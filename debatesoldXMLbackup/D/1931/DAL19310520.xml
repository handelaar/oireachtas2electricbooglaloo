      <P>asked the President to state the nature of the differences on major matters of policy which caused Dr. T.A. McLaughlin, Managing. Director of the Electricity Supply Board, to tender his resignation and obliged the Government to accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>The differences which led to the tendering and acceptance of the resignation in question involved the observance of the financial limitations imposed on the Board by the Oireachtas under the Electricity Supply Acts, and of an undertaking by the Board as to the manner in which those limitations would be applied.  In 1929 certain discussions took place between the Government and the Electricity Supply Board as to the items to be included in the capital sum of £2,500,000 provided for the Board under the Electricity Supply Act, 1927, and an agreement was reached as to the interpretation to be placed upon Section 12 (3) of that Act.  The Government became aware that adequate steps were not taken in time to secure the proper observance of this agreement.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce will shortly lay before the House certain proposals regarding the Shannon Scheme, and will take that opportunity of making a full statement on the subject.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance to state the names of the local newspapers which receive grants for publishing current news in Irish and the conditions attaching to the making of such grants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>To be eligible for grants of the kind referred to in the question, a newspaper must be published in the Gaeltacht or in an area adjoining it, and must circulate largely in the Gaeltacht.  It must print an average of not less than three columns per week of news matter or articles of topical interest in Irish.  This material must be printed in the same type as the rest of the paper, and must not be segregated, but distributed through the news columns as if the various items were printed in English.  It must not deal to any great extent with the Irish language itself or the language movement.  Grants at the rate of 30/- per column will be paid on a limited quantity of suitable matter in excess of a column and a half.</P>
      <P>I may add that the policy of making grants of this nature, which has for its object the gradual strengthening of the language position in the Gaeltacht, is still in an experimental stage.  So far grants have been given only to &ldquo;The Connacht Tribune&rdquo; and &ldquo;Connacht Sentinel,&rdquo; which for the purposes of the scheme are regarded as virtually one paper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tadhg O Murchadha</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs whether he is aware that the telephone rent of £7 10s. charged in Bantry and other West Cork towns is considerably in excess of the charge in towns like Midleton, Cove, and Kilmallock, and if he will take steps to reduce the charges in Bantry and other West Cork towns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Heffernan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the difference in the rentals.  The explanation is that the Exchanges at Midleton, Cobh, etc., were established many years ago when plant and construction costs were substantially lower than in recent years when the Bantry and other Exchanges in West Cork were provided.  £7 10s. is, in accordance with the existing scale, the rental for exchanges opened in recent years. The regulation in this respect is due <Col N="1459" /> to the fact that lower rentals would be uneconomic and would involve the Department in loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that as a result of the imposition of this rent certain users of the telephone have ceased to use it?  Is he aware that it hardly tallies with his general statement as to the policy of the Department in regard to the encouragement of the use of the telephone?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that any subscribers in Bantry have discontinued the use of the telephone because of the charge.  As I explained, £7 10s. is the minimum rate in accordance with our scale.  I have explained on many occasions, a reduction of the rate of charge would result in a loss, or in a smaller profit than is being made at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary take the opportunity of making some inquiries as to whether, in fact, certain subscribers have had the telephone disconnected because of the rate of charge?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a question involving subscribers all over the country.  No matter what the results of the inquiry in regard to the Bantry situation might be, we could not allow the position at Bantry to be altered without altering the general situation throughout the country.</P>

    <P>The total number of films presented to the Official Censor during the four months ended 30th April last was 893, of which 551 were drama and 342 <Col N="1461" /> interest.  Of the dramas, 79 were rejected, being 14.3 per cent., and 86 were cut, being 15.6 per cent. of the total.  No interest pictures were rejected, but 10, being 3.42 per cent., were cut.  There were 19 appeals against the Censor's decision.  His decision was confirmed in 13 cases; in five the film was passed with cuts, and in one case his decision was reversed.</P>

      <P>The Deputy appears to refer to bogs situated on holdings in the townland of Lisnagrave on the Estate of Lord Kenmare.  The holdings comprising this Estate were sold by the landlord direct to the tenants and in connection with the sale the control and management of the surplus turbary situated on certain of the holdings was committed by a Deed of Trust dated 20th March, 1915, to Trustees for the tenant purchasers. Under the terms of this deed each tenant cutting turf is to pay the Trustees on demand a sum not exceeding 3s. per annum in respect of <Col N="1466" /> the cost of administration of the turbary and the Trustees have power to repair bog roads and to drain the bogs out of surplus funds in their hands.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission understand that for a considerable time the majority of the persons entitled to cut turf on these bogs have repudiated the authority of the trustees and refused to pay them the sums mentioned in the Trust Deed, with the result that the trustees do not exercise control over the bogs and the turf has been cut in an indiscriminate manner and roads and drains have been neglected.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission have the matter under consideration at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This is a Bill to amend the Public Charitable Hospitals Act, 1930.  The first important amendment is embodied in Section 2.  Deputies are aware that only a certain class of hospital can participate in the proceeds of the sweepstakes which are held for the benefit of the hospitals. Section 2 proposes to enlarge that class by five specified hospitals.  These are hospitals that could not participate owing to the wording of Section 1 (2) of the Principal Act.  The first of these hospitals is Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, which, I am informed has, up to this, been used largely as a sanatorium. It is now being altered and is to be used as a hospital for adult tubercular patients suffering from bone disease. It is to do very much the same work as hospital No. 5, St. Mary's Open Air Hospital, Cappagh, does for children. I am informed that the work done in that hospital is admirable, and that an hospital of a similar nature for adults is badly needed.  Another institution which is to participate is Peamount Sanatorium, Hazelhatch.  There a new village settlement has been started which will enable consumptive <Col N="1469" /> patients to live there either in houses or in hostels and to do a considerable amount of work towards their own support.  At present I believe that some of the patients living in that village settlement, which is only in its infancy, are able to earn sums of money which not only pay for their own support but, at the same time, enable them either to put by money or to contribute to the support of their people at home.  That seems to me to be a most deserving work. Another hospital which it is suggested should participate is the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital.  That hospital does a great deal of charitable work, but a great part of the work is done through dispensaries.  It is very much the same class of hospital as, say, the Dental Hospital, which the House already agreed to make special provision for in the Principal Act.  Another hospital is St. Anne's Hospital, Northbrook Road.  This is not a very large hospital, but it deals with cancer patients and I am satisfied it does very good work among the sick poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next provision in the Bill contained in Section 3 directs the Minister to appoint a committee of three members, to be called the Committee of Reference, for the purpose of this scheme.  I should tell the House that as the Bill stands that Committee of Reference would have imposed upon them certain duties which are contained in Section 4; that is to say, they should examine and report on every scheme before such scheme receives sanction.  Representations, however, have been made to me by the existing Hospitals Committee that that is not practicable as a working proposition, that there must be continuity between one scheme and another, that a very large staff is employed, and that, in fact, before one scheme has been completely finished another scheme should be sanctioned, so that there would be no break.  This provision, though it makes more perfectly for the carrying out of the principal Act, is not essential to its working. The real difference is that the right of hospitals to share in the proceeds of the scheme would be reported on by the Committee before they participate, <Col N="1470" /> instead of the matter being, as it is now, submitted to me, and I, on statutory declarations, making up my mind.  That is more perfect, but would cause delay, and I think the present scheme works reasonably well. You can take it that the statutory declarations are substantially true, and, in consequence, I intend on the Committee Stage to suggest to the House that Section 4 should be deleted altogether from the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that deposits should be made in the name of the Committee of Reference.  The present Hospitals Committee are of the opinion that these deposits should be lodged in the names of the present trustees, who are very well-known public men.  It does not appear to me to be of the slightest importance really who the trustees are, provided they are persons who can be trusted, and representations have been made to me on that matter by the existing Hospitals Committee, who of course have carried out this scheme very successfully up to the present.  I should tell the House also that I propose on the Committee Stage to amend Section 5 by making it clear that the existing procedure shall be continued, and that the amount of the proceeds which goes to the prize money shall be lodged in the names of the existing trustees, all of whom are gentlemen of high standing and character.</P>
    <P>Section 6, however, brings in a very important new charge, and that is what the Committee of Reference is really for.  At present the representatives of the hospitals meet together and arrange in what proportion they should share in the proceeds of each sweepstake. I am not satisfied that that is a completely satisfactory method.  I think when you get a very large number of persons together, each one representing his own hospital and, naturally, putting forward the best case that can be put on behalf of his own hospital, that sometimes the best advocate, or the person with the clearest mind and the most clear-cut idea might succeed in getting more for his hospital than the hospital requires. I am also satisfied that some of the smaller hospitals which have benefited <Col N="1471" /> under this Act have benefited fully already, if they have not benefited too much.  I, therefore, think it well that there should be an outside determining body of a semi-judicial character that will examine into the needs of each hospital and fairly decide between the relative claims of the hospitals in consultation with the Hospitals Committee. At present that is left to the Hospitals Committee.  The provision in Section 6 is that the Committee of Reference should decide finally, subject of course to my approval, which is necessary in order to have Parliamentary control over the whole business.  But I am quite willing to amend Section 6 so that there should be consultation between them and the Hospitals Committee. I understand that the Hospitals Committee have to decide who will be the promoters, how they will be remunerated, upon what races the sweepstakes will be held, and everything of that kind.  It is a very important work and it takes a considerable amount of time, and, as I have said, they have been very successful up to this.  I do not wish in any way to oust them from their jurisdiction, but I think it would give greater satisfaction to everybody if there was a judicial body deciding in what share the various hospitals should participate.</P>
    <P>The next amendment is contained in Section 7.  It is an amendment which we have already discussed in this House and which makes it mandatory that one-fourth of the proceeds of every sweep shall go to the aid of county hospitals for their improvement. I shall read the exact words of the section, &ldquo;for the improvement of such hospitals or for the equipment thereof,&rdquo; the idea being that no part of the proceeds shall go to the maintenance of patients and directly in relief of the rates, but that it shall go to make these county hospitals really up-to-date hospitals, a condition which, in some cases, might never be attained, and in other cases is being attained, but attained very slowly.  I should say that the money will be apportioned between the various boards of health <Col N="1472" /> in proportion to the population of each county, and the duty of seeing that it is properly expended and for examining the scheme will devolve upon the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>There is only one other section to which I want to draw the attention of the House and that is Section 10.  It reads:</P>
    <P>This Act shall not apply or have effect in relation to any scheme which has been sanctioned under the Principal Act by the Minister before the passing of this Act or to any sweepstake held under the Principal Act, whether before or after the passing of this Act, in pursuance of a scheme so sanctioned.</P>
    <P>I said a few minutes ago that it is necessary that one scheme should be sanctioned before the time of the other scheme has completely expired.  For instance, before the work in connection with the Derby scheme has been finished a new scheme will have to be sanctioned, so that the staff will not be out of employment for possibly a fortnight or any length of time.  Deputies are aware of the fact that a very large staff is engaged, and it would disturb things very much if that staff were dismissed for any period and then taken back again.  I am anxious that there should be complete continuity. In order that there should be complete continuity, and since it would be almost a miracle to have this Bill law before the sanctioning of the next sweep.  I propose to ask the House, in Committee Stage, to make this Bill retrospective to every scheme sanctioned after the 1st of May.  It is perfectly obvious that the Manchester November Handicap Sweep, which I understand, is the next sweep, will be very large.  The Derby Sweep has been enormous, and there is much more time for sending out advertisements and doing work between now and November than between March and May.  I think it would be a pity if the county hospitals, and also those five hospitals I mentioned, should not participate in the proceeds of the Manchester November Handicap Sweep. Therefore I propose, with the sanction of the House, making this present Bill retrospective, so that it will cover any <Col N="1473" /> sweep which might be held in connection with the Manchester November Handicap.</P>
    <P>As the House knows, the names of the participating hospitals and the share in which they participate must be printed on the book of tickets, but in spite of that fact other hospitals are entitled to participate.  If this Bill is actually law before, say, the 1st of June, of course that would be unnecessary, but if it is not law before the 1st of June it would be necessary to enable the hospitals to participate and to enable a quarter share to go to the county hospitals.</P>
    <P>These are the main provisions of the Bill, and I suggest to the House that they are improvements on the existing Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>While we on this side of the House are not prepared at this stage to offer any opposition to this Bill, nevertheless I do not think it would be right to let it pass without voicing what I believe is the concern with which a considerable number of Deputies view the extension of the sweepstake principle as a means of raising money, particularly where in the case of this Bill it is proposed to use it for the purpose of providing moneys which should more properly come from public funds.  The Principal Act, I should like to remind the House, was originally introduced as a temporary measure.  I think the strongest argument put forward in favour of it was that it was merely a temporary expedient in order to prevent certain hospitals closing down.  It was accepted by members on this side of the House in that spirit as a temporary measure pending investigation into the general position of the public hospitals.  Any enlargement of its scope will naturally tend to make it permanent, and for that reason, as I say, we feel that before the Bill goes through the whole question ought to be carefully examined, because if we are going to introduce sweepstakes as a permanent means of raising what is in effect public revenue, I think there was scarcely sufficient consideration given to the Principal Act to warrant us in doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of us, who are familiar with <Col N="1474" /> life in Dublin, particularly life in working-class districts, have heard many stories of the hardship and of the privations to which Dublin people have subjected themselves and their families in order to provide the money to buy sweepstake tickets.  I am sure that what we have heard in regard to the workers of the city applies equally to every other class in the city.  All of us know the craze which possesses many people now to sell sweep tickets.  A book is procured, one or two tickets are sold, and immediately the person who sold these one or two tickets, urged on by the fact that he can buy the remaining tickets at a discount, becomes fanatical in his endeavour to dispose of the tickets.</P>
    <P>I am perfectly satisfied there is a considerable number of people in every section of the community spending more money than is justifiable on these tickets.  It might be argued that this would be no harm if the whole of the money were devoted to what appears to be the primary purpose of the Bill. The primary purpose of the whole machinery of the Bill is ostensibly to provide money for the hospitals, but in point of fact that is not so.  There are others who take a very large proportion of the proceeds.  First, there are the prize-winners, those lucky people who get large sums, and then there are the equally lucky promoters, and by far the larger proportion of the funds goes to these two sections.  A large part of the money raised from the public does not reach the hospitals at all.</P>
    <P>There are other factors which I think ought to be taken into consideration also.  I would like again to remind the House that the original Bill was introduced as a temporary measure. When it was going through, both from these and other benches, the question of the general position of the Dublin hospitals particularly was raised.  It seemed to some of us that the position was one which at the time warranted investigation and examination.  The measure was accepted as a temporary one because it was felt that Parliamentary exigencies, the exigencies of the Government and other claims on <Col N="1475" /> Government time, did not permit investigation to be made at that moment.  What happened since?  Most of us felt at that time that there was only one sweepstake to be organised, but now we find that every possible excuse is taken for organising sweepstakes. Many of the hospitals, some people hold, at any rate, would be better closed than undertaking capital expenditure which imposes on them further commitments and liabilities for maintenance, commitments which, if sweepstakes were to be discontinued, would certainly involve them in very grave financial difficulties.  All this haphazard expenditure has been undertaken merely because sweepstakes seem to have provided windfalls.  At the moment vested interests are being created which are going to make the problem much more difficult to deal with, when it comes to be dealt with, as in course of time it must be.</P>
    <P>I said that there are some who believe that there are too many hospitals in Dublin, and that it would be a good thing if a number of the smaller hospitals were amalgamated, and put under central control.  As against that, others believe that the smaller hospitals are doing good work by providing training places for students which could not be provided by the larger hospitals.  As between the two views I am not competent to judge. The problem is there, and it should be examined, but its examination and solution will be more difficult if we allow sweepstakes to be utilised, as they apparently are at present, without any real central control over them.</P>
    <P>There is one other thing which I think should be mentioned in connection with this Bill, and that is, that when the original Bill was before the House, I do not think that any section here contemplated that a virtual monopoly in the promotion of sweepstakes would be created.  This, however, is what has happened under the Act, and I think it is very objectionable that it should have happened. I do not know the merits or demerits of the case, but I remember that shortly after the first sweepstake was promoted, another syndicate entered <Col N="1476" /> the field, and submitted proposals to the Minister and the Government, which, I believe, were turned down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated that, in his opinion, there should be a monopoly as regards the promotion of sweepstakes.  I think that that was not in the mind of any section of this House when the Bill was going through.  Some of us, I suppose, knew who the individuals were, who would probably promote the first sweepstake, but we did not think that for the whole duration and operation of the Act the promotion of subsequent sweepstakes was going to be confined to that particular syndicate or corporation. I do not think that it is desirable that it should be.  It is a very valuable monopoly.  All of us have heard stories of the tens of thousands of pounds that have been cleared by the original promoters as their part of the profits.  If three or four sweepstakes be run throughout the year, as quickly as opportunity to organise them offers, surely, in the name of common justice, decency and equity, every citizen ought to be permitted if he likes, to submit a scheme to the Minister, and the Minister should not indicate beforehand that he is in favour of a monopoly, and that in actual fact, he has already conferred a monopoly on certain select individuals.</P>

      <P>No, what I stated was that I would not allow more than one Hospitals Committee, more than one sweepstake to be run. My idea was that all the hospitals in Ireland that were enabled under the Act to do so, should join in the same scheme.  I think it would be quite wrong to have three or four different schemes going at the same time.  It would lead to a great deal of confusion and, consequently, I said that all the hospitals should join together, but whom they choose as promoters has nothing to do with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that that has been cleared up, because undoubtedly in the public mind there was an idea that the attitude of the Minister for Justice had reference not merely to the fact that it was objectionable to run two or three sweepstakes on the one racing event, but that he did not favour the management or promotion of sweepstakes by anyone except one collection of individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I am glad that the Minister made that point clear, because undoubtedly the public did believe that the view of the Minister and of his colleagues in the Executive Council was that there was only one syndicate or organisation in the State that would be favoured with the promotion of these sweepstakes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is just one other point to which I would like to make reference, and that is, that while undoubtedly the hospitals referred to in Section 2 of the Bill are doing very good public work, I do not think that the principle which was at the basis of the original Bill should be completely lost sight of. That principle was that the only hospitals which would be permitted to participate were those which provided treatment and accommodation for the poor, either free or upon the payment of a sum not exceeding ten shillings a week.  As Section 2 of the Bill stands, it would seem that hospitals would be in a position to participate, irrespective of whether they provided any free accommodation whatever. <Col N="1478" /> That apparently does not matter.  They might not provide a single bed.  They might charge anything they like and still be entitled to participate in the sweepstake.  In view of special circumstances and in view of the particular treatment which they provide, it might be difficult to insist on the percentages or proportions which were included in the principal Act, but, never theless, I think that the desirability of insisting that some free treatment should be provided by these hospitals should not be lost sight of.</P>

      <P>The speech which has just been delivered by Deputy MacEntee, and the general attitude of his Party which his speech indicates towards the general principle contained in the Bill, might be understandable in a country where all the people were either saints or scholars.  If the attitude adopted by Deputy MacEntee is a sound one, I do not see why he should not carry it still further and say that dog-racing, horse-racing and other forms of gambling should be made illegal in this country.  I cannot forget, because I was one of the members of the original Committee with Deputy Sir James Craig, which went into the terms of the original Bill, which was a Private Member's Bill, that Deputy Seán T. O'Kelly, Deputy Moore, and some other Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party agreed with the Bill to the extent that they became members of the Committee appointed by the House which went into the details, details with regard to the allocation of the portion of the money which would be set aside for the promoters and for the hospitals.  I did not hear any member of the Fianna Fáil Party at that period taking any exception to the general principle of the Bill, which had for its object the securing of money to enable the hospitals of the country to be reconstructed and put in a proper condition. No citizen of the State is being forced to hand out money for tickets, and there is no obligation upon anybody; on the contrary, a person feels that he will get a good run for his money if he pays 10/- or less for his ticket.  Deputy MacEntee knows as well as every other Deputy and as well as most people of the country that a <Col N="1479" /> big percentage of the money which is being set aside for the reconstruction of our hospitals is coming from people outside the country.  Why should we protest against the principle of a Bill which will enable other citizens and people of the outside world to provide our hospitals with the money that will assist them to become the best hospitals in the world?</P>
      <P>There are Deputies who have a greater obligation to defend the promoters of the sweepstakes than I have, but I believe that posterity will pay a very great and well-deserved tribute to the people who initiated the hospitals sweepstakes.  They will pay it to them because they will in time be provided, by means of this Bill and as a result of the activities of these people, with the best hospitals in the world, which will enable the poorest of the poor to get the very best treatment that can be given to them whenever they find it necessary to go into a hospital for treatment.</P>
      <P>I do not pose as being an exemplary citizen of the State, and I am not going to oppose, on principle, the extension of the original Bill, which was brought in as a Private Member's Bill. I am glad to note that the Minister and the Government are now taking a different view from that which they took towards the original Bill introduced by Deputy Sir James Craig. Nine or ten of them held up their hands in holy horror against the idea contained in the temporary measure. Now they come before the House, clothed as Ministers and with the full authority of the Executive Council, and ask for the extension of the principle contained in the original Bill.  I am not going, for the reasons given by Deputy MacEntee, to oppose the principle contained in the Bill, because, as I said, I believe that posterity and the people of the country who will get the benefits that will accrue from the Bill, will pay a well-deserved tribute to those who introduced it.  Deputy MacEntee protested against the big portion of the money which is going to prize winners and promoters.</P>

      <P>I think one of the inducements offered to people outside the country for the purchase of tickets was the high prize money.  The prize money was much in excess of that offered by those who promoted the Calcutta Sweep and other sweeps which originally induced people from all parts of the world to speculate. Regarding the Deputy's complaint that a monopoly has been given to certain individuals in connection with the running of the sweep, speaking for myself I agree with the Minister that the sweepstakes should be run by one central authority, and if there is to be any change in the method of getting money for this very deserving purpose the only change that I would support would be to take the project out of the hands of private individuals and put it into the hands of the State.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister has seen his way to introduce this Bill to extend the scope of the existing measure.  The existing measure, in principle and in practice, has proved a huge success, and nothing succeeds like success.  Deputy MacEntee, I think, left most Deputies&mdash; certainly he left me&mdash;in very great doubt as to what his attitude was in regard to the present Bill.  I understood him to say that he was not going to oppose it.  But the whole speech seemed to be against the principle of the Bill and against the passing of the present proposals.  He seemed to me like one who felt that he had to get up and say something. He did not exactly want to oppose the passage of the Bill, but yet he did not want to give it his final and complete blessing.  He said that the original proposal was a temporary one.  Of course it was temporary, and this is a temporary one as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The existing Act comes to an end in the year 1934.  The passage of the present Bill will in no way extend the time period of that Act, so that the present proposal as well as the original one is a temporary measure.  If Deputy MacEntee is here in 1934, he and his colleagues, if they are here in <Col N="1481" /> sufficient numbers, as we are led to understand they will be, if they so choose will be able to oppose the continuance of the present proposal and the original Act itself.  Therefore, to suggest that the present proposal and the original one are in any sense permanent, is, to my mind, to talk from the point of view of one who does not know what he is talking about. The Deputy also said that to enlarge the scope of the Act&mdash;that is, to enable these further hospitals which have been enumerated by the Minister to participate in the sweepstakes&mdash;will tend to make the principle a permanent one.  I cannot follow that line of argument at all.  If there are ten hospitals participating, or one hundred hospitals participating, how is that going to render the measure more permanent or less temporary?  The same Deputy spoke about the hardships that the people of Dublin were undergoing in endeavouring to scrape up sufficient money to pay for these tickets.  I do not know whether they are undergoing these great hardships which he stated, or not, but there is one thing certain, and I think it will be admitted by all, that they are certainly undergoing more hardship in gathering in queues round the existing gambling dens in Dublin which have been allowed to be set up by this House, and which, in my view, are a disgrace to the country.</P>
    <P>It would be far better if a Deputy like Deputy MacEntee directed his comments and criticism to those existing temptations.  After all, though this may not provide the full sum required for the benefit of the hospitals, certainly it will provide a very large and substantial relief for a very just, proper and humane purpose.  The Minister has enumerated the various hospitals which he proposes to allow to participate in the coming sweep. I think the general attitude of most hospitals now is that a great many of them are sorry that they did not come in at the beginning.  They are anxious to come in now.  I think, therefore, even though they may not approve, and in some cases may have directly opposed the original Bill, it <Col N="1482" /> is right for us to be generous and to allow them to participate.  With regard to the county hospitals, the Minister said he is making provision whereby their participation in the forthcoming sweep will not mean a relief to the local rates.  Therefore, I think Deputy MacEntee's argument falls to the ground when he says that this is a proposal to do something which should be done either by taxation or the raising of rates.</P>
    <P>There is another fact and that is that the time is very short&mdash;July, 1934.  The greatest number of sweeps that can take place in that period will certainly not be more than ten because it takes a very large amount of time to organise these sweeps successfully. Therefore, there will not be such a big number of continuous sweepstakes going on during that period.  I was not one of those referred to by Deputy MacEntee when he said that the general public seemed to think that the Minister had given a monopoly to a certain body of people to be promoters of these sweeps.  I have not met anyone outside or inside this Dáil yet who was.  The Minister never did anything of the kind. Deputy Sir James Craig, who proposed this Bill and I who seconded it, knew perfectly well that the question of who the promoters should be was one which we meant should rest entirely in the hospitals themselves.  Perhaps it is well that Deputy MacEntee has cleared the air in that respect to-day by getting the explanation from the Minister which I was aware of.  Anyone acquainted with the Acts in force must be aware that though the Minister was not in favour of two, three, four or five sweeps running concurrently throughout the country, still it never rested with him nor had he the power of handing over to a single syndicate of men the whole right and monopoly in the Act to run these sweepstakes during the whole period these Acts will run.</P>
    <P>I think there is very little indeed to be said on a measure like this because I think it must meet with the general approval of the House.  Certainly there cannot be speeches made <Col N="1483" /> more against it than that made by Deputy MacEntee.  Yet he has informed us that he and his Party are not going to oppose it.  Therefore, I hope it will go through now.  As I have said previously, Deputy MacEntee and those associated with him if they are here, will have every opportunity of rendering this not a permanent but a temporary measure again or even destroying it altogether or opposing its renewal when it comes up, if it ever comes up, for renewal in the year 1934.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shaw</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a considerable change of opinion in this House and outside since two years ago, when I asked the Minister for Justice if he would introduce legislation to legalise sweeps.  I got a very short answer.  However, I am glad that the vast majority of the people have come to my way of thinking, and that sweeps have now been legalised and are perhaps the most outstanding success ever achieved in this country.  I welcome this amending Bill because of my personal knowledge of the vital necessity of fitting county hospitals with up-to-date modern equipment for the treatment of disease.  One-quarter is to be allotted to the county hospitals to bring them up-to-date.  The money is to be divided amongst boards of health according to the population of the particular county.  I understand money will be provided for capital expenditure for the provision of X-ray apparatus, which is one of the most desirable requirements at the moment for the treatment of disease.  In very few county hospitals is there proper X-ray apparatus.  In Longford they have to send patients to Westmeath to be treated.  I hope that every county hospital in the Free State will have first-class modern apparatus provided out of this money.  Operation theatres are primitive and can be very considerably improved.  Maternity wards are primitive in a great many cases.  I hope that a large part of this money will be devoted to the treatment of tuberculosis, provided that there will be a tuberculosis hospital built in every county in Ireland.  It is a disease which unfortunately, as we all know has caused <Col N="1484" /> great havoc, and the provision of this money will be of extraordinary value in relieving those people at present who cannot be provided with either accommodation or equipment.</P>
      <P>I might mention in connection with shortage of accommodation that the medical officer in Mullingar County Hospital told me yesterday that he had to refuse admission to six patients because he had no room, one of the principal reasons being that tuberculosis patients have to be put in other parts of the county hospital.  Those county hospitals and other hospitals in the county are doing just as good work as any of the city hospitals.  The most up-to-date treatment is given.  I certainly am very pleased that we are going to get a share of this money, because I know, as a member of a board of health in touch with various hospitals, of the great necessity for it. I would like to know from the Minister what is to be the position with regard to infirmaries and district hospitals. In the county I come from the infirmary is not under the Board of Health.  Therefore it would appear to me that the Board of Health institution would be eligible and the infirmary would not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to say anything about Deputy MacEntee's speech.  It was the usual Fianna Fáil method of crabbing everything which is a success in this country.  One would imagine from Deputy MacEntee's remarks that it was only since the sweepstakes were started here that people purchased tickets.  What the people were doing was: they were sending large sums of money out of the country for the purchase of sweep tickets on the Calcutta Sweep, London sweeps, and sweeps in other places.  They were helping British hospitals and Calcutta hospitals and neglecting their own.  As one of those who assisted in having the Act passed to have sweepstakes legalised, I want to pay the highest tribute I can to the promoters and to the committee who have brought the sweepstakes in the Free State to such a high standard that they are not only the talk of the Free State but of the world.  No matter what part of the world it is people are asking: &ldquo;Have you a ticket <Col N="1485" /> in the Free State sweep?&rdquo;  Everyone knows that the sweeps here are run under the fairest possible conditions and that everyone gets fair play.</P>

      <P>In order to set Deputy Shaw's mind at ease on some points I can assure him that as one member of the Fianna Fáil Party I am just as enthusiastic a supporter of this Bill as I was of the original Act.  Perhaps I disagree more than any other Deputy with some of the remarks made by Deputy MacEntee.  I cannot agree that any hardship whatever is inflicted on people who buy sweepstake tickets. As far as I know, anyone who purchases a sweep ticket, or portion of one, can afford to do so or might spend the money in worse ways.</P>
      <P>I understand that 91 per cent. of the money on the last sweepstake, and on the Manchester November Handicap came from countries outside Ireland. In order to induce people to purchase tickets for sweepstakes decent money prizes must be given.  Otherwise the people will not take tickets or help to make the sweeps a success.  The success of sweeps depends on the amount of prize money given in previous ones.  Deputy Redmond referred to the fact that this Bill and the original Act are only temporary measures.  This amending Bill does not affect the temporary nature of these measures.  This Bill was introduced owing to the demand to have country hospitals included in the benefits of the sweeps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1486" /> Section 7 states:</P>
    <P>(1) One-fourth of the available surplus in any sweepstake held under the Principal Act shall be paid to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health and shall be disposed of by him in accordance with the following provisions, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) such one-fourth shall be apportioned by the said Minister between the several counties and county boroughs in Saorstát Eireann in proportion to their respective populations according to the general census of population which is for the time being the last such census.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with that section, because if it is retained it will mean that the cities of Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Limerick and other places will secure far more than their due share of money which is supposed to go to country hospitals.  In these places many of the hospitals have already secured benefits, so that if the population basis is taken for the distribution of the money which should go to the country hospitals I fear that counties like Leitrim, Sligo and Roscommon, with small populations, will get a very small proportion.  I would like the money to be apportioned according to the needs of a county.  In Leitrim there is no county hospital and no proper surgical hospital or equipment.  If Leitrim only gets a share of the money according to the population basis this Bill will not do much for it.  The needs of a county should be taken into account as well as the equipment at present available. The more deserving the case the more money should be given.  Leitrim is a poor county, and such a county should get more help because it needs it owing to the population being relatively small.  That county will not get a fair share of the money if this section is retained in the Bill.  I welcome this amending Bill most enthusiastically, but I say that, as far as I am concerned, nobody on these benches had any right to speak for me or to say that we are opposed to the Bill in any shape or form.  Many other Deputies <Col N="1487" /> on these benches will agree with me there.  I am just as enthusiastic in my support of this Bill as I was of the principal measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJamesCraig" hpid="Sir James Craig Sir James Craig">
      <NameTxt>Sir James Craig</NameTxt>
      <P>I had several objections to this Bill as it was drafted, but, as the Minister has stated, he has agreed to make changes that practically meet all the objections I had to raise.  I was very sorry that the names of those who are already trustees should disappear, because, in my opinion, these names stood for a great deal before the public with regard to the honesty of the measure and the way in which it would be worked.  The Minister has also agreed, I understand, to withdraw Section 4, with regard to the direct interference of the experts with the work.  I had the fear that he was going to remove all control from the Hospitals Committee and to place entire control in the hands of three experts.  I was not at all sure that he would be able to find three experts to give him such advice as the Hospitals Committee would be able to give him.  As everybody knows, the Hospitals Committee were unanimous in producing the schemes, and they worked without fee or reward. Although some objections may have been raised to their decisions, I think the decisions they gave in the drafting of the schemes were extremely satisfactory. It is a pity the Minister had to go outside the sections of the principal Act, so as to bring in hospitals which could not qualify under it, hospitals that were unable to show that they were keeping 25 per cent. of their beds for free patients.  He has had to introduce five names here. What frightened me when I saw these five names was that it would not end there, that there would be a great many other people applying to get the names of hospitals on the lists, and that we would not know where it would end.  On the whole, I am satisfied that three or four of these have a perfect right.  There is only one whose circumstances, I think, should be inquired into, because I have heard a great deal of opposition to the inclusion of this hospital.  There is no use in saying anything about it now, because <Col N="1488" /> probably in the Committee Stage some objection will be made to its inclusion.</P>
      <P>I come to what to me is the most important thing, the reason for the Bill, namely, the inclusion of the county hospitals.  When the matter was first mentioned to me by Deputy Shaw and others I stated that I thought it would be an extremely good thing if about £5,000 could be devoted to each of the county hospitals, in order to provide them with proper equipment in the nature of X-ray and other materials, perhaps improving their operation theatres and so on. On the other hand, I want to lay this proposition quite clearly before the Minister.  If the Act goes on till 1934, as I presume it will, and if there are three sweeps during each of these years, that means there will be nine sweeps.  I am prepared to say here and now that if the sweeps go on, as I have every reason to think they will go on, the result of giving 25 per cent. to the county hospitals will mean that each county will receive a total sum of something like £40,000.  That is far too much, I think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, the Minister should endeavour to devise some scheme by which a limitation would be placed upon the amount to be given to the county councils for distribution among the county hospitals.  If anyone wants to know what I base my calculations upon I am prepared to give it at any moment.  I will take one example. We know that the amount received by the hospitals under the National Sweep was £436,000.  I know that the amount that will come to the hospitals under the Derby Sweep will not be less.  I, therefore, say that it is quite fair to take £450,000 as the possible amount that will be available for the hospitals.  Not less than one-quarter of that will be available for the country hospitals.  That will be about £110,000 or £120,000, and when you multiply that by nine you will see what figure you reach.  Then divide that by 26 and you will see that it will give you a figure amounting to about £40,000 for each county.  Unless the Minister brings in a measure either to stop the Sweeps as some people would like, or to shorten the period <Col N="1489" /> over which they will last he should in some way limit the amount that will go to the counties.  It is not that I grudge the county hospitals the money, but so long as the money received is not allowed to relieve the rates I do not see what they are going to do with £40,000 in each case, and I think some limitation should be placed upon the amount, either by reducing the actual percentage that is given or when a certain sum has been reached that it should stop at that.  I think that we should really take cognisance of the fact that the county hospitals will be getting more money than they will know what to do with.</P>
    <P>I want to say this publicly.  It has been stated in public that it is well known to everybody that this measure was not introduced for the sake of benefiting the hospitals, but that it was really introduced for the sake of encouraging gambling.  There is no truth in that statement.  As far as I had anything to do with the introduction of the measure.  I was driven to it because of the needs of the hospitals. I say quite definitely that as far as encouraging the gambling spirit is concerned there was nothing further from my mind than that.  It has been stated here that little of the money has gone to the hospitals.  When the Derby sweep is over there will have been £1,000,000 distributed among the Free State hospitals from the three sweeps.  If that is not helping the hospitals I do not know what is.</P>
    <P>At all events, it is a fact that I am perfectly sure of that the hospitals are going to benefit to the extent of about £1,000,000.  I do not for a moment say that Deputy O'Kelly and myself had any idea when we were working on the Committee Stage of the original Bill that this was going to reach the enormous extent which it did. I do not know that I am not rather appalled at the extent of the success to which this has attained.  It is a huge success, and I am assured by those who have something to do with it that the success will go on, that there will be an increasing amount for these sweeps, so that we do not know what the limit of it eventually will be. That being so, perhaps the Minister <Col N="1490" /> would curtail the time during which the sweeps would be run.</P>
    <P>Someone said also that the hospitals get very little out of the 10/- ticket. They get 2/6 out of every 10/-.  Everybody knows that the Bill says that 20 per cent. is the minimum, but the actual amount has gone up to 25 per cent. or one-quarter of the total amount.  The Minister has put down here not less than 20 per cent.  I told him that I would like to see that amount 25 or 30 per cent.</P>

      <P>I am explaining that although the Act only allows 20 per cent. to be spent on the hospitals the actual amount that is spent is 25 per cent.  I would like that the Minister would make it 25 per cent. instead of the 20 per cent. in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee took exception to the fact that only one company, as it were, of promoters was allowed to run these sweeps.  As Deputy O'Kelly, Deputy Moore and Deputy O'Dowd will remember, it was suggested that it was a great mistake to allow company promoters to get hold of this scheme, that it should be run by a committee of doctors.  I knew sufficient about doctors to realise that any scheme that they would undertake financially was not going to be worth running.  It is only businessmen who can do this. I am whole-heartedly in support of the Second Reading of the Bill.  I would like to see some changes, but I do not think that any changes that I have in mind are enough to make me oppose the Second Reading.  I think it is possible to get some changes in the Committee Stage that will meet my views, perhaps on two at least of the points that I have raised.</P>

He stated that 25 per cent. of the money, amounting to £1,000,000, was going to the hospitals. Fifty per cent. has gone to the prizewinners.

      <P>Deputy Redmond mentioned that the original Act will expire in 1934.  He went on to express the opinion that this system of raising money will expire with the original Act.  We always recognise in Deputy Redmond, an optimist, but I am afraid his optimism on this occasion is not well-founded because, in view of the enormous success that Deputy Sir James Craig has attributed to this particular method of raising money, and for which he has a very large responsibility, I am afraid it will require a person with extraordinary courage to stand up here in 1934 and say that this system of raising money has now achieved its object, and must end.  I am afraid that the end will be alleged to have justified the means, and I still am one of those who are exceedingly sceptical from the national point of view as to the wisdom of raising money in this way.  However, that principle is not embodied for the first time in this Bill, and is therefore somewhat out of order in the present discussion.  But one or two subjects have been raised in this debate that I think ought to have some consideration.  Those who have some knowledge of the hospital problem as it exists in Dublin, know that for many years there has been a crying demand on the part of many hospitals, and on the part of a large section of the public who have been subscribing and who have been the means of <Col N="1492" /> maintaining those hospitals for a great many years in our city, that some scheme of centralisation should be brought about.</P>
      <P>One of the objections that one sees to this method of raising money and of supplying the needs of these hospitals is that the present system, which is a system of a number of small hospitals more or less efficient distributed over the city, will be maintained. Might I suggest that even at this stage the original proposal of centralisation might be considered.  A great deal might be done for the carrying out of that proposal, if, even at this stage, an agreement could be arrived at to provide the moneys from some future sweepstake for that particular object.  It does seem to me that that is a proposal that ought to receive more careful consideration than it has received.  If we can see that in that way some lasting and real benefit would accrue to the hospitals by reason of the money obtained in this particular way many of us might be disposed to look on it somewhat differently from the way in which we look at it at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are one or two other matters to which one would like to refer.  The first is that it is a matter of comment everywhere one goes that such a small sum as twenty to twenty-five per cent. of the proceeds of the sweeps goes to the hospitals.  The principles on which these moneys have been subscribed and the principles on which support is being given to this Bill is that the money goes to the hospitals.  After all, if we give our support to a measure of that kind it ought to be possible to give a larger sum from the total than twenty or twenty-five per cent.  It has always appeared to me that the names of the hospitals have been used widely in advertising the sweepstakes, and they only get a quarter of the proceeds.  Another matter into which I would like to see some inquiry made, and it is a matter that has been commented on, is the amount of money that the promoters get from these sweeps.  I would like to know from the Minister whether any inquiry has been made by his Department into the money received by these promoters. <Col N="1493" /> Can the Minister give the House an assurance that the promoters of these different sweeps are not receiving an undue amount of money?  That is a matter on which we would all like to have an assurance, and I think it is a matter into which there ought to be some inquiry.  It is a matter on which I hope the Minister will have something to say.</P>

      <P>I have no objection to Deputy Good and Deputy MacEntee going arm in arm to the highest altitude and moralising on the rest of us, poor sinners in the gutter.  I realise that, notwithstanding all the things that have been said, Deputy Good is quite naughty enough to wink at sweepstakes if his particular ideas in regard to amalgamation were carried out.  So, having swallowed the gnat he might swallow the camel.  Some complaint has been made in regard to the monopoly enjoyed by the Hospitals Trust, Ltd.  I do not know that I should say &ldquo;enjoyed,&rdquo; because it is a very heavy responsibility on several of those people, who gain nothing whatever but give their time and energy to the work they undertook to do at the start for the various hospitals when they were doubtful of success.  At that time everybody was doubtful of success, but when the sweepstakes succeeded people naturally became avaricious and they wanted to share in both the lustre and in any share in the way of gains that might accrue to the Hospitals Trust, Ltd.</P>
      <P>We have heard a lot about the hardships of poor people in this city scraping ten shillings for a sweepstake ticket.  Every day of their lives these people manage to scrape sixpence or threepence to put on a horse or on two horses both ways.</P>

      <P>Nevertheless they will do it.  I think it is as well for them to co-operate and find the ten shillings for the sweepstake.  In that event they will have the consolation anyhow that if the hospitals benefit they will have their services some day if they need them.  We might also remember that, <Col N="1494" /> taking Ireland in its entirety, it does not contribute ten per cent. of the sweepstake money, so that we have the best of the bargain.  Those of us who act as agents, subterraneously I admit, know that nearly all the money comes from Great Britain and the Dominions.</P>
      <P>There is one thing I would like to see in this Hospitals Bill, but which I am sorry to say is not in it.  I do not know if the Minister would give it further consideration.  I refer to the pensions for nurses.  There is a lot of money to be distributed, and the wounded soldiers of the hospitals are getting nothing.  These nurses are not working under local authorities, and no provision is made for them either in their old age or when they incur disabilities from attending the sick.  Somebody should do something for these nurses. They are the most deserving people in the community.</P>
      <P>Now when we have so much money going around, I would ask the Minister, if at all possible, to see that some portion of the proceeds of these sweepstakes is devoted to pensions for nurses.  If not, I hope the nation will do something to provide them with pensions.  I am, of course, referring entirely to nurses who are not under local authorities and who have no pension rights, but who are giving their services to the sick poor.</P>
      <P>The disqualification of certain hospitals, because they have not 25 per cent. of free beds, has been referred to. Many of these hospitals, although they have not actually free beds, have to bear two-thirds of the cost of the patients, and possibly get only one-third from local authorities or from some other source.  They are doing most important work in the way of medical treatment, and doing it with very considerable success.  I refer to the treatment of tuberculosis and of the scourge of cancer.  They make the end of these cancer patients tolerable and remove a scourge of great trouble from the homes from which they come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amalgamation of hospitals, to which Deputy Good has referred, has been the subject of very serious consideration in Dublin.  It is bristling with difficulties.  It has, of course, for <Col N="1495" /> its object the building of one big hospital for all Dublin.  That means, of course, that you would not have, as you now have, several small hospitals, as compared with hospitals in other countries, convenient to the people who make use of them.  Especially in urgent surgical cases, it is a great thing to have a hospital within easy reach of those requiring it.</P>
    <P>I really think that the hospitals under the local authorities are coming very well out of this scheme when they get 25 per cent. of the amount available.  I hope that money will be confined to providing proper equipment for the hospitals in the way of X-rays and equipment of that kind, and that it will not be used for reconstruction purposes.  It will in that way relieve the rates, because many of the councils throughout the country have done very well by their hospitals and have provided first-class accommodation and up-to-date operating theatres, etc.  There are others who absolutely refuse to provide proper hospital equipment.  I hope the Minister for Local Government, to whom the allocation of this money will be assigned, will see that the hospitals which have been kept up-to-date will not suffer because they have kept abreast of the times.</P>

      <P>(Clare): I hope before the debate closes we shall hear something on this matter from Deputies from country districts.  We have had an exhibition of what I might call the metropolitan mind.  I hope the Miniister will not take any very serious notice of what Deputy Sir J. Craig said, that too much money was likely to go to the county hospitals.  One would want to be in intimate touch with the conditions in these county hospitals before one could back up such a statement as that.  In some counties there is not alone a county hospital, but three or four district hospitals which are surgical hospitals. Recently, because of the distress of certain people, the Government introduced a system of de-rating.  We were all agreed that the causes that led up to the introduction of that system <Col N="1496" /> did not grow up in a night and that because of them there was some deterioration and disorganisation in the county hospitals.  I know something about these county hospitals and their condition.  I know that a great effort has been made by those responsible to keep them in a state of repair and to equip them in the way they should be equipped, but they were not in a position to do it.  I would say that the amount of money which is to go to these hospitals should not be reduced, and that is the reason why I should like to hear something in greater detail from Deputies who come from country districts.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to make it clear whether district hospitals are included in the term &ldquo;county hospitals.&rdquo; There are district hospitals which are surgical hospitals, and if they are not included a whole hornets' nest of trouble will be raised.  The Minister was good enough to receive a deputation from our Party recently and to discuss the matter with us, and I hope he will let us know whether this includes district hospitals or not.</P>
      <P>Now that we are considering all types of county hospitals, that treat the people in the country districts and in the provincial towns, I might say that representations have been made to me and, I think, to other Deputies, that mental hospitals might very well be included in this from the point of view of equipment, accommodation and improvements.  Unfortunately, lunacy is increasing to some extent, and in some cases those charged with the maintenance of these institutions were not capable of keeping them as they should be kept.  The equipment certainly is not up-to-date.  The new idea of detached villas and such things for the treatment of this disease can certainly not be tried effectively in these institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know whether the Minister would consider any representations of that nature, or whether representations have been made to him by responsible authorities in the matter.  I am not going to enter into the moral question as to whether or not it is right to have these sweepstakes. The position is that sweepstakes <Col N="1497" /> have been carried out for certain hospitals and the country hospitals are certainly entitled to their share of the proceeds.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should let us know whether the county hospitals include district hospitals and whether mental hospitals have any chance of being included as well.</P>

      <P>People seem to forget that but for the support of the Fianna Fáil Party the original Act would not have gone through at all.  They also seem to forget that in giving our consent to that Act we did it with reserve just the same as we do to-day, believing as we do that in the long run the views of Deputy MacEntee will be found to be very far sighted. There are a good many cases in Dublin of which, perhaps Deputy O'Dowd is not aware.  He is not aware of the conditions in Dublin perhaps, and while one would sympathise with his interest in hospitals and especially in the county hospitals, at the same time those familiar with the conditions in Dublin know that there are many abuses such for instance as cases of people selling their furniture in order to buy sweep tickets.  All authorities upon the moral aspect of the question agree that a sweepstake is not an evil in itself.  But what everyone is afraid of is abuse leading to an increase in the appetite for gambling.  We want to try and guard against that, and if the Minister could provide any means for preventing that&mdash;and I think it will be almost impossible&mdash;he would take away a good part of the criticism against these sweepstakes schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Redmond seems to have completely changed his attitude towards the Government, because he came into this House upon support which he gained largely owing to his almost violent opposition to the Government. Now his criticism seems to be levelled altogether against the Opposition Party, while he supports enthusiastically all measures of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  He criticised the remarks of Deputy MacEntee, and said he could not see what reason <Col N="1498" /> there was to imagine that the extension of the scheme might lead to the permanent institution of the sweepstake system.  The simple answer to that is to say that a scheme which assists ten hospitals might easily be concluded and brought to an end without very much resistance, but that the resistance to concluding a scheme which assists 100 hospitals would be very much greater.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>They also get money out of the sweepstake scheme.  It is necessary to emphasise these points, because I think the Minister at this stage should, upon some basis of figures such as were outlined by Deputy Sir James Craig, attempt to gauge how much money is going to be got out of this whole scheme up to the end of 1934.  And he should make it clear to the hospitals that the amount of money they are going to get during that period is the total sum they are going to get from this source.  I do not think that the Minister, except in the case of the Poor Law hospitals, has any power to direct or to check the schemes of outlay in the various hospitals, but certainly it would be an abuse, and very likely an abuse which would be indulged in, if the hospitals went in for a scheme of outlay which must inevitably at the end of 1934 involve further expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be some way to check the manner in which that money should be spent, so as to ensure that <Col N="1499" /> while the hospitals get the best possible advantage from the money coming to them, at the end they should be in a sound economic condition. A good many remarks made in the debate on this side of the House and upon the other, had reference to the promoters' costs.  If the promoters' costs amount to something like £200,000 it is a very large sum, and is more than any individual enterprise is entitled to regard as normal profit.  Some effort should be made to curtail it, now, when the scheme is well-known to be a success.  In the beginning the promoters' costs might be higher because of the element of risk involved, but now that the scheme is working in a smooth condition, and successfully, as it is, I am perfectly certain that reasonable promoters would be satisfied with a much smaller profit on the whole transaction, and the hospitals might very well get the difference between the larger and the smaller profit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Redmond said we would be much better employed in criticising the betting shops and the abuses arising from the betting shops.  If the Deputy had been paying any attention to the work in this House he would know that we devoted a very great deal of attention to the Betting Bill, and that we pointed out many of the evils which he found it so easy to refer to in a general manner.  He certainly did not assist us in trying to curtail these abuses.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin really misrepresented Deputy MacEntee because he said Deputy MacEntee's attitude was that Ireland should consist only of saints and scholars.  That of course, is absurd.  We have not, at any stage, taken up the attitude of trying to make life impossible for the normal man, or that we think betting or sweepstakes are in themselves an evil.  When people take up that attitude you immediately have hypocrisy springing into existence.  I could mention cases of people who denounced the hospitals sweeps, and afterwards took advantage of them. What we do want to do is to guard against abuses, and to check the appetite which very often becomes an unhealthy <Col N="1500" /> appetite when it goes to excess.</P>
    <P>Considerable praise was given to the organisation.  Again, we feel it is necessary to check too much enthusiasm about that.  We know there are cases where several people complained of not getting their receipts. That may be due to the rush or to some difficulty in the organisation, but the organisation is by no means perfect. It does not do to allow ourselves to be carried off our feet by enthusiasm about this scheme at this stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hennessy seemed to think that all the money was coming from Great Britain.  That, of course, is quite inaccurate.  One has only to look at the prize list to see that the money comes from all over the world&mdash;Australia, America, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa&mdash;practically everywhere. That is one of the several misstatements made by certain Deputies.  Deputy Shaw seems to think the English hospitals were getting money out of sweepstakes, which is also entirely inaccurate.</P>
    <P>We are not opposing this Bill.  Like Deputy Sir James Craig, we regret that the original condition with reference to the number of free beds provided by the hospitals is not contained in this Bill.  Perhaps that might be remedied in Committee.  Our attitude towards the Bill is that so long as the hospitals are in such dire need, and so long as the country is in its present position of being unable to devote public funds to them the sweepstake scheme is the best alternative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlexHaslett" hpid="Mr. Haslett Mr. Haslett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to bespeak the sympathy of the House for the Minister for Justice in regard to the measure which is now before it.  In its original form and during its incubation period the Minister showed very little enthusiasm for it.  Now that the baby has been thrust upon him with all the responsibilities of its care and control, he surely must have the sympathy of the House.  At the risk of being put on the list by Deputy Dr. Hennessy, and other Deputies with Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Good I would like to make a few remarks in <Col N="1501" /> general terms on this Bill.  I think that we all realise that the situation at this point is exceedingly difficult. The principle of the Bill has been conceded by this House and the scheme has been in operation for some time. Now an amending Bill has come up, and while I suppose it is not technically in order altogether to go against the principle, I think that Deputy MacEntee was perfectly in order in expressing the feeling and the experiences of those who have been looking at the working of the scheme.  I do not always agree with what Deputy MacEntee says, but I heartily agree with him in what he said to-day about this Bill.  The scandal and demoralising effect created by the working of the Act have made us a byword amongst the other peoples of the world.  Surely Deputy MacEntee was perfectly in order in drawing the attention of the House to that fact, so that it might direct us as to what we should do in the future.</P>
      <P>Exception was taken, as I think rightly, to the comparatively small proportion of the sweepstakes money that finds its way to the hospitals.  A number of Deputies tried to reply to that point, but nobody, apparently, has justified it yet.  Deputy Dr. Hennessy, in his mild sarcasm, talked about having no objection to Deputies going to higher moral altitudes, but I do not think that he gave any moral reason whatever to show why the principle in the Bill should be extended.  Deputy Redmond said that the success of the whole scheme was a perfect answer to what Deputy MacEntee had said about it.  There are different ways of calculating success, and I do not think that this House will accept the theory that money will always be the deciding factor in the success of moral issues. Never before in the history of this country was there such a huge gamble as that provided by the sweepstakes nor was there more money ever dreamed of than that involved in this scheme. That, however, is no argument as to its moral effect: Deputy Redmond said that it would be better if we went to the gambling dens in the city and attacked them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How can this House attack, or even <Col N="1502" /> criticise, such places when we are involved in the thing ourselves?  Would it not really be a case of Satan reproving sin?  If we in this House believe in Christian deas, surely we can rise higher on such issues as this?  In regard to the amount of money that has been collected for the hospitals none of us, I suppose, will say that the hospitals cannot use it, but as to the methods of raising it, we have a perfect right to be critical.  If we learn anything from other nations, we find that the foremost nations have turned down this system.  We, however, are continuing it, and we say that because we attract money from all parts of the world and because the scheme has been such a financial success, it is morally right.  A Higher Authority has said: &ldquo;What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul?&rdquo;  If we lose our souls and thrust ourselves into this gambling mania it will be a bad day for this country.  I was one of those who during the debate on the original Bill asked the Minister to withdraw it.  It has now been in operation for some time, and this is an amending Bill to it.  As Deputy MacEntee pointed out, we cannot very well vote against a principle which has been conceded by this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend speaking on this Bill, and certainly did not intend to go into the question of its morality.  When the original Bill was before the House that aspect of the situation was threshed out and, so far as I am concerned, I am an unrepentant sinner in that respect.  I did not follow the last Deputy and others who spoke as to the moral effect of sweepstakes in relation to charity.  This is not the time to debate that.  That was debated on the original Bill, and possibly an opportunity will arise in the future to debate it further.  At the moment we are considering a Bill to amend the original measure.  I am speaking as one who has some knowledge of the working of sweepstakes, because I was a member of the original committee appointed by the Dáil and also of the existing Hospitals Committee who are conducting the sweepstakes.  Deputy MacEntee, I <Col N="1503" /> think, wanted some information as to the disbursal of the amounts received. I think he said that the proportion allotted to the promoters was altogether extravagant.  It will be within the recollection of the House that the original Bill provided 30 per cent. of the entire proceeds for running expenses.  That amount was arrived at by the original Committee who sat and discussed the original Bill.  That Committee consisted of Deputies from all Parties, and the figure was arrived at from the closest information they could get from all parts of the country as to the cost of running sweepstakes.  Experience has shown it to be a very extravagant figure as far as this sweepstake is concerned, but it also proved that these sweepstakes are being run in a more economical way probably than any other sweepstakes previously promoted anywhere.</P>
      <P>The total expenses incidental to the last sweep, including the promoters' expenses, ran to a figure, not of 30 per cent. or anywhere near it, but, speaking roughly, between 7 and 8 per cent.  The portion allotted the hospitals was 25 per cent.  The Act provided that a sum of not less than 20 per cent. should go to the hospitals and the Committee decided that they would allot 25 per cent.  Speaking as one member of the Committee, I think we might have perhaps got a little more, but sweep committees, like other bodies, are bound by majority rule, and the Committee decided that 25 per cent. was a reasonable amount.  A sweepstake, mind you, whatever the morality of the people concerned, is possibly the fairest form of gamble you can have.  In the ordinary private sweepstake you have the fairest form of a gamble, because the entire fund received from subscribers is paid to the winners.  In this case, there was a provision that a certain proportion should be given to charity, but the people who put up the funds, the subscribers, were entitled themselves to get the major share of the proceeds. In this instance, some 65 per cent. of the entire amount passed back to the original subscribers of the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1504" /> Something has been said in regard to the hardships inflicted on various members of the community who were subscribers to the sweepstake.  I personally am not aware of any of these hardships.  I pass through this city and various other cities, and I represent a city myself, and in travelling through the cities or any part of the country I have not seen any of these terrible hardships which other Deputies have described.  There is no compulsion on anybody to purchase a ticket.  I have not seen any sellers of tickets go out of their way to compel anybody to buy a ticket.  There have been cases in which very poor people have bought tickets, but in many cases they have clubbed together to buy portions of a ticket.  I have known cases where such people have bought the twentieth portion of a ticket.  Is it any crime if a very poor person who heretofore did not subscribe to charitable hospitals says: &ldquo;Here I have an opportunity to provide money for an object from which I may benefit myself on a future occasion, and incidentally I can have a little gamble&rdquo;?  There is no harm done in the one case, and there is a lot of good done in the other.  In the purchase of a ticket one is able to satisfy two desires.  One desire, the foremost desire in the minds of most people, is to help the hospitals.  The other desire is to do what 99 per cent. of the people&mdash;and I am not making any apology to moralists in this&mdash;whether by way of sweepstakes, horse-racing, or dog-racing, indulge in.  Is it a crime if the poor man wishes to subscribe 3d. out of a shilling to a hospital and have his little gamble if he wishes?  I did not intend to deal with this phase of the matter, but I lapsed into it.</P>
    <P>I come now to the proportion that is proposed to be allotted by the amending Bill to the county hospitals. Some Deputies have raised the point that 25 per cent. of the entire proceeds was too much to give to county hospitals. There are several county hospitals in the country in a bad way owing to the lack of proper equipment, proper buildings, etc.&mdash;things that the ordinary county council or board of health is unable to provide under the <Col N="1505" /> existing condition of affairs.  Is there any Deputy who represents the city or anywhere else who will grudge the portion that is going to be allotted to these hospitals?</P>
    <P>So far as the two or three hospitals in the South, which I know personally, are concerned, they are very much in need of some of the appliances which were mentioned in the debate&mdash;X-ray apparatus, proper operation rooms, extension of buildings, proper accommodation for nurses and, if you like, for the doctors.  These were facilities that could not in the existing condition of affairs be provided out of the rates, and if a large sum is to be provided for hospitals it is only natural that country Deputies should make the case that they should get a share of that money.  I think that case has been established and the Minister has realised the necessity for giving these hospitals a share.  For myself, I do not believe that 25 per cent. of the total sum which is available for hospitals is an excessive amount to allot to county hospitals.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has decided to abandon Section 4 of the Bill.  With the remainder of the Bill I am more or less in agreement.  A fear has been expressed that the appointment of the three experts would interfere with the running of the sweepstakes.  I am glad to see that the Minister has arranged that the three experts will offer as little interference as possible with the existing condition of affairs. The sweepstake has been organised in aid of the hospitals.  As far as I know, there have been very few, if any, public grumbles at the administration of the sweepstakes.  That, to my mind, is the greatest tribute that could have been paid to the men who have been running these sweeps.  Reference has been made to one promoter having a monopoly practically of the business.  In the beginning of the debate the Minister was attacked and it was suggested that he was responsible for this promoter.  The Minister, as he said himself, has nothing whatever to do with that matter.  It is the Hospitals Committee which is primarily responsible for the running of the sweep.  They, having <Col N="1506" /> considered the matter as carefully as they could, decided that a certain promoter was the best promoter that could be found and I agree.  I agree that the present promoter is the best promoter that could be found in the circumstances, and until a better is available, one who the Committee consider would run the sweep on a better basis, I think there is a prospect of the continuance of the present promoter. However, nobody is tied to him.  It is conceivable that a future Committee will engage a different promoter.  I am glad to be able to exonerate the Minister from the charge that he had hand, act or part in the appointment of the promoter.  I say again that the fact that the cost of running the sweep is only 7 or 8 per cent., notwithstanding that there was a provision in the Act allowing as much as 30 per cent., is a tribute both to the Committee and to the promoter.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of this measure I would like to point out.  I believe that possibly a larger sum than 25 per cent might be allotted to hospitals. The Committee have gone to considerable trouble to run this sweepstake on the most economical lines.  If it had not been for the care of the Committee expenses on this sweepstake might have been 20 or 25 per cent.  No one would have lost anything except the prizewinners.  What has happened is the savings of the Committee have been passed on to the prizewinners. In my opinion, the savings of the Committee ought to be passed to the hospitals.  Up to the present what has happened is, owing to the great care of the Committee, the savings have been added to the prize money, and not distributed to the hospitals. It was felt by the Committee that that was the proper distribution, but I think, in the amending Bill there might be something to the effect that any savings out of the expenses should be passed to the hospitals.  I do not think there are any other points in the new amending Bill that need discussion. It is a simple Bill.  In the main.  I am in agreement with it, and I am quite sure the House will pass it.  I am sorry that the moral aspect of the case has been raised in connection <Col N="1507" /> with this Bill.  It was not the proper time for discussion of that. There will be opportunities again of discussing that matter, and this is not the time to discuss the moral aspect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion has lasted a considerable time, and probably will prove valuable to the Minister.  I was not an enthusiast in support of the original Bill to which this, we are considering, is an amendment. I was not enthusiastically in favour of it, not exactly for the reason Deputy Haslett has given just now, but for reasons for which he and others in this House opposed the original Bill, and probably will oppose this measure.  I do not want to go, at length, into the moral question raised by sweepstakes.  I personally do not see anything morally wrong in betting. I do see something morally wrong in betting, as in any other thing, carried to excess.  Excess, to my mind, is what brings in the moral question. However, I am sure that nothing I will say, will be likely to alter Deputy Haslett's view, or the views of others who hold similar convictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One reason that I was not enthusiastically in favour of this principle of sweepstakes originally, as suggested in the original Bill, was because I was not in favour of stabilising the present conditions of Dublin hospitals.  I was of opinion that we had too many hospitals in Dublin and that if something could have been done to centralise hospital administration in the city it would have been an advantage to medicine, an advantage to science perhaps in general, and an advantage in particular to the poor.  However, that idea was not adopted, and we passed the Sweepstakes Bill.  The sweepstakes have been a phenomenal success, judged from their financial result.  Twelve of the hospitals, I think, have already reaped very considerable advantages, and it is natural that other hospitals, seeing the amount of money these twelve have already received, should seek to come in.  Nobody is surprised that county hospitals and similar institutions have demanded a share in the sweepstake results.  I <Col N="1508" /> am only surprised that institutions, other than hospitals, have not knocked at the Minister's door.</P>

      <P>For my own part I hope it will be kept to hospitals.  I wonder would the Minister tell us why the hospitals included specifically by name in this Bill have been selected, because there are many similar institutions that, I am sure, once this list is published, would claim admittance also.  I want to say nothing against the hospitals here.  I know one, at any rate, the last one on the list, St. Mary's Open Air Hospital, Cappagh. That has done excellent work.  I really would like to know from the Minister what particular principle of selection he has adopted, because, as I say, their inclusion and the exclusion of similar institutions is bound to give rise to considerable jealousy.  If it does not give the Minister it will give a Deputy a considerable amount of trouble, because hospitals will want to know why they were not included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 lays it down that &ldquo;notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (2) of Section 1 of the principal Act that Act shall extend and apply to the following hospitals.&rdquo; That is the section that lays it down that 25 per cent. of the beds, reckoned over a period of a year, should be given to the poor.  I do not see why these hospitals should be excluded from that position, if they have been excluded.  I do not know why they have been definitely excluded from that condition.  Perhaps the Minister has satisfied himself that they are, in fact, doing what the Bill originally asserts should be done.  That may be so, but it looks strange that sub-section (2) of Section 1 is not to apply to that.  If they are not giving that same amount of assistance to the very poor personally I believe that they do not deserve that special treatment that the Minister is giving to them here. <Col N="1509" /> Perhaps I am speaking in the dark. Perhaps the Minister would be able to inform us that they are, in fact, complying with the conditions.  If they are not, I think they should comply with the conditions before they would be admitted.</P>
    <P>With regard to the hospitals that have been enjoying the proceeds of these sweepstakes, I would like to know from the Minister what steps his Department has taken to see that these particular hospitals have complied with the conditions.  The Minister proposes, in this Bill, to set up a Committee of Reference.  It is a very good idea, I think, to examine closely into the affairs of every hospital seeking admission to the sweepstakes scheme.  I do not know if it is wise of the Minister to drop that Committee of Reference idea, if I am correct that that is his intention, because, from my own knowledge, I am satisfied it would be wise, to examine closely into the condition of the hospitals, particularly their financial conditions in relation to all future sweepstakes.  I say that, having a considerable amount of knowledge of certain hospitals in Dublin that have reaped large sums out of this hospitals sweepstakes scheme.  I have a list here of the hospitals that have already got a considerable amount of money in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, etc., out of the sweepstake.  The first hospital on this list received, out of the first sweepstake in November, 1930, roughly £30,000.  Out of the second sweepstake it received over £37,000, and probably will receive out of the sweepstake now running another £20,000.  That will be in or about £92,000 to £95,000.</P>

      <P>Number 4, and so on down the list.  I know hospitals in Dublin that received huge amounts. and they are now in the position that they are looking out for schemes for spending the money.  I know that to be a fact.  They had debts and overdrafts that might have amounted to anything from £5,000 to £10,000.  Now they have £70,000 or £80,000, and they are looking around for schemes in order to spend the money.  It is for that reason that I say to the Minister that he would be wise in keeping to the idea of a committee of some kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I think that would be wise.  I heard of a case where I believe misrepresentation of the financial position of an hospital was made use of, and a higher percentage was granted than would have been granted if the full facts were known to the Committee, to the Minister, or whomsoever was responsible.  I am speaking of something I am aware of. Afterwards, I heard the individual who was responsible rather clap himself on the back on the good thing he had done for the hospital with which he was concerned, because it got a contribution greater than it was entitled to.  I heard Deputy Hogan speak of the metropolitan mentality.  I should have some of that.  I am a representative of Dublin City, and I am a Dublin City man.  Naturally I would like to see Dublin City and the city hospitals getting a generous amount, but I certainly would not stand for Dublin City hospitals getting more than they need, as I believe some of them may do, under present conditions.  From my experience of some of the hospitals I would like to see county hospitals&mdash;especially in poorer areas where such places are ill-equipped, as we know they are, and where the people are unable to afford the necessary funds to equip them&mdash;get under the jurisdiction of the Department of Local Government, where the Minister would have a controlling voice in saying how much money should go to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this Bill, as Deputy Sir James Craig pointed out, a considerable sum of money will be available for county hospitals.  Seeing such a large amount available, some people may be inclined to do what some Dublin hospitals are inclined to do. I would like to see this money doled out under proper control after the submission of a proper scheme.  There is the greatest need for improved hospitals all over the country.  I would like to see the poorer counties looked after first, where people are already heavily rated, and are not able to provide the hospital accommodation that they require.  There may be other classes of county hospitals that <Col N="1512" /> are well-off and that are able to provide for themselves.  The Minister for Local Government, I take it, knows the conditions in the country, and if there are, as I am informed there are, counties that could well afford to have decent hospitals, and that would not tax their people to provide them, then I would give primary consideration to the poorer counties.</P>
    <P>I take it that the Minister proposes to nominate the individuals on the Committee of Reference.  Would it not be wise to allow an outside body like the General Council of County Councils to nominate one or two of these individuals, subject to the approval of the Minister?  The Minister could nominate the third, and also the chairman.  Probably that would give additional confidence in the administration of such a body throughout the country.  Several Deputies mentioned the amount of available surplus, as it is called, that goes to the hospitals out of the sweepstakes fund.  I wonder would it be possible to raise the sum to 30 per cent.  An enormous amount is given away in prize money.  I know there is an argument urged in favour of keeping the prize money very high.  It is urged that if it were not so high, the success that has been achieved would not have been achieved.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, out of the total amount that was raised 25 per cent. does not seem to be an adequate amount to go to the hospitals.  I wonder does the Minister propose to permit these hospitals to go on for all time participating in these sweeps.  I saw in the Press that the Minister received a deputation from people representing the hospitals that participated in the original sweepstakes and that have continued to participate, asking that anything that would happen through the introduction of this Bill should not jeopardise their position.  You have heard what I have already said with regard to the amount of money at the disposal of some of these hospitals and their difficulty in finding ways of disposing of it.  I have no doubt they will dispose of it properly, in putting up additional accommodation, <Col N="1513" /> in providing X-ray and other scientific apparatus.  My idea is that there should be a limit to the amount of the extensions of these various hospitals in the city and that the money available should be under some authority.  I would like to know, therefore, whether it is proposed to permit these same hospitals that have been participating in the Sweeps and that have got close on £100,000, to go on indefinitely participating.  I do not think, even speaking as a Dublin city man and a Dublin city representative, that while there are hospitals in the country that are in needy circumstances, that that would be proper.  I would like to hear the Minister's view on the matter.</P>
    <P>Some other Deputy asked a question that I had noted to ask.  That is, whether county sanatoria are to be permitted to benefit under this scheme. County hospitals are.  Deputy Hogan, I think, mentioned district hospitals. I would also like to ask the Minister if county sanatoria are to benefit. That is all I have to say, except to again express my view that it is not a wise procedure to wipe out, in so far as certain hospitals are concerned, the condition relating to the number of free beds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bennett said that country representatives should try and make a case for county hospitals. I do not think that we will have any trying to make a case at all.  We have a clear case.  The county hospitals and district hospitals deal with two-thirds of the population of the Free State, and that fact alone entitles them to consideration under the Hospitals' Sweepstakes, to much more consideration than they are getting even under this Bill.  For the last ten years the amount of work done in the county hospitals has increased four-fold.  The percentage of patients sent to Dublin now or to Cork is very small, and on the decrease.  In fact, the amount of work to be done by the county surgeon is altogether too much. As has been indicated here by Deputy Dr. Ward, on the Local Government Vote, the county surgeon is expected to perform every operation from the <Col N="1514" /> taking out of an eye or a tooth to serious abdominal operations.  He is expected to do things that are specialised in by different surgeons in the city.  That being so the amount of work done, whether it be right or wrong, in the county hospitals has increased four-fold in the last ten years and entitles them to consideration under this Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hogan has referred to the exhibition of the metropolitan mind. Certainly I can reiterate what he said. Deputy Hennessy, Deputy MacEntee, Deputy Little and Deputy Sir James Craig were unanimous that under this Bill county hospitals might get too much and they would not know what to do with it, and suggested to the Minister what safeguards he should put in this Bill to prevent them from squandering.  They forget the fact that whereas a couple of dozen hospitals at the most benefited under the original Bill, 75 per cent. of the proceeds remained for these hospitals, and only 25 per cent. is available now for a total of 100 institutions approximately. There are, at least, one hundred county hospitals, district hospitals and county infirmaries.  It is not hard to calculate what they will get out of 25 per cent. of the amount allocated from the proceeds of the hospitals sweeps if we take the profits of the sweep as a basis.  As time goes on my opinion is that these sweeps will be on the decline, that they are not going to continue increasing.  This original measure, when introduced, was not introduced as a Government measure. It was left to a free vote of the House. I do not think that the idea for this Bill came from the Government.  The idea came from Dr. O'Dowd, although Deputy Shaw was not slow in claiming originality for it.  He is never behind the door in that regard.  It is, however, a good job that the Government and the Opposition in Westmeath are unanimous in this measure.  If we cannot have hands across the sea we can have hands across the Jordan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The proportion of the money that the hospitals will get out <Col N="1515" /> of this has been dealt with by Deputy MacEntee, Deputy O'Kelly and others. I said on the original Bill, and I have said it in this House since, that at least thirty per cent. should be devoted to the hospitals.  I do not see any reason why that percentage should not be devoted, and we believe that the amount subscribed would be the same.  The effect of increasing by five per cent. before did not take from the success of the sweep, and the making of the allowance to the hospitals up to thirty per cent. will not influence the subscriptions to the sweep in the future. The amount given to the promoters in fees is altogether too much.  In the original Bill Deputy O'Kelly suggested that five per cent. should be the maximum. I think every fair-minded person in the House will agree that with that percentage the promoters will get off very well.  Any balance and any economies should be devoted to the hospitals and not to further increasing the prizes.</P>
      <P>While speaking on this matter we might express the hope that in the employment that this measure and the previous measures are giving, and will be giving, Irishmen will be chosen in the offices.  A rumour is going about that foreigners have a big interest in the Hospitals Trust, and that the principal heads in the promotion of these sweepstakes are foreigners.  I hope that that rumour is false.  However, from the knowledge at our disposal we believe there is a lot of truth in the rumour.  If that be so, what Deputy Davin advocated here should be done&mdash;that is to say, that the State should take over the business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice here, in Section 2 of the Bill, the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital, Adelaide Road, Dublin, comes into the sweepstakes.  I do not know why &ldquo;Royal&rdquo; should be in it.  I do not know whether they are getting any grant from England because of this &ldquo;Royal&rdquo;.  The point I want to make about it is this: the fact that this hospital is getting benefit under the sweep should be a reason that all eye and ear cases which now come for treatment to the county and district <Col N="1516" /> hospitals and infirmaries should be sent on for treatment to the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital, and that the Minister should make that a condition as to why this hospital should benefit by the Bill.</P>
    <P>In Section 7 the apportionment of the twenty-five per cent. of the proceeds of the sweepstake is dealt with. I agree with Dr. O'Dowd that population is a wrong basis to go on.  If we go on that basis the County Cork will get everything, and County Cork has done well enough already.  I think that there is too much power given to the Minister for Local Government in this measure.  He has absolute power as to how the money, when it is allocated on a population basis, is to be spent.  There should be a clearer indication and a clearer direction to the Minister in this Bill than there is in sub-section (6), Clause 7.</P>
    <P>We heard a great deal about Ireland's contribution to this fund.  I wonder how the various people who got up and said that Ireland only contributed 9 per cent. of the sweepstake funds got their figures?  I wonder how the Hospitals Trust made the estimate? If one goes down there any of these days one meets with hundreds of people going into the receiving offices handing in counterfoils and cash.  Between Saturday next and the draw, how can the Hospital promoters arrive at the figure as to how much Ireland contributes and how much England contributes?  I think that is only propaganda.  Deputy Bennett goes on to state that contributing to sweepstakes is a blessing to the poor man.  We have Deputy Haslett on the one side and Deputy Bennett on the other side&mdash;the two extremes.  Gambling is an evil and we are benefiting by this failing of gamblers.  Nobody buys a ticket, as far as I know, in order that the hospitals may benefit.  Deputy Bennett knows people down in Limerick who buy tickets for the benefit of the hospitals.  I know of no such people.  People buy tickets in order to wake up some morning millionaires. That is the only reason for buying a ticket.  That little failing was availed of by the promoters in the original Bill.  We are very glad in this House <Col N="1517" /> to avail of it now for the benefit of the county hospitals.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Hennessy stated that no money should be given for reconstruction and that the money should be confined to providing surgical apparatus and X-ray equipment.  From my knowledge of county hospitals, I can say that most of them are already equipped with X-ray apparatus.  But most of them need maternity wards. They need separate buildings for the treatment of maternity cases, and that certainly would be one of the most desirable objects to which the funds from the sweepstakes could be devoted. There should be nothing put in the way of the county hospitals or the boards of health adding wings for maternity cases to county hospitals. It would be a great blessing and a benefit that the unfortunate patients suffering from tuberculosis should be taken away from the rest of the patients in the county hospital and put into sanatoria.  Many counties have done that already, I think the majority have done it, but the sooner all counties do it the better for the unfortunate tuberculous patients.  They should be kept apart from the other patients in the county hospital. It is a very bad thing that these patients should be in wards adjoining wards in which other patients are accommodated. Very often there is no privacy or quiet for those poor patients suffering from tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>If the Minister does not see his way to give money towards the erection of tuberculosis hospitals or the purchase of mansions for tuberculosis hospitals he should see his way to give money towards the equipment of these tuberculosis hospitals when they are built or acquired.  Speaking for myself, I welcome this Bill.  I think it is overdue. I think also that the Minister should look into this fact under the next sweepstake.  The Dublin hospitals will have got more than enough, and he should devote the whole of the proceeds from this onwards to the benefit of the county hospitals.  Certainly the position to which Deputy O'Kelly refers will arise, but I cannot see from this to 1934 that position arising as regards the county hospitals, <Col N="1518" /> district hospitals and county infirmaries, when we consider that their number is well over one hundred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArthurMatthews" hpid="Mr. Mathews Mr. Mathews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mathews</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like an assurance from the Minister when he is replying that the county infirmaries will participate in the twenty-five per cent. allocated to the boards of health.  I am not sure from the wording of this section that a county infirmary would come within the ambit of this Bill.  I am quite sure it is the intention of the Minister that it should.  Section 7, sub-section (b), of the Bill states: &ldquo;Shall be allocated by the said Minister in such manner as he shall direct to such one or more as he shall think fit of the hospitals (exclusive of any hospital entitled under the foregoing section to any other part of the said available surplus) for the sick poor of such county or county borough maintainable under the enactment relating to the relief of the destitute poor.&rdquo;  I am not quite sure whether a county infirmary would be a place coming under the enactments relating to the relief of the destitute poor.  There is a county infirmary in my county which is not directly under the Board of Health, but is governed by a committee, and the County Council, in view of giving a contribution from the rates each year, have the right to nominate a certain number on the committee. Otherwise it does not come under the control of the Board of Health.  It is simply run by a committee of which the County Council nominate a proportion, because under the Local Government Act of 1898 they were entitled to give a contribution from the rates.  I am not quite sure that these county infirmaries come under the provisions of the Bill.  I am sure that it is the intention of the Minister that they should, and I should like an assurance that they do.</P>

      <P>I wonder if there is room for another irrelevant speaker, as I should like to take up the issue raised by Deputy MacEntee.  I find myself very largely in agreement with what he says.  I do think that the principle of sweepstakes is involved in this Bill, and as I had not much <Col N="1519" /> opportunity of discussing it on the previous Bill, I should like to say a few words now.  I speak against this Bill with considerable reluctance.  I am acquainted with many people who were behind the original Bill and who were energetic in its promotion. I know that their motives were thoroughly disinterested.  Indeed, some of the most disinterested and most civic, if I might say so, of our fellow-citizens are in their company. I know that their eyes have been fixed simply on the needs of the hospitals.  That those needs are dire and extreme, nobody can deny, but I did believe, and I do believe still, that those needs could be met in another way than the way that the originators of the Private Bill chose to take.</P>
      <P>I think it was Deputy Davin remarked that most people in this country felt with him and differed from Deputy MacEntee; that only a saint or a scholar could agree with Deputy MacEntee.  I do not profess to be either.  I did read a little history and I have not forgotten it, and I do know that if we are to learn anything from history we might learn this: that other States have tried lotteries, have tried these big schemes for raising money and getting it cheap, and have found that they paid dearly for it.  To put it shortly, experience shows that this form of raising money cheaply tends to rot the economic life of the nation; tends to sap the moral stamina; tends to undermine the belief that there is only one way of getting money, and that is by work.  Nations have learned that and have set about checking lotteries and blotting them out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That experience we have forgotten, or else we have yielded to a sudden temptation.  This temptation is becoming not less but greater.  We are playing the usual trick of saying, &ldquo;We will be better to-morrow; we will put it off until New Year's Day; we are going to be good in 1934.&rdquo;  I have done that myself.  I have decided to give up things and put off the day for giving them up.  You know what <Col N="1520" /> happens.  I suppose we are all the same.  Better stop it at once.  We are trying to justify this thing, which I think is bad, by pointing to other things that are admittedly bad.  We point to the increase in the growth of turf accountants in our city and say: &ldquo;You permit them and refuse a little flutter like this that is bringing us not merely money but reputation.&rdquo; To say that a sweepstake is not as bad as the institution of turf accountants, is simply trying to justify the bad by the worse.  It does not make the sweepstake good.</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Kelly said, the whole thing is a matter of degree.  Gambling in itself I do not regard as an evil, inside limits.  It is its excess that I condemn.  I certainly have seen enough of these present sweepstakes and of the people who have gone in for them to realise that they are not benefiting our people.  The Minister will forgive me for not speaking to the Bill, but I would say this: I do believe, with Deputy MacEntee, that the widening of the scope is going to make it very difficult for us to stop the institution of sweepstakes in 1934. We have put our feet on a very slippery path; we are going down the hill and we have not got a brake.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to delay the House long, but I should like that what I have to say should go on record.  Much has been said about the method of control that the Minister should assert over the distribution of the money acquired from the various sweepstakes and also as to who should get it.  I believe that we will some day or other cease to acquire money by this means for institutions in the country.  Unless I am very wrong, we might yet decide, if the country is going to go on as it is going now, to raise money by sweepstakes which is now raised by taxation, when we find they are becoming so popular all over the world.  I do not care if one part of the country gets more money than another from this.  I say that the money should be distributed where it is required.  But I should like the Minister to think of what will happen if institutions in the country and in the <Col N="1521" /> city go in for extravagant building schemes for which they will afterwards have to find the money necessary for upkeep.  If, when the sweepstakes cease, these hospitals find themselves with a bigger expenditure and less income, is the Minister not really opening up for the future an extra imposition on the rates or extra taxation in order to raise funds to keep the hospitals going?</P>
      <P>The Government have themselves been very quick to take advantage of the tremendous success of the sweepstakes, inasmuch as they have cut down the State grants to hospitals which have participated in them. It is only fair to assume that if the Government are going to shed their responsibility for the upkeep of these hospitals while they are benefiting from the sweepstakes, the hospitals and the public will expect the Government to come to the rescue of the hospitals, to a greater extent when the income from the sweepstakes ceases, and when the expenditure for the upkeep of the hospitals will have become greater, owing to the extra buildings and equipment which they will have provided.  That applies particularly to the country.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies said that the city Deputies were anxious to see all the money kept for the city hospitals.  I would not care if all the money from the next sweepstakes went to the country hospitals, provided the city hospitals had enough to keep them going.  It is not so very long since the Minister came into this House like a forsaken child when the original Bill was introduced.  Now the Minister is taking care to create new jobs and to fill these jobs himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say this whole thing should be left to the hospitals or to the county councils in the country, and that it is for them to set up the persons who should decide what the hospitals should get out of certain proceeds.  It is not for the Dáil even, or for the Minister to have new positions created and paid for out of the funds of these sweepstakes.  I believe that in 1934 we will not be looking to the finishing of this system of raising money, but we <Col N="1522" /> will find ourselves in the position of having to continue to find some other idea to support the demand for more money to be got in this way.  A lot of people from both sides have talked about the morals and everything else of this transaction.  I do not know where the difference and the degree come in, and how one person can satisfy himself about one thing, and turn round and deery another.</P>
    <P>The Government is reaping a very handsome return from the tax on betting transactions, and the taxation of the country is benefiting from it, but if it is fair for the Government to derive taxation from a duty on betting transactions, either on the course or through the betting shops, it is also just as moral, I presume, for the hospitals to get money through sweepstakes. What I really want to say is this: I find great fault with the Government for having ceased to continue their contribution to the hospitals, because the original idea was that the Sweepstakes Act was to be a temporary measure; it was to get the hospitals out of immediate debt and to help them to equip themselves with the more essential and more important implements and surgical apparatus. Although the Government demands certain services from the hospitals, it now turns round and cuts down the grants, which are already small enough.  My one objection to the sweepstakes idea was that the Government would use it to shed their responsibility to the people who were running the hospitals.  Next to proper housing, the health of the people of the country is the most important item.  If the Government is going to shelve its responsibilities on the slightest pretext, I think it is quite accurate to say that they were misleading the Dáil when they said that their idea was to make the Hospital Trust Act a temporary measure.  I believe the Government will keep this thing going as long as there is any return from it.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee has stated in his speech, possibly in a better way than I could do it, the views that I hold in this matter.  We have to face the <Col N="1523" /> existence of sweepstakes and to try and make the best use we can of them. It was rather amusing to hear Deputy Sir James Craig say that no county hospital should get more than a certain amount because they would not have use for it.  I would like to hear some suggestion as to what they should do with any surplus the hospitals themselves might have.  Do Deputies not think it might be possible for the county hospitals, if they receive a certain amount of money, to put up new buildings or to rebuild or to equip themselves with a certain amount of apparatus, to invest the money in such a way that it would bring in certain dividends to pay for the future upkeep of their extensions?  I think it would be very wrong to try and bring about a position where you would have the beneficiaries afterwards quarrelling over the spoil.  I would urge the Minister to keep a very rigid control over the way in which the money is spent.</P>
    <P>I am connected with two Dublin hospitals, one of which benefits under the sweep, and I am glad to see the Board of that hospital decide to make provision in connection with any extensions they might build so as to be able to look after its upkeep in the future, so that when the sweep ceases there will be no extra burden either on the voluntary subscribers or on the city or anybody else, and they would be able to give not only the present but an extended service to the community. If all the hospitals acted as the hospital I have mentioned did there would be no difficulty.  But many hospitals which are getting sweep money are embarking upon huge schemes.  Their expenditure is becoming tremendous both in the acquisition of new property and in rebuilding, and they are not looking to the day when their income from sweepstakes would cease and when they may have to find income elsewhere for the upkeep of their extensions. I would rather see the Minister making sure that those hospitals embarking upon such expenditure should lay aside money for the upkeep of the additional extensions <Col N="1524" /> and commitments they have gone in for.  Instead of that the Minister is concerning himself largely with the right of appointing certain individuals, and another Minister is to have the right of fixing their salaries and the Hospitals Committee has to pay them. The right of hiring and firing these people rests solely with Ministers.  I think these are matters that should concern the hospitals or the county councils in conjunction with the Dublin Hospitals Committee.</P>
    <P>I was expecting that the Minister would give the House more detailed information as to reports and statements of the previous two sweeps. Many of us are very anxious to know exactly what the figures are and how they have been disbursed and what the expense has been, and who have benefited in the shape of commissions arising through agencies.  I understand that these statements are to be put before the Dáil.  The Minister has surely information in regard to the two previous sweeps, and if he does not intend to give us particulars here perhaps he would state how and where we would get this information.  Is it to be obtained through a system of question and answer?</P>

      <P>Very well.  I want certain information, and I hope to get it in that way.  I also desire to say that do not wish to underestimate the organising ability of the promoters, but neither do I want to overestimate it or join with those who are paying glowing tributes to the promoters as being wonderful business men.  It is common knowledge that in practically every country outside this the running of sweepstakes and the selling of tickets are illegal.  As a result, this country, being one of the few countries in which sweepstakes are permissible, the organisers have an <Col N="1526" /> exceptional chance, as they have practically the whole world from which to get returns.  Under those circumstances, getting £1,000,000 from the whole world is not such a phenomenal feat.  It is not so wonderful.  We may yet find that other countries will adopt certain restrictions on the sale of tickets, and that these will make the returns here much less.  That is why I rise to say that I hope that the Minister will concern himself with seeing that expenditure on the part of the hospitals, whether in cities or the country, will not be indulged in to the extent that it would leave a burden on the ratepayers at some future date when the Bill ceases, or, as Deputy Kennedy said, when we may visualise a falling off in the returns.</P>

      <P>I think that this measure has been pretty well debated, so that I have no desire to delay the House.  As a country Deputy and one who knows the difficulties under which boards of health are conducting county hospitals, I desire to say a few words and to endorse what has been said by other Deputies who have had experience on such boards.  In County Westmeath we have district and county hospitals to look after, and we have to turn patients away from the hospital in Athlone.  We want to extend these institutions, and up to the present the only way we could do so was to put further burdens on the ratepayers.  Now, however, we have found a means through sweepstakes, which have done such great good to the Dublin City hospitals.  We naturally think that we should have the same facilities for carrying out these extensions as those which have been enjoyed by the Dublin hospitals. We would then be able to bring our county and district hospitals up to date.  I congratulate the Minister on introducing this Bill and on giving a chance of improving and equipping our hospitals in an up-to-date manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesKeogh" hpid="Dr. Keogh Dr. Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Chair and the Minister have displayed great patience during this discussion, which has included many things very wide of those contained in the Bill.  I was <Col N="1527" /> surprised to hear a Deputy say that other means could be devised to get money for our hospitals.  Those who have been connected with management committees of hospitals for the last ten years will, no doubt, be pleased to have his advice and to learn how that state of affairs can be brought about.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kennedy said that all this was merely propaganda for the Free State, and that only about 9 per cent. of the money subscribed was got within it.  I am certain that the chartered accountants will be able to give him the figures to convince him that it is not propaganda.  There has been much talk about the promoters, but I suppose it is not the Minister's place to defend them.  It surprised me to hear that the promoters got 25 per cent.  I know, as a matter of fact, that in connection with the two sweeps they did not get even half of that.  Some Deputy mentioned the word &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; in connection with this matter.  We know that there are thousands of girls, and some men, who are receiving in wages up to £100,000, and we thank the foreigners for sending this money to keep what might be called an industry going.  It has been remarked that we have got the best promoters we could get.  We had no alternative in regard to the promoters.  Promoters, Ltd., came along and said &ldquo;There is £100,000.&rdquo;  That took our breath away.  They told us that 50 per cent. would go to the winners, 25 per cent. to the hospitals, and the rest in expenses throughout the country. Everything possible in connection with the sweep is bought in this country and, between printing, building and other expenditure, upwards of a quarter of a million has been circulated amongst ourselves.  That is much more than we ourselves have contributed, while the promoters are getting the original amount which Deputy O'Kelly, Deputy Bennett and others who sat on the Committee to implement the Bill decided that they should get.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased at the introduction of this Bill, and I compliment the Minister on making provision for the county and district hospitals. <Col N="1528" /> I also wish to return thanks to the promoter of the original Bill, Deputy Sir James Craig.  No one can realise the great advantages that have been derived, and the blessings which that Bill has brought to the sick poor of the country.  It has placed hospitals in such a position as to ease them financially and make them in every way up to date.  That is magnificent work, and, no matter what moral may be attributed to it by some Deputies or those of the outside public who do not approve of the scheme, there is certainly one moral to be drawn, and that is that it has served a great need and has relieved the sufferings of people in this country to an extent which was never before thought possible.  As regards contributions to county hospitals, I suggest respectfully that they be made as large as possible. I know that the hospitals in Dublin are now reasonably well provided for, and I am glad of it, but our county hospitals and infirmaries, as well as our district hospitals, are sadly lacking in anything in the shape of modern equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the primitive equipment of these hospitals, I would like to see a larger sum allotted to them in order to bring them to an up-to-date condition.  The expenses which would be incurred to instal modern equipment in these hospitals would be enormous. In districts down the country people suffering from various diseases who require immediate attention, or perhaps operations, have in many cases to proceed to Dublin at a very big cost to themselves.  The poorer people in many places could not afford to expend what would be incurred in bringing them to Dublin for operations and treatment in hospitals with modern equipment.  In such cases, owing to the extreme expense, these poor people are deprived of the services of surgeons in the city.  In many districts down the country we have surgeons of outstanding ability, but owing to the lack of equipment they are not in a position to perform the operations which they otherwise could carry out at a nominal cost.  They are not in a position to perform these operations, for no fee in some cases, <Col N="1529" /> as they would be if the equipment were provided.  That is the sort of service which medical men would really perform for the poor people were these facilities afforded them.  In the circumstances, it is much more essential that county hospitals should be provided with modern equipment.</P>
    <P>In my own county we have a county infirmary and a county hospital in Longford, but we have no modern equipment.  We have no X-ray apparatus of any kind.  If it is necessary to have patients X-rayed, they have to be sent to the nearest county, which is Westmeath.  In the course of that journey the patient may suffer serious consequences, if not actual death. That is the important feature of the matter for counties such as ours.  The county is small, it has a small population, and the sums contributed by ratepayers and voluntary contributors are not sufficient to enable the hospitals to purchase the equipment necessary to render these services to the poor.  On the question of distributing the money on a population basis, I say that considerable hardship will be imposed on many counties with a small population if that basis is adhered to. If the money is distributed in that way, counties such as I represent will not benefit to any great extent.  The amount that would be allocated to these counties would be of very little use, while cities and towns such as Dublin, Cork and Limerick, which have already benefited under former sweeps, will come in for a further share on the population basis.  I hope that on the Committee Stage amendments will be introduced to give these small counties the same privileges that counties with a larger and a wealthier population enjoy at present.</P>
    <P>I find that all Deputies are as one on the major question of the Bill.  One feature of the debate is that each Deputy tries to take the wind out of other Deputies' sails in showing how he is accountable for the introduction of the Bill.  For myself, I would like to say that I have been an ardent supporter of the measure and was very anxious for the introduction of this Bill to assist county hospitals.  The <Col N="1530" /> matter that most concerns as now is to see that an equitable distribution of the money takes place, particularly as regards those counties which are poor and unable to supply the necessary hospital equipment themselves.  I know that a considerable amount of money is being subscribed from outside sources in other countries, but I know also that very large sums have been contributed from many counties throughout Ireland.  I venture to say that the amount of money contributed in the Free State was about 50 per cent. greater than has been contributed from other countries, pro rata to the population.  Yet we are very thankful for the contributions made by other countries.  On the point as to whether the money was contributed entirely for the relief of hospitals or otherwise, there is this to be said: that the inducement to people to subscribe was the chance of winning a large sum of money in most cases.  A large prize is a very great inducement, and I do not think it would be at all advisable to reduce the prize money to any great extent.  If we maintain reasonably handsome prizes and offer the people something they want; if we offer them value for the money they contribute and have the terms as attractive as at present, the sweeps will continue to be successful.  Many Deputies criticised the Bill on the morality of having sweeps at all.  If you ask those Deputies is it possible that they have not contributed to the sweep it is very questionable whether they could answer in the affirmative.  I would hardly like to challenge some of the Deputies who have been criticising it from that point of view.  If you ask them to turn out their pockets probably you will find a few tickets in their possession.</P>

      <P>At the same time it is scarcely worth while saying that it is immoral or that it is tending towards immorality.  It is quite a legitimate proposition.  Betting and gambling have been going on since the beginning of the world, and will continue to exist until the end of the world.  It is a reasonable and a fair system and no <Col N="1531" /> great risk is involved.  People who might have to deprive themselves of certain necessaries of life for this purpose might have on many occasions deprived themselves of other necessaries of life for other purposes not so laudable.  I trust that when this Bill is before the House on the Committee Stage the Minister will introduce some necessary amendments in order to make the Bill fairer to counties with smaller populations, and that counties that have no great means at their disposal will get a better share than the amount suggested here, a 25 per cent. on the basis of the population.</P>

      <P>I anticipated that the discussion on this Bill would occupy something, like half an hour or, at the outside, an hour.  I am afraid that I would make an extremely bad prophet.  I think the reason that this discussion drew out to such very considerable length was that Deputy MacEntee, having started an attack on the general principle, made a speech which had nothing whatever to do with the amendments contained in the Bill, and caused most other people to follow him in his irrelevancies.</P>

I feel that if the Deputy had gone to the trouble of making himself acquainted even with the details of the Hospitals Bill he would not have made the speech which he made to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He started off about my insisting on a virtual monopoly in the Hospitals Trust.  He stated that the Hospitals Trust alone would be able to promote sweeps.  He said that without the slightest knowledge of the facts, and also with a culpable ignorance of the facts, because if he had read the original Bill, he would know that I have not got anything to do with the promotion or formulation of the <Col N="1532" /> scheme or with the distribution of the money.  My functions begin and end with seeing that the scheme comes within the four corners of the Bill. I have power to reject, amend or accept it and nothing else, and the responsibility for the details of it is not my responsibility, and the details are not mine.  I think I should go on and say, since he has attacked the Hospitals Committee as he has done, and said we should send it all round, that one body should not get the whole monopoly, might I ask to whom they should send it around? They have an organisation which is a success, and Deputy MacEntee, in his wisdom, comes along and says &ldquo;scrap your existing organisation, get a new body, new individual promoters who will get together new premises, and new staff, and start with an entirely different scheme on probably different lines.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I never said that sweepstakes were immoral.  When the original Bill was before this House I was one of those who was prepared to support it because of the conditions in the hospitals, but I saw that the developments ought to be carefully watched.  I never said it was immoral to run a sweepstake, and I never held it is immoral to gamble, but I saw that there may be dangerous developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy went further and said that there were already dangerous developments and painted a lurid picture of people selling their furniture to buy sweepstake tickets.  If that is the case the proper attitude that Deputies should take up would be to introduce a Bill for the abolition of sweepstakes altogether and the repeal of the existing Act.</P>
      <P>Deputy Davin, who spoke after Deputy MacEntee, declared that I had at one time held up my hands in denunciation of this scheme and that now I was in favour of it.  My attitude has remained completely unchanged from the beginning.  It has always been the same.  I said I saw that it was to the very greatest interest of the hospitals that this should come in; that I did not see any harm in a scheme which would benefit the hospitals, but I did see if we allowed the hospitals sweep we would have to allow other sweeps in the future, and for that particular reason I opposed the Second Reading of the Act.  I opposed it not because I thought the thing was wrong, but because I believed and still believe that you have not got to the end of sweepstakes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act was passed and then I was in the position that I had either to sit down and sulk because I was opposed to the Act or else administer it.  Which was the proper course for me?  What I have done since the Dáil put the responsibility on my shoulders is I have shouldered this responsibility and have endeavoured to see that the hospitals scheme will be within the limits imposed <Col N="1534" /> on it and be properly carried out.  Deputy Good and Deputy O'Kelly also talked about the centralisation of hospitals.  I do not think that arises here.  It is a matter for the hospitals themselves.  If they consider it is the proper thing to centralise, now is the time.  They should really consider it when they have got very large sums of money in their hands.  I know a great number of them are contemplating large building schemes.</P>
    <P>Before I deal with the real criticisms which have been directed to this amending Bill I would like to say one word about a matter we have coming up again and again, that is the alleged small proportion of the proceeds which the hospitals obtain.  To my mind, the hospitals get as much as they ought to get.  The original Act said that they should receive a minimum of twenty per cent.  They are receiving five per cent. more, making it twenty-five per cent.  I think, considering the enormous sums they have received and considering, when the Derby Sweep is finished, the hospitals will have received practically a million pounds, that nobody can say that the hospitals have done badly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister making the case that the hospitals have received more than is sufficient?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would listen to my speech he would understand the case I am making. I think I will make myself so clear that even Deputy MacEntee can follow me.  I said that the hospitals have received twenty-five per cent.  I do not think anyone can say that the hospitals have not received a due and ample sum when, out of three sweeps, they have received one million pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To look at it from the other point of view, of the person who purchases a ticket; if this were a mutual sweep everything except expenses would go into the prize fund.  What happens here is that the purchase money of the tickets goes to a fund from which 25 per cent. is taken away on behalf of the hospitals.  Have not the people who purchased tickets some moral claim, a claim that in good faith they should be given a reasonable sum of money to draw from?  You can <Col N="1535" /> entice them by making them give the hospitals fifty per cent.; they will buy just the same.  Granted they do, I do not want to go out sticking the people who purchased tickets.  What I want to do, and what I think the Hospitals Committee ought to do is to see that the persons who buy tickets in their sweep get fair play, and get a fair and honest proportion of the proceeds of the sweep.  Let them see, when they buy tickets in a sweep which is promoted in this country, that the idea is not to regard them as people that will be &ldquo;stuck&rdquo; if you like.  Let them see that we wish a reasonable amount to go to charity and that we do not want an unreasonable amount to be taken from the funds from which they draw.  I think somebody has to look after the purchasers of tickets.  The hospitals have plenty to look after them.  The purchasers of tickets are an unorganised body, and I think it is the business of this House to see that they get fair play and that a fair proportion of the money supplied goes amongst those who subscribe to the draw.</P>
    <P>I come now to the actual criticism launched at the Bill itself.  On Section 2, Deputy O'Kelly wished to know why some hospitals were now included, and if they came under the original scheme.  I may tell the Deputy that for instance, as far as Peamount Sanatorium is concerned it could not possibly have participated because its new village scheme was not established in 1929.  The Deputy will recollect that there is one standard year, the accounts of which are taken. That hospital, and also the Lourdes Hospital had not started work in 1929.  The Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital I have already dealt with, I will deal with it shortly again. It stands on the same footing as the Dental Hospital.  It does the major portion of its work in the dispensary. A tremendous amount of charity work is done in the dispensary department to which a great number of people go for what I call dispensary treatment. They do not stop there just as they do not stop in the Dental Hospital. I think the same principle applies <Col N="1536" /> in an hospital of that nature and that how the beds are given is not the real standard that ought to be taken.  Similarly I think Cappagh Hospital does very good work but, owing to its nature, it is not precisely the kind of hospital which I believe even the promoters of the Bill in the first instance visualised.</P>
    <P>Under paragraph (c) twenty-five per cent. of the total accommodation for indoor patients has to be given at a rate not exceeding 10/- weekly.  That was really framed when persons were looking to large hospitals here where temporary patients go in.  It was not really in contemplation as to whether hospitals of that nature would or would not come in.  I think the real test is: Does an hospital really do good, charitable work?  If it does, whether it comes within the formula &mdash;which after all is an artificial formula&mdash;does not matter very much.</P>
    <P>I stated a comparatively short time ago that if any hospitals that did not come within the provisions of the Bill wished to have their names considered, I would consider them.  The ones that put their names forward, and that I considered would come reasonably within the scope of the Hospitals Committee for charitable work, are here. One institution&mdash;the Blind Asylum&mdash; would like to be put into the Sweep. I had, however, regretfully to refuse because it was not an hospital, and did not come within the general scope.  I might say generally that there was talk about payment for nurses and setting up assistance for lunatic asylums. I did not think either of these would come within this Bill or the original Act.  I am endeavouring to keep to the spirit of the original Act for the benefit of the hospitals.</P>
    <P>I come to another question&mdash;the proportion of the proceeds which ought to go to participating hospitals, the portion which ought to go to county hospitals, and the basis on which it should go.  In the first place all hospitals which are maintainable under an enactment relating to the relief of the destitute poor can receive portion of this money, and I think that takes in, as far as I know, all the county hospitals.  I may be <Col N="1537" /> wrong in that as far as Meath is concerned, because I am not completely conversant with county hospitals.  If the Deputy will consult the Minister for Local Government he will be able to make the position clear.  The question is put forward as to the basis upon which the money should be distributed, whether it should be left to the unfettered discretion of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, or whether there should be a rule of thumb principle for distribution, and that the rule of thumb distribution would be, of course, on the population basis.</P>
    <P>The population basis seems to me to be very fair.  It is said that it will not help the poor or the smaller counties.  On the contrary, I think it will.  After all, the poorer counties are the thickly populated counties, and it is these counties which will get the larger sums of money.  You may have a small county which gets a comparatively small sum of money, while another county, twice the size, will receive twice as much money, but then it will require twice as big a county infirmary, or, at any rate, twice as much accommodation for poor patients. You will not get smaller populated counties as poor as largely populated counties.  Large western counties, for instance, are fairly thickly populated, and I think they will require more than some of the smaller counties which have not perhaps so many poor people to provide for.  I do not think there is anything else I need go into now.  I venture to say that a considerable amount of the discussion we have had will be repeated on the Committee Stage.  I venture to think also, that a great deal of it might have been deferred to the Committee Stage, but we will wait until then.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I have no power to make any regulation as to how money is to be expended by a hospital.  I have no such power under the Act, and I have never attempted to make any such regulation.  If the Deputy would like to know my personal views I think a hospital should lay by a certain amount of money.  Not only should they satisfy their present necessary requirements but they should capitalise half of their income, because they have chosen this particular method as the method of raising money, and rejected the voluntary method.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill. Normally, between the 23rd June and 1st July the triennial elections would take place in respect of the county councils, urban district councils and town commissioners.  It will be recalled that in his Budget speech on 6th May the Minister for Finance foreshadowed that the Government would introduce proposals for the remodelling of local government, and stated that at a very early date proposals would be put before the Dáil for, in particular, the remodelling of the county council <Col N="1540" /> machinery.  In the circumstances it was thought that no advantage would be gained by having an election to these bodies now.  An election will take place for the county borough councils of Waterford and of Limerick, and one-third of the members of the council in Cork will be elected.</P>
      <P>There will be no county borough election in Dublin, but with the exception of these elections it is proposed to postpone county council elections and elections to urban district councils and town commissioners. The important proposals that have been promised will be introduced and take effect before the term of office of the new council elected in June next would be completed, and in the circumstances it was thought quite unnecessary to spend approximately £30,000 on these local elections on the one hand, and on the other to put public representatives administering the work of local bodies at present to the inconvenience of contesting an election for a period that would not be the normal period of the life of the council.  The postponement of the elections then saves the local bodies approximately £30,000.  It also puts us in the position that while we will be discussing very important proposals dealing with local government. we will have in office councils who will have had continuing experience of the last three years as well as whatever period will elapse before the proposals are put before us.  It is thought that that will be an advantage too.  The proposals are then that the elections will be postponed to a date not later than July, 1934.  That is the end of the normal period.  The proposals that are before the House contain provisions whereby committees, of which the principal one would be the board of health, that are usually elected after the triennial election and are entitled to last for the life of the councils that elect them, will continue to run for the period of life of the present councils, so that there will be a continuity in respect of the work of the committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill makes certain proposals in regard to casual vacancies and resignations. As far as urban district <Col N="1541" /> councils are concerned, since the change of local government in 1922 elections are held on the same date as the county council elections and part of the cost of the elections only is borne by the urban district councils. It is considered that it would be unwarranted to carry out elections in the urban districts, imposing more expenses on these districts than would normally be the case and more than they had made provision for.  Apart altogether from that, there are some urban district councils and a number of county councils that will be changed in any remodelling of the local government system and in many ways the work of the county council reacts on the urban districts, so that it is as well to have continued the personnel of the urban district councils as well as of the county councils while we are discussing our proposals.  Provision is made also in respect of those areas where we have commissioners acting for the councils at the present moment.  It will, if the circumstances suggest it, enable the Minister to postpone further the elections that would normally take place in these areas. Normally it might be desired to postpone these elections until such time as we are holding the general local government elections.  So powers are taken to extend the present period in respect of which a commissioner can do the work.  There is nothing that will prevent a council being restored in any of these places if the circumstances should appear to warrant it.</P>
    <P>At the annual or quarterly meeting of the Council, as the case may be, that takes place between the 23rd June and the 1st July, a chairman is elected. Deputies will realise that the Eucharistic Congress will take place in June of next year.  Urban councils and, in an ex-officio manner, the chairmen of urban district councils may possibly, and probably will, take rather a prominent part in the functions in connection with the Eucharistic Congress.  It is obviously undesirable that the persons acting as chairmen of such local bodies should be changed during the period of the Eucharistic Congress. Many of them may be organising or doing other work in connection with <Col N="1542" /> the Congress in June, 1932.  Everyone will realise that it is desirable that the person occupying the position and doing the work leading up to the Eucharistic Congress should continue to do it in whatever representative capacity he may occupy during the period of the Congress.  It is therefore proposed that the election of chairman to the local body that would take place in June, 1932, will be postponed for six or seven weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this Bill is an entirely unnecessary one.  We were told by the Minister for Finance in his Budget speech that there is an intention to alter in some form or another the present system of local government. The Minister for Local Government has just told us now that a Bill is in preparation and will be introduced some time before 1934.  I do not see the necessity of introducing a Bill of this kind postponing the elections while we are waiting for a Bill which will embody the proposals of the Minister for Local Government and his colleagues, to alter, modify or abolish, whichever it may be, the present system of local government.  I do not see why the Bill could not be introduced now.  It probably will not be introduced in a great hurry; if we are to judge by former experience, it may be six months or even twelve months before we will see the Bill.  I see no adequate reason, therefore, why the ordinary elections that would fall due this year should not be held.</P>
      <P>One argument, and one only, that I have heard from the Minister, offered as a good reason why the election should not be held is the Eucharistic Congress.  What the Eucharistic Congress has to do with the election of chairmen of local bodies I cannot see. Whatever their shade of politics may be, I cannot see what difference it would make to have Tom, Dick or Harry as chairman of the local urban district council.  I cannot see what difference or effect it would have on the Eucharistic Congress.  The Government were hard up for arguments when they fell back on that for an argument to advocate the postponement of elections in June.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must have misunderstood my point in regard to the Eucharistic Congress.  The Eucharistic Congress is not introduced in any way for the postponement of elections to the local bodies this year. It is introduced as an argument for putting into this Bill a section which is only for the purpose of securing that whatever local bodies will be in existence in June 1932 will not be called upon during the week of the Eucharistic Congress to elect new chairmen. That is all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see why I was not right in saying that it introduced no argument in favour of the passing of this Bill.  Why it was introduced appears to me to be difficult to understand.  Even if the Eucharistic Congress were actually in progress why a local body should not elect its chairman or change its chairman and elect a new one is a thing that passes my understanding.  The Bill is unnecessary in my opinion.  Whatever may be the fate of local government in the view of the present Ministry, this Bill is unnecessary.  The elections could be held.  The people could be given an opportunity of re-electing those at present in control or changing them if they wish, as I maintain they have a right to do.  The proposals of the Ministry regarding local government and its alteration or abolition could be considered and discussed here.  This is, in a way, rather discussing the whole question in the dark. This Bill only deals with the question of the postponement of the elections, but the whole question of local government changes that are to take place is naturally in one's mind, and it is difficult to avoid discussing them.  I do not propose to call upon myself a ruling from the Chair by going into this matter now, but if I am to take as accurate the statement made in Monaghan ten days ago by the Vice-President it would look as if there was going to be very little change in local government.  That does not bear out what we read every second or third day in the inspired articles in the &ldquo;Independent.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Vice-President of the Executive <Col N="1544" /> Council told the people in Monaghan that they would allow the system of local government to remain substantially in the form in which we had it.  If that be the intention then I see very little necessity, if any, for this Bill.  I think it is a waste of the time of the House, time that could be more valuably spent in other directions than in introducing this unnecessary Bill.  I do not know what the attitude of my colleagues on this Bill will be.  We only got the Bill on Friday last, although the Minister wanted to have its Second Reading fixed for last week. It is more than a fortnight since it passed its First Reading, but not withstanding that we only got the Bill on Friday.  For that reason I have not had an opportunity of discussing the Bill with my colleagues and I do not know what their views may be.  I am only speaking for myself.  I think it is a waste of money and time and a reflection on public bodies in general that they are not to be allowed to hold their election and elect or reject their chairmen, or elect whoever pleases them to run their local affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(An Clár): This Bill does not give an opportunity for very much discussion.  It simply says that we propose to adjourn the local elections for an indefinite period not later than July, 1934, but it does not say when between now and 1934 it is intended to hold them.  It intends to hold up what we were taught to regard as a very sacred thing&mdash;the will of the people&mdash; for that period.  It intends to cut them out.  It intends to say that the people shall have no say as to whether they are satisfied with those people they elected to public responsible positions during the period.  It is indicated that before 1934 we are going to have some modification of local government.  In 1925 we had a very drastic alteration of our local government, that was six years ago, and we had another change in 1923.  We had the wiping out of certain bodies.  There was a good deal of opposition given to that measure.  Later we had further drastic changes in local government administration. I refer to the experiment in Cork and Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1545" /> Now we are asked to wait for a further period, and we are told that some time between this and 1934 we are going to have further drastic changes.  One would have expected that in the last five or six years the Government would have made up their minds as to what their local government policy should be, as to what ought to be the manner in which local affairs should be managed.  They ought to be prepared to tell us now what they propose to do and how local government should be run.  Instead of that, they ask us to wait for this indefinite period.  The Minister told us that there is going to be a saving of public money.  To my mind, that argument could be adduced in favour of anything.  You could postpone a general election indefinitely on the supposition that you were saving money.  You could say, &ldquo;Why have a general election?  Postpone it and save a certain amount of money to the country.&rdquo;  No sufficient reason has been adduced by the Minister as to why the local government elections should not be held.  He can let us have the code in 1934 to which he is so favourably disposed.  Let us have the reformed system of local government when the period of office of the councils expires in 1934.  Nothing desperate can happen between this and 1934 so that we cannot wait until the elections are over and the people have a say in the matter.  I have been so often asked to consider the will of the people as a sacred thing that I did not think the Minister would interfere at this moment and try to suspend it just for the sake of waiting one, two or three years until he has his code prepared, his alterations ready and his system perfected.  I do not think there is any great necessity for that.  We ought to have some adequate reasons adduced for the suspension of the elections.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy O'Kelly, I cannot understand this reference to the chairmen. He talked about their experience and all that sort of thing, and that they are more likely to come in a representative capacity to the Eucharistic Congress.  I would have thought that the Minister would have <Col N="1546" /> liked to allow the councils to say whether they were satisfied with the actions of their chairmen in their representative capacity during the three years, or if they were not, have given them an opportunity to send alternative chairmen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <P>I know, but they rarely change them.  If the Minister gets to be a chairman he has a very good chance of remaining chairman for three years.  I can assure him of that. Where they are satisfied with the activities of the chairman for one, two, or three years we are not giving the councils an opportunity, and the people an opportunity through the elections to the council, of saying: &ldquo;This is the man we would like to send up as a public representative to the Eucharistic Congress to represent us on such an auspicious occasion.&rdquo; This is a Bill on which we cannot say very much.  It simply proposes on the ipse dixit of the Minister to postpone the elections.  So far he has not given any good reason why they should be postponed, and I hope, before he asks the House to vote on the Bill, that he will give us some adequate reasons.</P>

      <P>It is apparent to us that the Minister is postponing the local elections for the purpose of doing away with local government, or, at least, so curtailing the powers of local bodies that local representation might as well not exist at all.  I do not see any reason why the county council and urban council elections should be postponed.  They cannot be postponed certainly on the ground that the present councils are inefficient.  In the county councils and the urban councils, taking them as a whole, you have as clean government as you have in any part of the world.  In fact, local government in Ireland sets a headline which could be copied in many other countries.  There is certainly not any state of things here, such as you have in American cities, that would justify the postponement of elections.  We would like to have a definite reason from the Minister as to why he contemplates <Col N="1547" /> postponing the elections for the purpose of bringing in his reform of local government.  Surely local government has already been too much curtailed under the 1925 Act.  Surely the example of the powers enjoyed in the Six Counties and in Great Britain in local government should be a headline to the Minister not to curtail further the powers here.  I contend that we have as unselfish a body of men on the local councils as is to be found anywhere.  If we do away with local representation, the poor and the ordinary ratepayers will have a very small chance of making representations to anybody.</P>

      <P>You, sir, should take cognisance of these difficulties.  Under the Local Government Act, which did away with district councils, representation was cut down very much.  If the Minister examines the return of voting at county council elections and compares them with those for Dáil elections he will find that a bigger percentage of the electorate vote at council elections than at Dáil elections, which shows that the people take a bigger interest in local affairs than they do in the affairs of this House.  If the object of the Bill is to postpone local election so as further to curtail the representation of the people locally we certainly intend to vote against it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support Deputy O'Kelly in his protest against this Bill. As Deputy O'Kelly said, there is no necessity for it.  There is only one precedent in recent times for such a proposal as this, and that was when the local elections were postponed from 1917 to 1920.  We all know the reasons for that postponement.  There was a world war raging, and this country was also in a state of war.  Certainly the British authorities at the time had a <Col N="1548" /> very good argument for postponing the elections&mdash;a far more substantial argument than the Minister has for his proposal now.  I cannot see in what way the celebrations connected with the Eucharistic Congress next year are inter-mingled with local government, or what they have to do with it.  The Minister, even in this Bill, has shown his inconsistency.  When making his statement he said that in counties where there were Commissioners there was nothing in the Bill to prevent the restoration of the councils between this and 1934.</P>
      <P>As a result of this Bill a situation might occur in which a council which was dissolved where a Commissioner had been appointed might be restored, and that such a council might not represent the views of the people.  The Minister may say that I may be hitting against myself when I mention that, as I am an ex-county councillor, but that is the fact.  The best test that we can have in any county that the council does really represent the views of the people is to allow the election to proceed.  Never since I came into this House did I listen to a weaker speech in support of any Bill, whether introduced by a Minister or a private member, than the speech made by the Minister for Local Government in introducing this Bill.  I shall not go into the proposals in this Bill or try to anticipate them, or to make prophecies regarding them as to what the Minister has in his mind regarding the form of local government that should prevail in this country in the future.  The Minister may have in mind the total abolition of local government, or he may only intend to go as far as the Minister for Finance said in Monaghan he would go in regard to local government. But whatever his intentions are or whatever proposals the House will be presented with they should not make the Minister bring forward this Bill.  As I said, the Bill is inconsistent with what the Minister said, that in counties where Commissioners are now in office there is nothing in the Bill to prevent the restoration of the former councils.  I am sure the Minister will see how inconsistent that statement is with the proposals in the Bill itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1549" /> The best argument in regard to a county like Mayo or any other county similarly situated that the Minister could give in support of his action is, if an election is held that the present members of the council should be defeated, or that the majority of them should be defeated.  I am sure if such a result were to take place it would justify the Minister's act.  But certainly, denying to the people of Mayo or any other county the right to express their opinion upon what has happened is rank injustice and is, in my view, an outrage.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Hogan has said, we hear a lot of play made by the Ministerial and Cumann na nGaedheal speakers throughout the country about the will of the people.  Certainly this Bill is not very consistent with the will of the people.  It would seem, one might say, sacrilegious to connect the Eucharistic Congress celebrations with local government elections.  Further, it is ridiculous to say that it might be considered disrespectful to the celebrations. I think the thing is absolutely preposterous, and I appeal to Deputies, no matter on what side of the House they sit, to throw this Bill out.</P>

      <P>I believe the vast majority of the people, and also the people's representatives, are grateful for the postponement of the local government elections at the present time, because they believe very considerable improvements can be made. I think that Deputy Kennedy, who has spoken against the Bill, as chairman of the board of health where there are ten members, will admit that a board of health will do more work in one day than a county council of thirty-two representatives will do in ten days.  I challenge contradiction of that statement.</P>

      <P>I think it would be generally agreed that the present time is not a very suitable time to spend money unnecessarily.  We have not a very great lot, except in the hospitals sweep, to throw away without very good reason.  As it has been foreshadowed in the Budget speech that a change in local government is going to take place that will require thinking out and development, and will also involve an election soon after the Bill becomes law, I think it would be criminal waste of money to throw away £30,000 unnecessarily and for no purpose whatever.</P>
      <P>A great deal has been made about this being done to convenience those attending the Eucharistic Congress. Of course this Bill has nothing to do with that.  The only matter that would occur in June would be the election of chairmen of councils, and, as the Minister mentions, he means to make some arrangement by which that inconvenience would be obviated, so that chairmen of those important bodies will, if so disposed, be able to attend and take part in the Congress.  On the whole, I think not only in the House here, but all through the country, the proposal of the Minister will be approved.  I think the matter of economy ought to appeal to all of us. This is not a time for throwing away money.  The Minister very wisely decided that these elections shall not take place this year, and I think that his decision will be upheld by every sensible person, not only in this House but outside.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the Minister has given any substantial argument in support of this measure.  I doubt, in fact, whether any good or substantial argument could be produced in favour of it.  Summing up his arguments, such as they were, we have the money argument, the saving of £30,000, but if that were to be used as an argument we should never have <Col N="1551" /> elections which would cost money.  We could always save money by saying that we will not have elections.  That argument must be ruled out.  I quite agree that there are a number of people, like Deputy Shaw and Deputy Wolfe, who think that elections of all kinds are a bit of a nuisance and that we can get on very comfortably without them.  That idea is opposed to all ideas of democratic government.  If we hold that this is a democratically run country, and that the voice of the people must get an opportunity of expressing itself now and again, we must have elections.  The main argument of the Minister is: &ldquo;We are going to introduce fundamental changes in the local government system sometime between this and 1934&rdquo;&mdash;that is as near as he has gone; it might be this year, next year or the year following&mdash;&ldquo;and because of that we are not to have the ordinary elections which usually take place in June.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What is his reason for that?  He said that it would be a good thing, while that measure is going through, to have men on local bodies with considerable experience of local government.  That, I take it, was the main point of his argument, but he did not even suggest how he is going to make use of that experience, or what voice local councillors will have in framing the proposals which he is going to bring in. He has not said that they will have any voice.  He has not shown how it will be more advantageous to have men on public bodies who were there for the past three years and among whom, according to the Minister for Finance, there are a considerable number of windbags than to have a new election this June, when the windbags might be eliminated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether a fresh windbag is any better than an old windbag.  I cannot see why the ordinary practice should be interfered with in order that the men in office, while this measure would be going through, would be men with a certain amount of experience, when they cannot and will not be availed <Col N="1552" /> of to any great extent, so far as one can see.  I suggest that there will be no difficulty in putting through proposals within the next three years and fixing the appointed day in June, 1934.  That point was mentioned by Deputy Hogan and it seems to me to be a practical and sensible thing to do.  There is certainly no point in postponing the elections because we are going to have a new system of local government.  There is nothing, so far as I can see, to prevent a scheme being submitted, put through this House and becoming operative from, say, 1st June, 1934, when you could have your new elections under the new system.  I can see no point in postponing the elections except that it saves money.  That, however, would be an argument for postponing all elections, for wiping out county councils and even the Dáil itself.  I think that it was an undemocratic action on the part of the Minister to bring in this measure.  It certainly is not wise, because it gives the people an idea that they have no voice in things.  That has been done more than once and the idea has got about among the people that the party in power can postpone elections and, if necessary, bring in a Bill to double the life of the Dáil and to extend the period of government.  That could be done and as good a case could be made out for it as for this Bill.  This Bill is simply taking away that sense of responsibility which we all join in trying to inculcate amongst our people, and I certainly will oppose this measure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Some Deputies seemed to have difficulty in finding a reason for the introduction of this Bill. Personally I find none, because I am aware that there is very keen competition between members of the Executive Council as to who will be responsible for the introduction of the greatest number of nonsensical Bills within twelve months.  There is competition, for instance, between the Minister for External Affairs, who looks for the exemption of certain classes of Port wine from duty; the Minister for Local Government, who introduces some other nonsensical Bills, and <Col N="1553" /> also the Minister for Justice who introduces a Bill for giving three hours' relief to the publicans in twelve months.  The time of the Dáil is, in fact, occupied in considering nonsensical Bills introduced by gentlemen opposite.  This measure is part of the competition amongst Ministers. I am prepared to admit that in this instance the Minister has another reason.  I think that anyone who has any experience of public bodies will admit that I hit upon the right reason for it when I say that, just as constant dropping wears a stone, constant pounding by the Minister for Local Government and his officials on the heads of unfortunate councillors for a number of years makes them more or less tame.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister has his birds fairly tame he likes to keep them there and to play with them.  When a new body starts in office the Minister start pounding again, and says: &ldquo;You shall not do this, you must do the other thing.&rdquo;  That is the whole difficulty which I see about the Minister and, in my opinion, the principal reason that he has introduced this Bill is that he considers that he will have less trouble in running the local bodies when he is certain that a certain number of county councillors will be walloped into submission, pounded into it.  The Minister has shown very great contempt for these people while he was getting them tamed.  I remember hearing the Minister a short time ago&mdash; I think it was on our de-rating proposals&mdash;allude to the county councils who adjourned the striking of the rates as disreputable councils.  Then he came at the tame boys who struck the rate and he saddled them with extra expense because they carried out his instructions.  I can quite understand Deputy Shaw's anxiety to keep a little longer in the public eye.  The poor man knows that he has been found out and that he will be dropped as soon as the people have an opportunity of dropping him.  As I said, I quite appreciate his anxiety to have the elections postponed and I sympathise with him.  I think that the time of the Dáil would be better occupied than in paying draftsmen to draft <Col N="1554" /> fourteen sections of a nonsensical Bill like this.  The Minister should consider the public purse a little more and should find better use for civil servants than getting them to draft nonsensical Bills.  As to the arguments of Deputy Shaw and Deputy Wolfe, the same arguments could be, and probably will be, used to-morrow or afterwards to extend the life of the Dáil by those who know that they have no chance of getting back.</P>

      <P>The very same proposal probably will be introduced in respect to the Dáil, because the Minister and the Executive Council have found out from all those whom they could collect at the Cumann na nGaedheal meeting a few weeks ago what the country thinks of them.  I am afraid they gave the verdict that the time is not a very good one for an election, that it would be much better postponed, and I am afraid that decision is working in their minds.  I cannot see any sane reason for this Bill.  If there was any idea in the Minister's mind to postpone the elections until 1934, then the three years' office for the new council would be up.  If it is going to take the collective wisdom of the Minister's Department all that time to hammer out a new local government scheme, I can guarantee him that he will not be here as Minister to see it through.</P>

      <P>I should like to say that in introducing this Bill the Minister is voicing the opinion of the people in County Leitrim.  There was a county council election held in Leitrim three years ago, and in some of the divisions the elections were not contested at all. In other divisions the people found it very hard to get candidates to make a contest.  I believe that on this occasion we would have the same state of affairs.  By postponing the elections you are saving the ratepayers the money voted for the elections.  I honestly believe that it is the view of <Col N="1555" /> the people that the councils should be allowed to remain as they are.  I believe that is the view of Deputy Corry and other Deputies, and that an election once every six years would be sufficient.</P>

      <P>I do not know anything about that but I am quite sure that in the case of county councils an election once every six years is quite sufficient.  I am sure that Deputy Kennedy who has considerable experience on public boards would agree that it is not fair to the ratepayers to hold elections every three years.  It is not fair to the county councils that an election should be forced on them every three years.  With regard to the election of county council chairmen, the election of chairmen takes place in June.  They should have one year's experience at least before the Eucharistic Congress is held, and I think it is wise that they should not be asked to elect a new chairman this year.  I quite agree with the Minister in his proposal to postpone the elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear from the few speeches we have heard now that county councillors, who are also members of Cumann na nGaedheal, are extremely anxious that the life of the county councils should be extended. Deputy Shaw and Deputy Reynolds, who are also county councillors, are very anxious that they should have another two or three years which the electors did not give them when they were first elected.  I notice, on the other hand, that members of Fianna Fáil and of the Labour Party are anxious that the electorate should have a chance of putting them back or not as they think fit.  That at least shows that members of the Fianna Fáil and Labour Parties are not as much afraid of the electorate as the Cumann na nGaedheal Party is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That might be the reason why the Bill was introduced.  Why should it be necessary to provide in this Bill that elections may not take place until <Col N="1556" /> 1934, three years hence?  Why should the Minister or the Executive Council require three years to make these changes, which, we understood from the Budget speech, were already decided upon?  The Minister for Finance, in his speech on the Budget, spoke of decisions on the question of local government, and we understood that they had decided even on the details of the Bill which they meant to introduce. He spoke of cutting down the number of members of the councils. He spoke about a modified system of management somewhat on the lines of the Cork and Dublin councils. Surely when the Minister for Finance was able to speak in that strain the plans must have been already decided upon by the Executive Council.  Why should they require three years to put these plans into operation?</P>
    <P>If the Minister had brought forward a Bill asking for a six months extension there might be some reason for it, but to ask for a three years extension is absolutely ridiculous, and no case can be made for it.  Deputy O'Connell said that the same case might be made for an extension of the life of the Dáil, and for all we know the same case will be made. As a matter of fact, I believe that Ministers on occasions during the past twelve months have been giving hints in various places that if there was a demand from the people that the life of the present Dáil should be extended, it would be welcomed by the Executive Council.  A Parliamentary Secretary, in making a speech in Tipperary last Sunday, as reported in the &ldquo;Cork Examiner,&rdquo; said that he did not wish the people to think because he appeared there, that there was a general election in the offing. Evidently he did not appear there very often, and he thought the people might misunderstand his visit.  Well, he did not wish them to understand that a general election was in the offing.  &ldquo;He for one hoped there was not.&rdquo;  I think that hope of the Parliamentary Secretary is also the hope of Deputy Shaw and Deputy Reynolds in their respective councils.  They hope that there is not going to be a local election in the offing either.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Fortunately or unfortunately I would not have to face the electors in the case of a county council election.  As I have stated already, members of our Party who are members of county councils have clearly expressed the view that they are not afraid to face the electors next June, which is the time at which these elections should be held.  I think it is altogether unfair to the electors to extend the life of the councils for another three years, because they were not told at the time they were electing these councils that they were electing them for four or five years, or for any period longer than three years.  Deputy Reynolds has mentioned that in some districts in Leitrim there were no contests on the last occasion, because only the number of candidates required to fill the vacancies were put up. Surely that does not prove that the same thing would occur again?  If it did occur again, it would show that they were satisfied with those whom they elected the last time, but in 90 per cent. of the areas at least in which there were contents the last time there would be contents this time.</P>
      <P>In all probability changes will be made.  The electors who would elect those county councils would be fully represented if elections were held in June, as they should be.  I do not know that the Minister has made any case whatsoever for this Bill as it stands.  Perhaps in reply he will try and improve on the case he made on the introduction.</P>

Firstly we stand here for keeping party politics, as much as possible, out of local government administration. Secondly, I think it too much to ask the ratepayers of this country to pay £30,000 this year for the purpose <Col N="1558" /> of saying, a little beforehand, what they think of Fianna Fáil or Labour.</P>

      <P>They will get an opportunity of seeing what kind of representatives they want to carry on local government long before 1934.  I hope Deputies, on the far side, will have got out of thinking by that time that they will do themselves or the country any good by contesting local government elections on a political party programme.</P>
      <P>Deputy Walsh finds a weakness in my case on this subject.  It is weak because I come forward and make a businesslike proposition.  We have said that we intend to put proposals before the Oireachtas for changing the machinery for local government administration.  We have said that we propose to put these proposals before the House at an early date.  Deputy O'Kelly says that even in these circumstances, to introduce a measure like this, postponing the local elections, is a wastage of time and a wastage of money.  He thinks, on the other hand, that it is no harm to waste the money of the ratepayers in holding an election for the purpose of setting up bodies that might last, say, for not more than eighteen months.  He thinks that it is a waste of time to say the few words necessary on this measure.  He thinks nothing of the waste of time we would ask representatives of local bodies to undertake in the conducting of elections throughout the country, urban and county councils, for a period of office that might not last more than eighteen months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1559" /> Deputy Hogan thinks we are not acting according to the will of the people.  We are going on our own instinct and our own information on that matter, and I think we are meeting the general wishes of the ratepayers of the local government electorate, and the general wishes of those who are working to-day on local bodies, in asking the House to pass legislation that will make it unnecessary to have elections in June.  We are putting down 1934 as the period for the postponement of the elections, simply in order to put down a date at the end of the next three years' period. I do not want to enter into a proviso with regard to when it may be possible to bring about the position which the proposed legislation with regard to <Col N="1560" /> local government proposes, but it is not the intention to postpone the introduction of that measure for, say, two years or anything like it.  It is proposed to bring it in at the earliest and most convenient time for the Oireachtas to discuss it.  The only thing the House is called on to decide here is, anticipating that new machinery of local government will be proposed, and put into operation in eighteen months or two years, whether you are going to ask those at present carrying on local government administration to stand the expense to themselves and the expense to the ratepayers of carrying out local government elections this year.  On this side of the House we do not think it is reasonable to ask that that should be done.</P>

      <P>That the Dáil agree with the Committee in Resolution No. 1.</P>
      <P>(1)  That income tax shall be charged for the year beginning on the 6th day of April, 1931, at the rate of three shillings in the pound.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Dáil agree with the Committee in Resolution No. 2.</P>
      <P>2.&mdash;(1)  That a customs duty at the rate of fourpence per gallon shall be charged, levied and paid on all hydrocarbon light oils imported into Saorstát Eireann on or after the 7th day of May, 1931, and on all hydrocarbon light oils imported into Saorstát Eireann before the 7th day of May, 1931, and landed in Saorstát Eireann on or after that date.</P>
      <P>(2)  That for the purposes of this Resolution the expression &ldquo;hydrocarbon light oils&rdquo; means hydrocarbon oils of which not less than fifty per cent. by volume distils at a temperature not exceeding 185 degrees centigrade, or of which not less than ninety-five per cent. by volume distils at a temperature not exceeding 240 degrees centigrade, or which give off an inflammable vapour at a temperature of less than 22.8 degrees centigrade when tested in the manner prescribed by the Acts relating to petroleum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The method of testing oils for the purpose of ascertaining whether they comply with the provisions of this paragraph relating to the distillation of a certain volume thereof at a certain temperature shall be such as <Col N="1563" /> the Revenue Commissioners may prescribe.</P>
    <P>(3)  A drawback equal to the amount of the duty shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners to have been paid in respect of the goods in question shall be allowed on the exportation from Saorstát Eireann or the shipment or deposit in a bonded warehouse for use as ships' stores of any hydrocarbon light oils, or of any article in which there is contained any hydrocarbon light oil which was used as an ingredient in the manufacture or preparation thereof, and on the loading into any aircraft of any such oils or articles for use on a voyage to a place outside Saorstát Eireann.</P>
    <P>(4)  That the following provisions shall have effect with respect to the duty and to the drawback mentioned in this Resolution, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the provisions of Section 98 of the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, which relate to the charging of duty on the quantity of goods ascertained by weight, measure or strength at the time of actual delivery thereof, shall apply to hydrocarbon light oils when cleared from a warehouse for home use as they apply to the specially excepted goods mentioned in the said Section 98;</P>
    <P>(b)  subject to compliance with such conditions as to security for the re-exportation of the goods as the Revenue Commissioners may impose, the duty shall not be chargeable in respect of hydrocarbon light oils imported for exportation after transit through Saorstát Eireann or by way of transhipment;</P>
    <P>(c)  the Revenue Commissioners may in relation to any goods in respect of which the drawback is payable, relax as they may think fit any provisions contained in the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, or in any enactment amending that Act, with respect to the giving of security or entry before shipment;</P>
    <P>(d)  if any person for the purpose of obtaining any repayment of the <Col N="1564" /> duty makes or causes to be made any statement or representation which is untrue in any material particular, he shall be liable at the election of the Revenue Commissioners either to a customs penalty equal to treble the value of the goods (including duty) or to a customs penalty of one hundred pounds and the goods in respect of which the offence is committed shall be forfeited.</P>
    <P>(5)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    <P>I would just say in connection with the Resolution that under the section of the Bill it is proposed to introduce a provision that will exempt turpentine, which is at present charged with this particular duty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some points arising out of this Resolution that I would like the Minister to clear up.  In his Budget statement the Minister stated that the retail price of petrol in this country was higher than in Great Britain, allowing for the duty to be added.  This higher price is due, it is said, to the cost of distribution.  Some time ago I addressed a Parliamentary question to the President of the Executive Council, inquiring if the Government had taken any action with a view to securing a reduction in the price of petrol here, in consequence of the higher charges in the Twenty-Six Counties than in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  I was informed by the President that representations were being made to the oil companies in the matter.  Some time later I addressed another question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce for the purpose of discovering the result of these representations.  The Minister stated that an attempt had been made by the oil companies to justify the difference in price on the ground that distribution costs were higher in the Free State than in Northern Ireland or in Great Britain.  He added, however, that he was not satisfied that the difference was justified on the grounds <Col N="1565" /> advanced by the oil companies.  He also added that he was prepared to consider the control of petrol prices under certain conditions.  Since these questions were asked in the House some readjustment of prices has taken place, but allowing for the duty the price of petrol is still higher here than in Great Britain or in Northern Ireland, and from what inquiries I have been able to make I cannot find that there is any justification whatever for it.  I cannot see how the cost of distributing petrol in Dublin, for example, could be higher than the cost of distributing petrol in Belfast.  I think if the Government took up the question with the oil companies with sufficient vigour they would be able to secure a further reduction in the price here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his Budget speech spoke as follows: &ldquo;This levy will only bring the import price of petrol up to the level at which it stood four or five years ago.  In view of the present relative levels of wholesale and retail prices it ought not to be necessary for the whole of the duty to be passed on to the public.&rdquo;  I would like if the Minister would tell us exactly what he meant by that.  The Minister is, no doubt, aware that the price at which the retailers sell petrol is fixed for them by the oil companies.  They are under contract to sell at a fixed price, and if they fail to do so they are liable to have their supplies stopped.  Cases have arisen in which supplies have been stopped.  Is it the Minister's view that the profits made by the retailers are too high and should be reduced?  It has been stated in the Press&mdash;I do not know whether it is true or not&mdash;that the profit on petrol sold to commercial users is only 2d. per gallon, and to ordinary users 3d. per gallon.  The implication in the Minister's statement was that the wholesalers of petrol were making only reasonable profits, and that a certain amount of profiteering was being engaged in by the retailers.  Is that exactly what he meant, or what exactly did he intend to convey to the House when he expressed the hope that the price of petrol would not be increased by the additional amount of the tax? As he knows now, his hope has not <Col N="1566" /> been realised.  The price has been increased to the consumer by the full amount of the tax.</P>
    <P>I would be glad also if the Minister would tell us what arrangement it is intended to make for collecting the tax on petrol coming in in tanks of motors from Northern Ireland, or if any arrangement will be made for giving a rebate on petrol exported in the tanks of motors going into Northern Ireland.  Is it intended to subject such petrol to a tax at all? We would like to know what arrangement the Minister intends to make to deal with petrol which is imported or exported in that manner.</P>

      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say that he did not intend to press the tax on turpentine because since the proposal was put forward in the House I have had a large number of complaints from different bodies who use commodities containing turpentine. I am satisfied that if it had been included it would have added a great deal of delay and irritation to those engaged in industry.  There is one other commodity which is being stopped by the customs and that I would like to have some information about.  Heretofore supplies of printers' ink have been admitted free, but within the last few days a large consignment of this particular commodity has been stopped by the customs.  I would be glad to know from the Minister the reason why that was stopped, and if it has been stopped for analysis would it not have been possible to take a small quantity for the purpose instead of holding up a whole consignment?  Possibly, the Minister could give us some information on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesSprouleMyles" hpid="Major Myles Major Myles">
      <NameTxt>Major Myles</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the great inconvenience caused, particularly along the Northern border, through the stopping of goods in the line of paints and oils, even down as far as boot polish, for the purpose of analysis, to find out how much petrol spirit or hydrocarbon oil, which is the technical name for it, let us say which boot polish contains.  Even printers' ink is being held up.  I can see no reason <Col N="1567" /> why the following articles should be held up: paints, varnishes, enamel lacquers and the like; embrocation and liniments, liquid adhesive rubber solution, tyre solution; metal polish, boot polish, floor polish; printers' ink and insecticides of all kinds.  Perhaps some of us did not look into things as closely as we should have done when we passed the tax on petrol.  When we passed the tax we did not realise that we were passing it on a variety of commodities.  The list I have given you is a list of things of which hydrocarbon oil forms a part.  Here is a further list: light petroleum ether, motor spirit, white spirit and special solvent; benzol, joluol, xylol, solvent naphthas; mineral naphthas, vaporising oil, light oil from coal, light oil from shale, light oil from tar, and light oil from Bergins' process; turpentine, resin spirit and mixtures of these. The ordinary people in the rest of Ireland do not meet these difficulties. I have seen quite recently the hopeless confusion that exists and I am afraid it will continue to exist over things which contain even one drop of hydrocarbon oil.  To have these sent for analysis is hopeless from the point of view of people who want to get business done.  There was an Act passed some twenty or thirty years ago whereby all these articles that I have mentioned were taken in, due to the fact that they have a proportion of spirit.  It is up to the Minister to delete such a provision from the Bill. The Dáil never intended, so far as I could see, to put a tax on all these things.  It was intended to tax motor spirit and nothing else.  I think this is making a laughing stock of the whole thing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJamesCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if it is intended to allow petrol for agricultural purposes to be imported free of tax.  During the war time petrol used for agricultural purposes was not taxed, and the same consideration should be given now to any petrol used for agricultural purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>After the speech of Deputy Major Myles I take it that tomorrow morning the &ldquo;Irish Times&rdquo;<Col N="1568" /> will come out with its usual leading article: &ldquo;An Infliction.  As long as the petrol tax remains in existence the door is banged and barred in the face of the North,&rdquo; in the same way as they brought out an issue some time ago stating that as long as vice is prohibited in the Irish Free State the door is banged and barred in the face of the North.  The Minister told us on the last occasion that turpentine was included and he has now been good enough to tell us that turpentine is excluded.  That is an announcement which I think we will all welcome because turpentine does enter largely into certain manufactures.  The Minister, I think in error on the last occasion, told us that white spirit did not enter into this particular case, that white spirit was not covered by this tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a point we want to get at.  White spirit enters into certain industries, and I understand that it was not intended that the tax should hit this particular industry, and I also understand that the Minister and his Department have been engaged in investigating how that particular difficulty could be got over.  I am going on the assumption that it is the intention of the Minister to find machinery by which this tax would not be imposed in certain cases&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in the case of white spirit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it intended then that white spirit which is used in polish and other things manufactured in the Free State should be liable to that tax?  If so, I think that that is a mistake and it is one that ought and could be easily remedied.  It is one of those difficulties that we had in relation to the flour tariff when it was a question of the exemption of flour in the case of Messrs. Jacob, or, in other words, giving them a licence to import flour. It was said that it was impossible to deal with the matter, but when it came down to brass tacks there was a means of dealing with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I understand there is a perfectly simple means of dealing with white spirit in relation to these <Col N="1569" /> industries.  A licence can be given for the importation of white spirit to every particular industry which is using it for manufacturing purposes in exactly the same way as in relation to Messrs. Fords in Cork, we decided that tractor parts imported for the use of tractors manufactured here should be free.  You had exactly the same case in relation to the constituents of soap.  Ordinary washing soda was held up as one of the possible constituents of soap when that particular tax was put on, but arrangements were made by which the manufacturers were able to import the stuff under licence, and I think it was clear of that tax.  Between now and the Finance Bill it might be definitely excluded.</P>
    <P>I am going to ask the Minister again to consider whether some simple machinery cannot be devised to prevent Irish trade being hit by this particular tax.  After the petrol tax I am in the unfortunate position of having received a certain amount of undue and improper popularity, due to the misreporting of a speech of mine. As I do not want to sail under false colours, I would like to put the matter right.  It was stated that I said that there was no reason and no justification whatever for the petrol tax. There is no technical justification whatever for any tax which is a tax upon the instruments of production in the process of production.  That is a very different thing, however, from saying that there is no justification for a tax, say, on petrol used for pleasure motoring or anything of that kind.  I think you have got to separate this tax into its different constituents and take them separately.  There are a considerable number of millions of gallons of petrol used in purely industrial processes in this country. The Minister for Industry and Commerce was good enough to supply me with the figures from the last census of production.  Unfortunately I do not happen to have them with me. Petrol is evidently used in a considerable number of processes.  I recollect that in the case of creameries, for instance, it would cost them between £3,000 and £5,000 a year.  It is <Col N="1570" /> quite obvious that a tax on petrol used for purely industrial purposes, is, on the face of it, wrong, unless you are prepared to say that you will tax other constituents of production. To get revenue from other constituents of production in the process of production would be quite unreasonable.  It would be just as reasonable, as I said, to tax coal, lubricating oil, or anything of that kind which is the raw material of production.  The Minister himself has, in relation to barley, yeast, and things of that kind, refused to put on a tax, on precisely that ground, that he would be taxing a raw material in the process of production.</P>
    <P>That is the first case.  The second case is where petrol is used for industrial transport.  To tax transport for the purpose of revenue is also to tax one of the processes of production.  You are simply putting up the cost of production in the country to the extent to which you tax motor lorries, or to the extent to which you tax any passenger vehicle which is carrying people on ordinary occasions for commercial work.  Therefore, it seems to me that logically, assuming one was simply looking at this as a broad question of principle, you would have to say that you would not tax industrial petrol used for motor power, and you would not tax petrol which was used for ordinary commercial transport, while you would be entitled to tax pleasure motoring petrol to any extent which was electorally desirable.  Against that we have to put the fact that a certain proportion of this tax, in so far as it going specifically for the purpose of derating, is going into the possession of authorities who are now spending money upon the maintenance of roads. To the extent to which that money is going through the rating authority for the replacement of damage to the roads used by vehicles in the course of their commercial operations, or to the extent to which it is financing the capital cost of the improved roads required in order to carry heavy motor transport, it is as logically justifiable and as logically desirable as upon the mere ground of tax revenue it is undesirable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1571" /> I have not been able to get sufficiently exact figures to enable me to say how much of the money which will go to the road maintenance authority from the petrol tax would be replacement tax.  The difficulty is to estimate what amount of damage is done by particular vehicles.  My own belief is that the amount of damage done to a good road by an ordinary motor car is practically nil.  Some surveyors have told me that the use of properly driven light motor cars upon good roads is an actual improvement to the roads, and I, personally, am inclined to agree with them.  So that the replacement tax, as far as light motor vehicles are concerned, would be nil.  But against that the Government are entitled, in my opinion, to get from vehicles of that kind such revenue as is otherwise desirable, while the damage from heavy lorries goes up geometrically with the badness of the road.  In so far as the local authorities are concerned, the money which they get from the petrol tax will be used, as far as it is used on the roads, very largely upon those bye-roads which, to the extent to which they are used at all by heavy lorries, are more grievously damaged by them. It would seem that a considerable proportion of the actual petrol tax may represent replacement.</P>
    <P>We are not in a position to reduce this to a mathematical formula, but there is a case, I think, on balance, for the tax itself.  The real objection to it is the objection to all additional taxes.  In my opinion, it was unnecessary. If I were asked to judge the petrol tax as a tax alternative to some other tax, there seems to be a considerable case for it compared with some existing taxes.  My difficulty in accepting the tax is not that it is not an alternative tax, but that it is an additional tax, and I am very strongly of opinion that the best benefit that we can give to any portion of the community at present by taxation is to leave it in the pockets of the people themselves.  We have seen the thing operating more or less exactly in relation to the sugar tax.  We can trace it in certain ways here in the petrol <Col N="1572" /> tax, and, in my opinion, where we can benefit the people most is, either by getting better value for the existing amount of tax which we get, or by reducing the amount of the proportion of the total revenue of the State which we take out of the pockets of the people and use for administrative purposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister replies, I should like to know whether he is satisfied that he took sufficient precautions against forestalling before introducing the Budget.  It is stated that an enormous amount of petrol came into the country for some time before this tax was imposed.  It should have been possible for the Minister to take stock of the amount of petrol held by the distributing companies even after the Budget was introduced, because they are the people who are supposed to have got the big profit out of this.  The retailers were not in a position to make big profits because, although they were asked by the distributors to charge the price of the petrol plus the tax immediately after the tax was introduced, they say that they were only making up for the loss which they had to bear during the recent fall in the price of petrol.  During the last six or twelve months there were various reductions made in the price of petrol, and each time a reduction was made the petrol they had in stock was subject to that fall and they had a certain loss.  Even though they increased the price when the tax was introduced, they say they were only making up for that loss.  The big distributing companies did make a profit and it should be possible to collect the tax on what they had in stock.  We are also told that a large number of private car owners got in large stocks of petrol before the tax was introduced. I suppose they are not to blame for trying to take advantage of the tax when they were fairly certain that it was going to be imposed.  They were, however, doing a very dangerous thing in keeping large stocks of petrol in private houses and garages, and they were also committing an illegal act, because, as the law stands, I believe a <Col N="1573" /> private owner is only allowed to stock a certain amount of petrol.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister is satisfied that he could not have dealt with this question of the petrol tax in a way which would be fairer to the revenue, to retailers and to private owners.</P>
      <P>It would appear from the way the thing worked out that the only people who got big profits out of the tax were the distributing companies, and these distributing companies could be dealt with quite easily by the Revenue authorities, or somebody else taking stock of what they had on hands.  I would also like to know from the Minister what is the position with regard to paraffin.  It is a thing the people in the country are very much interested in.  I would like to know whether a tax is to be imposed on paraffin, and if not, how the distinction is to be made, and what the regulations will be with regard to the selling of paraffin as well as petrol.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lemass made certain points about prices.  I have nothing to say in addition to the remarks I made on the Budget statement except just this: That the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who has been dealing with the matter, and whom I consulted before the introduction of the Budget, was of opinion that, although the retail price had been reduced it had not been reduced as much as it ought to have been.  He is taking up with the importing companies the question of a further reduction in the price of petrol, which, he is of opinion, having all the facts that it was possible to gather before him, is due.</P>
      <P>No notice will be taken of petrol in the tanks of cars coming from Northern Ireland into the Saorstát, or in the tanks of cars leaving the Saorstát and going into Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Good asked why printers' ink had been held up.  It was held up under Section 7 of the Finance Act of 1901, which prescribes that when a tax is imposed upon a particular article all articles containing that commodity are liable to be taxed, so <Col N="1574" /> that in that way printers' ink would be held up for examination.  In the great majority of cases, printers' ink will be found to be free of duty, but, of course in the first instance it would have to be examined.  Later on no difficulty would occur because it would be established pretty well what brands of printers' ink were dutiable, and what were not.  It would be possible for all the people concerned in the importation of the goods to which Deputy Myles refers, to pay a deposit and to have their goods released.  In the case of any goods found not to be dutiable the amount of the deposit would be refunded.  What, in effect, Deputy Myles asked for is that, in respect of petrol, Section 7 of the Act of 1901 should not apply.  That is a possible solution, but it would require some more consideration than I have so far been able to give it.  It may be that there is no duty involved, and it may be that it would be possible to carry out a corresponding change in respect of petrol or white spirit used definitely in the manufacture of any of these goods by way of letting the manufacturer be supplied free of duty.  That would depend largely I think upon the number of manufacturers, and the possibility of administering the matter without undue charge.</P>
    <P>It would not be possible, for instance, to allow paints which contain white spirit, or any article which contains white spirit or petrol, in duty free, if the Saorstát manufacturer had to use a duty paid white spirit or petrol in the manufacture of his goods.  If we are going to make any change in the application of Section 7 of the Act of 1901 it will be necessary to arrange that the Saorstát manufacturers of competing articles should get their amount free.  Whether that could be done or not will really depend upon the number, and the possibility of controlling the supplies of duty free spirit to them without increasing too much the expense.  That is a matter upon which no decision has yet been made.</P>
    <P>As regards turpentine the matter was relatively easy.  It was found that no substantial difficulty would arise in <Col N="1575" /> connection with the exception of turpentine itself and articles containing turpentine from the scope of the duty. There are certain additional difficulties in the case of white spirit.</P>
    <P>In Great Britain although great efforts have been made to induce the Government to exempt white spirit it has been steadily refused.  Of course we could not exempt white spirit entirely because that would cause the tax to break down, but the admission of white spirit for manufacturers engaged in the production of certain articles is a matter that is being considered and no decision has yet been taken.  I do not think it would be possible to agree to admit petrol for agricultural purposes free of duty, because we would be immediately up against the difficulties of rebates and administrative costs and the difficulties would be too great.  Of course certain other users would make a case and, as the exemptions were extended the difficulties would increase.</P>
    <P>Then with regard to forestalling I do not think that there was any very serious forestalling.  Undoubtedly there was a certain excess of imports of petrol, and a good number of people did anticipate the imposition of a tax on petrol and laid in some stock.  It is even said that private people bought stocks and laid them in, but I do not think that the excess imports of petrol were on a large scale.  So far as any figures that had been submitted to me go they do not show it was on a serious scale.  Nearly any duty unless a duty imposed without any expectation of its being on the way, leads to a certain amount of forestalling.  I do not think anything could be done in the matter.</P>

      <P>Might I point out that the Minister has ignored the serious point raised by Deputy Dr. Ryan, namely, that he has completely neglected to enforce the regulations regarding the storage of petrol, a fact which in many parts of the country is viewed with much alarm?  Forestalling has led to the storage of petrol in dwelling houses and all sorts of places, a proceeding which is very dangerous to life and property.  The least the Minister might have said was that he would bring the matter to the notice of the Minister for Justice.  There are strict conditions laid down in regard to the storage of petrol but they have been completely ignored during the last few weeks and no notice has been taken of that fact by the Civic Guards.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to detain the House on this Resolution because the matter will probably be argued more fully on the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill.  I only desire to say that our opposition to the tax has not abated in any way and we are more strongly convinced than ever that it is unjust, unfair, and should not be imposed, particularly having regard to the excuse given for its imposition, namely, to provide relief for the farming community.  The tax will undoubtedly bear heavily on the poorer and smaller farmers and for that reason we propose, rather than argue the matter in detail now, to divide on the Resolution.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister say if it is necessary to give to revenue officers the very extended powers proposed to be given to them under Section 4?  It seems to me that the Resolution is very wide.  It proposes to authorise any officer at any time to enter any premises in which there is, or is believed by such officer to be, any sugar chargeable with any of the said duties and inspect and take copies of or extracts from and if he thinks fit for that purpose take away any books, accounts, letters, etc.  It seems to me to give officers almost unlimited powers.  It is hard to see why such powers are necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Dáil agree with the Committee in the following Resolution:&mdash;</P>
      <P>4.&mdash;(1)  That in lieu of the duties of customs chargeable under Section 15 of the Finance Act, 1924 (No. 27 of 1924), as amended by Section 25 of the Finance Act, 1925 (No. 28 of 1925), Section 15 of the Finance Act, 1926 (No. 35 of 1926), and Section 20 of the Finance Act, 1928 (No. 11 of 1928), there shall be charged, levied and paid on all sugar confectionery imported into Saorstát Eireann on or after the 7th day of May, 1931, a customs duty at the rate of four and four-fifths pence on the pound, in addition to any duty which may be chargeable in respect of any spirits or saccharin contained in such sugar confectionery but in lieu of any duty which might otherwise be chargeable on any other ingredient contained in such sugar confectionery.</P>
      <P>(2)  That in the case of fruit (not liable to duty as fruit) in syrup, containing not more than thirty-three and one-third per cent. of sweetening matter and imported in sealed tins or cans, the duty mentioned in this Resolution shall be charged and levied at the reduced rate of twopence on the pound in lieu of the full rate of four and four-fifths pence.</P>
      <P>(3)  That in this Resolution the expression &ldquo;sugar confectionery&rdquo; means confectionery made from or containing sugar or other sweetening matter and not containing cocoa, and includes breads, biscuits, cakes, cake mixtures, puddings and powders (other than medicinal powders) sweetened with sugar or other sweetening matter, and not containing cocoa, and also sweetmeats, jams, marmalades, and jellies not containing cocoa, and also peels and fruits candied, crystallised or otherwise preserved with sugar or any other sweetening matter, and not containing cocoa but does not include ginger preserved in syrup imported into Saorstát Eireann in wooden barrels or casks of a capacity of not less than one hundredweight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)  That the provisions of Section <Col N="1588" /> 8 of the Finance Act, 1919, shall apply to the duty mentioned in this Resolution with the substitution of the expression &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; for the expression &ldquo;Great Britain and Ireland,&rdquo; and as though sugar confectionery as defined in this Resolution were included in the Second Schedule to that Act in the list of goods to which five-sixths of the full rate is made applicable as a preferential rate.</P>
    <P>(5)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    <P>In the debate on the previous Bill there was a certain amount of discussion about the tax as applicable to tinned fruits.  I am prepared to alter the provisions in the Bill so that the tax on tinned fruit will remain as it was before the introduction of this Resolution.</P>

      <P>Fruit syrup containing more than ten per cent. but not more than fifteen per cent. of sweetening matter &mdash;One shilling and eightpence per cwt.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1589" /> I felt there was a strong case, as the Minister has admitted, in regard to tinned fruits.  Even leaving the duty as it was, it is I think rather unfair owing to the circumstances, because if this duty is to be put on at all, it is put on because of the sugar content.  I assume that is the reason. If the fruit came in without being in the tin, there would be no tax on it. Therefore, the tax was put on because of the sugar content in the syrup.  If that is so I think that the tax should be according to the sugar content and the tax would be very much smaller indeed, even than what it was, leaving it on the existing basis before this new tax was put on.  The Minister made this change to a flat rate. Up to 1924, as the Minister knows, the tax was according to the sugar content but in 1924 the change was made. The plea was that at that time, by making a flat rate the necessity for opening tins and examining them, to find out what the sugar content of each particular class of tin was, would be obviated.</P>
    <P>I am informed by those connected with the trade that there has been no change whatever in the practice in regard to the opening and examination of tins.  One important firm engaged in the business state that &ldquo;going over our records we find that the Customs have been opening the same percentage of tins since the 1924 Budget as previous to that year.&rdquo;  That statement is made by a responsible company who are engaged in the importation of tinned fruit in a very large way.  If that is the position, nothing has been gained from the administrative point of view, or from the point of view of saving administrative costs, and a very heavy tax has been put on this article of food.</P>
    <P>This is an article of food which has become very common of late years.  It is a cheap and wholesome form of diet, especially to the working class family.  We know that home grown fruit is not very cheap, and is not always procurable, except at certain seasons.  I have figures to show the change since 1924.  There is one point the Minister should look into.  Tinned fruits are graded into four groups, <Col N="1590" /> according to the sugar content of the mixture in which they are bottled or contained.  It is that which contains the lowest percentage that is frequently used.  I am informed that something like 80 per cent. of the tinned fruit used is in this class known as seconds, which contains not more than 5 per cent. of sugar.  Before 1924 the tax on that particular grade of tinned fruits was 1/3 per cwt. and under the 1924 flat rate it was up to 11/2.  That was a very considerable increase.  In the highest grade called &ldquo;fancy,&rdquo; which contains not more than 20 per cent. of sugar the tax was 5/-; that also was put up to the flat rate of 11/2.  A very small quantity of that fancy class or grade is used in the Free State.  It might be regarded as a luxury article as compared with the lower grade.  Before 1924, the tax on the fancy grade was 5/1 and on the lower grade 1/3.  In 1924 the tax was made a flat rate of 11/2 all round. That is the figure it will remain at under the Minister's proposal.  I think that requires to be looked into.  In Northern Ireland and England at the present time the tax on the lower grade of tinned fruits is only at the rate of 7d. per cwt. and that is a very great difference indeed.  It is a very heavy tax, even standing at what it was before the present Budget tax.</P>
    <P>While I appeal to the Minister to look into the matter between this and the Finance Bill, and see if an arrangement cannot be made to continue the pre-1924 scheme whereby the tax was in proportion to the sugar, I suppose it is as much as I can hope for at this stage in view of the fact that he has agreed to leave things as they were with regard to tinned fruit.  I do not propose to press my amendment now, but I would ask him between this and the introduction of the Finance Bill to look into the whole matter to see whether this flat rate of tax on tinned fruits is a fair tax in the circumstances. We have it that there were one and a half millions or one and a quarter million tins imported last year.  This is not a protective tax because we have not any canning industry in the country so far as I know.  Therefore the tax has not the <Col N="1591" /> effect of a protective tariff.  I think the increase in 1924 was altogether too steep so far as the lower grades are concerned, and I think if there is any case for a tax the tax should be in proportion to the sugar content of the syrup.  As it is at present it is according the weight of the fruit.  I do not think that is fair in all the circumstances.  If the fruit were not in the syrup it would be brought in without any tax.  Not only is the sugar taxed, but also the fruit is taxed, and I ask the Minister to look into the whole matter to see if the adjustment can be made in the rates.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make it clear, speaking on my own behalf, that we cannot view this in the same simple way Deputy O'Connell views it. He says this is not a protective tariff. It is, to a certain extent.  After all we have to remember that these are foreign fruits which are being imported.  We have native fruit growers in this country and we have got to consider their interests.  A tariff on foreign fruit is just as justifiable as a tax on foreign boots, clothes or chocolate, and while a case is made for some discrimination as between the grades of canned fruit, I am not sure that a case is being made on behalf of the poor consumer rather than on behalf of the exceedingly rich and opulent companies engaged in this industry in the first place, and of those who are acting as importers and distributors. I do not know whether Armour and Company; Libby, McNeill and Libby, Angus Watson, or any other big concern who have issued circulars and a statement, the figures of which seem to agree with those Deputy O'Connell has put before the House, are entitled to very much consideration in this matter.  After all, if the tax were to be retained at the old rate would the remission be passed on to the consumer?  That is an aspect of the matter on which I have, at any rate, grave doubts.  This is very largely a monopoly business, and where a monopoly of that kind exists you <Col N="1592" /> may be certain that if any remission is made the whole of that remission will not go to the consumer.</P>
      <P>I think that to a certain extent we are not unsympathetic with the attitude which the Minister has indicated he is prepared to take up. We feel that if it is difficult to obtain home-grown fruit, which difficulty has been very largely created by the people whose names are appended to this circular.  Some of them are engaged, I believe, in the distribution of fresh fruits.  They, and those who are associated with the distribution of those fruits, have very largely crushed out the native grower.  First of all, they do not give him a price that remunerates him, and what they buy they are not disposed to sell at prices to suit the people of the city. In that way they have very largely killed fruit growing in this country. We on these benches are very doubtful of the whole thing.  We do not like the Minister's proposals, because we know that if we accept them the tax is going to be passed on to the consumer in exactly the same way as the tax on petrol has been passed on.  At the same time, we also feel that if we do urge a remission of the tax, we are going to put the native fruit grower at a further disadvantage as against these people. I personally feel that the Minister's suggestion to leave the tax at the old rate is one more or less acceptable to us, and we are going to leave it at that.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy MacEntee has put the matter very fairly.  It is hardly correct to say that this has no protective aspect.  Apart altogether from the question of fresh fruit, there is a certain fruit bottling industry here, and while the fruit bottling industry is not concerned with exactly the same fruit as those that come in in tins, nevertheless there is no doubt that the development of the industry which would help native fruit growers is prevented by the large importation of tinned fruit, so that the matter has, in fact, a certain protective aspect.  There is one other point.  I am afraid that <Col N="1593" /> the firm which stated that there has been no change in practice since 1924 in the matter of opening and sampling either had not normal experience or was not disclosing the full facts, because there has been a very considerable change.  Occasional tins are opened now to check the returns and to ascertain that they belong to the particular category, but the opening is very much less than before 1924. I will look over the whole matter again.  Generally, I think we should not do more than to leave the rate as it stood, and I think if Deputy O'Connell will examine it further, he will discover that the protective aspect is worthy of some consideration.</P>

    <P>(3)  That whenever the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that any cinematograph film imported into Saorstát Eireann is of an educational character they shall, subject to compliance with such conditions as they think fit to impose, exempt such film from payment (as the case require) of the duty on cinematograph films included in and not excepted from the new import duties mentioned in the first paragraph of this Resolution or of the duty mentioned in the second paragraph of this Resolution.</P>
    <P>(4)  That the provisions of Section 8 of the Finance Act, 1919, shall apply to all the duties mentioned in this Resolution with the substitution of the expression &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; for the expression &ldquo;Great Britain and Ireland&rdquo;.</P>

    <P>Since the introduction of the Resolution a certain number of representations have been made to me, and I would like to say to the Dáil that I feel so far as news films are concerned that a case seems to have been made at any rate for not charging the full <Col N="1596" /> new rate of 3d.  I think as far as news films are concerned they have a very short life, and that there is a case for allowing them to come in at the old rate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel in a difficulty too about this matter because I know that a certain case can be made for remitting the duty as far as news films are concerned, on the ground that they have a comparatively brief life.  But there is another aspect that I think should be taken into consideration, and that is the aspect of the orchestras and others formerly engaged in picture theatres.  If news films were not in the programme these would have to be made up in some other way, and they might possibly be made up by retaining the services of the orchestras for a short period, as was the custom in one picture theatre in the city.  That is the difficulty I find myself in.  I sympathise with the Minister in the difficulty he finds himself in, because it does seem rather inequitable to charge news films, which have a comparatively short life, this duty.  At the same time there is in addition to the point of view of the orchestras, the points of view of some of the audiences at picture theatres.  They occasionally find these news films very objectionable from some points of view, and there is a feeling amongst a considerable section that instead of the duty being 3d. a foot on certain pictures there would be no harm in putting a duty of 1s. per foot on them, in order to stop the exhibition of films that a very large section of the audience find objectionable even though they do not make themselves so ill-mannered as to voice those objections.  It is the other aspect of the matter that I would like the Minister to take into consideration.  I would particularly like him to consider carefully whether the elimination of the news films would not lead to the re-introduction of orchestras in picture theatres.  That is the important fact that should be taken into consideration in the whole of these Resolutions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening I was dealing with the very slow progress made by the Land Commission, first in the taking over of ranches, and secondly in the division of these ranches.  I gave a few cases to illustrate this.  I was dealing with the Pollock Estate.  In County Galway, so far as I can see, more than in any other county in Ireland, the question of the division of the land is a tough problem.  We have farms taken over by the Land Commission eight or ten years, and there has nothing been done in the matter of their division as yet.  If one goes round and examines the circumstances of some of the tenants around these ranches, and sees how they are situated, one sees the little bit of land they occupy, while somebody or other in their immediate neighbourhood has 300 or 400 acres of a ranch.  In one particular case to which I was called quite recently up in Clonfert, the average holding would be six or seven acres of low-lying land which is flooded nearly all the year round, and in the midst almost of such holdings there is one farm of 300 acres, another of 500 acres, and another of 1,700 acres.  First of all, the people with the six or seven acres pay £1 2s. 6d. an acre for their land&mdash;land that is no good to them during the winter months, and off which they cannot take any hay or grow any crops in the summer.  I would like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary what is being paid for the land all around these holdings, the large farms.  The estate I am referring to is the Samer Estate.  What is being paid for that? I believe that while the rent of the prime land is only 6s. or 7s. per acre, the poor people have to pay £1 2s. 6d. an acre for the rubbish that is left. That is one of the most disgraceful cases I have seen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked a question here recently about the Buston Estate.  It is flooded from one end of the year to the other, and the answer the Parliamentary Secretary gave me was that that was the first time he knew about it.  There are numbers of Land Commission officials paid out of the public moneys to go and investigate those things, and <Col N="1608" /> it should not be my duty to go and bring it up here or anywhere else. These people are paid for doing that work, but they are not doing it.</P>
    <P>Yet in spite of all that, if these occupiers refuse to pay a half year's annuity that they are unable to get out of the land, the sheriff walks in there almost at once and takes away whatever stock there is on the land. That side of the question is not overlooked for six months.  There is no sympathy in that direction for these people.  I would like if the Parliamentary Secretary when replying would tell us what his policy is in regard to men selling farms of 80 or 100 or 120 acres in congested areas where the people have no more than three or four acres of land, some of them not that much at all.  I would like to know why the Land Commission do not step in and take over those farms if they are out to relieve congestion.  There was one farm sold quite recently; I asked a question about it a month before it was sold. It belonged to Mr. Garvey in North Galway.  Nothing was done by the Land Commission about it.  Another question I raised here was in connection with the Bermingham farm on the O'Rorke Estate.  I asked that question on the 5th March, 1930, and the Parliamentary Secretary said they were about taking it over.  They are still about taking it over.  Probably I will come into this House next year, if I do come into it, and ask another question about this farm and get a similar reply and the same thing will happen the year after.  There is another case of a man who bought a farm of 150 acres of land.  That man hopped off to America and he set the land for grazing to the people around. If he can afford to give it to people in that way I see no reason why the Land Commission cannot take that farm from him altogether, and hand it over to the people who have already to foot the bill.  I could possibly bring up some 50 or 60 similar cases.  There is then no use in standing up here and telling us that the division of the land is going on rapidly.  We cannot see it, and we cannot believe it is.  At any rate I cannot see it.  There is not <Col N="1609" /> much use in a Deputy like Deputy Gorey standing up here and taking the part of the Parliamentary Secretary when he knows nothing at all about conditions in the West of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have been looking up some figures since speaking here on this debate last week, and I discovered that there are 396,245 occupiers of holdings in the Free State.  I also discovered 254,020 of these have an average of 11½ acres each.  That would be roughly about 62 per cent.  About 62 per cent. of the occupiers hold only 3,000,000 acres, whereas 8,128 occupiers hold over 200 acres of land each, that is over 3¼ million acres.  In other words, 2 per cent. of the occupiers hold more land than 62 per cent. of the population.  I would like to ask Deputy Gorey, if he were present, if he stands up for this sort of thing.  I would like to ask the remainder of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party on the opposite benches if they stand up for that sort of thing.  It is all very fine for a man like Deputy Gorey to get up here and talk about the western congests, but he does not for one second think or know of the way in which a number of the people of Connemara are still living the lives of slaves.  Of course, many of them got work on the Shannon Scheme recently, but a great many of them have to go over to England and Scotland, and if they were the type of workers that Deputy Gorey talks of I wonder where they would find employment.  Whatever Deputy Gorey thinks, we believe that these people should be given a chance of making a living on the land.  And the land, when it is acquired, should be allotted to them, and not continue the system that is being carried on at present&mdash;taking over a farm and holding it for five or six years, drawing rents out of the half-starved people's pockets, and then handing it over to them when they are not able to pay any more.  One matter I mentioned last week was the question of the road in my area, Boher Branagh. I am glad the Land Commission has started work on it, and not before it was full time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankJCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say first of all that there has been a marked improvement <Col N="1610" /> in the administration of the Land Commission in one respect&mdash;recommendations now made by Fianna Fáil Deputies receive more favourable consideration than was the case some years ago.  Until a year or two ago it was mere waste of time for a member on this side of the House to approach the Land Commission on behalf of his constituents, whether it was to recommend a tenant for an allotment of land, to obtain grants for the repair of bye-roads, or to have drainage schemes carried out.  Any recommendation made by a Fianna Fáil Deputy was invariably turned down.  I have had practical experience of this in my own constituency.  During the last year or so, however, there has been a marked improvement in the attitude of the Land Commission in this respect.  A considerable number of applicants for land, whose names I recommended to the Land Commission during the last two years, have been provided with allotments.  This is a step in the right direction on the part of the Land Commission officials.  Every deserving person, irrespective of his political opinions, is entitled to a fair share in the distribution of land, and the small farmers and the unemployed are entitled to similar consideration whenever relief grants are being distributed by the Land Commission.  While there are still many cases where undoubtedly unfair discrimination has been shown by the Land Commission, the number is not near so large or so glaring as it was a few years ago.  In spite of all we hear about the efficiency of the Land Commission, I am forced to the conclusion that many years will elapse, at the present rate of progress, before the land question will be definitely settled in the West.  According to a recent report of the Irish Land Commissioners 38,578 acres of untenanted land have been the subject of proceedings or inquiries in Co. Sligo under the Land Act of 1923.  The total area of untenanted land distributed among uneconomic landholders and others in Co. Sligo since 1923 is shown as 19,259 acres.  At the present rate of progress it will take the Land Commission upwards of ten years to distribute what remains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1611" /> The present rate of progress in the acquisition and subdivision of untenanted land seems unnecessarily slow.  Apart altogether from the delay in the inspection and acquisition of untenanted land, it seems unreasonable, where land has been acquired, that one or two years should elapse between the date of acquisition and subdivision.  In South Sligo a number of farms have been acquired by the Land Commission for a considerable time, and so far these lands have not been divided among the congested tenants in the vicinity.  The Heather farms at Knockadoo and the Bearlough farm on the Basil Phibbs estate are cases in point.  Surely a scheme for the subdivision of these farms could be prepared more expeditiously? In many cases congested tenants in the vicinity of untenanted farms obtain conacre tillage on these lands prior to their acquisition by the Land Commission. After these farms are acquired the tenants are deprived of conacre until such time as the lands are subdivided, often for a period of two years.  This delay imposes a very great hardship on the congested tenants concerned. Immediately land has been acquired the Land Commission should take steps to expedite subdivision as much as possible.</P>
    <P>Regarding the acquisition of untenanted land under Sections 24, 35 and 36 of the Act of 1923, it would appear that some sinister influences are at work to delay the acquisition of such land in County Sligo.  I have already pointed out that upwards of 38,500 acres of untenanted land remain to be acquired in County Sligo.  Is it not time for the Land Commission to speed up the acquisition and subdivision of such land?  Before Deputy Roddy was elevated to the position of a Parliamentary Secretary he was very emphatic in his condemnation of the dilatory methods of the Land Commission in dealing with the problem of congestion in the West.  Now that he is in charge of the Land Commismission, and vested with ample powers, I think he should direct his attention to this urgent and pressing problem. Any person who is familiar with local <Col N="1612" /> conditions in Sligo&mdash;and I am sure the same applies to other Western counties&mdash;must admit that the Land Commission have been very dilatory in dealing with the problem of congestion.</P>
    <P>[<i>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle took the Chair.</i>]</P>
    <P>Almost every week since I entered this Assembly I have had to approach the Land Commission regarding the acquisition and subdivision of non-residential farms in County Sligo, and I must say frankly that I am thoroughly disgusted at the snail-like progress of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to two farms at Bearlough and Knockadoo that have been acquired for a considerable time without being subdivided.  There are also other farms that have been acquired at Kilcreevan and Treanscrabbagh on the Gorman estate, and at Heathfield and Derroon on the Phibbs and Gore-Booth estates.  I hope the Land Commission will see to it that these lands are divided immediately. Lists containing the names of deserving applicants have in each case been forwarded to the Land Commission.  In addition to those I have already named there are other farms that should be acquired with as little delay as possible. I would like to mention a few in particular.  There is the Rolston lands in the parish of Castleconnor. There is a very considerable amount of congestion in this parish, and it is a matter of urgent importance that this farm should be acquired and subdivided immediately among the uneconomic tenants in Castleconnor. There are also two other farms in this parish&mdash;one belonging to Bartley Maughan at Corballa and the other owned by Mrs. McHale at Killanly; these farms should be acquired and subdivided without delay.  In the parish of Dromore West there are three farms which should be taken over by the Land Commission for the relief of congestion&mdash;the Giblin farm at Ballyglass on the Palmer estate, the Laugton farm at Belville on the McMun estate, the Cuffe farm at Leharrow and other lands and turbary at Croagh and <Col N="1613" /> Duneil, all on the Cooper estate.  Most of the tenants in this parish are living on uneconomic holdings, and some effort should be made to relieve the congestion that exists.</P>
    <P>Another farm to which I have already directed the attention of the Land Commission is the Keogh farm at Geevagh.  A list of deserving applicants for this farm has been sent to the Land Commission some months ago.  There are two other farms&mdash;one at Streeda, Grange, on the Jones estate and one at Moorfield, Drumcliffe, on the Gore-Booth estate, which are urgently required for the relief of congestion.  There are also a number of non-residential farms at Classiebawn and Mullaghmore on the Ashley estate, in the parish of Cliffoney, together with turbary situate between Ballincastle and Clooncoo, and between Enenreva and Drumfad also on the Ashley estate, that are required for the relief of a large number of congested tenants in the parish of Cliffoney.</P>
    <P>Then there is the McKim farm at Carrownacreevy or Branchfield, in the parish of Mullinabreena, containing upwards of 270 acres to which I have repeatedly directed the attention of the Land Commission.  This land should have been acquired and subdivided years ago.  There are a large number of uneconomic holdings in the vicinity.  Unfortunate tenants are huddled in small farms on the side of the Ox Mountain in close proximity to this substantial farm, the subdivision of which would give much-needed relief. I hope no time will be lost in the acquisition of this farm.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in connection with the division of land to which I would like to direct the attention of the House.  It has frequently happened in my constituency that the owners of large non-residential farms, which should have been acquired for the relief of congestion, are allowed to dispose of their farms with the sanction and approval of the Land Commission. I think it is criminal on the part of the Land Commission to allow such lands to be bought over the heads of the tenants, in many cases by ex-members of the R.I.C. and other <Col N="1614" /> well-to-do individuals.  A very glaring case occurred recently in the parish of Killyglass on the Gordon estate.  A large non-residential farm at Chapelfield was allowed by the Land Commission to be sold over the heads of ten congested tenants in the vicinity.</P>

I would like to hear what excuse the Parliamentary Secretary has to offer for this action on the part of his officials.  I would like to know if it is the considered policy of the Land Commission to allow farms like that at Chapelfield to be bought by wealthy individuals over the heads of uneconomic holders in the vicinity, and, if not, why it was that permission was given by the Land Commission to the owner of Chapelfield to dispose of his holding.</P>

      <P>Local members of Cumann na nGaedheal made representations to the Parliamentary Secretary to have this land acquired, and they were so disgusted at the attitude of the Parliamentary Secretary in this <Col N="1615" /> matter that there is no longer a branch of Cumann na nGaedheal at Ballinacarrow, in spite of the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary visited the district after that farm was sold in order to try and revive what was left of the organisation.  There are still complaints in my constituency regarding persons who have been provided with allotments.  A number of cases have been reported to me where the claims of deserving tenants have been brushed aside and the land given to outsiders.  In one particular case, the Hunt farm, at Rockley, tenants who lived miles away were given allotments to the exclusion of a number of local fishermen in the vicinity whose forefathers originally owned this land.  I hope the Land Commission will take immediate steps to rectify the grave injustice done to these poor fishermen, who have to depend for a living on a few acres of land and a chance catch on the sea.  I understand that one of the Land Commission engineers, responsible for the subdivision of this farm, was afterwards convicted and imprisoned for accepting bribes and for the misappropriation of money entrusted to his care by the Land Commission.</P>

      <P>I will leave that to Deputy Reynolds.  He would make a good-looking and impressive witness. I think the Deputy should confine his attention to the railway men in Ballinamore. I have also received complaints regarding the subdivision of the Clarke farm at Carrowmoran, in the parish of Templeboy.  This farm is adjacent to the seashore.  The tenants provided with allotments are denied access to the seashore, and are unable to collect seaweed, although, according to my information, these tenants have to pay a special rate for seaweed.  It seems very unfair that tenants should have to pay for privileges which they do not enjoy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The manner in which relief grants have been spent in my constituency certainly calls for investigation.  There are two glaring examples in the <Col N="1616" /> County Sligo of the manner in which public money has been squandered by the Land Commission.  Some time ago a new road was made by the Land Commission up to the side of the Ox Mountain in the townland of Dunflin Upper, in the parish of Skreen, at a cost, I understand, of about £500. This road was supposed to be made for the purpose of enabling tenants to reach bog on the mountain-side, but when the road was finished it was found that there was no bog within reach, and even if bog were available the road was so steep that it could not be used for vehicular traffic.  The only value this road has been to the district, and to the farmers it was supposed to benefit, is the number of tourists it attracts.  I understand that a considerable number of foreigners have already visited the district, anxious to view one of the wonderful achievements of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>In the townland of Altonelvick, in the parish of Dromard, another similar road was constructed up the side of the Ox Mountains.  In this case it was also supposed to be constructed for the purpose of enabling farmers to reach bog on the mountain, but when this road was finished it was found to give access only to a large swamp on the mountain.  Had the engineer responsible for this road any knowledge of local conditions he could have constructed a road, at much less cost, in the townland of Carrowvard, a short distance away, which would have given access to upwards of 500 acres of excellent bog.  I would like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary who was responsible for selecting the sites of these roads, and what outside influences were brought to bear to induce the Land Commission to squander public money on such useless work.</P>
    <P>A very strong case has already been made by the various Deputies who spoke for referring this Estimate back for reconsideration.  In addition to referring the Estimate back for reconsideration, I think the time has arrived when the administration of the Land Commission should be made the subject of an inquiry by a Select Committee appointed by this House.</P>

      <P>I have listened with much interest to the admissions made by Deputy Carty, in which he stated that there has been a marked improvement in the Land Commission in the last few years.  I am afraid the Deputy has hardly done justice to himself in confining improvement to the Land Commission alone.  I think the Deputy's views and the views of those who sit with him have changed in a marked degree compared with their views of two years ago.</P>

      <P>On a point of explanation, I said there was a marked improvement in the administration of the Land Commission in one respect, that representations made during the last year or two by Deputies on these benches have received consideration from officials of the Land Commission which they did not receive two or three years ago.</P>

      <P>I have heard Deputy Carty advocate very strongly the compulsory acquisition of land for the relief of congestion.  I have heard him complain of the delays which have taken place in that respect.  I have heard him say that the delay was caused by sinister influences.  I also listened to the speeches of Deputy Killilea and Deputy Walsh.  I wonder would that be the same Deputy Carty who two years ago voted for a Bill that had as its primary object the taking away from the Land Commission for all time of any power compulsorily to acquire land for the relief of congestion? Is it the same Deputy Carty?  Is it the same Deputy Walsh?  Is it the same Deputy Killilea, or have they completely altered their views?  Are they going to tell us that when they voted for that Bill, which had for its plain object the taking of these powers from the Land Commission, their mentality was such that they did not know what they were voting for?  When we find Deputy after Deputy coming up with a complete change of front and advocating a policy which each of them denounced and voted against two years ago, I think the House is entitled to know in all fairness why this change of front has taken place and why, having <Col N="1618" /> voted, as they did in 1929, in favour of taking these powers from the Land Commission, they proceed in 1931 to denounce the Land Commission for not being speedy enough in the acquisition and division of land.</P>
      <P>Are we to assume that these Deputies have completely changed their views?  If so, why, how, and when? Would it not come better from some Deputies other than those who were so fierce in their advocacy in 1929 of taking from the Land Commission compulsory powers for acquiring land &mdash;why not leave it to them to attack the Land Commission for delay in 1931?  The other day I heard, or perhaps I read, a statement by Deputy Lemass in which he accused the Parliamentary Secretary of having cogged or copied the Bill introduced by Deputy Derrig some years ago.  No greater slander could be uttered against the Parliamentary Secretary than that he copied or got any inspiration from a Bill which was a monstrosity on the face of it.</P>

      <P>To impute to the Parliamentary Secretary any connection with that Bill, which was introduced two years ago and which was on the face of it a disgrace to legislation and a disgrace to the country, would be a cruel slander on him, and should not be repeated throughout the country.  I agree as to what has been said about the good work that has been done in the Land Commission, particularly recently. A stupendous job had to be undertaken.  If Deputies only knew what it meant they would agree that no Department in the country ever got through such a big job in such a short time and with such satisfaction as the Land Commission did in the last two or three months in speeding up the operations of land purchase.  They have done a job which reflects great credit on them, particularly on the <Col N="1619" /> head of the Department.  It must have been a great pleasure and a source of pride to the Parliamentary Secretary to know that he had officials who in an emergency like that could undertake such a vast job and do it so quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that as regards his staff the system of employing temporary labour is not a good one, or, at all events, is one that may be carried to an extent which would not be justified by results.  There are officials in the Land Commission who have been there for over twenty years but who are still on the temporary staff. That, in my opinion, is not right.  I do not think that it is economical because you will not get the best results, no matter how good and how faithful the officials are, if they are only temporary employees.  It would take a saint to resist the temptation of not killing the goose that laid the golden eggs.  I agree that it is necessary to employ a temporary staff in the Land Commission to some extent but I think it would be much wiser if men who have been there for eight or ten years were placed on the permanent <Col N="1620" /> staff.  If the Parliamentary Secretary did that, I believe that he would get even better results.  In my view, men who have been in the Land Commission for twenty years and over in prominent and responsible positions and who discharged their duties with credit to themselves and to the Land Commission, even though they are technically on the temporary staff, could not be discharged without getting compensation.  As I say, I believe it would lead to better results if these officials who served a long apprenticeship were taken on the permanent staff.  The Land Commission must still take a considerable period to complete land purchase.  It is essential that examiners of title, for instance, should be thoroughly efficient and, if you are to get the best results from them, they should not be merely temporary men, men who, knowing that their job is only temporary, would naturally be inclined to take their time over it.</P>
