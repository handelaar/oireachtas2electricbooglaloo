      <P>I do not know that anything that we can say here is likely to influence the minds of the gentlemen opposite with regard to this Bill.  In our opinion it is another step in the erection of dictatorship in local government affairs, and, as such, we are strenuously opposed to it.  Opinion on this side of the House, which is, I <Col N="720" /> think, backed by a very considerable volume of opinion outside, is definitely hostile to the concentration of all power over local affairs in the hands of a central authority.  We have discussed this matter at length before, and I suppose that we will have to do it again, and keep on doing it, until an opportunity comes to make our views effective in this matter. During the last day or two somebody sent me extracts from a number of provincial journals.  So far as I know, the opinions of the editors of these journals are friendly to the present Ministry.  There is one from &ldquo;The Midland Tribune,&rdquo; another from &ldquo;The Sligo Champion,&rdquo; a paper which I think has always been the champion of the Free State Government, and there is also one from &ldquo;The Dundalk Democrat.&rdquo;  All three of them, in their editorial articles in the issues of June 6th, vigorously oppose the ideas expressed by the Minister recently when introducing another local government amending Bill into the House.  While, as I say, all of them are organs that champion generally the Free State Government, they certainly do not show any sign of championing the views of the Local Government Ministry in regard to local affairs.  &ldquo;The Midland Tribune&rdquo; says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There has been far too much tinkering with local administration so far.  Changes have been made and systems evolved which have not been the best, and which competent authorities stated, before their adoption, were not the best....  For ourselves we think that many changes for the better can be made in our present local government system, but we would be strenuously opposed to any new system which would give undue power to the central authority and remove the responsibilities of local control from local bodies.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the view of that journal.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;Sligo Champion&rdquo; says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Already the present Government has interfered so seriously with the operations of local authority as to leave it only a shell of its <Col N="721" /> former self....  In further pursuit of the ideal, we are told that it is the intention of the Government to introduce another Bill, which, of course, must automatically pass into law; and the intention of this legislation is to aim at securing `whatever benefits could be obtained by getting local people to do all the local work under the most favourable circumstances possible'.  Remembering the fact that the Government has already sapped most of the authority which local people did possess in regard to local work, it is a mere exhibition of dry humour on the part of the Minister to declare that it is the Department's desire to give local bodies the best machinery available so that they could work on proper lines when carrying out of their own volition the things they wanted to do in order to improve their local circumstances. The Government has never displayed any confidence in those chosen by the people under the Local Government franchise, and far from giving them any permission to carry out schemes `on their own volition,' the reverse has been, undeniably, the studied policy from the very commencement.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the &ldquo;Sligo Champion.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Dundalk Democrat&rdquo; is similarly opposed to the present tendency to centralise affairs as regards local administration at headquarters. It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We make no secret of our belief that there are forces at work&mdash;and were, long before General Mulcahy took over the portfolio&mdash;aiming at the establishment of a purely bureaucratic system.  The ideal of the people responsible would seem to be a purely official administration, carried out by Dublin-appointed officials under the direction of the central department, giving local people no voice in the management of their affairs and no control over their own destinies.  It was, doubtless, with this in mind that the Chairman of the Louth County Council the other day exhorted the Government to `walk warily.' He spoke in a place that local initiative <Col N="722" /> has raised, and is raising, to higher levels.  It would be a national catastrophe if the power were taken from such men to carry our towns and counties along the path of progress.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will follow their lead in local government affairs.  I am only quoting them because they are your champions.  I could quote you dozens of others which are not your champions. They are your own champions belabouring yourself and your own policy and telling you that if you continue your present policy in regard to local government you will not have their support.  These papers which are champions of the Free State Ministry state our views in regard to local administration, and in regard to the present tendency of centralising all power in the hands of the Ministry of Local Government.  It seems, perhaps, unnecessary to repeat and emphasise again what our views are in the matter but I think it is necessary to do so when the present Ministry, if they ever had any belief in the rights of the people, have lost whatever faith they had in the power of the people to conduct their local affairs.  If that policy continues in that direction the logical outcome would be that this Dáil ought to be abolished.</P>

      <P>I would not object as much as Deputy Reynolds and Deputy McDonagh to the abolition of the <Col N="723" /> House as at present constituted.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give it to the Minister to read if he is so fond of it.  I have no objection to reading it, but the President protested when I offered to read the whole of it.  I will read the article in &ldquo;The Dundalk Democrat,&rdquo; which is headed &ldquo;Local Control in Administration.&rdquo;  It says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In the course of a debate in the Seanad on Wednesday the Minister for Local Government gave some indication of the lines on which the forthcoming amendment Bill will be framed.  He said in the first place that the aim was &ldquo;to secure for the country whatever benefits could be obtained by getting local people to do all the local work&rdquo;&mdash;that is underlined&mdash;under the most favourable conditions ... so that they could work on proper lines when carrying out, of their own volition, the things they wanted to do to improve local circumstances.</P>
      <P>There is nothing editorial in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is, of course, the President's view, because it is the Minister's statement.  There is nothing editorial in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Something dictatorial, in fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly, dictatorial. One of the papers refers to the dry humour of the Minister.  I did not know that he ever had much humour in him.  They seemed to discover that he had when he talked of getting all the local people to do all the local work under the most favourable conditions. That is his statement&mdash;that they are to do all the local work&mdash;and the minute they proceed to do any of the local work under his Department, he comes down with a mandamus, or something of that sort.  Look at the <Col N="724" /> number of cases you have had quite recently.  I think I saw one of them reported in this morning's papers.  A mandamus was sought against that local authority, threatening them with severe penalties if they did not do what the Minister wanted, not what they considered right or proper locally, but what the Minister himself considered right.  His idea of doing local work is to make his will effective, to appoint whomsoever he wishes to carry out schemes of local administration, just as he desires in a certain narrow way and without reference to the people.  That is what he calls getting local people to do all the local work under the most favourable conditions. Who is to judge?  He says that he wants to get all the local people to do all the local work, but any time the local people express their opinion as to what they want to do, according to their experience in the locality, for the benefit of the locality, if that interferes in the remotest way with the views of the Minister, he issues a sealed order, a mandamus, or something of that kind, and threatens them with all sorts of legal pains and penalties, if they do not literally follow the views and the orders of the Minister.</P>
      <P>I think we are right in opposing this Bill, giving such wide and extensive powers, such almost limitless powers as it does to the Minister, in Sections 2 and 3, to dissolve local authorities, and having dissolved them, to appoint whomsoever he pleases.  It may be that he will have to have a very much increased staff of officials at headquarters. He will have to double or treble his inspectorate staff because if the present policy continues he will need to have in time inspectors under the name of Commissioners administering the local affairs of most of the public authorities in the country, or in the Free State, which is not the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is quite reversed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Then that will be doing what he says here&mdash;getting the local people to do all the local work under the most favourable conditions.  Was <Col N="725" /> there ever such hypocrisy known in the House, and there has been a good deal of it?  I doubt if at any time there has been such an exhibition of hypocrisy paraded in this House, or in the Seanad, as is evidenced in the present case&mdash;the Minister proclaiming, in word, his faith in the people to attend to their own affairs, to carry on their own administration, and by act, giving the lie to every word of his.  This Bill gives him wide and extensive powers. I would not object to giving the Minister full powers, the fullest powers he would demand, or giving any Minister full powers to supervise the work of local authorities, to direct, advise and counsel local authorities, but, when we see the way these powers are misused, we certainly object.</P>
      <P>If the Minister, or his colleagues in the Ministry, had in the past exhibited any faith in the local people, if they had shown their trust in the people and their confidence in the people to do right sometime, I think a Bill of this kind might be allowed to be passed, but because of our experience of the actions of the Local Government Department in the past, we certainly cannot allow a Bill of this kind to go through without protest.  Not alone are local authorities to be suppressed whenever they fall foul of the Minister, to be abolished, but every subsidiary body working under these local authorities is to be likewise suppressed, and individuals under this Bill can be handpicked by the Minister to run boards of health, to run a vocational education system, to run mental hospital boards and asylum boards and all other local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill gives him power to ignore altogether public opinion, to ignore the considered opinion of the elected representatives of any locality, to abolish the local authority if the whim seizes him, and to select from the locality the chairman of whatever branches of the Cumann na nGaedheal organisation might exist here and there, or the organisers of Cumann na nGaedheal, or people of that kind, people that he knows, because of favours granted or favours to come, will carry out his policy and his wishes, and put them to run local affairs, not <Col N="726" /> in our belief for the good of the people, and certainly not thus getting local people to do all the local work under the most favourable conditions. Undoubtedly he can always get local people to do local work by abolishing these Boards.  He has power then to select anybody he likes, and to select people who, he knows from their past, will be obedient servants of his and his Ministry.  He cannot maintain here or elsewhere that such people, hand-picked by him, who will be appointed to carry on these local authorities or subsidiary bodies, will represent the public opinion of the locality, or that they will voice the views of the majority of the people.</P>
    <P>So far as I know, in a great many of the public bodies in the country, the present Government has a majority of the elected representatives on a very considerable number of public bodies, but it would appear that even that will not satisfy him.  If these elected representatives, as in the case of Mayo, which was quoted here so frequently the other day, do not carry out to the letter the views of headquarters, they are to go.  How he can say with one breath that he is anxious for local people to do all the work, and at the same time wipe them out, cut off their heads when they endeavour to put local ideas into execution, knowing the views of the locality, or how he can reconcile his words with his deeds, it is difficult to see. Certainly he has not raised the reputation of the Department for efficiency during his occupancy of his present office.  There have been several cases in the past few years which have exhibited the Department and administration in a very bad light to the country.  One of the worst, for which the present Minister was not primarily responsible, was the case of the Grangegorman Mental Hospital Committee, which is particularly referred to in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister was careful to say the other evening that he took full and complete responsibility for the actions of his Department. That is only what one would expect he should say.  In my opinion, the Minister and his Department <Col N="727" /> should, at an early date, look for more efficient technical advisers, for a greater legal mess than was made of the Grangegorman Mental Hospital case it would be difficult to imagine. The Department is not helping the people to govern themselves.  It is not encouraging them to take an interest in public affairs and in local govern ment.  Our views and the views of the Ministry seem to be directly opposed on these matters.  The Ministry has no confidence in the people.  It does not wish to encourage them to take a live interest in civic affairs.  Our view is that it is possible for local authorities to make mistakes as well as it is possible for the Minister and his Department to make mistakes.  It is only by allowing them to conduct their affairs as they think proper, by showing them their faults and their mistakes when they go wrong, by encouraging them to go on the right road and insisting that they do good work locally, that they bear the cost as well as know the cost of mistakes when they make them, that you will train public opinion and the citizens generally to take a live interest in local as well as in national affairs.  You will not train them to do good local administrative work by abolishing them every time they refuse to carry out the dictates of the Department. The people get disgusted, dis heartened, and indifferent, and that is natural.  Our view is that it would be for the benefit of the State that they should be taught and encouraged to take a full and lively interest in local affairs; that where they prove themselves ignorant or inexperienced the Minister and his experienced officials should always be there to correct them, advise them, counsel them and show them the right road.  Instead of that the Ministry is determined to take all power and responsibility from their hands.</P>
    <P>It is only by leaving responsibility in their hands, by putting on their shoulders and making them realise the cost of wrong-doing, that you can train them properly.  We need such education.  We need education in civics in this country.  We need to teach our people to run their local <Col N="728" /> affairs and take responsibility for them.  We are backward in these matters, not alone in the rural areas, but even in the City of Dublin.  There is not that lively sense of civic responsibility that we ought to have.  The citizens do not fully realise their duties and responsibilities as citizens. Our view would be to encourage the people to take an interest in civic affairs and to realise their responsibilities. If the citizens of Dublin, and in the towns throughout the Free State, realised to the full their responsibilities in local matters you would have in a short time a very big change in such matters as housing.</P>
    <P>I am not going to tempt the Ceann Comhairle to intervene to suppress me by developing that point, but I just give it as an example of the want of civic spirit and civic interest.  There is not that sense of responsibility for civic affairs in this country that there ought to be.  The Minister's policy is directly opposed to the encouragement of that civic spirit.  Again, I say that I doubt if any words that we can use, or any urging that we can do here, will change the outlook of the present Ministry on these matters.  It is out of a sense of duty that we do it.  Despite what the results may be, and despite the apathy and indifference of those sitting opposite, we will continue to press forward our view that it is on the people's shoulders and in their hands should be placed full responsibility for the conduct of their own affairs.  It is only in that way you will bring them to a full realisation of their duties as well as their powers, and that good can result to the State and the people as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan (Clare) Mr. P. Hogan (Clare)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Clare): The principal fault that I have with the Minister in the administration of his Department, and in the legislation that he introduces here, is his glorification of theory.  The Minister in these matters of local government seems to go mainly on theory.  He does not get down to the practicability of what he propounds or endeavour to find out from those who are acquainted with the application of these theories whether they are workable or not. <Col N="729" /> Having glorified his theory, the Minister goes along and enforces it in the spirit of an autocrat.  These are the two main faults that I find with the Minister as regards the legislation he introduces in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it were desirable, I could indicate many phases of his autocratic enforcement of these theories of his, and how they affect adversely the lives of the people who are influenced by local government.  I could indicate how the lives of the people in connection with home assistance, local improvements, sanitation and other matters are affected by the theoretical views of the Minister and his autocratic enforcement of them.  I do not intend to develop that point now.  The Minister and his predecessors seem to have the same ideas, and since he came into office we have had various local government measures introduced.  Judging by the way these measures are coming to the House the Minister apparently does not think that we have reached the ideal machine for local administration. If the Minister continues in this fashion I do not think we shall ever reach it. It is impossible, and not reasonable, to except that a Department functioning in Dublin, far removed from the administration of local affairs, would be in a position to say what exactly local administration really wants.  It was to deal with that that I got up to speak.  Has the Minister, in the administration of local affairs, ever taken into conference any representative body of local administrators?  Has he any faith in local administration at all?  If not, then the proper course for him to take is to abolish local administration altogether and centralise the whole thing in the Department in Dublin.  I do not think anyone will say that the Department in Dublin has any experience of administration.  I do not want to use this as an argument against the Minister, but I think it is correct to say that he himself has no experience of administration in local affairs.  It is also true that his Department has little or no experience in such administration.  The Minister seems to have no confidence in those who are administering local affairs, because he never takes them into conference <Col N="730" /> to find out what the people need.  There is such a body as the General Council of County Councils. Deputy McDonogh does not like it; he does not like the Dáil.  The Deputy thinks that we ought to abolish it. Possibly we ought to abolish the General Council of County Councils, and then the county councils, who send representatives to the General Council. I think these councils and committees have done valuable work in local administration.  They know the needs of the people and what is required in local administration.  They have experience of these matters, and, against difficulties, they have endeavoured to carry on for years.  To an extent they have succeeded in making bad legislation fairly effective.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister if he has ever considered the question of taking a body like the General Council of County Councils, or any similar body, into consultation.  If he has passed over the General Council of County Councils, has he ever taken the chairmen of the county councils into conference, the chairmen of the boards of health, or the chief executive officials of these bodies, and asked them what local administration requires?  Has he done anything in that way to find out what are the needs of local administration? Has the Minister simply sat down with his officials in the Department and drafted measures without any reference whatever to their applicability to local affairs?  Surely there should be some reference to local bodies?  If the Minister does not like the people who are elected to county councils or the chairmen of the boards of health&mdash;some of whom are not pleasing to him because of their expressed political views&mdash;he has the executive officers of these bodies, and he can ask them their views as to the feasibility of these things.  He has not done that.  My principal objection to the Minister's attitude regarding legislation is that it is purely his theory without any reference to its practicability or applicability, and his autocratic method of enforcing these theories irrespective of their suitability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go at length into the reasons I have for opposing this Bill.  I think the Dáil is satisfied with the experience it has had in the City of Dublin.  The Minister tried to explain, as Deputy O'Kelly quoted, that he wants better results from local government in local areas. Yet when we examine the results of the Minister's interference in Dublin we find that there have been no advantages. If the Minister's point is that he wants to balance results as between the benefits to local areas and the results of central government we might be able to discuss the matter from a different angle.  Take the position in the City of Dublin.  The Minister's predecessor dissolved the Corporation of Dublin and set up the Commissioner system.  After five years, when control was handed back to the city in a diluted form, it was found that the city had suffered considerably through the Minister's intervention and through the administration of the Commissioners. It was found that the electricity plant had been lost to the city, a plant that had made a profit of £70,000 for the ratepayers.  That was a distinct disadvantage to the City of Dublin, although it might be considered an advantage to the central Government in connection with their Shannon scheme.</P>

      <P>We discussed that on the Second Stage of the Bill.  I pointed out then that it was relevant to object to the Bill in principle, and in order to support the objection, to quote examples as to how power already possessed by the Minister or by the central authority has been used.  I think it is late on the Fifth Stage to give examples.  I think we are confined to the mere question whether power should be given or not, without having examples from the past.</P>

      <P>I want to show that the Minister has sufficient powers without this Bill.  I want to illustrate that by pointing out that where local bodies decide to give contracts to a native firm, at prices somewhat higher than those of outsiders, the Minister has power to surcharge them.  These local authorities, before they can give such contracts, have to consult their legal advisers in order that he would interpret the rules and regulations made by the Minister, so that they would not be surcharged or suppressed simply because they wished to support home industry.  I am a member of a local authority where we spend a great <Col N="733" /> deal of time looking up the Minister's orders and rules and consulting legal opinion to ascertain whether we can do certain things, and whether we are liable to be suppressed or surcharged. I think the Minister has sufficient powers already to see that administration is efficiently carried on by the local authorities without seeking further powers to make it easier for him to suppress them.  On the Second Reading, I referred to the case of a local authority where the Minister set up his idea of government, and where the nominee of the Minister engaged in an act which any local authority with any self-respect would not tolerate for five minutes.  The ratepayers in that area have no redress whatever.  In the case of a local authority the citizens always have redress, but in this instance they are debarred.  I pointed out to the Minister the appointment, in one instance, of a sanitary officer to take charge of an area in which he was a considerable property owner.  Such an appointment was against all commonsense and reason, and it should not be tolerated, but the Minister ignores such matters. I got into touch with the Local Government Department on that matter, but instead of getting any satisfaction I was answered only on one point, and that was with regard to the man's age.</P>

I want to prove that the Minister's idea of local government will bring nothing but disadvantages. The Minister is trying to make way for what he pretends is going to be effective administration. In my opinion, the method he is proposing is going to make for jobbery on a more definite basis than ever it existed in this country.  I intend raising the matter next Wednesday that I was trying to raise here by way of question and answer.  I will prove&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister can scarcely wait until he gets the powers he is seeking.  He is so anxious to secure those dictatorial powers that he can hardly wait until next week. He wants to be busy this afternoon deciding what councils, or subsidiary bodies, he will suppress.  I do not know why the Chair has ruled that it is not in order on the present stage to argue on the basis of experience.  If the Dáil is going to be placed in the position of transacting its business on the same basis as the Minister transacts his business, purely on the basis of theory, as was pointed out by Deputy Hogan, and with no practical experience to back his arguments, then the outlook is sad for the country.  If the Chair rules out of order any references to practical experience and results which may be quoted as against certain legislation here, then the sooner we adopt Deputy Hogan's suggestion and suppress this House, leaving the whole Government to a few individuals, who can theorise from morning until night, the better.</P>

      <P>I consider this Bill is sufficiently important, even on this stage, to try and think out fresh arguments in the hope that some members of the House will change their minds and decide to vote in a different fashion to the way they voted on the Second Reading.  I do not know whether Deputies have considered this matter carefully or have looked up the results that have arisen through the <Col N="735" /> suppression of councils and the effect of the subsequent administration.  I wonder have Deputies studied the conditions in areas where councils were suppressed?  If they have not done that, it is not likely that they will alter their views.  It is regrettable that on this stage we cannot discuss definite reasons that we have knowledge of from our own experience. I expect all that we can do is to get up and say a few words and then oppose the Bill in the ordinary way. In Dublin the local authority which functioned for years was always careful never to increase the dead-weight debt of the city.</P>

      <P>The dead-weight debt of the city has increased almost twice as much as it was before the Corporation was suppressed.  That is a disadvantage from which the city will continue to suffer as a result of the Commissioners' administration.  If a local authority had been in office for five years and had increased the dead-weight debt from two millions to four and a half millions, or from two and a half millions to five millions, I do not think they would seek re-election.</P>

He has some experience of a Ministerial position, but in the matter of practical administration he knows little.  Before he goes any further on the road towards putting his theories into effect, he should accept Deputy Hogan's suggestion and call together either the officials of local authorities, the senior representatives of the councils, or the General Council of County Councils and get their views.  If they recommend certain changes, the Minister should accede to their wishes and then there would be some sense in this Bill.</P>

If the Minister were making alterations in the system of local government at the request of the local authorities generally, then there would be some sense in his legislation. In this instance, however, the Minister is out for the purpose of securing to himself dictatorial powers and he will insist that local authorities shall be merely puppets.  He will pull the strings from Merrion Street and they will dance to the tune.  That is what is being attempted and it is about time that the members of this House took up a definite attitude in regard to the Minister.  The ratepayers elect representatives to carry out certain functions in conjunction with the requirements of their areas and not in the manner which the Minister desires.  He sits in his snug office in the Custom House, and in many cases he knows nothing at all about the districts concerned. The Minister did interject and ask what about the librarian.</P>

      <P>I am opposing this measure.  If it is the declared policy of the Government to complete the humiliation and shame that have been already heaped on the heads of certain of our citizens, then, of course, I can quite understand it is the natural corollary to the Cork City Management Act and to the Greater Dublin Act. We find in Section 2 of this Bill that the Minister is empowered, after having dissolved a local authority, to make by order such provision as he thinks necessary or proper and to appoint a person or persons to undertake the duties of this local authority. I take it that that, translated into every-day language, means that the Minister would have power to appoint a commissioner.  I have had some experience as a citizen of Cork of the commissioner system, and of the city management system under a manager. I have experience of the Corporation, aldermen and councillors elected with the town manager by the Appointments Commissioners&mdash;in the case I refer to the name of the City Manager was mentioned in the Act.  That experience, however, does not alter my attitude in this matter one iota.  I want to say nothing personal against the City Manager or against any other manager in Dublin or Cork appointed under the Act to which I refer.  It is the system which I am attacking, a system which has borne very bad fruit in the City of Cork, for which I speak. I do not want to go into what has occurred here in Dublin, but I do know that the operations of this Act, as we find it in Cork City, have led to a lessening of that civic spirit and that civic responsibility about which we have heard so much in this State.</P>

      <P>Experience goes to show that wherever the State has interfered with public bodies, then when elections are taking place only a very small percentage of the electorate go to the polls.  It might be answered by the Minister, and very likely it will be said by the Minister, that this apathy is in itself a tribute to the system which he has set up.  We have another Bill here further consolidating that position.  But I take it that it is the aim of good government to inculcate a spirit of civics and good citizenship in the citizens.  I do suggest to the Minister and to this House that this Bill will go a long way towards negativing that spirit and every exhibition of good citizenship that may show itself in the near future, and that instead of encouraging the spirit of citizenship in the people it will discourage that spirit.  I want to know from the Minister whether that is good or bad for this State.</P>
      <P>I said that it was far better, even if those local councils make mistakes from time to time, to give the citizens of the particular area or district an opportunity even of another election.  After all, there is some similarity between Dáil elections and local elections.

Nobody yet has said, except Deputy McDonogh, that the Dáil should be dissolved.  Why should not the same system operate in the case of the urban or borough or county council or any other body locally appointed to administer the affairs of the citizens?  A case may arise where it would be absolutely necessary to have a Commissioner take charge for a period when the citizens of that particular area might be trusted to elect the right and proper persons to represent them in that council.  Let us take the case of a small council.  Take the <Col N="740" /> case of Deputy Sheehy, for whom I have the greatest respect.  Take his own little town of Skibbereen, the metropolis of the West, as he is fond of calling it; let us say that for some reason or another that that very useful and popular council there was dissolved. That council is composed of very good citizens.  What would Deputy Sheehy's attitude be if that council were dissolved?  I feel sure he would not begin his speech when he found that the Bill operated in this way, by glorifying and almost deifying our glorious young Minister, General Mulcahy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I have risen a fairly long way anyway.  I have already said that I look upon this Bill as a corollary to the other humiliations the Minister puts on our citizens.  I want to know from the Minister whether, after his experience now of two other Acts of a kindred nature, namely, the Cork City Management Act and the Greater Dublin Act, where he has the power to dissolve, he thinks this is a Bill that will be for the benefit of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think he will go down in history as the Seidlitz-powder Minister, for the word &ldquo;dissolve&rdquo; is so often used in his Bill that I feel the Minister will have that sobriquet attached to him for the remainder of his career.  He fizzles up here frequently after the application of the blue paper.  I think this Bill is so much fizz also, and that it will be found in practice to be unworkable. One thing I will ask the Minister to consider is how long the people of this country are going to tolerate such matters as interference with borough councils and other representative bodies which he seeks to dissolve on the slightest pretext.  Is it because there are numbers of hangers-on in his own Party who want jobs? Is it because there are many hangers-on in the country?  I know some of them who are waiting open-mouthed for these jobs.  I want to know what will be the Minister's reply to that. Perhaps it may be that he has already in his eye one or two councils that he wishes to dissolve and has partisans or carpet-baggers of his own Party to put into the jobs.  That is what has occurred.  No one will deny it.  The people are getting suspicious, for very good reasons.  We have it day after day occurring where even under Article 10 <Col N="742" /> of the Treaty certain people got out because they were invalided and are now working in the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That has nothing whatever to do with the Bill. The Deputy cannot possibly relate Article 10 of the Treaty to this Bill. It simply cannot be done, even by Deputy Anthony, and he is ingenious enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Before ever that Treaty was introduced I want to say there was a greater measure of freedom under John Bull than under this Bill. John Bull never attempted to suppress your local bodies, but it remains for the Minister for Local Government, General Mulcahy, to introduce a measure of coercion that was never attempted by even Buckshot Foster or Balfour.  Then we have a Free State forsooth! The people of the towns and cities are getting so disgusted with this class of legislation because of the fact that every vestige of freedom and power is being taken from them, that the Minister might consider whether there is not such a thing as reaction to this kind of treatment.</P>
      <P>Let me say here, as one who does not pretend to know much about psychology, that this kind of legislation has a cumulative effect on the people, and it would be far better for the Minister for Local Government to allow those safety valves of public opinion operate rather than shut them down and have their activities directed into another channel.  That is the position I would like the Minister for Local Government to examine very carefully, whether he is not, by this class of legislation, creating the very thing he seeks to destroy; in other words, a discontent is growing in this country which I and many other people like me have done our very best to put a stop to, because we do know that that unrest is finding expression in a way most unacceptable to the Free State and which, if allowed to develop, would be one of the greatest menaces to the Free State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unless you have these safety valves in towns and cities in the Free State that activity which has been squelched and squeezed out by the Minister <Col N="743" /> must find an outlet, and if there was any sense of statesmanship in the Minister for Local Government he would see to it rather than stifle and suppress and, to use the words in the Bill, &ldquo;dissolve these councils&rdquo; for every little fault they may be guilty of.  Rather than that, his aim should be to stimulate public opinion, stimulate the civic spirit, and stimulate a sense of responsibility in the people.  This is the negation of all civic spirit and responsibility, and instead of allowing local government to continue, even as it was allowed to operate under John Bull, he has taken from it the last vestige of representative power it had.  By all means dissolve the councils if they are unfriendly to the Cumann na nGaedheal Government! Does he even think out what would be the logical result of such conduct?  Assuming that Fianna Fáil come into power tomorrow, they will have the powers under this Bill; to me it is immaterial; any flag will do.  It does not matter whether you call this a Republic or a Free State or whether Deputy de Valera or President Cosgrave is in power.  If this is the class of legislation that is going to be produced in the Dáil, the representative Chamber of this country, it does not matter to me what you call your State, a Republic or Free State.  There is no freedom disclosed in a motion of this kind.  It is no manifestation of freedom.  Rather is it a manifestation of coercion and oppression, and it makes no secret of it.  I would ask the Minister to look into this and see if a continuation of this type of legislation will have the favourable reaction on the country which he thinks it will have.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the only reaction to this is a spirit of revolt and a spirit that is finding expression, and will continue to find expression, in the wrong way.  It would be far better to allow those councils, even though they may make a slip, to continue to function and act as the natural safety valves of the community which they represent.  We have, in reply to that sentiment of our own people, openly expressed in the ballot boxes, the answer of the <Col N="744" /> Minister for Local Government in a Bill to extend and define the powers of the Minister for Local Government in relation to local authorities dissolved by him&mdash;another constructive effort on the part of Cumann na nGaedheal.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister replies, there is a matter which he mentioned in his speech at the end of the Second Reading that I want to refer to.  I taxed him with having turned his back on a principle for which he was supposed to stand some years ago, in regard to local government, and his excuse was that one of the principles he stood for was to have a national civil service.  A national civil service, as we understood it, is quite consistent with leaving to local authorities the full power to manage their own affairs without the constant interference of Ministers for Local Government.  What did we understand by national civil service, including in that local officials?  What we understood, of course, by it was that servants of local authorities would be selected on their capacity to do their work and would have conditions of service similar to the conditions under which the ordinary civil servant operates. There is no inconsistency in that and leaving to local authorities the powers that we desire to leave them.  We object to the system of appointments that is operating at present, because it goes much farther than that.  We were anxious to see that the servants of local authorities would, every one of them, be qualified for their work, and that where competitive examination could be used as a test of ability&mdash; whilst we did not admit that it was an absolute test, still it is the best that we could get&mdash;it should be operated. Clerkships and so on could all be filled by competitive examination where the examination was designed to test the ability of the candidates for the particular type of work that they were to be engaged in.  That is what I understood by national civil service, and I stand for that to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made it quite clear in the case of the Local Appointments Bill that where there were appointments of a <Col N="745" /> technical character for which the ordinary competitive system would not be available, that there should be such tests as would make it certain that nobody who was not qualified to do his work would be appointed.  I hope our attitude in that matter is clearly understood, that we do not support any system in which incompetent people would be put in to do work which requires competent people to do, as all work does if it is to be done effectively.  I hope there is no misunderstanding as far as that is concerned.  The whole question is this: Is the system of the Local Appointments Commission going to get you the men you want, and to get the best men for their work?  We have objected to this centralisation, because we believe that the evils that were attached to it are greater than the evils that were attached to the other system, and that a system can be devised by which both of these evils can largely be eliminated.  We do not want to deprive any local authority of the right to make a request to a central examining body for the best qualified person, in their opinion, to be named for them, but we do not want at the same time to put it in the power of the central authority, without consultation with the local authority, to say that this particular position must be filled by A, B or C.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Anthony pointed out, there is a very strong suspicion abroad, a suspicion which each of us in our own experience and in our own observation, and from our own contact with individuals has confirmed, a suspicion that there is not fair play being given in these appointments.  I will give you an example myself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree with the Ceann Comhairle that what I was saying was not strictly relevant.  The only reason why I introduce it at all is that it is indicative of the difference in the attitude of the Minister towards local government and the attitude of the majority, at least, of members on this side of the House.  I had hoped to be able to see how far we could, so to speak, go together upon the one road and then see exactly where we diverged.  I was taking the case of the Local Appointments Commission and was about to give examples, but I will not do it because to continue that would really not be in order.  I do not think, however, that the Minister has repudiated these words.  He is guilty of an extraordinary statement here, which Deputy O'Kelly read out at the beginning of the debate, and I would like to know whether he is just fooling about it, talking with his tongue in his cheek, or whether there is not some principle behind what he has said which it would be well for us to understand. <Col N="748" /> He says that the aim was to secure for the country whatever benefits could be obtained by getting local people to do all the local work under the most favourable conditions.  I am sure there is nobody in this House who would disagree with any Bill the purport of which was simply that&mdash;&ldquo;to secure for the country whatever benefits could be obtained by getting local people to do all the local work under the most favourable conditions.&rdquo; That, to my mind, is what we ought to aim at.  If the Minister only tried to aim at that, and if his legislation were tending in that direction, he would certainly find no opposition from the majority of members on this side of the House, because that must be the aim.  But how can we get these people to work?  Are they to be mere automatons, mere marionettes?  Are we going to have a system at the central headquarters by which we press a button and get these people to dance and do what we want?  Even the most typical militarist mind would not conceive the possibility of such a thing. Even where you have a large number of people regimented as in an army the best executive head of an army would not seek to make automatons of his officers and men and try to get them to march to whatever individual special directions he gave.  At best he would give a general outline of what he wanted to be done and there would be then a system of general education by which the individuals concerned would use their own brains in carrying out the work.  But the Minister steps in and tries to do what even a superman could not do.  He tries to determine for the local area what are the best policies, and who are the best officials, and interferes in their work in a way which is beyond his power and the power of any man.  There are limits even to Fordisation, as Ford himself has admitted. Instead of trying to have one central machine, because he recognises that there is a limit to the power of one person to supervise, he has had to allow a certain number of independent departments to be built up.  If we want to keep within the limits of <Col N="749" /> human possibility we must give up this idea of trying to centralise things at headquarters.</P>
      <P>We had an example the other day which shows how impossible it is for central officials to know exactly what is being done.  There was a case put up by Deputy O'Reilly about the flooding of the Boyne and Blackwater.  That has been going on for no less than four years to the knowledge of everybody locally.  It was a matter of concern to the local authorities for four years.  But when the Parliamentary Secretary was asked a question about it he did not know whether there had been any representations made by the County Council, although the County Council had been prepared to put up their share of the money for the work.  That is what is bound to happen when people take upon themselves more than can be humanly done.  Let us recognise our human limitations and put some stop to this greed and lust for power and concentrating everything into our own hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other aspect of it was dealt with very well by other Deputies. Apart from the impossibility of the task which the Department of Local Government are taking upon themselves, the whole tendency is a bad one from the point of view of the welfare of the people.  The natural training ground for public administration, the natural school from which our national administrators ought to come is from the local bodies, and if you let these people feel that they have no power or responsibility, if you are, in effect, wiping them out, if you are giving them officers whom they recognise as their masters and not their servants, what is going to happen?  You are certainly going to fit a certain number of people to be sent in here later as representatives who will sit silently by and allow the Ministry to do the whole work without any help and without any check by criticism or otherwise.  You are sapping that whole spirit of self-reliance of our people in public affairs.  You are bringing about a state of affairs like that in America and elsewhere, where the ordinary citizen stands aside and feels that he is helpless, feels that there are two <Col N="750" /> machines there, and that it is a case of Tweedledum and Tweedledee; that, as far as his life and liberty and livelihood are concerned, it matters very little to him who are the &ldquo;ins&rdquo; or the &ldquo;outs.&rdquo;  Such a thing in a large country may be an evil which is unavoidable. But here in this country it is avoidable.  This assumption of superiority on the part of Ministers, and on the part of some Deputies, is altogether unwarranted.  The members of local councils have just as much brains and ability as Deputies and Ministers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just as good men in local bodies in this country, and they are as valuable for local affairs as there are on any of these benches.  We hear the same sort of nonsense about civil servants, that we cannot get civil servants unless we pay them £1,500 per year.  There are as good brains going out in the emigrant ship for want of opportunity as there are in any of these posts.  It is a question of giving them the opportunity. The whole of this legislation tends to deny opportunity to the ordinary citizen to develop upon proper lines, to give the best service that is in him to the community as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us come back to the Minister's words: &ldquo;To secure for the country whatever benefits can be obtained by getting local people to do all the local work under the most favourable conditions.&rdquo; Let us stick to that and try to do it and not do what the Minister does in the next part of the sentence, make a mockery of it by bringing in a Bill at this time and then using these words, &ldquo;so that they could work on proper lines when carrying out of their own volition all the things that they want to do.&rdquo;&ldquo;Carrying out of their own volition!&rdquo; The man who uses these words brings in a Bill which puts it into his power to prevent them from carrying out the things of their own volition.  They have to do as his <Col N="751" /> puppets may order them to do.  When they try to do things in their own way, when they try to make appointments that will give satisfaction in their own areas, and do the best for their own people, the Minister steps in and says &ldquo;That appointment must not be made, no matter how qualified the person is; it must be made in accordance with the law,&rdquo; and he makes the law because his Party happens to be in the majority.  That is the position.  As far as we are concerned, we mean to resist that tendency as strongly as we can whenever it shows its head.</P>
    <P>We are opposing this measure now. It does not matter if the Minister passes it, because, so far as we are concerned, amongst the legislation that will go, as surely as a majority comes to this Party, anyhow is this; that is if there is to be this interference with local authority.  I do not wish to have any misunderstanding upon this.  It is possible to get a system by which nobody will be appointed to a local position who is not qualified.  I want that made clear.  There is to be no back door by which people not qualified are to come in, and it is not suggested, in our opposition to the appointments made, that the people were not qualified in the sense that they did not know the technique of their work.  We have not suggested that, but what is suggested is that there is favouritism in these appointments, and that such favouritism is bound to result when you have it in the power of a body, practically sitting in secret, to tell a local body that they must take this particular person and none other.  The moment you leave the choice open you prevent anything of that kind.  The possibility of favouritism is, to a large extent, ended the moment there is a choice left, but when you say that this is the person and none other, you are opening the door to favouritism. From the point of view of control, the local people will certainly be able to control their officials.  You may call a man a manager or a secretary, I do not care a pin, for that is not the point; so long as the local people can control and can see the work they want carried out satisfactorily by the <Col N="752" /> officials it is all right.  But does any Deputy think that the Minister for Local Government, sitting in his office in Dublin, with the variety of things that he has to do, depending as he must do on the reports he receives from members of his own staff, is in a position properly to supervise the local manager, and yet the local manager knows it does not matter what he does so long as he has the car of the Minister. We object to this type of legislation and intend on every possible occasion to object to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrThomasHennessy" hpid="Dr. Hennessy Dr. Hennessy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hennessy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy de Valera seems to suggest that the Minister makes all appointments.  The Deputy must know that the appointments made to local authorities are made through the means of a selection board, and this board supplies the candidates, after a very careful examination, in the order of merit.  I remember in the old days of the Sinn Fein movement the aim of Deputy de Valera and those associated with him was that merit alone should count in these cases, and my vote, when I gave it in the pre-Truce days for Sinn Fein, was very much influenced by that particular principle. Deputy de Valera and his Party have made it almost necessary that we should have an Appointments Commission and a Local Authorities Officers and Employees Act, for the very reason that his Party stands for manning the county councils, so far as they can, with their own supporters. Now I ask will every candidate have a fair chance if Deputy de Valera succeeds in manning local bodies with his own supporters?  Will not his supporters vote for people of the same political colour as themselves?  These are the things that concern me.</P>
      <P>I know very well that Deputy de Valera's Party has succeeded very well in a number of the appointments made by the Commission, and those who hold his views have received appointments simply because they were good men and deserved the appointments.  I would be very sorry that anything should preclude even the followers of Deputy de Valera when they have the merit from these appointments.</P>

      <P>I also know that on the selection boards there are quite a number of Deputy de Valera's supporters. I do not say they are actuated by politics.  They are not actuated by politics when making these selections. Independent bodies outside the selection boards are very jealous of the qualifications of the men appointed, and inquire into them when they are appointed.  Thus I say on the whole all these appointments are made on merit.  Then the Minister is criticised for adopting such a policy.  That policy has encouraged men, instead of seeking after political and other influences with the local authorities, to do post-graduate work, and all this post-graduate work is in the interest of the public.  Certainly nobody can challenge the fact that the local authorities, and the poor people entrusted to their care, never got such good medical men as they are getting under the present Minister for Local Government and Public Health.</P>

      <P>This Bill does not enshrine any new theory.  The Local Government Act of 1925, under Section 72, which deals with the dissolution of local bodies and the appointment by the Minister of a person or persons to take their places, also provides in sub-section (6) that the Minister may from time to time by order do all such things and make all such regulations as in his opinion shall be necessary to give full effect to any order under the section.  Under the Act of 1923, the same section appears as sub-section (6) of Section 12.  A recent judgment of the court made it clear that under these Acts when a body, say when a county council, was in the position that its mental hospital business was discharged by a committee consisting jointly of members of that council and of another council, and if that county council was dissolved for adequate reasons under either of these Acts, it was not possible to have a mental hospital committee or to get the work of the mental hospital committee carried out at all.  Implied in the judgment was also the fact that if the matter was before <Col N="756" /> the court they might decide that under similar circumstances, in the circumstances, say, of a county council being dissolved for adequate reasons, the Board of Health work could not possibly be carried out.</P>
      <P>The previous Acts of 1923 and 1925 did not intend that when a county council was dissolved, the Board of Health work should be let go by default, that nothing should be done about it, that the mental hospital committee work was going to be left in the air and completely discontinued. This Bill is to provide adequate machinery necessary to carry out the intentions of the Acts of 1923 and 1925. When persons talk about the consequences of the Acts, of which in fact it is the result, and the actions taken under Section 12 of the Act of 1923 and Section 2 of the Act of 1925, to put commissioners in the place of local bodies if they were not discharging their duties satisfactorily, I would ask them to go down to Ennis and to Trim or if they do not want to go to Kerry, Offaly, Leitrim, Dublin or Cork&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We are not asking you to read the Bills and to talk about their excellence one way or another. We are asking you to look at the results in the country.  If Deputy de Valera has his own ideas as to how a national civil service for the country should be run, we have ours.  We stand over them and we put them into operation.  We are asking you to judge us not on our words&mdash;whether they be words in regard to the powers and responsibilities of local bodies or as to the conceptions of a national civil service&mdash;but we ask you to look at our actions and their results.  Those who criticise the present Local Appointments Commission should really read the Act that deals with the matter, because it is impossible to take seriously representations made by Deputies in regard to the Local Appointment Commissioners and their work. They show what is plainly to be seen here, that they have no conception as to what is in the Act.  Deputy Hogan asked us whether we in the Department of Local Government are not running the affairs of the Department out of touch with local bodies, unadvised by local bodies.  We have the closest possible association both with members of local bodies and with officials of local bodies, and, where it is necessary to bring them into confidence on major matters, it is my policy and the policy of the Department to do so.  We do not bring them into conference to ask them general questions as to what local administration requires.  We bring them to discuss with us either the details of local problems in which they are interested, <Col N="758" /> or the general problems that may perhaps affect the roads of the county, the public health of the county, the poor law system, the housing system or the clean milk system.</P>

      <P>I move</P>
      <P>That the Dail disapproves of the action of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health in refusing to allow Deputies to make representations in person to the deciding officer on behalf of old age pension claimants whose cases are on appeal, whether at the instance of the Pension Officer or of the claimants themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The necessity for this motion arises out of the Order which the Minister for Local Government and Public Health made towards the end of 1929 prohibiting Deputies from making representations in person on behalf of old age pension claimants.  This order was made without any previous complaint having been made of abuses &mdash;if any such did arise&mdash;arising out of the practice that was in existence up to the end of 1929.  From 1922 to 1929 no objection was taken by the Minister for Local Government by officials of his Department to Deputies discharging this duty towards a section of the community not in a reasonable position to protect themselves and their interests.  I would like to know from the Minister what was the cause of the change of policy; of his altered outlook in this matter?  The Minister has from time to time advanced reasons in this House for his change of policy, that cannot be considered adequate or sufficient; that are in fact, childish reasons.  He suggested that representations in person by Deputies had the effect of obstructing the deciding officers in the course of their duties.  I will deal in more detail with that aspect of the question later.  I would like to mention at this stage that it requires <Col N="762" /> some explanation how such representations in person were not the cause of obstruction during the seven years from 1922 to 1929.</P>
    <P>In examining this question I would like that Deputies would approach it from the point of view of the rights of Deputies, of the rights of claimants and the tax-paying public as well as from the point of view of the most effective way of getting a proper administration of the old Age Pension Acts.  It appears to me to be a Deputy's duty to secure that people who are entitled to the old age pension will get it, and that they should not be deprived of it on any inaccurate or misleading representations that may be made against their claim.</P>
    <P>Similarly, it appears to me the duty and the right of a Deputy to ensure that nobody will secure an old age pension on any evidence that will not stand analysis.  From that aspect of the case I think it will be found that the margin of error is fairly small.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that it is the duty of a Deputy to ensure that public money is expended in accordance with law.  I submit, too, that it is the right of a Deputy to inquire into the working of any Department of State to see that the evidence on which a claim to public money is successfully established will stand the test of examination. With the possible exception of the Department dealing with military service pensions, there is no other department of State, to my knowledge at any rate where such a barrier is put up to prevent a member of this House from exercising his right and his duty to the people who elected him, as in the Department of Local Government, where these old age pension cases are dealt with.  A person of 70 years of age who fulfils certain statutory requirements as to means becomes entitled to an old age pension.  That is a legal right and a moral right.  To my mind it is the duty of every Deputy to ensure that persons of 70 years of age and over who fulfil the statutory requirements as to age will secure the pension which the <Col N="763" /> law entitles them to get.  It is quite obvious that that legal and moral claim cannot be successfully established if the claimant is not fully aware of the case that has been presented against him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government has repeatedly argued in this House that the fact that a claimant is entitled to be present when the sub-committee is examining the claim is sufficient protection for a claimant, that it is a sufficient precautionary measure to take to ensure that no injustice will be done to the claimant, and that if any further representations are required on the appeal stage these can be made in writing.  When a claimant applies for an old age pension the pension officer investigates the claim.  He reports to the sub-committee recommending either that the claim be disallowed or that a certain amount be awarded as pension.  There is nothing whatever in the law, or in the regulations issued either by the Revenue Department or the Old Age Pensions Department, that makes it obligatory on the pension officer to be present when the sub-committee is examining a case.  He may be present, but he may not be present. If he is present he is under no obligation to answer any questions that may be put to him.  He gives his figure. He estimates means at so much, and if he disagrees with the decision of the sub-committee he appeals.  The case then goes before the deciding officer for final decision.  I quite admit that if the pension officer is present when a sub-committee is examining a claim the members of the sub-committee, if they have a proper grasp&mdash;it is a big &ldquo;if&rdquo;&mdash;of the claimants right under the Old Age Pensions Acts, and cross-examines the pension officer, and &ldquo;if&rdquo; again, the pension officer is sufficiently agreeable to answer all the questions put to him, it is quite possible that the representations he intends to make on the appeal will be elicited before the sub-committee. But there are too many &ldquo;ifs&rdquo; in that to secure beyond any doubt that the claimant is going to get justice.  The biggest &ldquo;if&rdquo; is that the pension officer may not be there at all. If he is not, then his representations <Col N="764" /> to the deciding officer are never brought either to the notice of the sub-committee or to the notice of the claimant.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister will agree with me in this, that so far from the sub-committee being the protecting force to the claimant which the Minister seems to think they are, it very often happens that the claimant has to appeal against the decision of the sub-committee. Such appeals have been taken, and taken with success.  I think the fact that they have been taken at all is sufficient evidence, and establishes beyond doubt that it cannot be left to the sub-committee to ensure that the last word that can be effectively said will be said on behalf of the claimant.  The Minister argues that the claimant can be present.  The claimant can be present before the sub-committee. The Minister argues that there is no need for representation in person on the appeal.  Could anything be more absurd than to argue that these poor old people, many of whom are illiterate, many blind, and many physically unfit, can argue out their legal rights either before the sub-committee or before the appeals department against an expert in the actual interpretation of the Acts?  Anyone who knows the physical condition of the vast majority of the claimants will admit at once that, while some of them are fit to be present when the case is being debated&mdash;if it is debated&mdash;one in ten is not capable of presenting his case and making the best representations that could be made.  If a claimant for any of the reasons I have mentioned, either through disability or blindness, is unable to be present before the sub-committee, how is he to know what representations have been made behind his back at the sub-committee and to the deciding authority?</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Department have refused time and again to give details of the pension officer's report to claimants.  If that were done, if all the representations made by the pensions officer were disclosed, even though it would be much more troublesome to make representations in writing than to make them in person, still the possibilities of serious injustice <Col N="765" /> would be lessened to a great extent.  Up to the present the Minister has refused to accept that suggestion in the administration of the Acts.  The pension officer attributes a certain amount of income in his return.  A certain amount is given for an acre or for half an acre of potatoes, and a certain amount for oats.  The claimant has no means of knowing what the figure is.  Obviously if the pension officer has a figure of universal application it cannot be relied upon, inasmuch as there is a great difference in the yield of a crop on different classes of land.  The pension officer estimates a certain amount of income from a couple of cows on the farm.  If the claimant does not know the amount put on each head of stock he does not know whether the same income is being attributed to a cow 20 years old as to a cow 6 years old.  Surely in that case the claimant cannot successfully meet the case being made behind his back.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw attention to another point regarding written representations. I find in practice that when we make written representations, presenting all the features of the case that we think can possibly have any bearing on it, these representations are sent down to the pension officer for another secret report.  I called attention to this matter in the House before, and the Minister did not deny it.  I do not think he will do so now.  It may be all right, and the Minister is quite entitled to check through the pension officer any representations made on behalf of a claimant, but in practice it means that since we have been deprived of making representations in person, and since the files are denied to us, another secret report from the pension officer is sent up, while the claimant does not know what is going on behind his back.  If everything is above board, and if the Minister is only anxious to secure that those people will get the pension who are legally entitled to it, why should the files not be disclosed to Deputies?  Why should not the old people be entitled to make representations, either through Deputies or any other representative of their selection, in order to see what is the evidence, and what is the case made <Col N="766" /> behind their backs to the deciding officer?</P>
    <P>[<i>Professor Thrift took the Chair.</i>]</P>
    <P>I have previously drawn the attention of the Minister to the fact that a claimant was notified that the pension officer had appealed on the grounds of the claimant's qualification as to age. The Department was subsequently satisfied that the statutory qualification as to age had been fulfilled, but the pension was disallowed on another ground&mdash;means.  That has actually happened, and I quoted the case here some months ago.  I am prepared to quote another case that occurred within the last month.  In that particular case the statutory qualification which was the ground of the appeal was fulfilled, yet the pension was disallowed on another statutory qualification without any notice being given to the claimant.  That is not only grossly unfair, but, to my mind, it is dishonest. When the claimant is notified that there is an appeal by the pension officer on the ground of age, that claimant is entitled to assume&mdash;he cannot in reason assume anything else &mdash;that the only ground for appeal is the question of age.</P>
    <P>If personal representations to the Department were allowed, if Deputies were in a position to see the files, such things would not occur as an appeal on the grounds of age being disallowed on the ground of means.  The Minister may challenge the accuracy of the assertion, but I am prepared to give proof.  Wrong and unjust decisions are liable to be arrived at on the ground of age in the absence of personal representation before the deciding officer.  I have known it to happen that where statutory evidence of age has not been procurable, the pension officer has turned up an old school register and an extract from that register has been submitted as evidence of the claimant's age.  These extracts have, to my knowledge, been submitted without the claimint being acquainted that such evidence was going to be used against him.  The same applies to marriage certificates.  The heads of the Old Age Pensions Department will inform the <Col N="767" /> Minister, if he does not know it already, that I have proved these school registers to be inaccurate to the extent of a period of ten years.  I have done that by submitting birth certificates side by side with extracts from school registers.</P>
    <P>The system that permits of the possibility of such evidence of age being put before the appeals department, behind the backs of claimants, is wrong.  That is what is happening since the files of evidence have been refused to Deputies.  Such a system is bound to result in grave injustice to claimants.  The Minister may hold that all these matters have been argued before the sub-committees and hence before the claimants.  There is nothing in the instructions issued to pension officers to ensure that any of the evidence I have referred to ever goes before the sub-committee or the claimant. What is the real reason for this order? The Minister will scarcely suggest that the deciding officer could not resist the representations made by members of this House.  If that is his case, then the deciding officer who is not capable of resisting representations by Deputies should not be in office.  If the deciding officer is capable of resisting personal appeals by Deputies, I cannot see how anything could be wrong in ensuring that injustice will not be done to claimants by having these personal representations made.  The only line the Minister can take is that he may suggest that Deputies going into the appeals department hold up business. If the Minister makes that case, it will not be consistent with the facts.</P>
    <P>Often I have been thanked by officers in the appeals department for the efforts I made in procuring all the evidence possible for or against a claimant.  When evidence against a claimant was turned up by Deputies, on this side of the House at any rate, that evidence was given to the deciding officer just as well as evidence in favour of the claimant.  I have been told by responsible officers in the Department that Deputies here were of great assistance to them in arriving at proper decisions.  The Minister may not admit that, but it is true, and perhaps <Col N="768" /> the occasion will arise sometime in the future when it can be proved to be true.</P>
    <P>It is a strange thing that the old age pensioners are the only people in the country who are to be deprived of the assistance of their elected representatives when endeavouring to secure their legal rights.  I have never heard a Deputy here say that we were denied access to the Agricultural Credit Corporation, to the Housing Department when grants were in question, or to the Revenue Commissioners when we were being charged too much income tax.  I have never heard it suggested that the claimant of a military service pension could not secure the personal representation of a Deputy or a lawyer or any other person.  Even in the case of those able-bodied men who are well able to present their own arguments, and who are appearing before a tribunal that has a good deal of sympathy with them, not only are they allowed to be represented by Deputies, Ministers, officers, and lawyers, but the people who are giving evidence on their behalf are guaranteed that, no matter how false their representations may be, the light of day will never be let in upon them.  The Minister may defend that attitude.</P>
    <P>The old age pensioners may not be as important a body from the political point of view as the people who are drawing military service pensions.  At the same time, the Minister ought to consider the justice of the case, regardless altogether of the political aspect. The other pensioners who are afforded all the facilities it is possible to afford them are able-bodied men, most of them able to earn a living if they would only work.</P>
    <P>I hope this debate will have the effect of securing the withdrawal of this objectionable order.  It will certainly make for better administration of the Acts, and it will bring about the removal of a very grave injustice that is now being inflicted on the aged poor.  It may possibly have a damaging effect on Deputies in this House, who have got into lackadaisical methods of discharging their duties, and who are too lazy to make either personal or written representation. <Col N="769" /> If this order is removed it will have an effect on the Deputies who will not bother about old age pensioners and who up to this have contented themselves by saying: &ldquo;The Minister has made an order that I cannot appear in his Department in your behalf, and, consequently, I cannot do anything for you.&rdquo;  I think the number of Deputies who would deal with the matter in that way is very small, and I appeal to the Minister to ignore them.  Some of them, no doubt, are very influential, and possibly most of them could be found on the Minister's own Benches.</P>

      <P>I am rather glad that we have been afforded an opportunity of discussing this motion.  I hope, whatever its fate will be, that during the lifetime of this Parliament, at any rate, no opportunity will be missed of raising in one form or another the principle underlying the motion.  Deputy Ward has properly said that this motion concerns claimants for pensions in the first instance.  The most important issue, however, that arises is the extent to which members of the House are entitled to discharge their duties to their constituents.  Most of us who are intimately connected with the administration of the Pensions Acts both in the country and in the Local Government Department heard with amazement of the decision to exclude members of the House from access to the Department dealing with pension appeals. I waited with some wonder for the explanation of this decision.  I have not yet heard any reasonable explanation why the Minister resorted to this extraordinary action.  I think it was suggested that a certain amount of congestion arose in the Local Government Department, the portion of it in which this Act is administered, and that congestion was due to the intervention of members of the House. The responsibility for remedying a position of that kind lies in the hands of the Minister.  The Minister cannot absolve himself of any responsibility <Col N="770" /> by adopting the attitude he has adopted.</P>
      <P>Appeals in regard to old age pensions come under two headings, age and means.  The whole question of the right of people to obtain old age pensions was reviewed when legislation was passed here in 1924.  The rights of people on reaching a certain age to obtain an old age pension were tremendously restricted by the legislation passed at that time.  Not alone did the legislation provide a certain reduction in the maximum amount of pensions, but it included numerous restrictions with regard to the amount of the pension following the investigation of means.  To repeat what has been said on dozens of occasions, one of the most extraordinary defects in the administration of the Act is the absence of any standard for computing means.  In different areas means are assessed in different fashions.  We have failed to elicit from the Minister or his officers any explanation as to the method by which means are computed. I have had numerous instances of the discrepancies that arise in the manner in which different officers assess means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who are associated with old age pension committees can see that enormous difficulties are placed in the way of claimants who come forward to satisfy the local committee and the pensions officer, or who come forward in the end to satisfy the Department, as to the particular position they are in, having regard to the manner in which the facts are presented in the first instance to the pensions committees. I have had occasion to draw the Minister's attention in this House to the action of pension officers in resorting to the most extraordinary expedients to assess means.  I pointed out on one occasion here where a pensions officer, investigating a certain case, asked casually the claimant whether she had received any money from members of the family abroad. After some inquiry he ascertained that the sum of a few pounds was sent occasionally, not regularly, to the home from children in America.  The pension officer solemnly entered a certain figure as an annual contribution <Col N="771" /> from members of that claimant's family in America.  I consider that was a gross wrong to the claimant and a most extraordinary method of calculating the means of that particular person.  One knows the position in the country quite well.  Members of the family will send a few pounds to old people at home, and they might not be in a position to send anything again for years.</P>
    <P>The method of assessing £5 or £10 a year as regular income for the old people at home seems to me to be an entirely unfair and extraordinary method of approaching the examination of cases of that kind.  I mention that in order to show that it would be absolutely necessary for claimants for old age pensions to avail of the widest opportunities for having the facts of the case presented to the Department when the cases come before them for final decision.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made a case in this House that he has suddenly come to regard the deciding officers in the Local Government Department as constituting a court.  In a court, the normal practice is not alone to allow persons to present a case against a particular defendant, but the normal practice is to allow that defendant facilities for rebutting that case.  If the Minister regards the deciding officers in the old age pensions branch of the Local Government Department as constituting a court, then he has very carefully shut out the possibility of representations being made on behalf of the person whose case is being investigated by that court.  He suggests that representations are made in writing.  Representations come up from the pension officer after the cases have been heard by the local committees.  The Minister's predecessor in office demonstrated on numerous occasions that he had no regard whatever for the decisions of old age pensions committees.  Old age pensions committees exist in the Minister's assumption for the purpose of passing claims, whether there is very much foundation for the claims or not. I have no doubt that that is the official view.  It has been declared in <Col N="772" /> this House more than once, and representations have been made by old age pensions sub-committees.  Very little importance, in my opinion, is attached to such representations.  That being so, the representations sent by the pensions officers constitute the only evidence before the Minister's officers when the cases are being finally decided except for any representations that may be conveyed in writing by members of this House.  I have no objection to conveying representations for any particular case in writing.  I think that applies to members in this House in general who are anxious in the fullest and most efficient way to serve the interests of those who happen to be claimants for old age pensions, but I consider it is a very defective way of doing so.</P>
    <P>On the one hand, the representations of the old age pensions officer are contained in a certain file, and the points in favour of the old age pension claims submitted by a Deputy may run very sharply counter to the official view as contained in the report of the pensions officer.  I have had many instances of the necessity for having the two reports compared, and an exchange of views as between the local representatives, who know the circumstances of the case, and the officer who comes to decide the case in the end.  I consider that it is loading the dice heavily against the old age pensions claimant to deny that facility. I am not certain that the explanation of this whole change has not been a strong feeling in the mind of the Minister that there are too many old age pensions being obtained in the country.  We have had figures made available in this House on more than one occasion showing the number of old age pensions passed in Scotland, England and other countries, and the number in this country.  I feel myself that the pension officers in a great many cases, not in all cases, set themselves out deliberately to make certain that as few people as they possibly can will secure old age pensions.  I am quite sure that, at the back of his own mind, the Minister has something approaching the same view.</P>
    <P>If that is not so, the Minister or the <Col N="773" /> Minister for Finance ought to have no objection whatever in laying before this House a copy of the instructions issued to pensions officers as to the manner in which means of claimants should be investigated and as to the manner in which they should approach the examination in such cases.  Unquestionably there are men in the service of the Department of Finance and of the Department of Local Government administering the Old Age Pensions Act down the country who are not fit for their positions.  I had occasion to remind the Minister for Finance some three or four years ago of the action of a certain officer of his Department in investigating old age pension claims down the country.  He was extremely rude, aggressive, and unfair in the manner in which he received people who went to him in connection with such cases.  There is no question about it but people claiming old age pensions, old people, enfeebled, illiterate, and suffering from many handicaps, are not in the best position to present their cases sometimes even intelligibly.  They are not received sympathetically.  If due allowance is not made for their difficulty and for the limitations of their education, then there is a difficulty arising that is going seriously to prejudice their cases.</P>
    <P>When I brought a series of instances where that was occurring to the notice of the Minister for Finance he referred the matter for investigation to an officer of his Department.  I was informed in a very brief official communication a few weeks afterwards, that the charges I made against that particular officer were groundless. At this very moment, in the Minister's Department, there is ample corroboration, arising on a much more serious charge, of the truth of my statement and of the fact that the officer concerned on that particular occasion was absolutely reckless in the manner in which he discharged his public duties, and barren of any kind of sympathy whatsoever for the people who happened to be the victims of his administration. I join in the protest that has been made against the exclusion of members, not alone in this particular connection, but because I regard it as <Col N="774" /> the beginning of a policy which is manifesting itself in other Departments of the State.</P>
    <P>I feel that the position of people claiming old age pensions is going to be very seriously prejudiced if members of this House have not an opportunity of discussing with the particular officers who are dealing with these cases, every item that arises in the course of their duties.  I think it would be an advantage both from the point of view of the fair and just administration of the Act, as well as from the point of view of the claimants, if the Minister would revise his decision, and realise that many facts would be elicited in the course of an exchange of views dealing with the claims under review.  The argument that the officers dealing with cases of this kind should be regarded in a judicial sense, and ought to be free from personal approach is one that has very little weight behind it, and ought not to be seriously advanced in this House.  If there is any other reason for it then, we ought to have it.</P>
    <P>Personally, I feel that members of this House who approach the Old Age Pensions Department in cases of this kind take the most difficult and inconvenient way of dealing with the matter, because it would be much easier to write a letter and get a reply which could be furnished to the claimant. But if a Deputy wants to discharge his duty in the most painstaking and efficient way I think it would be by going to the Department and eliciting the fullest possible information in regard to the case.  I consider that the Minister has much to explain in shutting out members of this House from approach to the Department, and I hope that the House will indicate its disapproval of the Minister's action in that respect.</P>

      <P>In my five years' membership of the Dáil, of which I am very proud, I have never heard a motion moved in this House with which I have less sympathy and for which there is less foundation than the motion now before the House.  I think I can claim, with Deputy Ward and Deputy Murphy, that during that <Col N="775" /> period I have been a friend of the old age pensioners.  I think I have shown that friendship, and I have, by my own vote, with the full knowledge and appreciation of the consequences, given the Executive Council a rest for a few days from the stormy sea of office.  I showed my disapproval of the views of the Executive Council towards the old age pensioners. I still hold these views, and I am going to hold them, but it is not because I hold those views that I am going to give support to a motion of this sort, a motion which is brought forward in the worst interests of the old age pensioners.  My support of the old age pensioners, and the support of the group with which I have been associated, has been more effective than the support either of the Opposition Party or the Labour Party, because in consequence of our support the position of the old age pensioners has been improved, and to-day they are not in the same position that they were in when I came to this House.  We have been told time and time again that we hold the balance of power. Well we have improved the position of the old age pensioners.  The chief Opposition Party spoke, the Labour Party spoke, but the Independent group delivered the goods.  That is the difference between them.  I had a good deal of experience of the old system.  I want to say at once that I absolutely dissent from what Deputy Murphy has just said&mdash;that he found officials of the Department of Local Government who were rude and aggressive.</P>

      <P>I wish to make this point clear to the House, that I speak with more experience of the officials of the Local Government Department than any other Deputy in this House.  I have forty years' personal experience of them, and during that time, I want to say, both of the old staff and of the new staff, that I have never met an official of the Local Government Department who was rude, aggressive, or unfair.  They have always done their duty in a proper way.  Among Government Departments it is the one Department against which nobody could say one word.</P>
      <P>I have spent afternoons in the Local Government Department, and I have found the officials not merely fair but absolutely able and courteous to a fault.  My friend, Deputy Donovan, my colleague from West Cork, generally accompanied me.  I remember saying to him: &ldquo;How long will the officials of the Local Government Department put up with the insults that are shied at them.&rdquo;  People go down there.  I have listened to them speaking aggressively to them, and I was wondering when the time would come when the officials would be spared from the insults that were being shied at them, and shied at them in my presence. I am glad that the Minister came to that decision.  It is only fair to his staff.  Of course, I must not forget the bouquet which Deputy Ward has thrown at the members of the Chief Opposition Party when he said that they spent their spare time under the old system in presenting objections against applicants and that he has been thanked over and over again for his services in that direction.  I do not suggest that at any time I presented any objection against an old age pensioner's application.</P>

I do not want to be critical, and I am the last man who would be personal if I could avoid it, but there are in this House, irrespective of Party, certain Deputies who are incapable of presenting fairly and squarely&mdash;this is between ourselves, of course&mdash;the case of an applicant for an old age pension. I have seen them there.  I do not know any Deputy more incapable of presenting a case on behalf of an applicant for an old age pension than a man like Deputy Ward, who is obsessed with <Col N="781" /> the delusion that he understands the Old Age Pensions Act.  He is an absolute source of danger to applicants.</P>
      <P>It is for that reason, if for no other, that I, as a friend of the old age pensioners, welcome the decision of the Minister to make Deputies who are filled with that idea keep clear of the Custom House.  It is not fair to the old age pensioners, and I hope that for that reason, if for no other, the Minister will stand over his decision and not allow himself to be ballyragged into allowing a lot of people who do not know what they are talking about to come and interfere with the work that is being done.  I have a great deal of experience of the new system and I know no better system than that which the Minister has undertaken.  Under the new system, I write to the Ministry of Local Government in connection with an application and I am told in reply of the grounds of the decision arrived at.  I get an opportunity of presenting the evidence, not in haphazard conversations in which I might present arguments against as well as for, but I get a due and considered opportunity of presenting the case of the applicants and I do it.  I am bound to say that in my experience of the new system it has worked out very successfully and very well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been some suggestions made here by Deputy Dr. Ward and, in some degree, by my colleague, Deputy T. Murphy, that there prevails in the Ministry of Local Government the view that there are too many old age pensioners.  Speaking once again as a friend of the old age pensioners and with a good deal of experience, I say there is not a particle of truth in that.  I never presented a case, whether under the old system or under the new, that was not fairly and squarely heard.  It was not always decided with me; it was very often decided against me.  But I do differ from Deputy Ward to this extent, that whenever I get my gruelling I am able to take it.  He is not.  I do not assume that I am always right.  I know I am very often right, but not always right, but when I am told I am wrong I take the decision of the sympathetic <Col N="782" /> tribunal in the proper spirit. I take it without imputing to them any unfairness, aggressiveness or rudeness.  I know they are men who, in my view, are sympathetically carrying out the Old Age Pensions Act, and I think the great danger of this motion is that it might render the Minister a little bit sour towards the old age pensioners.  I ask him, on behalf of the old age pensioners, to forget the rude things said in support of this motion and to keep on steadily in the course he has hitherto followed.</P>
    <P>We recognise, so far as the Minister and his staff are concerned, that his action and their action have been above and beyond reproach on behalf of the old age pensioners for whom I have qualified myself to speak.  I take advantage of this opportunity, and it is not a thing I often do, to say a word in praise of the Minister.  I want to praise both the Minister for Local Government and his staff for their action in the administration of the Old Age Pensions Act, and the last word I will say to the Minister is that he should not allow his officials to be insulted.</P>

      <P>I must say I was very much impressed by the sincerity of Deputy Wolfe's speech.  He at least is honest enough to tell the House what his position and the position of his Party&mdash;the Independents&mdash;is and what their influence is.  He has definitely told us that he and his Party are responsible for the Government's action in the past on the old age pensions question.  He is at least definite in that.  We have been endeavouring to make it known in the country for a long time back that the influence that controls affairs in this country is the influence of the Independent Deputies, of which Deputy Wolfe is one.  That statement has been denied, but Deputy Wolfe has now confirmed by his statement that the Independents are the people that control the policy of the Government in this affair of old age pensions and in every other affair as well.</P>

      <P>He tells us it is they that control the affairs in this country and he is proud of their action.  We may take it from the statement made by Deputy Wolfe that the first intimation was given to the Government by Deputy Wolfe and his colleagues that this order should be made.  Therefore the old age pensioners up and down the country can assume and, indeed, may take it as definite that if they are denied the right of having their cases represented before that final court, they are denied that right because the Independents in this House think it right that they should be denied it.  Therefore the old age pensioners in the country must be content to occupy a position that no other class of persons in the State occupy, not even the meanest criminals occupy, because they are denied the right to make personal representation before the court that has to try them.</P>

    <P>The Independent Deputies are responsible for that position, and the old age pensioners in the country can say &ldquo;We know now, at last, who are the people that deny us the right of the ordinary citizens of this State.&rdquo;  These people are the Independent Deputies in this House.  The Government, yielding to the dictation of that Party have made a special order to put outside the bounds of the ordinary law in this case that section of the community which consists of the old age pensioners.  Deputy Wolfe was present at the Custom House on several occasions, and spent pleasant evenings there.  He found a number of people who went there to interview the officials of the Department, and he asked himself the question how long should this continue. He saw men approaching the officials to put forward a case on behalf of old age pensioners, and he heard insults hurled at the officials, and his sense of righteousness as a member of the <Col N="784" /> Independent Party in this House that controls the Government and the State, made him ask himself the question &ldquo;how long will this continue.&rdquo; I suggest to Deputy Wolfe that if he was looking after the interests of old age pensions in the Custom House, he should not have been present when the officials were dealing with any cases except those in which he was interested himself. If he was, he was abusing his position which entitled him to be present.  If he insisted on being present on such occasions, he was guilty of very bad taste indeed, by inflicting himself on a company in which he should not be present.  He is responsible with his Party, first of all, for having this order inflicted.</P>

      <P>I never said that.  I have pleaded guilty on behalf of my Party, for having increased the old age pension, but nothing else.  The Deputy can object to that as long as he likes.</P>

      <P>He is responsible, according to his own statement, and his Party are responsible for the policy of the Government.  I suggest I can interpret that only in one way, namely that he and his Party are responsible for directing the Government to make such an order as we are now discussing. They have done that.  He comes now to pay the price to the Government&mdash;to stand by them.  I presume he is going to give an order to his Party to defend the Government in opposing this motion of ours.  We can take it therefore that the Independent Party having made the order will see with the assistance of the Government that it will be carried out and adhered to.</P>
