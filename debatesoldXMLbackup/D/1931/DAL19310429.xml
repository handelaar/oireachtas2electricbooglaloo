      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state whether the Government have considered the recommendations contained in paragraph 53 of the Report of the Old Age Pension Committee of Enquiry, 1926, with reference to the remuneration of clerks of pension committees and sub-committees, and whether it is proposed to carry the recommendations into effect.</P>

      <P>I had occasion, some two years ago, to consider very fully the question of investigating locally claims for repayment in respect of sums subscribed <Col N="382" /> to the Dáil Eireann (Internal) Loan, 1919-20.  I came finally to the conclusion, however, that any such arrangement would not be more helpful than the measures which are at present being taken to investigate claims.  In the circumstances, I regret that I cannot see my way to adopt the Deputy's suggestion.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister inform us what scheme there is for arriving at a correct conclusion as to the true investors in this locality?  I would like to know that because of the peculiar circumstances.  At the time the treasurer, Fr. Conroy, was very particular about the matter.  He was so anxious, indeed, that he came up first with the money in order to ensure that the deposit would be safe and correct.  He had at the time the intention of making a second journey with the list of names.  If he had been arrested in those difficult times he was afraid that the money and names might be found on him together and by making separate journeys he realised he would evade any particular difficulty that might arise in the circumstances.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will state why, to supervise the examinations held on 8th-10th April, 1931, in connection with Intermediate School Scholarships and entrance to Preparatory Colleges, superintendentships were not, at least for Gaeltacht and Breac-Ghaeltacht candidates, confined to persons with a good knowledge of Irish, and why among superintendents selected for such centres as Gaillimh, Beul an Mhuirthid, Daingean Uí Chúise and Cathair-Saidhbhín, were persons with practically no knowledge of Irish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Professor O'Sullivan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of centres at the examinations referred to was increased this year owing to the setting up of additional centres in the Gaeltacht.  In making the arrangements for the examinations it was found necessary to utilise inspectors and some other experienced persons for the purpose of applying oral tests in Irish, English and Music.  The charge of the examination papers and the immediate superintendence of the examination rooms had, accordingly, to be devolved on such officials from the indoor staff of the Department as could be spared.</P>
      <P>Every effort was made to send fluent speakers of Irish to the Fíor-Ghaeltacht centres, but it was not always possible to do so owing to the exigencies of work in the Department at the time of the examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>With all deference to the Minister's opinion, they are important, and I think we ought to have them, inasmuch as the truth or accuracy of the live register has to be gauged by the number of books in the Exchanges.  I ask the Minister <Col N="387" /> to let us have the particulars asked for immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to hesitate now about giving figures on the basis submitted by the Deputy, because there is no reasonable case that can be made.  Books are lodged when persons previously in insurable occupations are thereafter in non-insurable occupations or unemployed. There is a wide difference between that and unemployment.</P>

      <P>Replying to a question about a month ago the Minister gave me figures relative to books held in the Exchanges and the number of people on the live register.  These two numbers are comparable, but I want the number on the 9th March, the last date on which the Minister gave me the figures on the live register.  I want to compare these two, and I suggest that in the interest of the Minister's own defence of the live register he should give me the figures so that they can be compared.</P>

      <P>Though the price to be paid for beet is primarily a matter for settlement between the Irish Sugar Manufacturing Company, Limited, as buyers and the Irish Sugar Beet Growers' Association as representing sellers, the Government, as the Deputy is aware, has intervened in this matter on several occasions.  The only modification of their terms for the purchase of beet of this year's growth which the company made as a result of these interventions was to agree to pass on to growers part of the advantage which the company would derive in the event of sugar prices advancing.  The company definitely intimated by letter, dated 17th instant, that they had no offer to make other than that set out in the contract form which they had issued to farmers.  In these circumstances, it would appear that no useful purpose would be served by further intervention on the part of the Government, unless both parties primarily concerned request such action.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the best thing for the Minister or the Deputy, or any other Deputy interested, to do is to see me as to what could be done by way of Debate in the Dáil. The matter, it seems to me, could not <Col N="393" /> be raised even on the Minister's Estimate, because the Minister is not responsible for the price the Irish Sugar Manufacturing Company pays the growers or the price the growers demand.  Therefore the matter can hardly be raised upon the Estimate, nor can it be raised as a matter of urgent public importance unless the responsibility of the Minister is clear.  If the Minister had a clear responsibility, opportunity could be found to debate the matter, but if the Minister is not responsible it cannot be raised as a matter of urgent public importance.</P>

      <P>I shall answer the four questions together.  Inquiry will be made by the Land Commission into the questions of drainage, roads, turbary, and erosion referred to by the Deputy in his four questions, relative to the Stoney Estate, in order to ascertain how far, if at all, they are matters to be undertaken by the Land Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilroy</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Parliamentary Secretary been informed by his Department as to what steps they are about to take?  I am given to understand, as far as coast erosion is concerned, that for the last 20 years there are about 50 acres of land less.  That is a great disadvantage to the tenants there.  So far as roads are concerned, the people have been given their turbary for 23 years, and they are unable to make any use of it because of the lack of road services.  They further suffer a great disadvantage by being unable to get turf off their turbary land.</P>

I am not in a position to say what steps will be taken until the Land Commission has an opportunity of examining the inspector's report with regard to erosion. Erosion may have taken place, to a slight extent, in that area, but considerable accretion has also taken place, with the result that an island which originally was separated from the mainland has recently become attached to the mainland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice in the report of the discussions of the various Committees of the League of Nations circulated by the Minister that there appears to be considerable disagreement amongst the representatives of various countries as to what the exact significance of the most-favoured-nation clause in commercial treaties is. I would be glad if the Minister would tell us exactly what interpretation his Government has put on that clause. References, for example, have appeared in the Press to a contemplated customs union between Germany and Austria.  Are we to understand that whatever commercial advantages are accorded to Austria, under that arrangement, will also be accorded to the Irish Free State, or are special arrangements of that kind excluded?  Similarly, a question may arise for us if at any future time it was decided to limit the importation of classes of goods by means other than tariffs.  One of the questions raised at that League of Nations Committee was whether in such circumstances we would be bound to take steps to provide that the same proportion of the goods concerned would. come in from Germany as in the past.  If, for example, the Free State Government decided to restrict the importation of barley, not by means of a tariff, but by the fixing of a quota, would we be under any obligation to ensure that German barley would still be imported in the same proportion as in the past, under the quota arrangement.  These are points upon which there appears to have been a difference of opinion <Col N="405" /> amongst representatives of the various countries at Geneva.  I would like if the Minister would clear up the matter on the first occasion on which a motion of this character is being brought before the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the customs union, I can be precise.  Most-favoured-nation treatment has not hitherto been extended to customs unions made between two countries, or even, in fact, to identical customs standards which are adopted as between contiguous countries.  As a matter of fact, if this country likes to enter into the same relation with Austria as Germany is at present entering into, there is an offer at the moment that that should be done, and the country has only to accept that offer to get these terms.  It is not, however, offered by reason of this Treaty.</P>
      <P>With regard to the interpretation of the phrase &ldquo;the most-favoured-nation treatment&rdquo; there is some difficulty, but more in its application to new policies that are being discussed at the moment at Geneva than otherwise.  It is quite clear that I cannot decide here a matter which the League of Nations has thought of such importance as to establish a Special Committee to deal with.  As the term is understood at the moment, it has a pretty clear application, in a rough and ready way, that we favour no country more with regard to the specific matters mentioned, that is, that whatever is regarded by Germany as favoured treatment must also be given to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to quotas, the view largely held is that they would be fraught with such difficulties in their determination that they would almost lead to the denunciation of the most-favoured-nation clause in treaties. That view, of course, is not completely held.  I would not like to say it is held as the majority opinion of the nations whose commercial relations are based upon most-favoured-nation treatment. At any rate, that question can only be decided in the particular circumstances of a particular scheme with regard to quotas.  The principle is fairly clear that a nation must get the treatment which is given to the nation that is <Col N="406" /> most favoured in the commercial relations of this country in the specific cases that are mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to raise another point.  I was not aware that this matter was coming on to-day.  It has been on the Order Paper for quite a long time.  When the terms of this Treaty were being negotiated, did the Minister give any consideration to the fact that some economic dislocation had been caused here by the importation of subsidised oats from Germany? Would he not consider it advisable to have endeavoured to include in the Treaty some safeguard for producers of that cereal in this country against subsidised competition of that kind? Did he attempt to do so, and, if so, what was the result?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not attempted.  It would have been going away from the basis of most-favoured-nation treatment altogether.  There is observable a tendency to change. Up to very recently, the continental system was tending rigidly towards a scheme of most-favoured-nation treatment and no attention was paid to specific items.  On the basis of taking out one particular article, the Germans would do no business whatever. As a matter of fact, the export bounty system with regard to oats has been withdrawn recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The only point arising in that connection is this: In how far would this Treaty limit us if we found ourselves in a position in which it would be advisable for us definitely to exclude subsidised products of any kind if the only country subsiding the exportation of such products was Germany?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. McGilligan) Patrick McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of this Bill.  It has been <Col N="407" /> before the House for a considerable time.  It is founded upon the recommendation of the Commission which was set up to deal with the question of technical education and which considered this subject incidental thereto and reported upon it.  The Bill is also based largely upon the provisions of the two Acts to which that particular Commission's Report referred. It is based upon the voluntary principle.  The scheme of it is this: that where an application is made by either employers or employees in a trade&mdash;I am now speaking of trades generally and for the moment leaving out trades which are affected by the Trade Board Acts&mdash;then it is within the power of the Minister to declare that trade a designated trade.  Once it has been declared a designated trade, certain other things follow as a consequence.  Apprenticeship districts have to be scheduled.  The country is marked out into certain apprenticeship areas or districts, and for the trade in these areas or districts a committee is set up.  The committee will consist, in the main, of an equal number of representatives of employers and employees, with the addition of appointed members, to a maximum of three, who will be appointed by the Minister concerned. That committee then must make certain regulations, and may make certain others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The important section dealing with this matter is Section 8.  Rules which the Apprenticeship Committee must make are: Firstly, that employment &ldquo;in the designated trade for which such committee is established of any specified class of persons in any specified manner shall constitute employment by way of apprenticeship in such trade&rdquo;; secondly, rules relating to the period including any probationary period of employment by way of apprenticeship in such trade; thirdly, rules in relation to the minimum rates of wages to be paid during the apprenticeship period; and, fourthly, rules in connection with the hours to be worked by the apprentices.  When a trade is scheduled as a designated trade and when the country is divided for the purposes of that trade into <Col N="408" /> apprenticeship areas or districts, apprenticeship committees will be established. These committees then must make rules dealing with these four points: that is, classification with regard to apprenticeship, the period of employment by way of apprenticeship, the hours to be worked and the minimum wages.</P>
    <P>In addition, the committee may make rules on the other matters set out in sub-section (2) of Section 8&mdash; that is, rules in relation to the educational qualifications of persons entering on employment by way of apprenticeship in the designated trade; in relation to the age limits within which employment by way of apprenticeship may commence; requiring employers carrying on such trade in such districts to train and instruct apprentices employed by them in a specified manner, and rules relating to the number of persons who may be employed by way of apprenticeship in such trade in any particular premises in such district.</P>
    <P>The rules when made will come up for confirmation.  If they are confirmed, then they apply to a series of sections in the Bill, and a breach of them becomes an offence.  These sections run from 8 to 21.  Section 22 sets out the additional functions that the apprenticeship committee may have cast upon it.  Section 25 ordains that every apprenticeship committee shall cause a register of apprentices to be kept.  Section 27 provides that the employers must furnish certain specified particulars in relation either to apprentices generally, or to specified apprentices employed by them.  Section 26, for the purpose of the better enforcement of this Bill when it becomes an Act, gives the right of audience at meetings of the apprenticeship committee to authorised officers.  They are defined as people who may be authorised by the Minister concerned to exercise the powers conferred under the Act.</P>
    <P>At the moment, there are certain trades which are regulated by the Trade Board Acts.  Committees have been appointed under these Acts.  As these Committees would have certain functions in common with the committees to be set up under this Bill we decided <Col N="409" /> that where an application is made by a particular area in which a committee has been established under the Trade Board Acts, it is that committee which, in the first instance, will make application to the Minister for the designation of that trade. Thereafter that committee will be established as the apprenticeship committee for the purpose of that particular trade.</P>
    <P>The scheme is based entirely upon the voluntary principle.  A trade will not be designated unless there is an application from a trade board committee, if one be in existence, to have a particular trade designated, or, if such committee be not there already, unless employers or employees in a business make representations to the Minister to have a trade designated. When the Minister accedes to either application and proceeds to designate the trade then the rest follows.  There will then be the division of territory, the appointment of the Apprenticeship Committee and the making of the rules by the Apprenticeship Committee in relation to the four matters described in sub-section (1) of Section 8.  In addition to that the other matters referred to may be dealt with by the committee.  Once the rules have been made and confirmed breaches of them will count as an offence.  From that time on all the matters referred to in Section 8, and to which I have referred, are fixed and settled with regard to a trade in a particular area.  Once these rules are put forward and confirmed rules may be made by the Apprenticeship Committee regulating the educational qualifications of persons entering on employment by way of apprenticeship in the designated trade, rules relating to the training to be given by the employers to the apprentices as long as the trade remains a designated trade, rules requiring that the employer and the employee shall remain in a particular relationship, as well as rules in regard to the age limit within which the employment may commence.  There will be the further point&mdash;it will be a ticklish one&mdash;to be dealt with, and that is in regard to the number of apprentices allowed in relation to the number of actual workmen engaged.  There may <Col N="410" /> be some difficulty experienced in operating this rule.  It may appear the rule that will be most likely to cause difficulty because it distinctly ordains that if the rule is made it has to be a rule made in relation to the number of persons employed by way of apprenticeship in a particular premises in such district.</P>
    <P>There is not much good in a committee for a particular trade declaring, even in a limited area that the number of apprentices to workmen is to be so many unless power is given to somebody to enforce the regulation and say that the number of apprentices must be divided out even over the particular individuals employed in the business.  There again the circumstances of each individual business and individual tradesman will have to be taken into consideration. It is clear that in a big establishment you might employ the full proportion of apprentices allowed under the regulation.  Possibly it is not so easy to ensure that the actual proportions can be kept in a very small establishment. There will have to be some discrimination allowed and that will be done by the committee.</P>
    <P>Although it is stated that the committee &ldquo;must&rdquo; consist of representatives of the employers and the trade, it only says that there &ldquo;may&rdquo; be other members.  As far as I am concerned, the intention is that the appointed members will be always present. We will give them a chance by allocating a certain number, even up to the maximum of three allowed in each case.  In that we have the experience of the Trade Board Acts with which we are in touch where, undoubtedly, appointed members have exercised a considerable influence on deliberations between employer and employee.  That Act deals mainly with minimum rates, but there is a special stimulus to both employer and employee to attend the meetings, and to see that the duties thrust upon them are properly carried out.  We find that the Act has worked mainly through the efforts of the appointed members.  They have been of considerable service, and it would be the intention to have this committee consist not merely of representative members, but also of members to be <Col N="411" /> appointed.  As the Bill is drafted, it leaves that position a little less secure than the position as regards actual representative members.  Our intention would be to make it pretty definite that, in the ordinary way, the committee will consist of representatives as well as appointees.</P>
    <P>It is not considered that there will be very much expense in connection with the Act.  The expense is referred to mainly in Sections 34 and 35.  There will be certain officials, such as a secretary, appointed to the Apprenticeship Committee, and it may be that there will be certain sums of money expended in the way of remuneration for the secretary, and also for the payment of travelling expenses.  It is not expected that there will be very large expense falling on the State in connection with the Act.  An attempt will be made to combine the duty of secretary with other duties, if officials can be got who are already carrying on in a part-time way.</P>
    <P>I said that this Bill arises out of the report of the Commission.  It does, strictly and accurately, but it follows the terms of reference to the Commission and the Acts referred to.  During the course of the proceedings of that Commission a certain scheme was put forward which aimed rather at compulsion than the voluntary principle which is the one here.  That proposition was not very much pursued, and the Commission made no recommendation with regard to it.  I suggest that, as in other countries, we should start with legislation in this form.  To those who think there might be some element of compulsion imported, I put this difficulty: if there be no agreement as between employer and employee in any particular trade as to the number of people that might be employed as apprentices, or as to the age and educational attainments of these people before they enter or leave the apprenticeship stage, I do not see how it would be possible to enforce a regulation which might be established by a superior authority.  In the end, it will depend on the employer whether or not the scheme of apprenticeship will make good and how far it will <Col N="412" /> make good.  One could not possibly lay down rules of a compulsory type that this or that kind of training should be given.  A good spirit is required between employer and employee, coming together and working smoothly, and compulsion would not be effective.  There is the further point that unless there is a pretty general agreement between employer and employee there will not be very much hope of getting a number of people taken into establishments.  On the one hand, an employer might object to having too many what are called &ldquo;apprentices&rdquo; forced upon him, while an organised body of employees might object to a number of people being trained as apprentices in a skilled trade where it did not seem there was any likelihood of these people being absorbed into that skilled occupation.</P>
    <P>The aim is to have something that amounts to agreement beforehand; to have an application made showing, at any rate, evidence of a desire on the part of one or other of the two bodies concerned to have the trade designated. When that is done, the two sets will be represented, with this important addition, there will be appointed members who will in fact take the place of the public, in this close association with the representatives of the two bodies concerned, to arbitrate, as it were, between conflicting claims that may be made with regard to the whole apprenticeship business. We have decided to try this on a voluntary basis now.  We are not alone.  Although certain unfavourable comments were passed in South Africa, and the Act was not received with great enthusiasm at the beginning, although it was prophesied that no number of trades would be designated or apprenticeship committees established, we have had information recently that the Act has worked smoothly.  In other words, the employer and the employee, or both, made application, the trade was scheduled, and the rules which were made worked fairly successfully.  As well as the report of the Commission, we have the information that the scheme has worked successfully in one country.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill, which, of course, is complementary to the Vocational Education Act, to which it gives effect in Section 82. When the Vocational Education Act was introduced, the people closely connected with technical education said it was absolutely essential to get this Bill through as soon as possible. I think employers would be of the same opinion.  I suppose this is not the time nor the place to go into the thorny question of the limitation of the number of apprentices and of the allocation of such number as will be admitted, but I hope the Minister's forecast will be justified and that the Bill will work smoothly on a voluntary basis.  It is based largely on the South African Apprenticeship Act of 1922 to which it bears a very close resemblance. There are some omissions. I suppose these omissions were designedly made.  The Minister referred to the powers given to the Committee in Section 8.  I should like to know whether they will have power to make provision where the employer dies or where the firm becomes bankrupt for the apprentices to continue their apprenticeship somewhere else.  Then in the South African Act there is a proviso that no bonus or fee be taken with apprentices.  That is not in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding remuneration, the Minister did give an explanation.  I was rather surprised to see the word in Section 34, because in the Vocational Education Act there is no provision for remuneration of that kind, and there are teachers and others giving long hours every week and hard work in getting the Vocational Committees under way.  However, we take the Minister's assurance for it that the expenditure under this head will be very low and will be closely watched. Being an administrative Bill largely, there is not very much to be said on it until the Committee Stage, and even then I think we shall have only to wait and see how it works out on the <Col N="414" /> voluntary basis, and have a revision in a year or two, when we find out how things have worked out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House welcome the Bill.  Many of us who have given service on the old Technical Instruction Committees and, at a later period, on the Vocational Education Committees, have frequently envisaged this class of legislation. This measure goes at least some distance to translate into an Act of Parliament some views frequently given expression to by educationists, particularly technical educationists, and, indeed, for that matter any person who takes an interest in the education question.  We approve of the general principles of the Bill.  In addition to giving expression to many of the things we have envisaged before, it is largely, I think, founded on the report of the Technical Education Commission, and deals with the apprenticeship question, or rather provides the machinery for dealing with that question.  We feel that the success or non-success of the measure will depend on the action taken by the Committees to be set up and by the Minister's policy in regard to the whole question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few points in the Bill which require elucidation by the Minister.  I hope on the Committee Stage to put down some amendments myself, but if the Minister will look into the matters I am about to touch upon, he might himself put down these amendments, and thus make the passage of the Bill easier and more expeditious. In the definition section we have it that &ldquo;the word &lsquo;trade&rsquo; includes any industry, trade, craft or business.&rdquo;  That is a little indefinite, because the Minister must be aware that, for instance, the word &ldquo;trade&rdquo; would cover the building trade.  Within that trade you would have a number of other trades, such as plumbing, carpentry, plastering, painting, etc. Quite recently in England it was thought to apply some Act to the catering trade.  The matter was brought to the High Court, and I understand an appeal is pending with regard to the definition of the word &ldquo;trade.&rdquo;  It was suggested, and with <Col N="415" /> success, that the catering trade was not a trade within the meaning of the Act.  A somewhat similar situation might easily arise here, and for that reason I think the Minister, after the word &ldquo;any,&rdquo; might insert the words &ldquo;or occupation.&rdquo;  It would be less ambiguous and would possibly obviate a good deal of trouble at a later period.</P>
    <P>Another point is that included in the Bill is a reference to &ldquo;trade board trades.&rdquo;  Naturally, that inclusion suggests that this Bill is designed to cover factory trades.  The Minister will understand that these factory trades are not generally thought of in the same terms as one thinks of crafts. There are, for instance, the cigarette industry, the chocolate industry, the biscuit industry, the clothing industry, and so on.  These are not usually associated with the word &ldquo;trade&rdquo; or &ldquo;craft&rdquo; in this country, and I should like to have some information from the Minister as to whether he envisages that type of labour being included in the word &ldquo;trade&rdquo; in connection with trade board trades.  Does he intend to bring within the scope of the Bill young persons who enter these factories as learners?  That is a rather important point which I should like the Minister to develop later.  Is it his intention that these learners should be brought within the category of apprentices? An answer to that query will be appreciated, because since this Bill was mooted there has been a great deal of comment as to whether these learners shall come under the head of apprentices or not.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with the constitution of the Apprenticeship Committees. Here again we have two classes introduced, namely, the trade board trades and the other trades which are not covered by the words &ldquo;trade board trades.&rdquo;  Speaking generally, the trade board trades do not cater for craftsmen.  They usually cater for trades such as shirt-making, box-making, etc., and have not ever catered for the trades in which the tradition of apprenticeship has grown up.  In view of these facts, it is rather questionable <Col N="416" /> whether both of these classes should have &ldquo;appointed members.&rdquo; The practice usually has been, where skilled tradesmen and craftsmen are concerned, to appoint representatives of employers and employees with a neutral or independent chairman. That has been found to be a very useful practice and one which has been productive of very good results.  I am making vocal the opinions of the people engaged in the crafts and trades in the country when I say that we feel it is not necessary to have these &ldquo;appointed members&rdquo; where the craftsmen and the other style of tradesmen are concerned.  There is no doubt, of course, in so far as the trade board trades are concerned, that a very good case can be made out for having &ldquo;appointed members,&rdquo; but even here I suggest to the Minister that the practice which has hitherto been followed in the trade board trades should be reviewed or altered.  Notwithstanding the Minister's assurance that everything has gone on most satisfactorily, I can say that that is not my experience.  I have had complaints from time to time that in many cases these persons were appointed from a class which, to say the least of it, was not quite friendly to the workers engaged in the particular industry, and, therefore, it followed that there was not, and could not possibly be, the same faith or trust in the board.</P>
    <P>Another point I would like to impress upon the Minister is that if those appointed members are to be retained the workers organisation and the employers should submit a panel from which the Minister might make his choice.  That system is followed fairly well with regard to the appointment of the Court of Referees and in other matters where disputes have arisen and where councils have been set up to deal with these disputes.  I suggest that the Minister might introduce some amendment modelled on these lines which would make the Bill more acceptable.</P>
    <P>I certainly must congratulate the Minister on one or two sections of this Bill.  Section 8 which deals with the maximum number of hours to be worked does not suggest anything <Col N="417" /> with regard to the daily hours to be worked.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should make it read: &ldquo;Maximum number of hours to be worked daily,&rdquo; because it might easily happen that some of these apprentices who have to work 47 or 48 hours per week might have to work 12 or 13 hours one day and perhaps 7 or 8 hours another day.  I think it would be well if the Minister would lay down the maximum number of hours to be worked in one day.</P>
    <P>Section 21 which deals with the education of apprentices appears to me to be one of the best features of the Bill, but here again I suggest that, where apprentices are compelled to attend technical classes, that attendance should take place in the day-time and the day classes should be the classes set up under the Bill. I think it will be conceded by anybody who has had experience of these classes that when an apprentice has finished his day's work, particularly in the building industry, where possibly he may have to walk four or five miles, get back in the evening and prepare for the school, exhausted both physically and mentally, he is not in a fit condition to absorb the teaching of the technical instructor.  It would be far more beneficial to the boy and less trouble to the teacher if the boy was enabled to attend his class during the day-time or during his normal hours of work.  There is another provision contained in the schedule to this Bill, paragraph 7, which says: &ldquo;any officer of the Minister and any persons who appear to the person holding any such enquiry to be persons who, if the special order with the subject of such enquiry was made, would be affected thereby may appear at such enquiry either in person or by counsel or solicitor.&rdquo;  I suggest that the Minister might consider the advisability of inserting after the word &ldquo;solicitor&rdquo; the words &ldquo;or agent.&rdquo;  We see no reason why any body of workers or others should be compelled to go to the expense of employing counsel or solicitor when they have their own trade union officials who are capable of appearing for them.  If the Minister would be <Col N="418" /> good enough to look into and alter the words of the schedule, as I suggest, it would be an improvement.  May I ask the Minister to look into it, at any rate?</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of premiums, I personally hold very strong views upon that aspect of the question.  The South African Act, upon which this Bill is, to some extent, at least modelled, provides that these premiums shall not be accepted or enforced.  The establishment, in some trades at any rate, of this premium system, has led to very grave abuses, the chief of which I am sure the Minister himself must have come across from time to time.  A certain type of employer, happily not very numerous in this country, engaged apprentices from time to time at very substantial fees.  This employer is not always in a position to teach a boy his trade or craft, but he is able to exploit those boys and their parents by obtaining fees or fines from them, and then a number of these lads, at the end of their so-called apprenticeship, are thrown upon the labour market.  That abuse has crept into industry in this country, not to a very large extent, but to some extent, and something should be done in this Bill to prohibit the acceptance of fees of that kind.  It is preventing many educated and talented boys from entering trades because their parents may not have sufficient money to apprentice them, And we have in this country very often the rather peculiar, if not amazing position, of boys, who have the natural ability for becoming finished artisans, not being able to do so because of the fact that their parents cannot afford to pay the fee necessary.  They are driven into some blind alley occupations, for which they are not fitted, and compelled to take up, perhaps, some sort of clerkship.</P>
    <P>The observe of this is also true. Many a young lad who, because his parents have money to apprentice him to a particular trade, while he has an aptitude for a clerkship, is dumped into the carpenter's shop instead of being allowed to go to the clerk's desk.  That kind of thing has frequently occurred in this country.  I do not suggest that everything can be <Col N="419" /> done by legislation, but there should be some mention made in this Bill, even if it were only a gesture, disapproving of the whole system of payment of premiums.  Exception, of course, might be made in case of apprentices who may have for a period to live indoor, and where the money, though sometimes called a premium, is in reality an amount to cover the board and lodging of the apprentice.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as I have said, is one which we, on this side of the House, welcome, and we hope when it reaches the Committee Stage to be able to amend it in some particulars.  It is, on the part of the Minister, a gesture, at any rate, indicating that the apprenticeship system in this country is not all what it should be, and it is, furthermore, a gesture in the direction of better education, which should tend to the upliftment of the boys themselves and of the trades in which they are engaged, and which should react for the prosperity of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of us can remember the slogan of years ago, &ldquo;What shall we do with our boys?&rdquo; That problem is still with us, and it has not been rendered any easier of solution because of the entry of females into competition with males.  Difficult, however, as the solution of that problem is to-day for those in the middle class, the difficulty is infinitely greater for for those who are included in the term &ldquo;working classes.&rdquo;  Families among the working classes are large, influence is small, and opportunities for getting employment for the members of those families are thereby rendered more difficult.  It was to some extent to meet that difficulty among those poor people that the Advisory Committee on Juvenile Employment was set up in 1911.  As some Deputies know, that Department is one of the many branches of the Labour Exchange and, in the School Attendance Act, Deputies will remember, there was a clause embodied making it compulsory on those in charge of our national schools to notify the heads of the Juvenile Department of the Labour Exchange of the names of the boys and girls leaving school in the <Col N="420" /> coming term, so that they might register for employment at the Labour Exchange, and that the Exchange, in return, might see what it could do, by way of advice or otherwise, to guide them into channels of employment.</P>
      <P>As I have said, that Committee has been busily engaged since 1911 in discharging that heavy and onerous duty. Only in the last few days we saw in the newspapers the report of the work of that Committee for the past year.  I do not want to enter into any details of its work, but I will just mention the fact that during last year 4,454 juveniles who left our schools registered for employment at the Exchange. The sad feature about it is that the Committee was able to find employment only for 686 of that number. That is to say, that out of 4,454 fresh applications in the last year, speaking of Dublin alone, the Committee could only find employment for 686; in other words, only one out of every seven applicants was placed in employment. Even employment in many cases was accepted under duress.  That is, many of the channels of employment open to those people were not in any sense advisable channels to enter, because they did not lead to any permanent employment in future.  Let me illustrate what I mean.  Suppose a messenger is required for employment &mdash;a number of juveniles start in that way&mdash;when these juveniles reach the age of 16 or 18 they are too old, too big, or too expensive in many cases, and are discharged and thrown among the unemployed.  Therefore, when considering the employment of one in seven, we cannot say in all cases that it is of a desirable character.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty of finding employment for young people of both sexes is to my mind one of the most serious problems which we have to face in this country to-day.  Those of us who go about the city see large numbers of young fellows between the ages of 14, 18 and 20 at our street corners.  Passing through the different towns of our State we see boys of the same age around the different corners there. Parents will tell you that they see no solution for the problem.  Therefore I say that this is one of the most serious <Col N="421" /> problems which we have to face.  Let me further stress the fact that the State accepts responsibility for the education of these young people.  We spend considerable sums on their education and they are discharged from the national schools when they reach the age of 14.  In other words, the State says to them: &ldquo;We have discharged our responsibility and now you must do the best you can for yourselves.&rdquo; It leaves them at the most critical age of their existence because I think everyone will agree that for young people the most important period is that between 14, 18 and 20 years.  It is at that particular period that they are left to themselves to do for themselves.</P>
    <P>As one who has been interested in this problem for some years, I have been told by many people that these young persons do not want employment, that they want amusement and recreation.  Let me say, as one who has come in contact with a good many of these young people, that that statement is not true.  There is anxiety on the part of these young people to make good and, in addition, to take advantage of any opportunity that may offer by way of employment. Let me say, however, on the other hand, that I know nothing more disheartening to young people of either sex than to have to go round day after day to different places of employment and be told that there are no vacancies, no opportunities.  There is nothing likely to dishearten young people more when they are anxious to get employment than to have that experience day after day for a couple of years.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education has recognised the importance of this problem. He has started with what in many cases is one of the difficulties.  That is that the standard of education possessed by these young people, for one reason or another, is in many cases very low.  I will not go into the reasons, but in many cases it is very low.  He has tightened up the School Attendance Act very considerably in order that these young people may have a better attendance at school than they have had in the past, and in that way contribute to a higher standard of <Col N="422" /> education.  It must be said to his credit that he has also brought in and passed through the House a Vocational Education Bill.  That Bill is designed not alone to improve the opportunities for increased technical education for those who desire it, but also to give those who hope to enter industrial occupations some training in connection with industry, so that when they seek employment they may have some knowledge of what work is and may, in that particular way, be more acceptable to employers.  He has also under that Bill decided to set up what we may call continuation schools, whereby those whose standard of education is low may have that standard considerably improved, and thereby may be more easily absorbed into industry.  Now, with these young people prepared, I hope, as they have never been in the past, we come to the most important step of all.  That is to bridge the gulf between education, on the one hand, and industry on the other.</P>
    <P>The object of this Bill is to carry out one of the many recommendations of the Commission on Technical Education and to improve the opportunities for these young people, to open up avenues that will lead to employment in the future and which have been closed to them in the past.  I do not want to take up too much of the time of the House in referring to the Report of the Commission, but for those who take an interest in this particular question there are many features of interest in that Report.</P>
    <P>There is one figure which I would like to give and it is one of importance when we are dealing with this particular Bill.  It will be found in the Report of the Commission.  The Report dealt with the number of apprentices in the Saorstát, from information supplied to the Commission by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Take the building trades.  I take that particular industry because it is one about which I happen to know something. That information supplied by the Department of Industry and Commerce to the Commission shows that there are in the Saorstát 9,282 tradesmen engaged in the building <Col N="423" /> industry and we find that the number of apprentices, again taking the whole Saorstát, is 961.  Those who have studied this matter inform us that the number of apprentices in any industry, to keep that industry at what we would regard as a normal level, should be one to every three craftsmen.  If you apply that principle to the 9,282 tradesmen engaged in the building industry in the Saorstát you will find that we should have 3,304 apprentices.  Yet according to the returns supplied by the Department of Industry and Commerce we had in 1926, 961 apprentices.  I do not know any stronger argument which can be used in support of this Bill than that particular figure.  We should have 3,304 apprentices in the Saorstát in this particular industry.  We have only 961.</P>
    <P>The position seems paradoxical. The juvenile department of our Labour Exchange is unable to find avenues of employment for a large number of juveniles.  They were only able to place in employment one in every seven of the applicants.  In other words, for six in every seven no employment could be found.  Here, when we get the number of apprentices, we find that there are only 961, where there should be 3,304.  This, as I said, is one of the important features of the Report.  It shows the necessity for a Bill of this character and for the need of opening up these channels of apprenticeship.  It is recommended in that report that in bringing forward legislation dealing with apprentices, the Apprentice Acts, and they are only recent Acts, of South Africa and of Queensland, should be followed. The Bill we have before us at the moment does not follow very closely all the principles of these particular Acts.  I must take exception to one feature of the Bill which we have before us.  That is that it is based on what the Minister is pleased to call the voluntary principle. Our apprenticeship system at the moment is a very casual and haphazard one.  It is based on the voluntary principle.  Does anybody in the House say that it is a satisfactory <Col N="424" /> basis?  It may have been satisfactory in the past, but it certainly does not meet the requirements of the present day.  I need not go into the reasons for that.  Deputies can see many of them in the Report of the Commission.</P>
    <P>The practices of trade, the methods of trade and the principles of trade have changed very materially in the last 25 to 50 years.  The introduction of machinery has revolutionised many of these trades.  In the face of these changes, to say that the principles of training of apprentices that were in force 50 years ago are still necessary is to say what is not quite correct in connection with trade as one knows it here.  Nor can I agree that the underlying principles of the Apprentice Act of South Africa are embodied in this Bill.  As I read the South African Act, and anybody can read it because it is set out in the appendix of the report of the Commission, it is a compulsory Act.  You will see in every second section of that Act the phrase: &ldquo;The Minister shall decide.&rdquo;  Everything is practically left to the Minister.</P>
    <P>If our apprentices are to get the opportunities and training in future that we would like them to get, and that it is essential they should get if they are to make good craftsmen, we will want to make material alterations in our methods of apprenticeship.  I think one of the principles that we should try to import into this Bill is that the responsibility for the proper training of apprentices should rest with a Minister of the State.  The education of our young people to-day is the responsibility of a Minister of the State.  I would like to see that responsibility carried through until those young people have been placed in a position to make good for themselves.  If this Bill is to achieve the object that many of us have in mind, it will be necessary to get that principle clearly established. That same principle applies also to the Act passed in Queensland. That Act was passed in 1926.  The same provision is embodied in both of them.</P>
    <P>We have not, at the moment, any register of apprentices.  The whole thing is casual and haphazard.  We <Col N="425" /> want to do away with all haphazard systems of that kind.  We want to get a systems of control, and a system that we are satisfied will discharge the many responsibilities that we will put on it.  Features of these Acts have been referred to.  They are not matters of principle, but they are matters of interest.  Deputy Anthony referred to some of them.  He has referred to the question of bringing all these trades under Trade Boards.  I question the wisdom of that method. That is not the method to adopt, and it is not the method adopted in apprenticeship in South Africa.  The South African method is different.</P>
    <P>The South African Act has a schedule of trades attached to it.  All these trades are by that schedule brought within the scope of the Act.  That, to my mind, is a very much more desirable method than the method proposed in this Bill.  That is the method of bringing them in through the medium of Trade Boards.  Trade Boards may create in these particular industries difficulties of another character.  I would like to see this obligation of training apprentices more clearly defined.</P>
    <P>In the past, one of the difficulties in connection with apprentices was that certain employers are quite willing to discharge their obligations to train them.  Other employers are not willing to discharge their obligations in that respect.  That is one of the reasons why the number of apprentices is so low.  I think there ought to be an obligation placed by the State on employers who employ large numbers of craftsmen in a particular industry to train a number of apprentices&mdash;the number to be adjusted by the Minister. I do not know that there are many employers who would object to that obligation, but whether they do or not, I think it is an obligation that should be cast upon them.  It is a duty which they owe to the State, and it is a duty which they ought to perform for the State.  The proper training of these young people is a very important matter.</P>
    <P>In the past, these apprentices have been bound to employers.  I do not think that the continuation of that method is desirable at all, because in <Col N="426" /> many cases employers fall ill, pass away, or go out of business, and then the difficulty is: what is to become of the apprentices?  The way in which that difficulty has been met in other countries is that the apprentices are bound not to the employers but to a committee.  The committee itself decides if the apprentices are being properly trained in their craft.  In case of failure in business of any particular employer, then the apprenticeship committee has power to take the apprentice and to place him in another employment, where he can complete his apprenticeship.  That, I think it will be agreed, is a very desirable method, but that is a matter of detail, and can be attended to on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I would like to impress on the Minister the desirability of getting this whole question of apprenticeship put on a proper basis.  The question now to consider is whether we can amend this Bill.  If the House is agreed that apprentices should be put on that basis then if we cannot amend the Bill and put them on a proper basis, the best thing would be to ask the Minister to withdraw this Bill and to bring in another Bill embodying that principle.  Let us try to do the best we can for the large numbers of young people who at the moment have no employment and who are rapidly becoming unemployable.  We must, in their interest as well as in the interest of the State, do all we can to improve their prospects.  I hope this Bill will achieve that object.</P>

      <P>I hesitate to intervene in this debate, because I do not profess to have any particular knowledge with regard to the handicrafts of this country.  There is, however, one section of the Bill that seems to me to be drastic.  It is the section that establishes a new principle in this country with regard to apprenticeship to handicrafts.  That principle is that a certain educational standard must be reached before any young person can be permitted to become apprenticed to a trade.  That prohibition to apprenticeship unless a certain educational standard prescribed has been reached is laid down in Section 17.  I have endeavoured to find out what particular <Col N="427" /> standard of education is aimed at.  I cannot find any particular standard defined. It seems to me that the only reference to the standard of education is that set out in Section 8 (2), which states that the apprenticeship committee may make all or any of the rules, and one of the rules deals with the educational qualification.</P>
      <P>Deputies who have spoken mentioned that this Bill is based on a South African Act.  I do not know what the standard of education in South Africa may be, whether it is higher than ours, but we ought to be careful when framing this Bill that we do not do an injustice to a large section of the young people.  The question that would naturally strike one when examining this Bill is: what is the standard of education required?  Is it to be a uniform standard or a standard that is to vary with every particular trade? If, for instance, the standard of education set down under the Bill is to be the possession of a primary certificate from national schools&mdash;and to the ordinary man that would appear to be a reasonable standard&mdash;how many of the children leaving the schools would possess the necessary qualification? The Minister for Education, answering a question of mine to-day, mentioned that 44,000 children were qualified to sit for the primary certificate examinations and out of that number something like 10,000 children sat and 5,000 qualified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not going to argue that matter at the moment.  Let us say 7,000.  That means that if the standard under the Bill is to be the possession of a primary certificate, then only 7,000 out of 44,000 children would be entitled to be bound as apprentices in this country.  What is the number of children on the registers of the national schools?  I think it would run into something over 100,000.  That would mean that if the standard of education in order to permit a child to be apprenticed to a trade were the possession of a primary certificate, then only 7,000 children would be entitled <Col N="428" /> to qualify and the remainder of the 100,000 children would be debarred from learning a trade.  That seems to me to involve a very serious imposition on the young people.  I am the first person who will readily concede to the framers of the Bill the desirability of raising the standard of education, but I do feel that this section may involve very grave injustice to a large proportion of the children.</P>
      <P>Anybody with a knowledge of the educational standard existing in the country is aware of the lamentable fact that quite a large number of children on the national school registers leave school after reaching the third or fourth standards.  Are you going to debar large numbers of children who reach only those standards from learning a trade?  I have been associated with tradesmen practically all my life and I know that some of the finest men possessing the greatest amount of technical skill and efficiency in their own trades would be unable to qualify under this Bill to be bound as apprentices. I am not criticising the Bill.  I am only endeavouring to point out where a grave injustice may possibly be imposed on large sections of young people.  That is one of the great difficulties the framers of the Bill are up against.  It would be almost impossible to set a uniform standard.  It seems to me the standard required by the plumber, the plasterer or the cooper should not be as high as that laid down for the engineering trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider this section dealing with educational qualifications, and to consider the possibility of giving discretionary powers to the Committee to permit apprentices who may not possess a certain standard of education to enter the various trades.  I ask him to give certain discretionary powers at least for some years.  The section is a mandatory one as it stands.  If the apprentice does not possess the necessary standard of education specified he shall not be admitted to the trade.  I speak in no spirit of hostility.  I realise that if the section is passed as it stands the greater proportion of children leaving the national schools cannot be bound as apprentices to trades.  If that is the <Col N="429" /> position of affairs, to what are you going to turn those children?  Are you going to turn them on the swollen market of the unskilled?  If it is possible to give the Committee some discretionary power with reference to the standard of education I, for one, will consider that the Minister has done an excellent day's work for the country, and particularly for the young people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion, those interested in the subject of apprenticeship cannot really be satisfied with this Bill.  The Minister's hesitation to make the provisions compulsory can be appreciated, but the anomalies created will hardly convince one that he took the right course in deciding not to put Section 2 in a more mandatory form. You have the position that in several of the most important trades it is very likely there will be no demand whatever from the employers to have their trades designated.  At present they may be getting very big fees for apprentices, and they are able to treat their apprentices as they like.  They are able to get the utmost value from them in regard to the hours they work and the other conditions of service.  On the other hand, you may have employees with no organisation whatever amongst them who may possibly never hear of this Bill.  They may be the people for whom this Bill would have the most important message if it were made compulsory, or if there were a likelihood that a demand for designation would arise.  The Minister has to answer the question: what is the inducement put to either party to demand designation?  As I have said, in many trades there will be no inducement to the employer, and employees in many cases are too unorganised to prepare the demand for designation, while in other cases they will possibly be afraid of antagonising their employers. That is a lamentable defect in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further, I suppose that a number of the most important trades and businesses of the country will not come under this Bill because there is no demand for designation.  Is the Minister satisfied that the present <Col N="430" /> conditions in such trades should be continued or encouraged?  Obviously, he is not.  You have certain trades that are very important from the point of view of public safety.  For instance, in some of the engineering trades, there is no general system of apprenticeship.  You have young fellows getting attached, say, to garage premises, running in and out, partly attached to the firm, but subject to no definite undertakings.  They are learning nothing substantial and at the end of two or three years, if they ask their employers for a certificate or letter to show that they have worked in those premises, he is, in many cases, quite prepared to give them such a letter because there is no untruth in it.  He has never bound himself in a documentary way to teach them a trade; consequently he has no responsibility with regard to them.  You have boys who have got such a poor training as that undertaking very serious work from the point of view of public safety, work for which training should be under the most careful discipline and guidance.  That is one big defect in the Bill to my mind, and I think that the Minister should reconsider the Bill on account of that defect.  He should, at all events, consider the amendment of the clause.  I am surprised that, even if he decided not to make it mandatory at the start, he did not put in a provision that after a certain period, if there was no demand for designation, he would be empowered to take action.</P>
    <P>With regard to the general framework of the Bill, it creates a rather curious picture in this way, that you might have all sorts of different areas with all sorts of different conditions regarding apprenticeship.  You have no co-ordinating authority at the top. You may have a number of committees making quite different rules with regard to apprentices, as to the hours they will work, as to the fees which should be paid, and as to the length of time they have got to serve and so on.  No one, apparently, has a right to veto any of their decisions or to say that it is unreasonable. The Minister has the <Col N="431" /> right, but I take it that it is not his intention to use it, that his intention is that these committees should have more or less the final word on the subject.</P>
    <P>At all events, it is not indicated in the Bill that he is going to insist upon anything like uniform conditions throughout the country.  One would think it would be a reasonable proposal that there should be some council of these committees that would meet to consider the different recommendations of the committees and to co-ordinate them, as far as possible, so that there might be uniform conditions throughout the country.  As it is, it is quite possible that you would have a trade union vetoing the decisions of some of these committees with regard to hours, wages or other considerations. Section 28 (d) in the Bill gives authorised officers altogether too much power.  In fact, one wonders if it is seriously intended to give an authorised officer the power &ldquo;to examine either alone or in the presence of any other person, as he thinks fit, with respect to matters under this Act, every person whom he finds in any premises upon which he is entitled under this section to enter.&rdquo;  I think there is plenty of room for abuse there.  &ldquo;Every person whom he finds.&rdquo;  The person may not be working on the premises at all; he may be a visitor.  Yet, if the authorised officer thinks he can give him any information, he has the power to challenge him and demand replies to any questions he may put to him relating to the Act.  It is observed that while the authorised officer can examine books and require the employer to produce wage sheets, time sheets, and other records of wages, there is no question of his being bound to confidence. That is a very big power to give to any officer but to give him such power and not require from him a pledge not to give away that information, is unreasonable.</P>
    <P>With regard to Section 30, the committees are not empowered to go into the question of the wholesomeness of the premises or the living-in conditions. These are important matters, <Col N="432" /> relating to apprentices in certain businesses, and it is quite possible that in committee that clause will have to be examined with a view to betterment.</P>

      <P>I may have quoted the wrong section.  The fundamental objection to the Bill, however, is that it does not fix the period for beginning the work of regulating apprenticeship. It leaves it still possible, in very many trades and in very big branches of business, for the apprenticeship not to be subject to any public regulation or control, which is a very regrettable omission from the Bill.  I think it wants to be examined very carefully from that point of view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points arising out of this discussion to which I should like to refer.  The first is that mentioned by Deputy Anthony. I think the necessity for examination of that point by the Minister was emphasised by references of Deputy Good to his definition of the word &ldquo;trade.&rdquo;&ldquo;Trade&rdquo; includes any industry.  The building industry was referred to more than once by Deputy Good.  He spoke of the building trade as if it were one trade.  The building industry includes several individual trades.  I think it is just possible that confusion may arise in regard to that definition and I think the Minister should examine the matter further to see if any possible confusion that may arise could be obviated.  In this connection, I was wondering why the Minister did not adopt the suggestion contained in the Report of the Commission and carried out in the case of the South African and of the Queensland Acts&mdash;that is, scheduling the trades to which the Act would apply, and putting them into the Bill.  That is not done.  It would seem to me, in any case, as one who does not pretend to know very much about the matter, that that would be clearer than the plan adopted here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in thorough agreement with the opening remarks of Deputy Good, and with his remarks in regard to employment and industry generally, but on one statement he made I do not exactly <Col N="433" /> see eye to eye with him.  He spoke of the number of apprentices in the building industry and pointed out that there should be something like three times as many apprentices in that industry as there are.  He made a more or less dogmatic statement at the beginning on which he based his whole argument.  He said that everyone knows that the number of apprentices should be one to three.  As I said, his whole argument was based on that.  He did not show at all why that should be the case or on what basis that proportion was founded. That appears to me to be an essential factor.  I do not pretend to know why that is so.  I might equally say that it should be one to five or one to nine but I do not say it.  I take what appears to be a commonsense view, that the number of apprentices taken into a trade should have regard to the possibility of those apprentices being absorbed in the industry later on. That is the principle which should guide us in fixing the number of apprentices in any particular trade.</P>
    <P>Surely Deputy Good knows better than any of us that, if we were to take that basis, there are some trades in which there should be no apprentices appointed at the present time, inasmuch as there are a number of men idle in these particular trades.  Where is the use of putting in apprentices if they cannot be absorbed in the industry?  He knows, too, that there are some trades that are, as it were, disappearing altogether.  Take, for example, the brick-laying trade.  I will not say that it is disappearing altogether, but we know that concrete work is displacing the brick-laying trade to a great extent at the present time, and surely he could not hold that the number of apprentices in that trade ought to be as great as it was twenty or thirty years ago.  There would not be the same openings for these people afterwards in the trade. I, therefore, think that starting off by saying one to three is the rule, and that, therefore, on that calculation we have not enough apprentices in the trade, is not getting us very far, because we must go back to the beginning and find out how we arrived at this one to three.</P>

      <P>On the point about the Minister taking full responsibility rather than having the plan that is adopted here of acting on a voluntary basis, I might be inclined to agree with the Deputy if he went a little further. I do not believe he is quite prepared to go the whole way with me in this. If the Minister begins by taking responsibility for the control of entry into the industry, then I think he will logically have to go further and control the industry, or have a very big measure of control in it, and I suppose Deputy Good will not agree with that. If the Minister was to say that so many apprentices must be appointed, I do not see how the industry could claim to be independent of Government control.</P>

      <P>We will have to settle it in the future, I expect.  I am prepared, in any case, to give this voluntary system a trial.  Then, perhaps, Deputy Good and I may come together and see what we can do towards taking control of the whole business.</P>
      <P>I do not think Deputy Byrne read the Bill.  If he did, I do not think he quite followed the implication of it, because my complaint is exactly the opposite to that of Deputy Byrne.  Deputy Byrne said that educational qualifications are mandatory.  I am complaining, and objecting to the Bill, because they are not.  If he will read Section 8 of the Bill he will find that sub-section (1) sets out the rules the apprenticeship committees &ldquo;must make,&rdquo; and sub-section (2) sets out the rules that it &ldquo;may make&rdquo; about educational qualifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is governed by Section 17.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Connell Mr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly, but will you read Section 17 where the rules made by the apprenticeship committees are <Col N="435" /> enforced?  It is provided in Section 8 that they may only set up&mdash;they are not bound to set up&mdash;standards. That is my complaint.  I will move later, if necessary, that sub-section (2) (a) ought to be put into the rules that must be made by the committee.  I think there ought to be at least some standard of educational qualification adopted by the apprenticeship committees. It does not necessarily follow that they must be of a uniform standard for every trade, but each apprenticeship committee ought to be bound, as it were, to say that the people entering into their trade must have some standard of education.  I will press very strongly that sub-section (2) (a) be included in sub-section (1).</P>
      <P>I do not want to go into the points raised by Deputy Byrne in regard to the number of people who would possibly be excluded.  I might explain that the number of people who sit for this examination does not necessarily mean that that is the number of people who are qualified to pass the examination. As a matter of fact, 70 per cent. of those who did sit last year for that examination qualified, but he seems to stress the point of possession of the primary certificate.  I do not think that in the present circumstances of our educational administration any apprenticeship committee would simply say that candidates must possess the primary certificate.  They may say they must have a primary certificate standard, and take such steps as they think necessary to see that that standard is attained, but I think the mere possession of a particular document would hardly be laid down in the present circumstances when the examination for this certificate has only been established for a year, when at the present time it is running on a voluntary basis, and when there is no regulation compelling every child to sit for this examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said that, but the mere possession of a certificate <Col N="436" /> seems to be the only standard which is envisaged by the Deputy, and I think that in the circumstances that is not exactly reasonable.  I was rather surprised by Deputy Good's remarks in view of the fact that this Bill seems to follow the recommendations made by the Commission of which he was a member.  I even read the Deputy's reservation to the Report of the Commission to see if he had made any objection to the plan set out in this Bill.  Perhaps the Deputy is coming nearer to the idea of State control in industry generally, and that that is his reason for arguing that the Minister should have taken to himself the powers which he suggests he should take in regard to the regulation of apprentices.</P>

I have faith in the good sense of employers and employees, when they get together on a committee of the kind proposed to be set up under this Bill.  I believe that both are interested in the success and welfare of the industries in which they are concerned.  There may be exceptions to that rule.  Of course you will always get exceptions, but I believe that when both classes get together they will give of their best in the interests of the industry in which they are engaged.  They will do their best, I believe, to put these apprenticeship schemes on a sound basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me, after listening to the debate that has taken place, that the only speakers who really dealt with the principle of the Bill were the Minister on the one hand and Deputy Moore on the other.  I take it the principle of the Bill is that the conditions of apprenticeship shall be regulated only in such trades as apply to the Minister to have the Act put into operation in respect of them.  There is no guarantee, and no sound reason for believing, that on the passage of this Bill the conditions of apprenticeship will, in fact, be regulated in any trade, and it is extremely <Col N="437" /> likely that in those trades in which regulation is most urgently needed the Act will not apply at all. The issue which the Dáil has to face, and which most of the Deputies have not dealt with at all, is whether this voluntary arrangement should stand or whether power should be given to the Minister to compel the application of the relevant sections of this Bill to such industries where he is satisfied that the existing conditions so require it.  I am sure that most Deputies, and certainly the Minister, know of trades where the length of the apprenticeship period, the normal hours of employment for apprentices, the remuneration given to them and the classification of persons as apprentices are all so unsatisfactory that the State should have power to interfere and put them right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moore gave an example of the garage business.  It is, I think, generally admitted that in some cases the number of apprentices taken on in particular garages is in excess of the number which it would be possible for the proprietor of the garage properly to instruct in their business.  Frequently these apprentices have to pay substantial premiums or fines in order to get engaged.  It is, in fact, that premium or fine which is the main reason why they are indentured as apprentices at all.  There are other industries as well.  I am not at all convinced that the division of trades into Trade Board and non-Trade Board trades is wise.  There is no such division in the South African Act, which the Technical Commission appears to have taken as its standard.  Trade Boards have been established in relation to a number of occupations for the sole purpose of fixing minimum rates of wages.  These occupations were, generally speaking, those in which labour was not organised.  The Committees or Boards set up for that purpose are not necessarily the most suitable Boards to arrange apprenticeship conditions.  It seems to me that it would be much better if the reference to Trade Boards were left out of the Bill altogether, and that all trades coming in under the Bill were brought under the section which is <Col N="438" /> designed to deal with the case of non-Trade Board trades.</P>
    <P>It is, I think, a common experience amongst Deputies that the number of young people offering themselves for apprenticeship in all industries is declining.  That is due to two main causes.  The first is, I believe, the existence of these fines or premiums. When the Minister was drafting this Bill he had no doubt the South African Act before him.  In that Act there is a clause definitely prohibiting anybody from requiring or receiving such premium as a condition of apprenticeship. No doubt the Minister considered it, and deliberately decided to leave it out of this Bill.  I would like if he would tell us the reason for that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fahy, I think, suggested that apprenticeship committees should be given power to make regulations in respect of those fines or premiums.  I think the Dáil should go further and insist on the insertion of a section in the Bill prohibiting them altogether, except as suggested in the South African Act&mdash;to deal with special cases on the written consent of the Minister. Another reason why the number of apprentices offering themselves to industries is limited is that the remuneration received is frequently exceedingly low.  In many cases it is necessarily so because the employers are not in a position to give more.  The suggestion has been made that the State should come to the aid of employers in that matter by subsidising them, to a certain extent, to enable them to give bigger remuneration to their apprentices, or else in some other way to increase the remuneration of these apprentices.  I am sure that most Deputies will admit that it is of considerable importance to the country that the proportion of skilled workers to the total should be increased, and that anything the State does to bring that about will be a national benefit.  If, by the expenditure of a comparatively small amount of money, we could increase the inducements to young people to apprentice themselves to skilled trades rather than to seek casual employment or semi-skilled employment it would be a long step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="439" /> These are the main points which, I think, arise out of the Bill.  Most of the other points mentioned by Deputies were Committee points and in some cases, as Deputy O'Connell pointed out, they were based on a misunderstanding of the Bill.  We can go through these matters again on the Committee Stage.  What I am particularly concerned with now is that the Minister should justify the voluntary principle of the Bill, the division of trades into two classes and the failure to deal with the financial restriction upon the number of apprentices which exists at present and to which I have referred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are certain small points that I would like to deal with firstly.  Deputy Fahy raised a point about the apprenticeship contract entered into where the proprietor of a business dies.  Section 12 gives power to vary the apprenticeship contract.  That section is definitely designed to meet that point and I think does meet it.  Points have been raised, particularly by Deputy Anthony and by Deputy O'Connell, on the definition of &ldquo;trade.&rdquo;  I am prepared to consider any definitions put down on the Committee Stage.  I am not oppressed by the difficulties spoken of by these Deputies. The word &ldquo;trade&rdquo; includes any industry, trade, craft or business.  I was not sure, when Deputy Anthony was speaking, whether or not he was afraid that the Bill was not comprehensive enough, and did not take in trades under the Trade Boards.  It clearly does.  If on the other hand, his complaint is that it is too comprehensive, that it might be extended to any particular business he mentioned, then I am afraid I must agree that it is capable of comprehensive application. That is the most that can be said of it.  I cannot undertake to make any addendum until I find out what the difficulty is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In case it is thought that there would be any difficulty of the type referred to by Deputy O'Connell, who spoke of the building trade, and who thought that it might be scheduled and that thereafter you could only <Col N="440" /> have apprenticeship conditions attaching to the big group of trades included under that heading, if the Deputy looks at the Report of the Commission, he will see an example given on page 77 of the trades scheduled in Queensland.  Under that, you get an enormous number of things under building&mdash;bricklaying, carpentry, stone masonry, plumbing.  I think it is possible&mdash;and if not we can make it absolutely certain&mdash;to have apprenticeship rules made with regard to bricklaying, carpentry and joinery apart from the building trade as a whole.  It is a matter for the Committee Stage.  There might be a little confusion through having the word &ldquo;trade&rdquo; applied in connection with a particular operation.</P>

      <P>That is a different matter.  I think the Deputy has not appreciated the exact scheme on which the South African Act is moulded.  The reference on page 77 is not to the South African Act, but to the Queensland Act.  That is a matter we will deal with by way of an amendment, which I hope the Deputy will put up.  Deputy Anthony alluded to a <Col N="441" /> certain difficulty experienced in England. I think he will find that the difficulty is not so much on the application of the word &ldquo;trade,&rdquo; but rather where a particular item was challenged in court, and challenged successfully. The word &ldquo;catering&rdquo; was the difficulty&mdash;the precise application of what was called &ldquo;catering&rdquo;.  There was no great difficulty about the word &ldquo;trade.&rdquo;  I think Deputy Anthony intended to ascertain whether a learner as opposed to the old-time apprentice comes within this Bill.  Learners are intended to be brought within the Bill. The Bill is comprehensive enough to have learners included.  It is meant to have them included, and I think we have succeeded in doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>What do you call a learner in a trade?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That arises on a later point, and I think I had better deal with it by way of example.  Similarly, Deputy Anthony wanted a positive answer as to whether the word &ldquo;trades&rdquo; not covered by Trade Boards Acts are within this Bill.  The Act is intended to be capable of extension to these, and to cover, not merely Trade Board trades, but trades outside the scope of the Trade Boards Acts.  Again, I suppose that matter must arise in Committee.  Deputy Anthony spoke of the appointed members, and indicated, as the view of some Committees under the Trade Boards Acts, that some of the appointed members had not been friendly to the employees' side.  Consequently I gather from him they were in some way prejudiced against the workers' interests.  I find considerable difficulty in getting suitable people for these Committees.  If anything the tendency is rather the other way.  One can get a person who is definitely keen on social work to give voluntary time and effort to the work of Trade Board Committees. The attitude is generally too much that of the social worker and too little application to weighing the facts of a particular trade.  People simply have an idea with regard to minimum rates and do not see that there might have to be a distinction made between country and town rates.  There is a <Col N="442" /> good social point in having part-time occupation and, in the case of womenfolk who must spend some of their time in their homes, they may have time on their hands and be capable of earning money during that period. The experience we have had of the appointed members is that they have succeeded pretty well in holding an impartial attitude between employers and employees.  If I speak with particular application to one or two people, I think the mind of the social worker is a little uppermost, and that he does not advert enough to the reactions of the minimum wage.</P>
      <P>Another small point was raised on Section 8 by Deputy Anthony, in regard to the maximum number of hours, where it is stated that the rules regulating the maximum number of hours are the hours to be worked in any week.  The Deputy hinted that we should make that applicable to days. I think the debate on this Bill, so far, shows the necessity for having it drafted, first on the voluntary principle, and leaving the regulation and the rules to the Special Committees, because you have to consider the vast number of trades there might be and the tremendous number of varied circumstances that would apply to trades in particular areas and at particular periods of the week in an industry or to branches of some industry in the area.  I think that is all the more reason for leaving this as elastic as it can be.  I put it to the Deputy, on the question of apprenticeship, and in regard to the hours, that they must have some relation to the hours worked in the factory, and that as the training is to be carried out in the factory the learner's relationship must be determined by ordinary rules.</P>
      <P>Suppose there are rush periods, as there undoubtedly will be, in factories at certain seasons of the year.  It would be impossible to lay down rigidly here anything with regard to fixing of hours by the day.  Remember, all the while there is power, where it is seen that a regulation is working badly, to amend or modify it and there is an amount of freedom and ease in the whole system of regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Anthony also made the point that when it comes to the educational <Col N="443" /> course to be followed we should determine, or any rate allow, that it would be a day school.  I think Section 21 is definitely capable of application to day schools.  I do not think there is anything which ties it up merely to educational work after the period of employment during the day.  If necessary, we can amend it and make it clear, but not I hope to make it such that the school training must be always day training.  Let us leave it in the free state in which it is at present, so that the regulations may be varied to suit the circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must recognise that some of these sections should be made mandatory, otherwise the good effects of his Bill will be entirely negatived.  That is the reason I suggest that the sections dealing with the education of apprentices should be made mandatory and that &ldquo;shall&rdquo; should be substituted for &ldquo;may&rdquo; in some of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>These are points which will have to be borne in mind. I want to answer Deputy Anthony's question by saying that day school training is permissible under the section, but I do not want to make it so rigid that it must be so.  Deputy Anthony's point as to the Schedule, that after the words &ldquo;by counsel or solicitor&rdquo; we should add &ldquo;or other duly authorised agent&rdquo; is quite a good point and can be met by an appropriate amendment.  It can be put on a footing with the Trade Board system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Byrne, I think, is under a misapprehension with regard to the effect of Section 8 and 17 when read together.  Section 8 simply says that the apprenticeship committee may make certain rules, and amongst these may be rules in relation to the educational qualifications of persons entering employment by way of apprenticeship. Thereafter these rules, when made, have to be confirmed and, if made and confirmed, are in operation, and then <Col N="444" /> Section 17 works: that where the rules are in force it shall not be lawful to employ a person in such trade unless he possesses the educational qualifications laid down in such rules.  There is complete discretion given to the Minister whether or not he will confirm rules which prescribe certain educational qualifications.  That is a matter that can be attended to in the circumstances of each trade.  You could lay down that nobody would be accepted as a learner or apprentice unless some specified minimum amount of educational attainments were there.  But, remember, this Bill deals with apprentices as we used to know them; that is to say, people who are going to be trained for entry into the old type of skilled trade.  It is also intended to cover learners, as they used to be called in the Trade Board Acts, and there are many processes at present in some of these the newer trades in which very little in the way of educational attainment is needed.  For instance, take a machine minder, which some of these lads become in a good number of businesses at present.  If any minimum is going to be prescribed in the Bill it would be so low that it would be useless. Then when one thinks of the other end of it, there are in certain processes, say, in the boot trade, and in the shirt-manufacturing industry, which will be taken up by men and women learners, people very definitely of adult age and far beyond the school period.  If one were to think of the standard of education required there, or the standard that would usually accompany a learner in such a business, a standard could be set far too high.  Again, I think it is best to leave it to the committee to prescribe the rules and leave these rules for confirmation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore thought there was one flaw in the Bill, that there was no co-ordinating authority; that there might be different rules and different trades in different areas.  When I pointed out that there was discretion in the Minister with regard to the confirming of the rules and that, in the process of confirming, modifications of the rules might be enforced, he apparently altered and said: surely I would not <Col N="445" /> attempt to co-ordinate.  It is difficult to follow him when he alleges that there is no co-ordinating authority, and, when one is shown to him, alleges that it is definitely against the Bill that somebody is going to co-ordinate. It will certainly be the duty of whoever is going to carry out the Act to see that where there is some equality required between rules in different cases that that equality will be brought about where there are similar conditions operating, but who also will see that the varied circumstances of the different applications will also be borne in mind and that there will be differentiation in the rules allowed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not indicated in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is definitely indicated that rules may be made in a particular way.  Those rules have to come before one particular authority for confirmation, and it must have been evident to any one that one of the duties there would be to see that there are not rules drawn for haphazard applications.  If for no other reason, the mere fact that there is to be an inspection carried out by certain officers will always tend rather in the direction of uniformity.  If there is any danger it is that the rules will be rather too tightly made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Is one to infer from the fact that the Minister has this co-ordinating power, that uniform conditions as between, say, Munster and Connacht will be insisted upon with regard to the apprentices in different trades?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope they will not. All I am saying is that the Deputy's objection was that there was no co-ordinating authority.  I said there was, and the Deputy's second objection was &ldquo;Surely you will not co-ordinate.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the impression given.  There is a co-ordinating authority.  Take, say, rules regulating some of these learnerships that there will have to be in shirt-making where the training required will not last longer than a period of some <Col N="446" /> weeks.  Certainly when you get into the region of a couple of months, it would be the extreme term of the period necessary.  Then take some aspects of the wood-working business where an apprenticeship period of from five to seven years used to be demanded and for which certainly a long period of years would have to be demanded.  Does the Deputy consider that there ought to be anything approaching rigid uniformity between these different types of people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not in my mind.  It is possible under the Bill to have Regional Committees.  The decisions of these Committees as regards the conditions of apprenticeship can differ, at least as submitted to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly they can. All I pointed out is that in some cases they necessarily must, and when confirmed must be different, but that there is a co-ordinating authority.  Deputy Moore also, while pleading for a compulsory Act as against the powers given to the authorised officers, particularly objected to the fact that the authorised officer might under Section 28 (1) (d) &ldquo;examine either alone or in the presence of any other person, as he thinks fit, with respect to matters under this Act, every person whom he finds in any premises upon which he is entitled under this section to enter and require such person to answer such questions as he may put touching such matter, and to sign a declaration of the truth of the answers to such questions.&rdquo; Let us assume that that power is not there.  How are the inspectors ever going to enforce them?  Let us take a trade in which Deputy Moore's ideal has been some application made; there is a designated trade, and a committee and rules established by that committee in a particular area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we have got, at any rate, to the same stage in that particular trade or business as if the whole thing was compulsory. We want to see that the regulations are carried out.  Unless these powers are given, and given to the authorised officer, particularly the powers given under Section 28 (1) (d). <Col N="447" /> there would be no way to enforce them, and particularly if we go further, as the Deputy wants us, and say that whatever they find out as a result of the inspection must be kept confidential.  I should say the first place in which the confidence would be broken would be where a prosecution was instituted and those people would be induced to swear to what took place.  So far from there being anything about getting information of this kind to be kept locked up, it would be quite useless unless it was produced in due form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I mention confidence as applied to the inspection of wages sheets and other accounts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wants to take away any of the powers of the authorised officers let him do so by putting down an amendment and we will then see how far his proposal would help us to get enforcement of the Act.</P>
      <P>Outside these points there were a couple of bigger matters raised in the course of the debate.  Deputy O'Connell asked why not schedule trades as scheduled in the South African Act.  I said earlier that I thought the scheme of the South African Act had been misunderstood. In the South African Act certain trades were scheduled, and it was set out in Section 1 that &ldquo;the provisions of this Act shall only apply in respect of apprenticeship to any trade or branch of trade designated by the Minister after consultation with an Apprenticeship Committee appointed under this Act in any industry (hereinafter referred to as a scheduled industry) specified in the first schedule to this Act.  Any such trade or branch of trade is hereinafter referred to as a designated trade.&rdquo;  The schedule was of a limiting nature.  First you had certain businesses scheduled and there could only be apprenticeship regulation in connection with those trades&mdash; only those scheduled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasOConnell" hpid="Mr. T.J. O'Connell Mr. T.J. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>They were practically all scheduled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh no, there is a <Col N="448" /> small schedule given at the end.  It was not even that for the trades scheduled there had to be an apprenticeship committee set up&mdash;by no means; that apprenticeship committee was only set up inside the trades, at least with the first limitation of having to be mentioned in the schedule.  Apprenticeship Committees were only to be set up after consultation and a recommendation made that there should be apprenticeship conditions attached, so that the schedule was only by way of limiting the completest application of the Act. It did not extend the Act immediately to those trades.  There had then to be a recommendation put forward by the Committee that the ordinary series of regulations such as we have here should apply.  To that extent we have, if anything, enlarged the South African Act by simply not scheduling by way of limitation any number of businesses.</P>
      <P>Deputy Good has said with regard to the South African Act that it is compulsory, and has attempted to prove his contention by saying that if you read through the clauses you will see the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; appearing there very often.  If the Deputy will count the number of &ldquo;shalls&rdquo; that appear in this Bill and compare it with the number of times the word appears in the South African Act I think mine would win out, but the Deputy himself has signed the report of the Commission and the report on page 73 describes the South African Act in this way: &ldquo;In the Union of South Africa under the provisions of the Apprenticeship Act apprenticeship became compulsory in such trades as decided under Advisory powers vested in special apprenticeship committees to adopt the provisions of the Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is exactly the same scheme.  The framework is somewhat different, as I have shown, but the basis is exactly the same.  They set up their special apprenticeship committee and they then advise.  It is a question then whether the trade decides to adopt the provisions of the Act.  Deputy Good urges in a vague way that this whole Bill should be made compulsory. Deputy Moore clearly wants that, and <Col N="449" /> Deputy Lemass wants that, but Deputy O'Connell does not want it. Deputy O'Connell and Deputy Good had a certain argument in the course of the debate, as to the number of apprentices that should be allowed, say in the building trade.  Deputy O'Connell questioned Deputy Good's suggestion of one in three.  Deputy Good instantly said that that was a matter settled by the Minister in South Africa.  It is not; it is a matter in which recommendation is to be made by the apprenticeship committee to the Minister; thereafter he may settle it and be responsible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly the same. If the trade does not put it up can the Minister do anything on his own in South Africa?  Can I do anything on my own, or is it desired that I should? There was a difference as to the one in three provision of apprentices. Deputy Good said it was the South African provision, but that was questioned. Suppose there is a difference of opinion between Deputy O'Connell as representing the employees, and Deputy Good the employers, as to the number of apprentices that should be allowed to each workman in the building trade, am I to come along and say arbitrarily that the number should be so and so, and if I say the number should be so and so, how am I to enforce it?  If Deputy Good does not take the proper number of employees into his business am I to prosecute him? If he wants more apprentices than the employees want, and I provide him with them and the other employees leave his business, am I still to prosecute Deputy Good for not carrying on his business with the apprentices and nobody else?  There are innumerable difficulties in the way of enforcing this matter.  Deputy Lemass said that it was clear that the State should have power to interfere and regulate, and be raised the question of co-ordination. He mentioned the question of <Col N="450" /> garages.  I do not know whether he was complaining that there were too many apprentices or not enough, but he thought the motor garage business was not one likely to make application to be a designated trade.  If it does not make application either for employers or employed it is rather a sign, I think, that they are satisfied with their present conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be a sign that the employees are not organised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If they are unorganised in the sense of being under the Trade Boards Act there would be a Trade Board to apply to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, there is no Trade Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is rather an indication that the employees are regarded as somewhat organised, at any rate, and whether organised or not are able to protect their own interests. There is no specified number of employees that must come along.  Any number of employees which the Minister thinks sufficiently represents the position in any trade to make him enquire and consider whether or not there ought to be a designation of the trade can make application.  Here is the motor garage business which we are told is very flourishing.  There are apparently too many apprentices; that is the main idea put forward.  Yet neither from employers nor employees is it likely there is going to be an application made.  Supposing the employers are satisfied with the number, and I again decide that some compulsion should be put upon them, am I to decide arbitararily on the numbers of apprentices as against the employers' wish?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How on earth is one going to enforce the regulation with regard to training of apprentices in an establishment where the employer has made up his mind that he does not want so many? It would need an inspector to be on the premises the whole day long.  If there is not some measure of agreement on this point as between the employer and the employee there is no great <Col N="451" /> prospect of this scheme or any other scheme working.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why compel him to take less?  Supposing it is considered that there are more openings in the trade than that.  Take a person for whom Deputy Good would speak in this matter, and who would say that children ought to get an opening in this business, and the employer is going to take on only a certain number.  The difficulties are equal whether it is a question of forcing a bigger number on the employer or forcing a less number than people want to have in business. I think there is going to be a very grave social condition revealed immediately that would require some investigation if employers are going to be forced by some regulation of mine to keep a lesser number of employees than what they have at the moment. Then we would get a condition which Deputy Good referred to in his speech, a condition which I cannot see breaking off anywhere short of State control. Deputy Good's argument ran somewhat in this way, and Deputy Lemass is rather with him: we educate children in this country up to a certain age, and at a certain age we leave them to their own devices.  Deputy Good says that we should go one step further and see them into industry and at the end of their period of general training, we should go a little further and put them into business compulsorily against the wishes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There is no occupation for such an apprentice afterwards.  The mere training for an occupation does not provide employment at the other end. Do we drop them at that point?  What is the logic of dropping them there, if we decide that it is inhuman to drop them at the other point?  We must keep them on and see that they get employment.</P>

We are to take this further step which is a very definite interference with industry.  It would mean the State shouldering the payment of wages if there was difficulty in the industry over the apprenticeship point. We take him to a certain point, and it is all very well for the people to say we must carry him further.  Then we get the State as a kind of employer. This country has not got to that point yet.</P>

Young people are not getting the opportunity and they are going to swell the unemployment list.  Is that to continue?  If not, what are we going to do for them?</P>

      <P>That brings me to the second big point.  Deputy Good has founded a lot of his comment on the figures which he knows so well from the Report of the Juvenile Advisory Committee. A certain number of people come under the control of the Committee, and only a certain number are placed through the exchanges. First of all, that is not the final limit of the number of people of that age who get employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not so.  It is stated that a certain number would get employment through the Committee, but that does not mean that no further persons get employment.  So far as the Apprenticeship Bill is concerned, Deputy Good would perhaps tell us, if it is possible to do so, how many of these people are prevented from getting into certain trades where work is available by reason of the fact that missing a proper apprenticeship somewhere they have not got a proper apprentice's training?  That is where we are up against a real problem.  I do not know what the number is.</P>

      <P>Certainly not.  I remember an earlier figure given by the Deputy which, I think, was one in ten.  I think to-day he said it was one in seven.  It cannot end there.  Let us say that three out of every seven do not get employment.  The Deputy <Col N="454" /> jumps to the conclusion that the reason these three out of seven fail to get employment is that they have not been trained or apprenticed.  Surely it may be that there is no work for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the apprenticeship point we are up against here, and not the other point.  I was expecting that Deputy Good might have made a case which certainly appeared in some way before the Committee but for which not very definite proofs were adduced.  That is the matter of restrictive conditions operating in regard to bringing in apprentices to certain trades.  If any case is made that there are restrictive conditions operating in regard to bringing in young boys to these trades, and that these restrictive conditions will not be got rid of under this scheme, then there is a blot on the scheme and we would have to have these defects removed.  I have heard the argument used often.  There is the contention by certain employers that boys of obvious skill and promise cannot get into certain business because in certain trades there is something amounting to a caste system, that a person cannot become a bricklayer unless he is the son of a bricklayer.  I have not yet seen any definite proof of that.  I know the Commission was set <Col N="455" /> up and had this matter specially referred to it.  It was expected that that claim, if it could be proved, would have been proved or that evidence would be brought before the Commission in regard to it.  I have searched the records of the Commission and I have not found that it was proved.</P>
      <P>Statements were made with regard to that particular situation.  Supposing it does hold at this particular moment, my difficulty is, what allows that condition of things, what is it that permits it to operate?  It is stated to be in operation for a long time.  Is it that certain Trade Unions are powerful enough to enforce it, or is it that there is collusion between trades unions and employers in a particular business?  If it is a trade union regulation and the trade union is enforcing it, is it expected that a phrase in a Bill giving the Minister power to do something is going to end the matter?  Surely the best thing is to have it dealt with as it is dealt with here.  We can get either the employers, if they are aggrieved at the situation, or the employees if they are aggrieved to bring forward an application to have the trade designated.  Once it is designated we have two parties equally represented and three appointed members who, more or less, arbitrate the matter, and bring forward a rule.  That rule may not be pleasing to either of the parties, but there is a chance of having the matter ventilated as between the representatives of the trades union and the employers with two or three outsiders chosen for their impartiality, and who decide what they think is the best rule. Again, I do not see that the enforcement of a compulsory system is going to work immediately.  It will have to be set out on this basis, to see if we can get these things brought and liquidated before the appointed members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass is against the division between the trade board trades and the non-trade board trades.  I think it is necessary to keep the division. We have a trade board system in operation here for a limited number of grievances.  Under the trade boards there is a regulation of learnerships <Col N="456" /> and it would be difficult to have two bodies dealing with the matter.  The Deputy said why not leave out the trade boards?  I imagine he meant why not leave out the distinction between the trade boards trades and the others and have them all dealt with by apprenticeship committees.  Why establish such a committee when we have a committee doing practically the same thing already?</P>

      <P>For different purposes, but working properly, committees which have a knowledge of the trades and the work that is thrown on them.  Why should not we accept these established people in the limited number of trades to which the trade boards apply?  There is nothing at conflict between the trade boards and the others.  We have one set of individuals ready to hand, and they have given good work.  We can decide whether or not we make them an apprenticeship committee.  They will have to take on extra duties but they will not be hindered in that by the type of work they have already done.  There is no incompatibility in the duties.  They are the proper people to do the work.  A Deputy said that there is no such division in South Africa.  I do not think there are such trade boards in South Africa.</P>

It is a number which fluctuates because certain trades may be brought under its application and others may be removed. I do not think it complicates the measure by having them here. They are doing good work at present, and they are the very type which we set out to get under an apprenticeship system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the matter of premiums we have no explicit prohibition on premiums and bonuses as they have in South Afrca, but I cannot conceive of premiums being legal in any trade in which there is an apprenticeship committee formed hereafter, because the Committee <Col N="457" /> will make rules which will determine the contract and there is no question of a rule with regard to premiums. That is a matter that will have to be examined further between now and the Committee Stage.  I cannot see that a premium or bonus will be possible hereafter in connection with any trade which is designated, and for which the Apprenticeship Committee has made a rule.  Somebody asked why not take away premiums and bonuses in regard to all business.  We are dealing with apprentices in a particular scheme and we can only deal with premiums in designated trades.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to inquire whether it has ever been provided in any Bill that imperial preference shall be granted, or is that altogether an arrangement outside any enactment? One of the things arising from this Bill, I think, is that imperial preference is to be granted in regard to woollens, but presumably it is not to take place in regard to butter.  There is no imperial preference in regard to butter imported from any of the Dominions.  What is the statutory power in regard to the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in the power of the Oireachtas entirely to give the preference according to some principle. In the case of butter, I think it was mainly because of the large supply that came from New Zealand and Australia that a situation arose which rendered it necessary to have an application for a tariff on butter.  In the case of the other articles, the Tariff Commission had that before them and made a recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is: is there statutory authority for this imperial preference apart from the particular Bill providing for the tariff and the particular articles dealt with?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHayes" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Michael Hayes">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The tariff must be provided for by an Act.  If the imperial preference means that articles from certain places come in less than the ordinary tariffs, that must be provided for in the particular Act in every case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another question with regard to clause 2 of Section 1, which states that the Revenue Commissioners may permit such butter to be imported without the payment of the duty mentioned in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it clear, I wonder, after the butter is imported and duty is paid, if it is then found that the duty need not have been paid, that there will be power under that section to make repayment? The revenue officials are, as a rule, very conscientious.  Sometimes they take a long time before they will pass <Col N="459" /> a consignment where there is any doubt about it.  It may be that the importer wanting goods quickly will rather pay the duty and take delivery of the goods than wait until the Revenue Commissioners are in a position to decide to pass the consignment without payment of the duty.  It seems a doubtful thing if under the existing section a refund of such duty could be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>I would strongly advise anybody to get permission to import it without paying.  That is, I think, the intention of the section.  The Revenue Commissioners may, subject to compliance with such conditions as they think fit to impose, permit such butter to be imported, without the payment of duty mentioned in the section. That is how the section runs.  It is clear that you ought to get it in free. I would not advise taking the other risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear that if the duty is once paid it cannot be refunded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haslett</NameTxt>
      <P>When the resolution connected with this Bill was before the House previously I drew attention to what I thought was a very serious anomaly in the case of residents in the Free State, and at the risk of repeating myself I would again draw the attention of the Department to this. The case was brought to my notice that 28 years ago there was a co-operative creamery organised by the residents of portion of South Armagh and Monaghan.  The site for the creamery happened to be 20 yards inside the boundary of the County Armagh.  The work has been going on and it has been a fairly successful creamery.  It is a central creamery, doing churning and all.  The suppliers of that creamery were, of course, co-operative suppliers who had taken shares in it.  All went well and there was no trouble until we passed a resolution imposing a duty on butter.  As a result of that resolution the suppliers of that creamery found <Col N="460" /> that they were included in that tariff, and that though the milk was produced in the farms of the Free State, and brought across the boundary to be manufactured into butter, they were asked to pay a tariff on their own butter when they wanted to take it back from the creamery after being manufactured.  Now, these shareholders were entitled to get that butter from the creamery at wholesale prices. But the financial resolution passed here meant that they became liable to a tariff.  It worked out in practice that the farmer who had produced the milk on his farm and sent it to the creamery 20 yards across into Armagh would, on bringing back that butter, be liable to pay 4d. per lb. duty on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I drew the attention, in the form of a question, of the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners to this hardship.  The answer I got was that the number affected was so small that it would not be worth while to make the exemption.  I then made inquiries of the two creameries that are affected.  One was the Fane Valley creamery, and the other was the Aughnacloy creamery.  As a result of that inquiry, I discovered that there were 250 suppliers in the Fane Valley creamery and 110 in the other.  That is, altogether, 360 farmers in Monaghan who were affected by this resolution. Another reason urged against the shareholders of the creamery was that there would be a difficulty in making any distinction.  There, again, I may say that all those who are suppliers to the creameries have a creamery card, on which is entered the amount of milk supplied.  At the end of the card, there is a column showing the amount of goods or butter brought back from the creamery.  In that way there is a thorough check.  At the end of the month, the shareholder gets a cheque for the balance coming to him, so that there would be no difficulty whatsoever in the matter of administration. In regard to the question of getting a supply from another creamery, I want to say that there is no other creamery within eight miles of these suppliers.  In addition, even if there were other creameries, the farmers could not buy the butter on the <Col N="461" /> same terms because they would not be shareholders in the other creameries. As shareholders, they are entitled to get the butter at a fraction over the cost price.</P>
    <P>I think when we go to trouble in Section 3 here to protect the Northern Ireland farmer we should give some protection to our own citizens.  I do not disagree with the protection given to the Northern farmer who is marketing his normal supply. We are protecting the Northern Ireland farmer when the butter is made from his own cows, and when the quantity does not exceed 56 lbs. if it is imported on a market day.  In my opinion, if we are to have this tariff at all, we should have a further exemption in the matter to which I have drawn attention.  We should exempt the farmers in the Free State who produced on their own farms, milk, from which butter is made in Northern Ireland.  These farmers have been supplying milk to that creamery for 28 years.  I want to draw the attention of the House to it.  I think that is an anomaly that should be removed.</P>

I undertake to bring the matter before the Minister for Finance and see if it is possible to meet the Deputy's point. I think it would make the administration exceedingly difficult.  The concession that was made already was one that affects to a large extent marketing in the towns concerned.  On that point the farmers were benefited and everybody was well satisfied.  The original idea was for the purpose of making markets on the old lines possible.  On the other question, there does appear <Col N="462" /> to be some difficulty.

      <P>On the adjournment the other day I had almost concluded the remarks which I intended making to the House.  It is not my intention to go over any of the matters which I dealt with on that occasion.  I think I have dealt with all the points raised which could be regarded as of any importance except possibly one point and I will deal with that point now. It is a point to which attention was drawn at some little length.  It is the point that the fees paid to sheriffs were excessive.  The principal fee which is paid to the sheriff is a fee of very long standing.  It is a fee of 1/- in the £ upon the amount collected. All the other fees which are paid to the sheriff are really fees which reimburse the sheriff and his officers for out-of-pocket expenses.  I do not see how this scale of fees could reasonably be reduced.  It is necessary for the performance of the work of sheriffs that we should have good men as sub-sheriffs and good men as sheriffs' officers.  In order to ensure having good and reliable men it is necessary that they should receive something approaching a reasonable remuneration. They are men through whose hands considerable sums of money are certain to pass and, therefore, it is necessary that they should not be underpaid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that in certain cases it may appear that the sheriff's fees are altogether excessive in comparison <Col N="464" /> with the amount collected.  If the sheriff has a very considerable distance to go and has a small sum to collect, if he is not paid when he reacnes the debtor's house and if he has to seize cattle, to impound them and put them up for sale, the expenses naturally will amount to a very considerable sum.  Who is to pay that unavoidable sum?  At the present moment the debtor pays it.  If the debtor did not pay, either the creditor or the State would have to pay.  It would be very unfair to the creditor that he should have to pay.  All he wants is the amount of money due to him and he ought to get that.  On the other hand it would be extremely inadvisable if the State were made to pay.  I venture to think that a very large number of debtors would not pay until the sheriff came, and was put to every possible inconvenience, and until the State was put to every possible inconvenience and expense, if they thought that the extra cost of seizure would not come out of their own pockets.  Therefore, I do not see that any reduction could be made in the present scale paid to the sheriffs&mdash;one shilling in the £ on the amount collected and their out-of&mdash;pocket expenses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>The greatest care should be taken beforehand that the goods there are worth taking&mdash;that it is not going to be a case of nulla bona. There have been cases where small farmers have had their cattle seized and they only paid for the costs and did not cover the debt.</P>

      <P>The sheriff cannot know, until he goes to the place, that it is a case of nulla bona; he cannot tell until he sees whether the man has, or has not, stock upon his land.  I venture to think that the Deputy also knows that very often it is a case of nulla bona when the sheriff arrives, because his coming is observed. I think the Deputy will agree <Col N="465" /> with me in that.  If the Deputy has any suggestion to make at the moment &mdash;he does not appear to have&mdash;it will, I am sure, be given every consideration. If he puts any suggestion to the Parliamentary Secretary in that respect I am sure it will receive full consideration.</P>

      <P>I raised a question with regard to confidential documents. Does the Minister intend to continue the practice of sending out what he calls confidential, but what I describe as secret, documents to the courts? Will the Minister define for me what is a secret and what is a confidential document according to the interpretation of his Department?  Will he also say what reason he has for not possessing sufficient confidence in the people prosecuting in the courts? Will he explain why he has found it necessary to communicate with justices in the courts regarding what, in his opinion, should be sufficient penalties and sufficient deterrents? Will the Minister say if he approves of an ordinary citizen sending secret and confidential documents to justices in the courts for the purpose of influencing these courts in a certain way?  Also has it been the practice, for some considerable time, to send those secret and confidential memos. to the courts?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that I am not at all satisfied with the explanation given by the Minister as to this particular point.  I can conceive no object in the minds of the Department who sent this circular except to induce District Justices to increase the fines with regard to particular offences, and I do not agree that that is the way that should be done.  If it is the view that certain offences are being dealt with by the District Justices in a way they should not be, and that the fines are not sufficient to meet the charges, there are many things that could be done.  Legislation introducing minimum fines might be introduced, or a public statement might be made, but the very worst way <Col N="466" /> is the method adopted in this case by the Department.  It can serve no purpose unless it is to induce the Justices to do what their own discretion, up to that at any rate, told them they should not do, and that is undoubtedly interfering with the discretion of the District Justices.  I have read the Minister's statement carefully, and I cannot gather from it that he was justified in sending information.  I think he did more than send information in this particular way.  I think, if that practice is followed, it will create a bad impression in the minds of the public. In the country, Deputies or others with influence are being continually approached by litigants, who are ignorant of the conditions, suggesting that they ought to use influence with the District Justices.  I know that Deputies are often compelled to inform them that they have no right, and that nobody has a right to interfere with a District Justice and suggest to him what he should do in any case.</P>
      <P>I have done that with regard to suggestions made to me in respect to the School Attendance Act.  It has been suggested that the Minister for Justice or somebody else should make representations to the District Justices with regard to the fines inflicted. I have resolutely opposed any such ideas coming from any Ministry or Department to District Justices in this matter.  I was very greatly surprised to see that it was possible for a Minister to circulate a private and confidential document to District Justices suggesting what they should do, not in any individual case&mdash;that was not suggested&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I did not understand that it was suggested in an individual case.  I rather thought it referred to a class of cases.  I think it is wrong and should not be done.  I think if it is necessary a public statement might be made by a Minister, or public opinion might be influenced in some way on the matter, but certainly the issue of a circular like this will give the impression to the public that the Minister has the right and power to influence the decision of judges.  That is what I <Col N="467" /> object to, and I think the Minister should give an undertaking that it will not be done in the future.</P>

      <P>As Deputy O'Connell has pointed out, there is absolutely no foundation for the charge which Deputy Ruttledge hurled at my Department, that judges were being influenced in particular cases.  If Deputy O'Connell happens to read that document which appears in the printed returns he will see there clearly stated that it is the duty of the District Justice to decide each particular case as it comes before him, and to do what he thinks is right.  That is the only thing which was marked confidential, and it contained simply &ldquo;Do what you think is right.&rdquo;  It was marked &ldquo;confidential.&rdquo;  It might have been marked &ldquo;personal.&rdquo;  It was simply a circular which was meant to reach the District Justice himself.  As far as the general document enclosed in it was concerned it was nothing except putting statistics before the District Justices showing that that particular crime was on the increase, and that the penalties up to this were not sufficient to prevent it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone knows that a District Justice or any other judge, in apportioning the sentence he is going to give to a person who has committed any particular offence, will have regard&mdash;I must say in the first instance&mdash;to the frequency of the crime and the necessity for the punishment being a deterrent to the offender and to others.  Unless the District Justice has got full <Col N="468" /> statistics, as to the increase in crime when crime is increasing, I do not see how he can exercise his judgment properly, because he has not got the facts before him.  This did nothing except put facts before him, and there is not a single word in that document&mdash;in fact, it is the very opposite&mdash;saying that his judgment is to be influenced.</P>
    <P>We could, of course, take the step of putting on minimum fines, but that is not desirable except in rare instances. In certain cases it is desirable to have a minimum sentence, but as a general proposition I do not think it is desirable. Deputy Ruttledge asked: &ldquo;Have you no confidence in the persons conducting prosecutions?&rdquo; What has the person conducting a prosecution to do with the sentence?  All he can say is: &ldquo;We press for a full fine in this case,&rdquo; and he can do nothing more.</P>

      <P>This Estimate shows a nett increase of £5,421 on that for the previous year.  This increase results from a substantial decline in the estimated amount of the Appropriations-in-Aid of the Vote.  The gross total of the Vote is slightly less than that for the previous year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="471" /> Sub-head A: Salaries, Wages and Pay.&mdash;This sub-head shows a decrease of nearly £15,000 below the corresponding figure for last year.  This reduction has been rendered possible by a reduction in the strength of the force effected by not filling vacancies which occurred through wastage during recent years.  A number of stations have been closed and the strength of several rural stations has been reduced.  The Estimate makes provision for a total working strength of 6,900, plus an average of 40 recruits in training, to fill vacancies normally arising through wastage.  This strength of 6,900 is a reduction of more than 300 below the authorised strength of two years ago (7,212).  About 35 rural stations have been closed during recent years, and the revised scheme of distribution now provides for 808 stations outside Dublin (as compared with 1,129 R.I.C. stations in the same area).  In 370 rural stations the strength of the unit has been reduced to one sergeant and three Guards.  No further reduction below a strength of 6,900 is possible without closing other stations, or relieving the Gárda of such non-police duties as the collection of agricultural statistics, or the duties in relation to the School Attendance Act.  Neither of these steps is feasible.</P>
    <P>Sub-head B: Allowances.&mdash;This sub-head shows an increase of £11,466, due entirely to the increased number of men who will be entitled to rent allowance during the coming year.  Marriages are taking place at the rate of about 37 per month, and it is estimated that about 2,742 sergeants and guards will be drawing rent allowance by the end of the financial year.  The amount paid varies from a minimum of £13 in rural areas to a maximum of £30 in the cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford.</P>
    <P>Sub-head C: Subsistence Allowance.</P>
    <P>&mdash;This sub-head shows a decrease of £750, and Sub-head D&mdash;Locomotion Expenses&mdash;shows a decrease of £1,000. Sub-head E&mdash;Clothing&mdash;shows an increase of about £6,000, due to the fact that large issues of great coats, waterproof coats and breeches fall due to be made during the coming financial year. <Col N="472" /> The other sub-heads call for no special observations.</P>
    <P>Appropriations-in-Aid.  &mdash; The estimated appropriations-in-aid show a substantial decrease, as owing to the automatic reduction in the police rate in the Dublin Metropolitan area the amount to be received from that source will be nearly £7,000 less than during the previous year.</P>

      <P>Quite serious.  We are opposed to this Vote on the ground that economies which could have been effected have not been effected during the past year.  According to the Minister's statement, economies are not anticipated during the coming year.  It is obvious from the Minister's statement that recruiting has again commenced. The Minister referred to forty recruits at present undergoing training. It was clear from the Minister's statement last year that no recruiting was contemplated.  He then stated that vacancies arising either from dismissals or resignations would not be filled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Strength&rdquo; was not mentioned.  I have looked up the debates on the Estimate.  We gathered from the Minister's statement last year that in that way the force might be reduced by the process of time to something like normal limits.  During the past year, the vacancies that occurred were: Fifty men from resignations or otherwise, <Col N="473" /> and 12 sergeants.  That is the reduction in numbers between this year and last, as disclosed in the Estimate.  The previous year the reduction was something like 300 men. That reduction was due to resignations, dismissals or otherwise.  We contend that this country could be policed with a much smaller force than there is at present, and that by doing so you would not be taking away from the efficiency of the force.</P>
      <P>At the present time we see stations all over the country, in places where there is no necessity for them.  Under present conditions of transport and telephone communication, we believe a smaller force could attend to the needs of the community, the protection of property, and so on.  It is quite obvious that this country is not able to bear the expense that the maintenance of the present police force imposes upon it.  The reduction of the forces is one of the ways in which economies could be effected.  We could do with a smaller number of men without in any way impairing the efficiency of the force.</P>
      <P>The Minister seems to be reluctant to take any step in that direction.  Is it that he fears that by doing so he would be throwing men out of employment, and that in the present economic condition of the country he would be unable to find other positions or jobs for them? If that is his attitude, then I say it is the wrong line to go on.  We admit, of course, that the economic condition of the country is fairly bad.  It is difficult to procure employment, but that is no justification for having a redundant force as we described it before.  The force is altogether out of proportion to the needs of the community.  We are disappointed that recruiting seems to have commenced again.  The Minister has not indicated the number of recruits that it is proposed to take during the coming year.  In view of the statement the Minister made last year, that no vacancies would be filled, this seems a backward step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other matter that I wish to refer to.  Perhaps I should have raised it on the Vote for the Minister's Department, but as it had not come to my knowledge at that time I <Col N="474" /> may be permitted to refer to it now. I would like to have some explanation from the Minister with regard to the Clonakilty affair that occurred on Easter Monday evening.  If the information that has reached me is correct, it would appear that certain members of the C.I.D. ran amok in the town of Clonakilty on that night.  It would also appear that the Guards who went out to try and establish law and order amongst them, who tried to arrest these people and to curb their activities in some way, were unable to do so.  When the Minister is replying I would be glad if he would refer to that matter and say whether an inquiry has been held, and what action has been taken by him with regard to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting the contention of Deputy Ruttledge I would like to remind the Minister what the police figures were at one time compared with what they are now.  In a statement made by the late Minister for Justice in October, 1923, he pointed out, whilst the authorised strength of the Royal Irish Constabulary for the whole of Ireland was 11,844 in January, 1914, that the actual strength at that time was only 7,859.  The number in the Dublin Metropolitan Police was 1,124. The total strength for the whole country was 8,983.  Suppose we take these as figures which might be in operation in Ireland to-day&mdash;which is going very far indeed&mdash;and suppose we subtract the figures for the Royal Ulster Constabulary, then, what would be the strength for the Twenty-Six Counties? The Royal Ulster Constabulary numbers 2,934.  Even then, when we subtract that from the other figures we get 6,049, so that in actual fact the figures are at present larger for the Twenty-Six Counties.  The figures today are 6,944, and, as Deputy Ruttledge pointed out, about 50 or 60 more than last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Actually in police strength the figures are greater now than in 1914.  In an interview given at one time by the late Michael Collins he stated that the country could be <Col N="475" /> policed with, I think, a force as small as 500.  Even if we do not accept these figures at present there is, at the same time, room for an enormous reduction in the number of police.  The Minister has not given any details as to the daily, weekly and monthly work of the various policemen &mdash; sergeants and guards&mdash;so that we are left without sufficient information.  Lest the Minister might try to draw some fine and non-existent distinction between Deputy Ruttledge's attitude and my attitude, let me say that I agree thoroughly with Deputy Ruttledge.  I say that apparently there are far too many policemen.  One has only to judge by their conduct as one sees them to see that there are a great many more than are necessary.</P>
      <P>Apparently they have not a great deal to do.  The only thing we can suggest is that there should be a proper enquiry into the whole matter, so that we would know exactly what the duties of these men are.  I do not say that they have no duties, but I suggest that their duties could be carried out by a much smaller number.  After all, the amount of this Vote is very large. It represents £1,609,426 of the taxpayers' money.  It is perhaps one of the largest Votes, and one to which we should pay very great attention, because it is one upon which very great economy could, I am sure, be made.</P>
      <P>One of the objections, of course, to the present constitution of the Guards is that they are really drawn from one political party only, and they have shown that in various ways, during election time.  We had experience of the activities of the Guards at the by-election in Westmeath Longford.  I mention that again in order to get from the Minister an undertaking that the Guards will not be used in future for political purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was after April.  In any case, my purpose in mentioning it is, so that we might get the benefit of debate, so that the conduct that occurred at that time will not be repeated, and that we will have a public statement from the Minister, that in future the Guards will not be encouraged in any way to take any part in political activities, but to remain a neutral body in all these matters. After all, the respect which we have for law depends largely on the non-partisanship and neutrality of the judges and of the police.  I had one example of their political activities in Waterford where it was reported to me that detective officers had made special enquiries about my activities in the city, which I think is a most objectionable thing to do about a public representative.  It could have been done for no other but political purposes.</P>
      <P>
        <i>[An Leas-Cheann Comhairle took the Chair.]</i>
      </P>
      <P>The enquiries were with reference to the meetings I was having.  Again the conduct of the Guards recently was most fatuous when they made a raid on certain premises occupied by the Cumann na mBan and seized leaflets which advocated the buying of Irish goods as against British goods.  These leaflets were seized and solemnly held for some time before being returned. Surely the Minister could employ persons with at least the capacity to read before sending them to seize whatever they can lay hands on.  Of course it is an outrage on citizenship that such a thing should be allowed at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain statements were made recently by the Commissioner of Police and I hope the Minister will see that the same kind of statements will not be made again.  They arose out of a controversy about school attendance, where the Commissioner of Police made an attack on the District Justice in Waterford, and suggested that the administration of the School Attendance Act was not being properly <Col N="477" /> carried out.  The District Justice replied that any decision of his that had been appealed had been upheld, and he stated that if there was any other case where the police were dissatisfied, they could have appealed.  I hope the Minister will see that in future statements of that sort are not made by the police authorities.</P>
    <P>There are other statements which require to be noticed.  A particular statement was made which is more calculated to bring ridicule on the police than anything else, and certainly disregard and contempt of certain judges.  By way of <i>obiter dicta</i> Judge McElligott at Ennis made remarks in reference to the police.  He said that they were buffeted by politicians, they were ballyragged by justices, they were beset by solicitors, and badgered by counsel.  I do not know if there is any remedy for that sort of thing, but I think a public protest should be made against such expressions being used by one Department of the State about another Department of the State, and casting slurs on every one concerned.</P>
    <P>Last year I referred to the large amount of travelling expenses under sub-head D.  I pointed out that the expenses were very high, and asked the Minister to look into the matter. I gathered from his introductory statement that travelling expenses had actually been increased by £1,000.  I do not quite follow that, because the Estimate appears to be just about the same.  In any case, my contention remains the same, that it is a matter upon which there could be a very considerable reduction.</P>
    <P>I also submitted to the Minister last year that he should issue an order that the police should buy Irish manufactures, and that they could, for instance, get excellent Irish bicycles.  His answer was that he was not going to interfere with them.  That is a most extraordinary attitude on the part of the Department.  Here is public money being spent by public officials and it is not to be spent upon Irish manufactures. Surely we are entitled, when it is a question of public money used by public officials, to see that Irish manufactures, <Col N="478" /> where they are as good as foreign manufactures, should be exclusively purchased.  It would be very easy if the bicycles did not give full satisfaction from the point of view of police work to arrange for orders upon such an extensive scale as would make it worth while for the firms assembling or making bicycles in this country to adapt themselves to whatever the requirements of the police may be.  Some months ago a rumour was rife that a charge had been made against a high police officer in reference to defalcations in connection with the secret service funds.  Without going into the details of the matter, I would be glad if the Minister would give us information on it.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister what is a well-founded lie.  I hope the Minister will take the opportunity of clearing up the Stradbally case and of admitting that there was no murder in that case.  I should also like to point out that the Minister admitted <Col N="479" /> that his Department knew where the witness Fitzgerald was.  It looked as if the Department in some way was responsible for his leaving Stradbally, for his subsequent residence somewhere else, so that people did not know where he was.  It was an extraordinary thing that he should have disappeared in such a way, and that no one in the country knew where he was, except the Department of Justice, upon their own admission. I think there is a very strong case to be made for a reduction in the expenditure of this Department.</P>

      <P>Whilst a semblance of a case might be made for a reduction in the Army Vote, no case has been made, or can be made, to reduce this Vote.  While we have indications of peace and ordered conditions in the country, at the same time, there are occurrences which considerably upset the public mind.  There is no need to refer further to the case or cases to which I am alluding.  But, if anything were wanting to strengthen my belief in the great need for a numerous and well-paid police force, it is the tragic thing that occurred within the last few weeks.</P>
      <P>Certain comments have been made on the conduct of individual Guards. I know of no police force against whom charges of a similar kind might not easily be made.  As an Irishman, I feel a certain amount of pride in the fact that this young force has made good in a remarkably short time.  It must not be forgotten that in addition to all the duties at one time performed by the R.I.C., this force have to perform point duty in cities and towns where before point duty was not performed. We should also remember that owing to the increase in motor traffic in cities and towns this is a very onerous duty indeed and requires a good deal of training on the part of these men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would much prefer to hear, in a debate on a Vote of this character, some comment, for instance, on the unhygienic conditions under which some of these Guards are housed.  The Minister must know that in many cases the Guards are housed in unsanitary and unhygienic buildings, and that <Col N="480" /> many of them have contracted tuberculosis as a result of the conditions under which they have to exist in these out-of-the-way barracks.  If I had any further comment to offer it would be that owing to the clamours of certain elements around Waterford a Superintendent of the Gárda had to be sacrificed in order to satisfy somebody else. I have heard no comment on that.  The Civic Guard appear to be fair game and a cock-shot for every disgruntled member of the community.  I know we have a good way to travel yet before we can reach that stage of civic responsibility and civic sense when we will have some of the ordinary civilian members of the community coming to the assistance of the Guards in the execution of their duty.  I know that that is not a very popular doctrine to preach to some sections of the community, but it is a doctrine which, if not practised, is advocated by many sensible and good citizens. One thing which makes me feel ashamed sometimes is the lack of moral courage shown by our own people in not saying what I am saying at present.  We have had comments made with regard to over-zeal on the part of some of the Guards.  I condemn that as much as any Deputy.</P>
    <P>The Gárda Síochána is only a human institution, and as such it is bound to have its defects and limitations, but I do seriously suggest that as a police force it is second to none in Europe. Comment was made by Deputy Little in regard to a statement made by a high officer of the Civic Guards in connection with the administration of justice under the School Attendance Act. That officer has replied, in the public Press, and has satisfied me and, I venture to think, every decent-minded citizen, that in what he said he did not in any way overstep his official duty. If I remember rightly, the case to which Deputy Little referred was a statement made by this officer or Commissioner of the Police with regard to the administration of this Act, that he commented, with regard to the administration of the Act, that he and those who were his subordinates endeavoured to carry out the Act as laid down by this House, and that, when <Col N="481" /> they brought a case which they considered a good case, and had evidence at their disposal going to show that they should have got a conviction, they were frustrated in this because of the decision given by a certain District Justice in that case.  That was the statement made&mdash;I am referring to the case mentioned by Deputy Little.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Deputy if he read the reply of the District Justice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I read the accusation of the District Justice and the reply from the Commissioner, and the reply satisfied me that the Commissioner was right and the District Justice was wrong, and I am satisfied with that. I am not a lawyer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>That explains the Deputy's confusion of mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite easy to accuse an official and by a certain process of elimination, and taking things out of their context, to hold up that officer to odium or otherwise to penalise him for giving expression to what he thought to be true and knew to be true.  It may have been, if you like, a slight breach of discipline, but I question it, and the officer in question completely justified himself in the reply to the District Justice concerned.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the Stradbally case.  I do not know whether that was quite in order or not, but I am aware of this, that a superintendent was sacrificed over it and I have not heard Deputy Little or anyone else suggest that the officer should be compensated in some way for the blunders of somebody else.  Oh no.  It was quite sufficient that he was a member of the Civic Guards.  That was the damnable thing; it was sufficient to hang him that he was a member of the Civic Guards.  While I believe that it is absolutely essential that we should be entitled to bring into review the conduct of any member of this force, whether ordinary guard, superintendent, or chief commissioner, at the same time I feel that in reviewing the conduct of those guards we should have regard to the evidence and to the facts before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="482" /> Deputy Little himself admitted that he put forward a case on rumour, to quote his own words to the Minister. If that is the policy pursued, to level charges against individual members of the Gárda based on rumour, I submit that it is not cricket, that it is not playing the game, and that it is not sportsmanship.  I felt myself in agreement with Deputy Little when he suggested that it should be incumbent on the Gárda, though I would not deprive any man of his freedom, as a civic force to support in every way Irish industry.  I have no knowledge of cases where they do not, but I did myself some years ago mention upon this Vote a case where members of the Gárda were supplied with civilian cloth manufactured in a foreign country. I was not slow to mention that case here, and I agree to this extent with Deputy Little, that while the Minister may not be entitled by any Act passed by this House to bring pressure to bear on the Gárda to support Irish industry, at the same time I feel sure that a circular letter from his Department would have the right effect.  I do not want to occupy the time of the House too long upon this matter, but I always feel that attacking a force of this kind in an indiscriminate way without any solid foundation for the charges, is not a right or a proper thing to do, especially in view of the fact that these men are in the main fulfilling their duties in a most satisfactory manner&mdash;satisfactory to their superior officers, satisfactory to the State, and satisfactory to the citizens of the State.  In such circumstances I feel that while they cannot make themselves vocal and have little or no contact with members of this House&mdash;they have no Dáil Deputy or Senator to voice their feelings in these matters&mdash;I would not be doing my duty to the city that I represent or to the people of this country generally if I did not say what I have said in defence of a force which is one of the finest this or any other country ever had.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, I would like to say that I am quite ready to make any representation and to have any fair inquiry into <Col N="483" /> the conduct of any policeman concerned in the Stradbally case.  If Deputy Anthony suggests that I made any attack on any of those people without having sufficient ground he is making a great mistake.  I am quite ready to press for any fair inquiry into the conduct of any men where they court inquiry themselves.  At least one does court full inquiry into his conduct, and I am prepared to press for that inquiry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Wolfe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ruttledge and Deputy Little seem to be rather unhappy in their mind about the number of Guards in the country.  I, for one, think that something might be said the other way about, and that in certain cases the number is not sufficient. I think if a vote were taken throughout the Free State as to a reduction in the Gárda the overwhelming majority would be in favour of the retention of the present number, or even of increasing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that when there is talk of doing away with police stations people are very outspoken in their opinions as to the consequences of such abolition.  Any action of that kind is most unpopular, so far as I know.  I agree entirely with what Deputy Anthony said in praise of the force.  I think that it is a force of which we have every reason to be proud and, as he said, I do not think that there is a police force in any country which could surpass it.  Young as the force is, and considering the immense amount of work which the Guards have to do, I think that the force is very efficient. Some people seem to think because they see a Guard sitting in front of his barracks that he has nothing to do.  Such people seem to have the idea that Guards should work for twenty-four hours without rest.  As a matter of fact if the Guards belonged to a Trade Union there would probably be a row about the amount of work they do, and the number of hours they work. There are one or two points to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention.  Last year I mentioned that there are some police stations on main roads in which the telephone has not been installed.  I repeat the point now, <Col N="484" /> and say that it is most important that all police stations on main roads should have a telephone service.  Accidents frequently occur on such roads, and a telephone service is extremely important, especially at night.</P>
    <P>Two stations which I have particularly in mind are those at Kill and Clane.  It is important that they should have a telephone installation.  In the case of Kill barracks which is on the main road where accidents usually occur, it is improper that there is no telephone service, and that the police have to depend on the goodwill of a neighbour for any information which has to be hurriedly conveyed to the station.  Another matter to which I desire to refer is the question of vagrancy which is, of course, under the control of the police.  It seems that the laws dealing with vagrancy are somewhat vague.  As many Deputies know, there has been an enormous increase in recent years in this country, in the number of what are called gipsies or travelling tinkers, so much so, that they are becoming a dangerous nuisance. For a long time I thought that my county was exceptional, but I have observed from reading the newspapers that the nuisance is becoming quite common.  Only those in the midst of such counties as Kildare, Louth and Meath realise its extent.  These people block up even the main roads, and in some cases stay there for a considerable time.  They stay sometimes as long as six weeks on the Dublin road, and when they leave the whole place is littered with rags and bottles, and everything likely to be dangerous. They often leave their animals behind, sometimes in a dying condition, on the road, and they become a great danger especially at night to motorists.</P>
    <P>In their caravans there are generally an enormous number of people.  In three caravans, I was informed some time ago, that there were between twenty-five and thirty-two children. That state of affairs should not be allowed to exist.  These people must be evading the School Attendance Act, and it is to the detriment of the State that such a state of affairs should be allowed to go on.  I certainly hope that something will be done to stop it.  Very <Col N="485" /> often at night these people drive their horses into fields where there are growing crops, and great damage is done.  This nuisance is becoming common, and some law or by-laws will have to be put into force to deal with it.  It is a national loss that the children of these people should be exempt from any humanising effort to make them better citizens.  It is very undesirable that a lot of people of a very low class of society should be allowed to ramble all over the country without, apparently, very much supervision.  I think that the matter requires to be seen into and dealt with, and I hope that the Minister will do something in regard to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shaw</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take the opportunity afforded on this Vote of paying a well-earned tribute to the Gárdai.  They are a popular, efficient and impartial body of men, and a credit to the country that gave them birth.  They enjoy the confidence of the vast majority of the people in this country, that is, of people who desire law and order.  They are, of course, unpopular with people who do not like law and order.  On many occasions, in this House and outside of it, lying charges have been made against them, charges which could not stand the light of day when they were investigated. They are a force which, in my opinion, has been a wonderful success. They are unarmed, an experiment which certainly seemed doubtful when they were established.  We all know the conditions which prevailed in this country when the force was first set up.  It seemed to be taking a great chance to leave the Guards unarmed, but it has proved highly successful. They are an assurance that the peace established in this country at a terrible price will be maintained.  They are, and always will be, a living tribute to the memory of the late Minister for Justice, who was responsible for their establishment.  They are the admiration of the country and of people out side it.  Deputy Anthony, I think deserves great credit for having spokes about them as he did, and every Deputy who does not agree with the foul charges made against them should get up here and say what he think <Col N="486" /> about a body of men who established peace in this country.</P>

      <P>(Clare): With regard to the training of the Gárda, most of us are aware of the congested state of our streets and of the attempts to regulate traffic.  What I observe about the control of traffic by the men on point duty is that they seem to concentrate their attention entirely on vehicular traffic. They seem to take into account all sorts of vehicular traffic, but concentration on the pedestrian is almost negligible.  I believe that that is due to their training.  Some consideration should be given as to how traffic is controlled in other places.  I am sure that the Minister is aware of traffic conditions elsewhere.  In other cities he can see the police on point duty holding up the traffic in the street in order to allow a woman with a child to cross the street and taking particular care of pedestrains.  Pedestrains, however, in this city seem to get little attention. Certainly they do not receive a tithe of the consideration which they deserve from the men on point duty. This matter should be brought to the notice of those who are responsible for that training.  I do not know whether these Guards have got training in other centres in order to see how traffic is conducted there.  Certainly they should give more attention to pedestrians than they do.  If the Minister stood at any street corner he would see how vehicles get all consideration but pedestrains little or none.</P>

      <P>The debates on this Estimate have always one feature in common, the senseless attacks launched by the Fianna Fáil Party against the Guards.  We have had Deputy Ruttledge coming along to-day and saying, as usual, that the Guards should be reduced in numbers because there are too many of them all over the country.  I suppose that <Col N="487" /> Deputy Ruttledge happens to think that that suits his Party's political policy for the moment, but I can tell him that that is not the view even of members of his own Party, and that wherever barracks have been shut down protests have reached my Department, and they have not by any means been confined to our political supporters.  There is necessity, and great necessity, for Guards in this country.  Every ratepayer is entitled to have his property and his person protected.  Every inhabitant of the country is entitled to an adequate police force to protect him.  That is the main object of every Government, and the duty of every Government is to provide an adequate police force that will restrain crime.  Deputies opposite may not like that, but it is the duty of every proper Government. The Deputy went on to talk about the Clonakilty affair.  I do not know what he means by the Clonakilty affair.  No complaint has reached my Department about the Clonakilty affair.  If the Deputy wished for any information on that subject he should have put down a question.  If there are charges to be made against the Guards, that is not a new procedure.  It is an old procedure, but apparently the Deputy prefers to come along here and bring charges against the Guards.</P>

      <P>I will leave Deputy Ruttledge and come on to Deputy Little.  Deputy Little started off by saying that the Guards are not impartial. The Guards are impartial. The Guards do their duty irrespective of who a person is.  Deputy Little talked about Longford-Westmeath, and said that the Guards were not impartial during the election there.  Certain charges were made in this House.  I investigated the charges, and I am <Col N="488" /> perfectly satisfied that the charges were made without foundation.  The Deputy went on&mdash;and here is where Deputy Anthony brought him to book and very rightly brought him to book &mdash;to say that he had heard some whispers, and because they were whispers against the Guards it would have to be true, that there was speculation in regard to the Secret Service Fund.  That is absolutely untrue.  He went further and said that my Department had brought charges.  That is absolutely untrue.  The Deputy does not give the source of his information, but I think we can fairly gather what persons the Deputy associates with, persons who invent lies of this nature.</P>

      <P>The Deputy went on to talk about the number of Guards at the present time compared with the number of R.I.C. in 1914.  The Deputy said something about the Guards not being able to read documents and about taking them away because they could not read them.  The Deputy may be able to read, but I am afraid from what the Deputy has shown us here that he is wanting himself both in reading and arithmetic.  Let us take his arithmetic.  He arrives at figures and he comes at them obviously by first taking the number of R.I.C. that were in the 26 Counties in 1914 and subtracting from those figures the number of police now in the Six Counties and says that the result is the number of Guards we should have here.  The real figures are, leaving out the metropolitan area, and taking the rest of the 26 Counties, that in 1914 there were 7,859 R.I.C. men there.  If you take the number of Guards at present in these counties, you will discover that the figure is something like 5,600, or something like 2,200 less than there were in the 26 Counties, leaving out the Dublin Metropolitan Division, in the days of the R.I.C.  So much about the Deputy's arithmetic.  The Deputy talked about transport, and he said that there was no reduction in locomotion expenses this year from last year.  In fact, he gave me the credit of saying that it was increased when I had said that it was <Col N="489" /> decreased.  Yet, if the Deputy looked at the Estimate he would see that there was a decrease of £1,000 under that heading.  He has very large notions indeed if he says that £36,500 and £37,500 are identical figures.</P>

      <P>On a point of information, I was looking at the figure for allowances to officers and inspectors for the use of their own motor-cars. That is the particular item I had in mind.</P>

      <P>I do not know what the Deputy had in mind.  I can only judge the Deputy's mind by the Deputy's spoken words.  Deputy Anthony spoke about the unhygienic conditions of certain barracks.  I must admit that even now, although a great deal has been done to improve the conditions under which the Guards live, there are to this day certain barracks which are not really fit to be inhabited by Guards.  We are doing what we can to bring the barrack accommodation up to the standard at which it should be.  Deputy Anthony also spoke about a superintendent being sacrificed over an affair in Waterford. I cannot agree with the Deputy that there was anybody sacrificed there.  There were dispensed with an inspector, a very excellent officer, a man with a very good record, and some other men who unfortunately overstepped the bounds on one occasion, and the Guards lost very excellent men.  As I have stated here before, it was found by a jury that these men, though they had been excellent men up to that, had on this occasion used third degree methods, and third degree methods are entirely against what the Guards are instructed to use.  Strong measures had to be taken against these men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Anthony said he was in agreement with Deputy Little about foreign clothing.  There is no foreign clothing supplied to the Gárda, and bicycles are not supplied to the Gárda either.  The Gárda are allowed a certain cycling allowance, out of which they purchase their own bicycles, and they are perfectly free to purchase whatever bicycles they like.  I may inform Deputy Little that <Col N="490" /> I do not know that bicycles are manufactured here&mdash;they are only assembled.  But assuming that they are manufactured, I think that is a matter that can be left entirely to the Gárda.  They want no circular from my Department or from any other Department telling them to be good Irishmen. The Gárda are good Irishmen. They are infinitely better Irishmen than Deputy Little, who prates about his patriotism but whose patriotism consists in seeing where he expects he can get Party advantage.  He would sell this country one hundred times over for Party advantage.  It is not for the Fianna Fáil Deputies to endeavour to tell the Gárda Síochána what it is to be Irish.</P>
    <P>Deputy George Wolfe talked about telephones.  We are endeavouring to have telephones in every Gárda station in the Free State in which the cost would not be prohibitive, and we are getting them installed as quickly as we can.  I cannot just now inform the Deputy of the stations in which there are not telephones, such as Clane and Kill, but we are getting telephones fixed up in as many stations as we possibly can.  Deputy Wolfe has also talked about the Vagrancy Acts.  This is the first complaint that has been made as regards not enforcing the Vagrancy Acts to the full.  A great many of the abuses to which the Deputy refers are, I am sure, existing, but, I think, tinkers, in my county at any rate, are fewer than they used to be.  Perhaps they migrate to richer spots, but if they are breaking the law we will, of course, see that the law is properly observed by them just as by anybody else.  Putting their horses into people's fields at night and stealing people's hay are matters which the Gárda will endeavour to check.  In that respect, possibly, the real remedy lies in a man's own hands.  A man must, to a large extent, protect his own property.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made by Deputy Hogan that the Gárda do not do their duty well in the matter of traffic and that they have no regard for pedestrians. That may be a matter on which opinions will differ.  I do not myself agree with Deputy Hogan that <Col N="491" /> pedestrians are not regarded at all.  I know what happens here and elsewhere where the traffic is held up in certain directions.  The traffic is held up and the pedestrian passes over while it is being held up.  Then the traffic is held up in another direction and the pedestrian crosses over.  The whole traffic is held up for appreciable periods.  I certainly do not see any necessity at <Col N="492" /> the ordinary street crossing for aged people or anybody else to hurry across. They seem to be able to cross without any scurrying and without any danger. There is complete control of traffic in every instance where it is required.  I venture to think that street control of traffic is very well attended to.  We have practically no accidents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal difference in this Vote as compared with last year is in the increased amount required in connection with some of the public health services. These differences are principally:&mdash;Medical treatment of school children, £7,300; Gaeltacht school meals, £6,352; treatment of tuberculosis, £17,500; grants in connection with minor drainage schemes, £8,000. In addition there is a new heading included for the purpose of providing Irish-speaking nursing probationers in general nursing and midwifery.  The total of the increase comes to about £40,000.  The net increase in the Estimate is about £32,700.  The reorganisation of the public health services is proceeding satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>County medical officers of health have been appointed in 17 out of the 27 counties, and in Dublin County an appointment is at present under consideration by the local authorities.  I should like this progress to be greater, but I want to be fully satisfied in urging the completion of the scheme that there is a sufficient number of suitable applicants coming forward possessing the requisite high, technical and administrative ability for the organisation of health measures.  In the counties in which county medical officers of health are functioning the measures which have been taken are already gaining momentum, and there has been an immediate and gratifying appreciation of the functions and work of the county medical officers of health which is a testimony alike to the capacity of the men appointed to fill the positions and to the desire of the local authorities to see defects in our public health system remedied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While on this subject, I may refer to the first Public Health Conference held by the Department last year. Practically every public health authority in the country sent delegates, and the gathering that assembled in the Mansion House was fully representative of both medical and administrative experience.  The interest which the conference aroused and the practical nature of the discussions were most gratifying, and there can be no doubt that assemblies of this kind serve a most useful purpose in promoting an understanding of public health matters, <Col N="495" /> not only amongst those engaged in public health administration, but amongst the population generally.  I had intended to deal with housing and child welfare in June, but I have not yet abandoned the idea of dealing with the subjects this year.  County institutions continued to be improved and rendered more efficient for the treatment of all classes of disease.  Capital expenditure up to £60,000 was incurred for the purpose during the year.  On the provision of water supplies and sewerage schemes there was an expenditure of £180,000 of which approximately one-half was in rural centres.</P>
    <P>It is satisfactory to be able to record a further decline in the incidence of infectious diseases.  The number of deaths in 1929 resulting from scarlatina was the lowest since 1918, being 62 as compared with 79 in 1928 and an aver-of 85 for the ten years covering the periods from 1919 to 1928 inclusive.  Enteric fever or typhoid, has fallen in recent years, and the number of deaths registered in 1929 is the lowest on record, being 88 as compared with 94 in the preceding year, and 124, the average annual number for the decennial period 1919&mdash;1928.  The prevalence of enteric fever in an area is to a certain extent an indication of a backward state of sanitary administration in the district, whether in regard to the provision of an adequate pure water supply, the lack of an efficient sewerage system or the general want of cleanliness.  As our public health services progress local authorities will come to recognise in time that expenditure on the establishment of an efficient sanitation is real economy, and is amply repaid by the decreased outlay in controlling outbreaks of typhoid fever, not to speak of the saving effected in human life and suffering.</P>
    <P>We have, however, to record an increased number of deaths from diphtheria. In 1929 the number was 79 more than in the preceding years.  From a scrutiny of notifications received from counties, in 1930 the disease was more prevalent in the Counties of Tipperary, S.R.; Cork, Galway and Limerick, Louth and Wexford.  The immunisation campaigns to which I referred last year have been carried out in <Col N="496" /> Cork, Louth, Galway and Wexford. Striking results have already been obtained in reducing the mortality from the disease in the northern area of County Louth, where 1,500 children under six years of age were inoculated with toxin-anti-toxin during the Autumn of 1928 and 1929.  The number of persons affected with diphtheria in that area fell from 84 in 1928 to 37 in 1929, and to 10 in 1930.  It is hoped that equally favourable results will ensue from the other areas where immunisation is being carried out.</P>
    <P>The mortality amongst infants for the year 1929 is somewhat higher than for the previous year, being 70 per 1,000 births as compared with 68 for 1928.  Additional deaths in 1929 were chiefly due to pneumonia and bronchopneumonia as a result of influenza in epidemic form, and both urban and rural areas were equally affected.  The death rate compared favourably with that in neighbouring countries, England and Wales showing 74 per 1,000 births; Scotland 87 and Northern Ireland 86.  Statistics for 1930 which are to hand but are not yet checked in the Registrar-General's Office show that the mortality for 1930 has gone back and is even lower than the mortality amongst infants for 1928.</P>
    <P>Maternity and Child Welfare schemes are being operated by 84 voluntary associations and 23 local authorities.  The activity carried on by the nursing associations is the provision of a health visitor who is fully trained in medical and surgical nursing.</P>
    <P>The provision of medical treatment for school children is developing satisfactorily. The service has greatly impressed the public mind, and is attaining rapid popularity wherever it has been initiated.  Schemes have now become well established in Cork and Dublin County Boroughs, Clonmel Borough, and in the Counties of Cork, Kildare, Louth and Offaly, and are in process of development in Limerick and Waterford County Boroughs and in the Counties of Carlow, Cavan, Monaghan, Roscommon, Westmeath, Wicklow and Wexford Counties.</P>
    <P>The examination of the most recent figures in respect of school medical inspection in the two county boroughs <Col N="497" /> and four counties in which the service is well established, shows that in the course of a year's work 47,795 school children were examined.  Of these 22,562 were found suffering from dental defects, 9,260 from enlarged tonsils and adenoids and 6,956 from eye trouble.  The records of the cases treated are not yet complete, but the percentage is likely to be satisfactory. For one county the returns for last year show that the percentage of cases notified to parents of the poorer classes that underwent treatment was:</P>

    <P>Improvement in the numbers treated will follow rapidly as parents observe the good results in cases where steps are taken to have defects remedied.</P>
    <P>The school medical officers gladly acknowledge the whole-hearted cooperation and support which they receive from school managers and teachers.  The sanitary conditions in a number of schools have called for attention and improvements have been effected in many instances.  Managers have shown themselves anxious to fall in with the views of the school medical officers for the purpose of securing better hygienic conditions in the schools.  It is often possible, on skilled advice, to provide, at a moderate expenditure, far more satisfactory lighting and ventilation, and to arrange for more suitable sanitary accommodation in connection with the school premises.</P>
    <P>During the past financial year school meals schemes were established in Cootehill and Fermoy Urban Districts and Waterford County Borough, whilst 7 more urban district councils have provided in their estimates for 1931/32 for the cost of bringing schemes into operation.</P>
    <P>The population of the county boroughs and of the urban districts in which school meals schemes are now in operation, or are to function in the forthcoming financial year, represents over 81 per cent. of the total urban population of the country.  In Dublin County Borough, where meals are supplied, a daily average of 6,931 children <Col N="498" /> received meals during the year ending 31st March, 1930, at a total cost of £11,603.  The total number of schools participating in the year ending 31st March, 1930, in all the urban areas where schemes were in force was 163, as against 146 in the previous year, while the average daily number of children receiving meals was 16,828, as compared with 16,366 in the previous year.</P>
    <P>The Education (Provision of Meals) (Amendment) Act, 1930, which became law on the 23rd December, 1930, enables the Commissioners of a town to be a local authority for the purpose of providing school meals.  The authorities concerned were duly notified of the provisions of the Act on 13th January last, and the establishment of schemes suggested in districts where needed.</P>
    <P>The Town Commissioners for Ballyshannon, Edenderry and Mullingar have already taken the necessary steps for bringing school meals schemes into operation.</P>
    <P>As regards school meals for children attending National Schools, in the Gaeltacht schemes have been inaugurated by the boards of health.  The total number of schools dealt with under the Gaeltacht School Meals Act was 329, and the number of children, 18,420. In Cork in five out of eight schools in the area a scheme has been introduced; in Galway 99 schools are being dealt with and 56 in Kerry.  The adoption of arrangements under the Act in the case of Donegal and Mayo is deferred until the present financial year.</P>
    <P>Approved schemes for the welfare of the blind are now in operation in all counties and county boroughs, except Cork and Mayo Counties and Limerick County Borough.  Steps are, however, being taken to bring the standard scheme prepared by this Department into operation in Mayo County in the coming year.  In Galway County, where a partial scheme has been in operation, the standard scheme will be brought into force in the coming year.  The adoption of schemes in Cork County and Limerick County Borough is at present under consideration.</P>
    <P>In the areas in which approved schemes were in operation during the <Col N="499" /> year ending 31st March, 1930, blind persons to the number of 1,100 were afforded assistance in their own homes, whilst 212 were maintained in the approved institutions for the blind.  The total number of blind registered under the schemes of the local authorities was 1,358 in that year.</P>
    <P>Deputies will observe that there is a large increase in the provision made under the head of tuberculosis as compared with previous years.  Tuberculosis schemes are now in force in every county and county borough, with the exception of County Longford. In several of the counties the schemes have been largely developed by providing for the treatment of persons in local sanatoria.  Moderately advanced and advanced cases of the disease constitute a large majority of cases coming under the notice of tuberculosis officers.  Most of these cases suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis are definitely infective, and if their home conditions do not permit of satisfactory isolation, or if suitable precautions are not observed, their presence in the same is a constant menace to the health of other members of the household, and especially of children. Hence the necessity for facilities for the segregation and treatment of such cases in institutions.  It has been ascertained by experience that patients of this class will not readily undertake the long journey to a centralised institution situated far from their homes, or that if they do they will leave the institution after a comparatively short stay.  On the other hand, they will avail of a sanatorium within convenient reach of their friends.</P>
    <P>During the last 18 months local institutions have been opened or enlarged at Grianán an Chláir, Ennis; St. Brigid's Sanatorium, Portlaoighise; St. Teresa's Sanatorium, Ballinrobe; St. Patrick's Sanatorium, Collooney; Grianán Charmáin, Enniscorthy; Crooksling Sanatorium, Brittas; Woodlands Sanatorium, Galway; Glenties District Hospital, Carndonagh District Hospital, Donegal District Hospital. Local sanatoria or tuberculosis hospitals are now available for the residents of 15 counties and two county boroughs.  In Kerry, Kildare and <Col N="500" /> Meath it is anticipated that similar institutions will be in operation during the forthcoming financial year.  In addition, in several other areas active steps are being taken with a view to securing premises suitable for conversion into sanatoria.  Notwithstanding the extension of facilities for the local treatment of tuberculosis patients there has been no appreciable decrease in admissions to Peamount and Newcastle Sanatoria.  The number of cases dealt with under approved tuberculosis schemes has increased from 15,719 in 1928 to 18,217 in 1930, an increase of nearly 16 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is gratifying to record that the downward trend of mortality from tuberculosis previously observed has continued at an increasing rate during the year 1929, as evidenced by the returns supplied by the Registrar-General. These disclose that the mortality from all forms of the disease in that year represented the lowest rate yet registered in this country, 1.32 per 1,000 of the population.  The actual number of deaths from the disease was 172 less than the previous year.  The improvement is altogether accounted for by the reduction in the incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis, which was responsible for 190 deaths less than in 1928.  The decrease in mortality was confined entirely to rural areas, where a reduction of 215 deaths took place, whereas in urban areas there was an increase of 43.</P>

      <P>The Deputy wants to know the number of labourers' cottages that have been erected.  At another point in the discussion I will get that for the Deputy.</P>
      <P>This brings the total number of houses in respect of which allocations have been made under the Acts from 1924 to 1930: to local authorities, 6,450; private persons, 14,652; public utility societies, 1,334; total, 22,436.  Of this total the following are completed: local authorities, 4,780; private persons and public utility societies, 13,124; total, 17,904.  These figures do not include 2,100 houses dealt with by the local authorities under the million scheme.  The total amount of money involved in connection with these allocations is: grants provided by the State, £1,515,925; grants given by fourteen local authorities, £1,040,586, and assistance given by local authorities in carrying out or developing houses built by private persons, £9,609. In addition, local bodies have loaned amounts to the extent of £161,726. Allocations have been made to local authorities in the years ending March, 1929; March, 1930, and March, 1931. In the year ending March, 1929, Dublin received £500; the country outside Dublin, £558; for the year ending March, 1930: Dublin, £434, and the country outside of Dublin, £355; and for the year ending March, 1931: Dublin, £720, and the country outside of Dublin, £1,105.  The increase from the year 1929, in which outside of Dublin 558 houses were arranged for by local authorities, was £1,105 in the year ending March, 1931.  That arises from the fact that better loan facilities have been made available by applying the Local Loans Fund to urban authorities building houses.  Private persons and public utility societies in the year 1930-31 received allocations for 1,744 houses, bringing the total number of houses arranged for private individuals and public utility societies up to 1,162 houses in rural areas.</P>

    <P>For the county boroughs the figure is 415 houses in the year ended March, 1931, bringing the total to date to 2,486.  In urban areas the figure is 412 houses, bringing the total to date to 2,103, and in towns with Town Commissioners 39 houses, bringing the <Col N="502" /> total to date to 235 in respect of these towns.  Therefore, there were 2,610 houses in respect of which allocations have been made during the year to private persons and public utility societies, bringing the total for these classes to 15,986.</P>

      <P>From the passing of the Housing Act, 1924, down. Attention was drawn last year to the fact that in certain counties the acceptance of these facilities for building houses was taken considerable advantage of, as compared with others.  During the year allocations were made in Mayo in respect of 136 houses, bringing the total to date to 1,508.  Cork, 251; total to date, 1,452; Dublin, 308; total to date, 1,113.  Galway, 77; total to date, 932.  Kerry, 90; total to date, 824.  Limerick, 201; total to date, 795. Donegal, 55; total to date, 608.  These figures are to be compared with Carlow where the allocations made were in respect of five houses this year, bringing the total to 12.  Offaly, 10; total, 55.  Kildare, 44; total, 75.  Waterford, 6; total, 79.</P>
      <P>It is gratifying to see that in those areas in which the census of 1926 shows that overcrowding is greatest, if we take two persons to a room as an index of overcrowding&mdash;Mayo, Donegal, Kerry and Galway would appear to be the most overcrowded areas&mdash;that in those areas the greatest activity under these Acts has been noticed, in the rural areas at any rate.  There has been a falling off in the figures for the current year.  Although it is not very marked, it is due, no doubt, to the fact that the greater facilities provided under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Act are being availed of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No fall in the cost of building can be recorded during the year.  That has a bearing on our outlook towards the housing policy.  Statutory authority does not exist since the 1st April for the making of allocations to private persons or public utility societies for the building of houses.  A rather limited number of applications has been received since 1st April.  As regards the Government's policy of assistance to private persons building <Col N="503" /> houses as from 1st April, we hope to announce that at an early date.</P>
    <P>With regard to roads, I am glad to be able to repeat what I said on former occasions when introducing the Estimate of my Department, that the relations between the Department and the road authorities have been satisfactory. Both on the organisation side and on the actual carrying out of schemes and general maintenance there has been a strong measure of co-operation.  As in previous years we invited the county councils to come to early decisions on the question of the sums which they were allowing for the upkeep of roads in the ensuing financial year, and I am glad to say that the progress in this matter has been much greater than heretofore, so much so that we were able to take steps, as far back as December last, for the allocation of the grant for improvement during the current year. A year ago the improvement grants could not be notified until the month of March and, in some cases, April. This year many of the improvement grants were notified in January and the bulk of them early in February. The county councils, by reason of their greater expedition on this occasion, found themselves in the satisfactory position of being able to make arrangements in ample time, and were able during the finest portion of the year to carry out improvement works.</P>
    <P>Last year I said we were allocating £700,000 by way of grants for the upkeep and improvement of roads.  The sum actually allocated reached £724,162, of which £334,898 was assigned towards upkeep and £389,264 was available for improvement.  For the coming financial year we are allocating the sum of £900,000, of which about £350,000 will go towards the maintenance of main roads and £550,000 for works of improvement. The sum originally allocated towards the upkeep of main roads, when this type of grant was first made (in 1927/28), amounted to little more than £200,000, so that under this head the sum set aside has increased in four years by 75 per cent.  The type of maintenance now carried out on the <Col N="504" /> main roads is much superior to that which was in vogue in 1927/28 and greater value is being obtained from the increased grant.</P>
    <P>Last year it will be remembered that special attention was drawn to the desirability of co-ordinating the engineering services in the counties and getting rid, as far as possible, of the duplication which existed by having two sets of engineers employed by the board of health and county council. The principal object, however, which was sought was to place the engineering work of both bodies under the county surveyor.  There has been some satisfactory progress along these lines since, and wherever we have been able to arrange it the arrangement has been appreciated by the local authorities and by the urban district councils in those cases where they make use of the services of the county surveyor as their borough surveyor.  According as circumstances permit they make the necessary changes.</P>
    <P>The estimates of county councils for the year 1931-32 in respect of repair of roads amount to: Gross amount, £1,471,785; grant, £342,221; net amount falling on the rates, £1,129,564. The corresponding gross total for 1930/31 was £1,450,746, showing an increase in the coming year's figure in the gross total of about £21,000.  The returns of expenditure for 1930-31 are not, of course, yet available, but the figures for 1929-30 corresponding to the above, are as follows: Gross amount, £1,433,654; grant, £312,582; net amount falling on rates, £1,121,072.  It will be noted that the net increase over 1913-14 falling on the rates for 1931-32 will be about 81.5 per cent., taking no account of the Agricultural Grant.  The corresponding percentage a year ago was 79.3.  The sum passed by the county councils for 1931-32, as between the main and county roads, is apportioned by them as follows:&mdash; Main roads, £855,546; county roads, £616,239.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The collection of rates by county councils has not been quite as satisfactory as in the previous years.</P>
      <P>Although the total percentage collected remains practically unchanged, being 85.5 of the total warrants for the past year as compared with 86.4 for the previous year, the position in some counties was allowed to fall back.  The amount of the warrants collected shows a decrease of 15 per cent. in Offaly, 10 per cent. in Louth, 6 per cent. in Laoighis, 5 per cent. in Wicklow, and 5 per cent. in Dublin.  In the counties of Tipperary and Mayo the collections were closed at the 31st March, and in five other counties&mdash;Cavan, Leitrim, Mayo, Meath, and Waterford&mdash;the amounts outstanding were less than three per cent. of the warrants.  The improvement was most noticeable in the counties of Leitrim, Mayo, Waterford, Westmeath and Kildare.  In fact, the position brought about in Leitrim shows what can be done when a council deliberately makes up its mind that the rates which it strikes must be collected.</P>
      <P>At the 31st March temporary accommodation from treasurers was required only in six counties.  The total amount of the overdrafts was £116,560, as compared with £137,000 at March, 1930. Deputies will understand that for a number of years there were large arrears of audits.  The number of accounts remaining unaudited and in arrear on 25th April, 1931, was 428, as compared with 656 in April, 1929, and 1,900 in 1923.  The showing of these 428 accounts as in arrear does not mean that the audits have not yet taken place, but merely that we have not yet received the reports.  In some of the cases of long-standing arrears the audits have been practically completed, but the reports are held up pending clearance of queries.  A very considerable effort has been made to bring up the arrears in the matter of audits, and very considerable progress has been made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. T. Murphy Mr. T. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo; The amendment has been <Col N="506" /> set down because we are of opinion that the whole policy of the Department is out of touch with the needs of the people and with popular opinion.  In dealing with this Estimate on previous years it was stated that in the Department of Local Government, more than in any other Department of the State, broad and generous administration was necessary. It is not necessary to repeat that, beyond pointing out that Local Government administration and the policy of the Department enter more largely into the lives of the people, and particularly of the poor, than any other Department.  In considering that we have to think only of the very large number of people affected by the administration of the Old Age Pensions Act, in so far as the Department of Local Government is concerned in it, the administration of child welfare schemes, care of the blind, the services designated, for want of a better name at the moment, as home assistance, as well as the control of poor law hospitals.  There can be no doubt that, to the bulk of the people, who are not in a very good position to press their cases, the administration and the general policy of the Local Government Department must be a very important factor.  I regret that I can see very little evidence from what the Minister has outlined, that he has any real conception of the kind of policy that is necessary with regard to a Department of the kind.  If we examine the position we can see evidence of an entirely opposite policy, and where that entirely opposite policy is not apparent, there is very little evidence of any policy at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In supporting a charge of that kind one immediately thinks of the relations existing between the Minister and the local authorities.  One can see all over the country a very definite clash between the views of the Minister and the views of the people, as expressed through the local authorities. We have had during the past year a very rapid rate of suppression of local authorities and generally it is apparent that there is not much understanding between the central <Col N="507" /> Department and the local bodies.  I do not want to make the claim that the local bodies are all that they should be, in all parts of the country, and I am not making the claim that there is not just and ample cause for dealing drastically with local authorities on certain occasions.  But the policy of the Minister, it seems to me, goes far beyond that.  I do not think I would be unfair to him if I claimed that he very barely disguises the fact that he has very little use for local authorities at all.  The process of abolishing local authorities goes on steadily.  One begins to see that the whole system of local government, and what was achieved when that system was obtained for this country, is being steadily undermined, and that the Minister contemplates the end of local government, as far as local authorities are concerned.  I do not know if I am in order in referring to evidence of that kind which was provided by recent legislation enacted by this House.  If I am in order, I would refer, as evidence in support of my case, to the principle embodied in the Greater Dublin Act at the suggestion and instigation of the Minister.  That is the principle of entirely over-riding the popular franchise as exercised by the people and conferring privileges on certain companies in Dublin, enabling them to register votes in bulk, and to secure a permanent corner in the local authority in the city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Even recently the Minister has adopted what seems to me, without being too closely connected with the city, from reading the discussions following the conferences that took place, a very peculiar attitude in regard to the mistake made by his representatives when they were in charge of Grangegorman Mental Hospital. The Commissioners who were <Col N="508" /> in charge of that institution made certain reductions in the salaries of certain members of the staff and it was held afterwards in the High Courts that the reductions were entirely unjustifiable, the decision of the Commissioners being reversed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The reductions were made in any case.  That is not the argument I am relying on, but that the policy of the Minister, as a result of the decisions of the courts, was that he was anxious to upset the decision, and that the Minister was a party to an attempt made to prevent a local authority from giving effect to a decision of the court as a result of the appeal of certain officials.  I consider that that was an entirely unjustifiable attitude on the part of the Minister and bears out that the Minister is very keen on having his own way in regard to matters of policy and has very little regard for the opinion of local representatives and other opinion in matters of this kind.  There was less reason for that in this case, because the matter was the subject of a judicial decision, and I consider that the Minister's attitude was a very extraordinary one indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to refer to the operation of the Local Appointments Act and the attitude of the Minister to a certain provision in it.  I considered that one <Col N="509" /> of the most useful provisions of the Act, with a view to getting popular opinion in favour of the principle of the Act&mdash;which is a very good one, and one of which I approve, and which, in my opinion, will justify itself right through&mdash;was that enabling local authorities to promote suitable officials in their service to higher positions when vacancies arose.  The Minister on more than one occasion, and I think he is pretty consistent in that attitude, has overridden the demands of local authorities that they should be allowed to promote certain officials in their service to higher positions.  That has arisen in the case of dispensary doctors. It has arisen in one case which I discussed with the Minister in the House before and in numerous other instances where the question arose of promoting an official of one kind or another.  I think the policy of the Minister has been not alone to discourage it, but definitely to exercise his power as Minister when a proposal is made.</P>
    <P>If the Minister deals with this matter in replying, I anticipate that he will refer to a report of a Committee of this House which investigated the working of the Act some time ago.  I think some recommendation which would not encourage promotion of this kind was made by that Committee.  I happened to be a member of that Committee, but I did not attend many meetings, because very early during the course of the deliberations of the Committee I came to the conclusion that the Committee had very little power indeed, and its recommendations, if any, would be of a very minor character, and would not effect any useful purpose.  So that the Committee had very little opportunity of satisfying, say, suspicious people that the operations of the Act were perfectly watertight.  I am satisfied of that myself, but there are many people who are not as well able to judge in a matter of that kind as those of us who are in closer touch with administration here, and it would be well that they should be satisfied on that point.  The point I intended to make was that the Minister's attitude in that matter was entirely unfair, and that he ought to be the first to recognise the fact that <Col N="510" /> where there are men in the service of local authorities for some considerable time, with ample experience of local government administration, with good records, and with an opportunity of doing good work by reason of the fact that they may look forward to promotion of some kind or another in a reasonable time, the Minister is not assisting local government in the country, or even assisting economy of any kind, by refusing to endorse the demand of local authorities, where that demand takes the form of applying for permission to promote certain officials in their service.</P>
    <P>I now come to another phase of the administration of the Local Government Department as it relates to Deputies.  I repeat the protest I made on another occasion here against the exclusion of Deputies from the portion of the Local Government Department that deals with old age pensions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to another change made by the Department in regard to the administration of the Old Age Pension Acts.  Up to some time ago decisions of the Local Government Department on appeal cases were communicated to Deputies immediately the decisions had been reached.  I have noticed for some weeks past, perhaps more than some weeks, that such decisions are delayed very much longer.  I have had cases within the last three or four weeks where, instead of a communication dealing with a particular case, a tabulated statement, something like the cost of living index, was sent out a month or six weeks after the case was decided and a certain number of cases entered on this particular form.  I do not want to complain about the particular form in which the decisions of the Department dealing with matters of this kind are communicated to Deputies, but I feel that it is another symptom of the policy of the Minister, that he is all the time inclined to favour the registration of automatic decisions and to have them communicated in a very bald official fashion.  I regret very much that I am precluded from referring to the whole matter in the way I should like to by this Standing Order.  I feel that the Minister is anxious to discourage Deputies from taking the active interest that they ought to take in matters of that kind. Although one dislikes saying it, one is inevitably forced to the conclusion that the Minister is partial to the policy of leaving old age pension claimants to their fate, or perhaps I should say, to the pensions officers, who very often deal with them in a way that they ought not to be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said in opening the case for the amendment that it seems to be the policy of the Minister steadily to undermine, and finally abolish, local government <Col N="512" /> altogether, as we have known it for a number of years, in the country. If the forecasts that one hears at the moment as indicating radical changes in local government in the country mean anything, it appears that we are rapidly approaching the time when local government is definitely doomed. I do not think the Minister is altogether responsible for the initiation of that policy, because, to some extent, the policy I have referred to was in operation and favoured in a certain direction, at any rate, before the Minister came to occupy his present office. We had an experiment made in the local government of the country as far back as eight or nine years ago.  A beginning was made with the poor law system, which was remodelled, and we got a brand new system of poor law administration in the country which we were told was to do much for us.  The ugly term &ldquo;outdoor relief&rdquo; was abolished, and &ldquo;home assistance&rdquo; and &ldquo;home help&rdquo; substituted for it. The whole scheme of amalgamation led to very many hardships.  I know from my own knowledge, in my own county, it was felt very keenly, and in many instances proved disastrous. I know of only one phase of that change where the policy of the Department was justified.  I want to be fair to the Minister, and I acknowledge the fact that, in regard to the county hospitals and district hospitals, the policy of the Department was justified. I have little to congratulate the Minister upon, and I do congratulate him on the fact that the stigma of the workhouse hospital has been removed and a much better type of hospital and a much better system in that respect has obtained all over the country since.  But side by side with the position of the district and county hospitals one has the position in the county homes.  I referred to that matter before, and I want to refer to it again.</P>
    <P>The position of many of the county homes at the moment is absolutely deplorable, and the Minister knows it. There are buildings where no convenience of any kind is provided for the poor, who are absolutely in the position of being herded in a very bad, <Col N="513" /> and uncared-for fashion so far as the building and its surroundings are concerned. I do not say that the people charged with the responsibility for the poor in such institutions are not doing their best, but I say that the facilities provided for them to do their duty there are very inadequate indeed.  In certain parts of the country an experiment has been made to change the system obtaining in the county homes at the present time, and to take the poor people out of the horrible surroundings&mdash;for &ldquo;horrible&rdquo; is not too strong a word&mdash;in which they exist at the moment.  I am glad that the Minister has sanctioned and encouraged that policy.  Until much more is done in that direction the policy of the Minister will be lagging far behind what ought to be done.</P>
    <P>I feel that some very radical change is necessary, in regard to the whole service known as home assistance.  I am not in a position to say how that change should be brought about, but the whole thing demands revision, and immediate revision.  Speaking of that matter, one is shocked to find that at the moment in this country 84,000 persons are in receipt of home assistance, as indicated in a reply of the Minister to-day, at a cost of something like over half a million pounds.  The Minister ought to consider this whole question immediately, and how that system could be properly and humanely worked, and how the poor could be protected.  I say with regret, that very often the local authority has no conception of what the average family needs.  I know cases where, after considerable difficulty, a family of three or four persons would be very lucky if they got seven or eight shillings a week as home assistance.  There is no consistency about the matter, and&mdash; while what I am saying is not an argument for local authorities, but rather a condemnation&mdash;I am quite frank in saying that I believe the whole service is in a very unsatisfactory condition, and that the Minister ought to devise some method of making certain that whatever benefit a service of that kind confers upon the poor ought to reach them directly, and ought to be free from many of the abuses that <Col N="514" /> surround it at the moment.</P>
    <P>One has not to look far to find how difficult it is to establish a case of abuse in regard to the payment and distribution of home assistance, but clearly there is an opportunity for the Minister to carry out investigation in regard to this matter that would prevent certain parties who control local authorities at the moment from taking up the attitude they take up very often in regard to this whole matter.</P>
    <P>One hears the argument that nobody looks for home assistance except people who are too idle to work.  I hope the Minister does not think that of the 84,000 people in receipt of home assistance, a very large percentage in that unfortunate position, and it is an unfortunate position, are people who will not work.  In regard to much the larger number of people who form part of that 84,000, the policy of the Minister ought to have been announced long ago.  I am precluded from referring to that, because it would involve legislation, but the Minister knows what I am referring to, and I think it is a blot on the administration of the Minister that he has not taken his courage in his hands long ago and provided for the large number of people amongst this 84,000 being properly cared for in a humane and just fashion in the country.</P>
    <P>Now, with regard to the question of housing, I do not wish to anticipate what will be said by other Deputies when this particular aspect of local government comes up for review.  But I do complain of the fact that since we discussed this particular matter twelve months ago no provision of any useful kind has been made for the building of houses in the rural areas.  The Minister gave very long and elaborate figures in regard to the total number of houses built, but the Minister must remember that he has definitely failed to carry out the policy which was dropped when the Great War broke out in 1914.  There are no reasonable facilities existing at the moment by which local authorities can proceed even to complete the scheme for the erection of labourers' cottages hung up at the outbreak of the Great War.  The figures I have got would <Col N="515" /> indicate that since the Housing Act of 1924 was passed less than 300 houses were built by boards of public health for rural labourers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not very far wrong.  I shall improve the Minister's figure by saying 400, but I am afraid that 400 is a very small testimony to the policy pursued in his Department.</P>
      <P>I might say that nothing has been done in that direction.  I want the Minister to say, when replying, what he proposes to do in this particular connection and also in regard to the tenants of labourers' cottages who, when such cottages were erected, were unfortunate enough to get only half an acre of ground.  In Cork, particularly in the western portion, we have a large number of tenants who feel that they ought to be put in as good a position as their neighbours who benefited by subsequent schemes which enabled them to get one acre.  Does not the Minister think that the time has come when boards of health ought to be provided with opportunities for putting the tenants of such cottages into the same position as that enjoyed by their neighbours?  In regard to the operations of the Housing Acts since 1924, I feel that very much could have been done and my complaint is that a much bigger policy in regard to rural housing has not been adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the erection of houses in towns by private persons who do not build houses to live in them but to let them, I feel that abuses are steadily creeping in in some of the smaller towns where wages do not amount to a very high figure.  Take, for instance, towns in which a wage of 30/- or 32/- would be an average.  I find that in many of such towns persons who are in the happy position of being able to build houses through grants from the Local Government Department, loans from the local authorities, and substantial concessions in regard to rating relief, are letting these houses and charging rents altogether out of proportion to those for which working-class people in such towns can afford to pay.  I believe that in previous Housing Acts <Col N="516" /> provision was made in regard to the rents to be charged, but the rents mentioned in those Acts would be too high now.</P>
    <P>In the case of houses of the type to which I refer and which were built quickly in certain towns with the assistance of tradesmen whose rate of wage was not excessive, where no great difficulties in regard to building costs entered, where no dangerous trade unions existed to impose their will on reasonable and benevolent contractors, rents have been charged of 7/-, 8/- and 10/- a week, rents which make it impossible for such persons in small towns to get the benefit of the Housing Acts.  The only prospect such a person has is to look forward to someone moving from a house better than the one he occupies.</P>
    <P>In regard to the operations of the local government services dealing with the care of the blind, I complain of the fact that, although the Minister in his opening statement has indicated an improvement in that direction, there is no uniformity in regard to such schemes all over the country. There again, I feel that the Minister ought to make certain that suitable provisions are made for providing uniformity in these schemes.  The Minister seems to hope that one particular county, a county with which I am familiar and which has omitted, I regret to say, to make provision of that kind, is about to do so, but I am afraid that such will not be the case, because I have seen an advance copy of the estimates.  No provision has been made in them in that direction.  In regard to another matter which agitated the minds of Deputies of all parties some time ago, namely, the provision of grants to local authorities for sewerage and waterworks, I desire to call attention to the very unsatisfactory way in which schemes of that kind can be prepared and worked out because of the haste with which they have to be drawn.  Within a few days of the close of the financial year, local authorities in some cases were informed that certain grants were available and that unless portion of the work were carried out within the few remaining days such grants would be <Col N="517" /> allocated to other work.  That is not the kind of policy that will lead to properly thought-out schemes for sewerage and water-works being carried through.  There is very little doubt that the attempts made in certain portions of the country to take advantage of these grants by having particular schemes ready within a particular time meant that very often sufficient thought was not given to working out such schemes, with the result that a certain amount of expenditure was embarked on which might have been incurred with better results if the schemes were properly prepared and thought out.  I suggest to the Minister that the allocation of grants of this kind ought to form a permanent feature of the policy of his Department and that a certain amount ought to be held in reserve for assisting well-defined schemes when presented, and we should not have the scramble which we recently had between various local authorities all over the country to get grants within a few days of the close of the financial year, because such a scramble does not serve the purpose in view and does not assist the policy of the Department which is the central authority in control.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister still hankers after the idea of combining the services of the boards of health and the county councils.  In any inquiries I have made I have not heard of any very satisfactory results attending such combination of services.  I have a distinct recollection of reading about the situation which arose in Kerry as the result of the initiation of such a policy. I think that it was initiated by the Commissioner who was then in charge. He evolved a scheme whereby the road ganger going along the road and noticing a cottage falling into disrepair reported the matter to the deputy-surveyor, who later on in his wisdom might report it to the county surveyor, and after a considerable lapse of time something might be done.  One has only to read the newspapers to see that the result is that in Kerry most of the cottages are in ruins and thousands of pounds of arrears of rent have to be collected by the Commissioner.  I consider that a service <Col N="518" /> of this kind would be disastrous and a big loss to ratepayers.  The occupants of labourers' cottages who have paid their rent punctually are entitled to reasonable attention, attention they cannot get if the county surveyor is the engineer in charge of the affairs of the board of health.  I leave the Minister to consider the position that might arise if such a scheme were put into operation in County Cork. Some time ago a long discussion took place between the Minister's Department and the county council as to whether three surveyors or one were necessary in the county.  The Minister had his way, as usual, in that matter. I leave him to consider the position that would have arisen if Mr. O'Connell, the county surveyor, was responsible for the roads in the county, and for all the cottages from Youghal to Castletownbere.  I think the Minister will find that an arrangement of that kind is not practicable.  If both services are to be performed by the county surveyor and if the services performed by the engineer to the board of health are not to remain separate and distinct, the result will be that the amalgamation will not even be as big a success as some other amalgamations that have already taken place, and we know that very little can be said for them.  It seems unnecessary to elaborate the reasons for this amendment any further.  I think the Minister has much to answer for and has very little to his credit in regard to the administration and the policy of his Department.</P>
    <P>In regard to the county health services, while certain phases of that service are not justifying themselves in the manner that one would hope for, it can be said for the service in other directions that there is an improvement. In regard to the broad principles of policy administered by the Department, one feels that there is a growing attempt to reject the popular view for the view of the central department, and in that connection I might say that I hold the Minister primarily responsible, because in regard to the officials of the Local Government Department I have nothing to say, or no complaints to make.  I have had more dealings <Col N="519" /> with them than a great many Deputies and I have found them always ready to give effect to any reasonable request made to them.  One has to remember that the main factor in the Local Government Department is the policy decided on by the central authority. In my opinion that policy is becoming more unpopular day after day, and in the end will be condemned by the people.  I ask the Minister, when examining the whole administration of his Department, to remember that the beginning and end of the service must be service for the people for the duration of the control by the Minister.  If there is an attempt to override the claims of the people as expressed by their local authority, or if, on the other hand, there is an indication that the view held by the Minister himself must be imposed on local authorities, without even giving an opportunity to the local people to present their case, and that they have to register cut and dried decisions, that policy will fail in the country, and must fail.  It seems to me that no case has been made out for the allocation of the sum asked for in the Vote by the Minister.  In the absence of an indication of a complete change of policy on the part of the Minister I do not think the House ought to give approval to the Vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that Deputy Murphy will be gratified by any announcement to be made by the Minister at the end of the debate, that there will be any comprehensive change in the policy of the Department, because I think it is evident to everyone in the House that the policy of the Department has been for years, and probably will continue to be as long as the present powers remain in control, to have as great contempt as possible for local authorities, and, as Deputy Murphy said, to undermine steadily and finally abolish local authorities. That seems to be the policy and the mentality of those in control of local government for a number of years, certainly since 1924 or thereabouts. That mentality seems to have developed and grown to such an extent that, as Deputy Murphy said, I think it is quite true that people in <Col N="520" /> the country are forced to believe that the Minister's one desire is to abolish local government altogether, and to concentrate all power, authority and administration in the Local Government headquarters in Dublin.  I do not know how many officials of the Department, inspectors or otherwise, are at present employed administering the affairs of local authorities in the country.  There must be a considerable number.  I agree with Deputy Murphy when he says that occasions might arise when local authorities might have to be severely dealt with by the central authority in control of public local administration, but I doubt if any occasion has arisen or will arise that would justify the total abolition of the public authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would imagine that the desire of any authority imbued with democratic ideas, at any rate, would be to try to improve administration by local bodies, and in the case of recalcitrant local bodies, that an effort should be made by judicious pressure to show them the right road and teach them where necessary how public administration should be carried on for the benefit of the people concerned and the ratepayers.  Far from that being the idea prevalent in the Local Government Authority's mind to-day, it would appear that the idea, very definitely evidenced in the last twelve months, is that the people are not to have confidence in and should not be allowed to trust their elected representatives to disburse money raised by rates, with the administration of which they are usually entrusted.  Several cases have arisen during the last twelve months, the cases of Kerry and Galway, notable examples, and the case of Mayo, a particular example.  I think that in the case of Mayo even the Minister's own Department acknowledge that the administration by that county council was as good as it could be.  The Government has a majority of supporters on that county council, and therefore I am sure the Minister would be all the more ready to praise the administration of the county council.  The Chairman of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party&mdash;so somebody told me&mdash;is Chair <Col N="521" /> man of that county council.  Naturally there must have been very efficient administration there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I might say, without going into the matter raised in that motion on the paper, that such is the mentality of the Local Government Department, even in the case of the Mayo County Council, ruled as I say by a majority of supporters of the Minister's own Party, that that body was abolished even though it is admitted that its administration was as good as that of any local authority in the Twenty-Six Counties.  Something of that kind was admitted by those who held the public inquiry, or what served for a public inquiry, before the abolition of the County Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that any improvement in public administration results <Col N="522" /> from administration by officials of the Local Government Department.  I do not believe that that has been demonstrated in one instance, not even in the case of the Dublin Corporation. Nowhere has there been any improvement as a result of the abolition of the local authority.  But even if there had been an improvement I would claim that an assembly of this kind ought not to stand for the abolition of the councils elected by the people to run their local affairs.  If there has been, in any case, maladministration, it should be the duty of those who control local government to demonstrate to the elected representatives in the area, and to point out to the people that there has been maladministration and mismanagement, to encourage the people to take a more lively interest in their local affairs and to induce them to elect people who will improve administration and make matters what they ought to be as far as the public administration of local authorities is concerned.</P>
    <P>We suffer in this country from a want of recognition of civic responsibility. In city, town and rural areas people do not recognise to the full their civic responsibilities.  The numbers who vote at elections in city, town and country demonstrate that to a great extent.  In my humble opinion we should endeavour to educate our people into taking a more lively interest, a more keen and educated interest, in public affairs, and to keep on doing so even though we fail this year or next year.  It should be the duty of the Local Government Department to keep on trying to educate the people into the management of their own affairs where such education is necessary&mdash;and it is necessary in many places.  That, I think, ought be the policy of the Department.  As it is, the policy of the Department seems to be to watch out for any opportunity of rushing into the abolition of local bodies.  It rushes and grabs at any opportunity that may arise and at any excuse, no matter how flimsy, to abolish local authority and to set up in its stead a paid official of the Department to administer local affairs. That is bad economy.  It is worse democracy.  In my opinion it does not <Col N="523" /> make for that good management and that improvement in public spirit and civic education that we should all in this House encourage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy made a very comprehensive survey of the working of the Local Government Department. I do not think that there is any branch of it that he has not dealt with in one way or another.  I have gone to some trouble in making a lot of notes on almost every activity that the Department controls, but as my remarks would be very largely of the same kind as those made by Deputy Murphy, it would probably be only wearying the House.  I do not wish in any way to draw away from the effect of Deputy Murphy's very effective criticism of the administration in general.</P>
    <P>There are a few items, however, to which I would like to refer.  I notice that in sub-heads A, B, C in the Estimates, page 139, dealing with salaries, wages and allowances; travelling expenses of inspectors and salaries of auditors, a decrease is proposed for the coming year.  Last year there was an increase in these items.  The decrease this year is nearly £2,000.  Last year the increase was in or about £1,000.  I am always satisfied to see a decrease, provided it does not mean a decrease in efficiency.  I do not think it is likely to decrease efficiency, because I feel certain that the Department concerned is not under-manned.</P>
    <P>The Minister drew attention to the fact that there was proposed in this year's Estimates a considerable increase in the amounts to be devoted to public health in general.  With the increase set out here I am in hearty agreement.  I think that any increase in the moneys to be expended on public health services should be welcomed by this House.  Several others in this House probably more competent to speak on questions of public health than I am, have said similar things.  We have endeavoured to impress on the House the backwardness of public health services in general in the Twenty-Six Counties area.  That backward state of public health services still exists.  But there has been an improvement in recent <Col N="524" /> years, and I hope the improvement will continue.  It does not always follow when more money is spent that we get more efficient services; but, on the other hand, without spending more money we cannot get better services. I believe that whilst the amounts we are asked to grant here are considerable, we will have to spend considerably increased amounts out of the State Exchequer as well as out of the local rates before anything like adequate public services for the Twenty-Six Counties are provided.</P>
    <P>Public health services here include expenditure on school meals.  That, to my mind, is properly looked upon as a public health service, because many of us know that in many large areas in the country, as well as in the city, many hundreds of children go to school improperly nourished and are therefore liable to take more readily whatever diseases there may be in the neighbourhood than would healthy, well-fed children.  It also has this advantage when school meals are provided, that children are better equipped to benefit by the instruction provided for them.  In case anybody is inclined to criticise the additional expense there is the advantage from the national point of view from this expenditure to be emphasised.</P>
    <P>I notice that there are some slight errors in the figures given in this year's Estimates when they are compared with the figures given in last year's Estimates.  For instance, the figures set out for medical treatment of school children in the 1931-1932 Estimates is £10,200, whereas if we turn to last year's book we find the amount is £11,000.  There is a difference there of £800.  How it arises I do not know. Likewise, under Miscellaneous Grants, in this year's books for grants under the Education (Provision of Meals) Acts, 1914 to 1930, we have £8,285 set down as being the estimate for the year, whereas if we turn to the book for last year the corresponding item shows a figure of £7,600.  Similarly in connection with sub-head P&mdash;Treatment of Venereal Diseases&mdash;there is what appears to me at any rate to be a mistake.  In 1931-1932 the estimate is £7,456, whereas last year the amount estimated was £7,850.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="525" /> These are not very important items, but it is strange that errors of that kind should creep into a book of such importance.  Perhaps the Minister will be able to explain how the differences arise.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy referred to the question of the welfare of the blind, and I gathered from him that he thought there was an improvement to be brought about in the coming year.  So far as the Estimate is concerned there is no increase in the figure provided under that heading.  Whether there will be any increase in the amount to be expended by the local authorities out of their own exchequers I am not aware.  But if that is so, I imagine that we would find the proposed additional expenditure reflected in the figure set out in the Estimates.  If there has been any improvement in that direction I, and I am sure other Deputies in the House, will be glad to hear of it.  We all agree that the blind have not got the consideration they deserve.  In the course of last year there were brought to my notice the cases of blind people who are quite destitute.  Something has been done for these people by the local authorities, but it was nothing like sufficient to meet their requirements.</P>
    <P>No doubt Deputies have got circulars from benevolent organisations interested in the blind in Dublin City, pointing out that these organisations are in a parlous condition financially. They are almost at an end of their resources.  I do not know whether representations have been made to the Ministry for additional consideration for blind people and the charitable organisations interested in them.  I have not heard whether representations have been made to the local authorities.  If there is one section of the community that should have our warmest support, and that should get every consideration from those of us who, in most cases at any rate, are gifted with all our senses, it is the blind.  If the Government can do anything to educate public authorities on their duty to the blind, I think it should be regarded as a service <Col N="526" /> done to the general public.  That is a course which the House should encourage the Government to take.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Public Health Congress held last year, and the Congress he proposes to hold next October.  If anything could be done during the deliberations of that Congress to put forward facts relating to the conditions of the blind, and if suggestions could be offered towards making happier the lot of those unfortunate people, I am sure any effort in that direction would receive the approval of the people as a whole. Something of that sort is due to the blind in our community.</P>
    <P>I am sure everybody who listened to the Minister was pleased to hear of the improvement in mortality statistics with regard to infectious diseases.  I hope that improvement will continue and will be brought gradually, not alone into the position wherein we would favourably compare, say, with neighbouring countries, England and Scotland, which are often quoted here, but into the position that a country that is to the extent of five-sixths a rural area ought to occupy.  Our people, if properly cared for and nourished, are as healthy as any people in Europe that I know and if there is disease, it is largely, as was said already, due to lack of knowledge with regard to public health matters and lack of public health facilities. We ought to be able to raise the standard of public health and we ought to be able to decrease mortality among young and old in this country to such an extent that we would be leaders in public health matters so far as Europe is concerned.  That, of course, means additional cost but in the end it will repay the additional cost.  If we have healthy young people and our mortality, especially amongst infants, is considerably decreased, it will mean a reduction in expenditure in many directions and in the end the local exchequer will be the gainer.</P>
    <P>[<i>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle took the Chair.</i>]</P>
    <P>A new item appears in the Estimates <Col N="527" /> this year with regard to provision for the training of persons from Irish-speaking districts as nurses.  That is a step in the right direction, in my opinion, and the small sum that is set down, while it will not do very much, is a beginning to help a class of the community that have not had great opportunities for improving themselves in the past.  I hope that the amount that is set down here, which will be, I expect, efficiently spent, will be increased, and that the number of nurses, midwives and probationers who will be made available for work in the Gaeltacht areas will be largely increased.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy dealt at considerable length with the question of housing. The Minister gave us plenty of figures, showing what houses had been built and what amount of money had been allocated in urban and rural areas in recent years.  While a considerable amount of money has been allotted in recent years, and while between 15,000 and 20,000 houses, the Minister tells us, have been built, considering the housing conditions in cities, towns and rural areas, I say that what has been done is only, as it were, scratching the surface of the problem in our cities and towns.  These I know better than I know the rural areas.  Speaking for the cities and towns that I have any intimate acquaintance with in the Twenty-Six Counties area, I know that the housing situation in general is a disgrace to us.  The housing situation in Dublin has no equal.  The magnitude of that problem cannot be realised by the Department of Local Government or else they would have taken drastic steps to see that that problem was tackled, as it ought to be tackled, any time within the last nine years. There does not seem to be, on the question of housing, a proper mentality in the Local Government Department, any more than there is on the question of local administration in general.  I know it is not easy to find all the money that is required, and it cannot be found in one year or two years, but, while not wanting to go at great length into this problem we have so often discussed here before, I <Col N="528" /> say until there is a radical change in the mentality in this House, and particularly in the Department of Local Government, on the subject of housing, nothing will be done that is adequate to the situation.  Nothing has been done and nothing will be done so long as the present mentality is continued.</P>
    <P>There are only one or two other items that I desire to refer to.  One of these like most others, has been already referred to by Deputy Murphy.  That is the question of the recent happenings in connection with Grangegorman Mental Hospital.  A recent decision in the High Court has brought about a situation which imposes a cost of £40,000 on the City of Dublin, due to the incompetence of the Minister's Department. It was gross imcompetence &mdash;nothing else could describe what happened&mdash;which brought about the imposition of that huge sum in one year on the Dublin City ratepayers. The Department of Local Government &mdash;not under the present Minister; President Cosgrave, I think, was the person primarily responsible&mdash;abolished the Dublin Corporation, and as a result of that the Joint Committee of the Grangegorman Mental Asylum, so far as its Dublin City representation is concerned, abolished itself.  The members of the Dublin Corporation, having had their authority to sit on subsidiary bodies withdrawn, withdrew from the Grangegorman Mental Hospital Committee, and the Minister appointed three of his officials to act instead of the 28 or 29 members of the Dublin Corporation who sat on that body.  I am not quite sure if that number is accurate.  In or about that number sat there on behalf of the Dublin Corporation, and the Minister's Department was advised by highly paid legal gentlemen that the procedure was legally proper, and the Minister's Department ordered certain reductions in salary, again, I presume, under the authority of his legal advisers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter has already been referred to at considerable length and the Ceann Comhairle did not see fit to rule it out.  At any rate, the matter is probably well known to everybody in this House who takes any interest in public administration, and a more gross piece of mismanagement and a greater display of legal ignorance I have not seen in connection with public affairs than has been demonstrated in this particular case.</P>
      <P>The Minister got advice from his legal advisers and paid dearly for it but, dearly as the Department paid for that ignorant advice that was given to the Minister, the citizens of Dublin paid a thousandfold more dearly for it.  It ought to be a lesson to the Department that the abolition of public authorities, unless they have very efficient legal advisers behind them, is a policy that does not pay.  At least if the Minister has not learned that lesson the citizens of Dublin ought to have learned it because they have been made pay through the nose for it.  If the Department had any sense of decency they would have shouldered the cost that they were responsible for placing on the Dublin ratepayers. They would have admitted their mistake. The Supreme Court showed them that they blundered and told them that they had no right to make the orders that they made, that they were illegal, and, in decency, they ought to have paid not alone the refunds to the officials whose salaries and wages were involved but the heavy legal expenses that the Minister's Department was responsible for.  The cost has to be shouldered by the Dublin ratepayers with the result that there is a considerable increase in the city rates because of the ignorance and stupidity of the Local Government Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say a word in relation to the Dublin Union.  The Union is now administered under the authority of the newly-appointed Committees. Therefore, so far as the present administration is concerned it does not arise here.  What I have to say does not refer to the present administration, except <Col N="530" /> to this extent that it has been demonstrated to those in charge that the Minister's administration with regard to the Dublin Union affairs has not proved a success.  He and his advisers have been shown not to be as wise as they thought they were, and the Board they nominated to administer the affairs of the Union was not a success. It is evident that they are not as omniscient as they thought they were in local government administration.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in connection with the administration of the Dublin Union that I wish to refer to, and that is the exposure by an auditor of the Local Government Department of gross mismanagement while the Union was in charge of the officials appointed under the patronage of the Local Government Department. The auditor's report showed that a very considerable amount of money had gone astray, that contractors were allowed to misbehave, and that officials of the Union under the control of the Commissioners' régime were allowed to misbehave also, at the cost of thousands of pounds of the citizens' money.  If these things happened under any other public authority in Dublin or elsewhere, run by elected representatives, the daily Press, probably at the suggestion of the Department of Local Government, would for days, if not for weeks, have big headings pointing out the iniquities of the administration by publicly-elected representatives.  A body of such officials would not be long in existence.  If the mentality of the Local Government Department, as it has been recently exhibited, is still maintained it would not be long when an order for the abolition of such a body would be issued, but because these things were done under the aegis of Commissioners and because the contractor concerned was one of the pillars of the Cumann na nGaedheal party in Dublin the matter was hushed up and no enquiry is to be held.  The officials are all whitewashed.  The Board that replaced the Commissioners, of course, cannot be held responsible and they will not be abolished for the time being, but it certainly proves that <Col N="531" /> there is not that sense of honest dealing in the Minister or his Department that one would expect when officials and contractors are allowed, as shown by the Local Government Department auditor, to defraud the public and the poor and the Minister does not insist on these people being prosecuted.  If the Minister were acting justly and honestly after the receipt of the reports of his auditors he would have ordered a public investigation on oath and have those responsible officials or contractors or whatever they were, brought before the court to answer for their pilfering and robbery of the public pocket and of the poor of the city of Dublin.  I think that one thing alone shows disgraceful maladministration in the Dublin Union under the aegis of the Minister's own officials and shows them unfit to hold their offices.</P>

      <P>(Clare): One of the functions of the Department of Local Government is to act as arbiters between the Department of Finance and applicants for old age pensions. It has been found necessary both by public representatives in public bodies in the country and by the elected representatives here to make personal representations to the Department of Local Government to help them to arrive at proper decisions in most of those cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, it was understood, was the right of Deputies.  It was not a privilege, it was a right, and it was accorded to Deputies ever since practically the Dáil was established. Anyone who comes in contact with the applicants for old age pensions will realise that these people, in the main, are not capable of putting their case sufficiently well before the pension officers, and that as regards the deciding officers it is really necessary that oral representations should be made to them in order to try and secure for these people what they are entitled to under the provisions of the Old Age Pensions Act.  Yet, we find that there is an alteration in the administration of the Department in that connection, an alteration that was introduced by the present Minister, who has absolutely <Col N="532" /> refused to allow Deputies to approach the deciding officers in these matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, if I cannot get over the Standing Order, then I cannot. At all events, I have made a point of commonsense that I hope will weigh with those responsible for <Col N="533" /> Standing Orders.  I think it is fairly generally accepted that local government is one of the most important services that a Government can administer. It enters more intimately and directly into the lives of the poorer classes of the community than any other Department of the State&mdash; in their sickness and destitution, and whether they are being dealt with in public institutions or in their own homes.  The administration of the Local Government Department, wise or unwise, sympathetic or unsympathetic, affects them to a very great extent. In no phase of its administration is it so necessary that there should be a wise and sympathetic policy as in the matter of housing.  At the present time I cannot find any indication that there is any definite, clear cut and well-defined policy announced, adumbrated or conceived by the Department with reference to the housing problem.  If one were to deduce its policy from its activities, one would conclude that it has little or no policy.</P>
      <P>At the present time it is freely accepted that there are in or about 50,000 houses needed in this State. I am giving the minimum, and I do not think the Minister will question the figures.  As far as I am concerned, I do not propose to assess in terms of human happiness, human unhappiness, human effectiveness, human ineffectiveness, or health, physically or mentally, what the provision of these houses would mean towards the State and humanity.  I do not believe that can be assessed in figures.  In that matter the Ministry is piling up for itself, and the State is piling up for itself, a collection of bad debts, that will ultimately have to be liquidated in some form or other, whether in the matter of hospitals or other public institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The President in a statement in Cork said: &ldquo;We have contributed to the building of more than 17,000 new houses.&rdquo;  The Minister has told us that the figures are about 18,000.  I was <Col N="534" /> anxious that the Minister would analyse these figures and say how many have been built in urban districts, and how many have been built in purely rural districts.  That is to say, how much of the money has been spent where there is a large number of insanitary houses, and how many houses have been built in the rural districts, where there is a certain number of insanitary houses, but where the problem is not so acute as it is in urban and town districts.  I think I may take it that at a very low figure something like 75 per cent. of the houses erected, and of the money expended, has gone to the rural districts, and I think I may say that 50 per cent. of the houses built in the urban districts were not built for the working classes and were not built for people who need houses.  They were built by speculative builders, who sold them to people who, in any circumstances, would have secured proper dwelling houses, or they were let at rents from 10/- to 15/- weekly to people who also, in any circumstances, would be able to get houses or some decent accommodation for that figure.  Therefore we must take it on the Minister's figures, and on the President's figures, that in urban districts little or no impression has been made on the housing problem.  I do not say that much good has not been done in having rural housing attended to and in having a number of houses erected there.  The one thing the Minister's Department did not do was to endeavour to secure that repairs which they could bear were executed to most of these houses, which would certainly do a good deal to improve rural housing.</P>
    <P>I move to report Progress.</P>
    <P>The Dáil went out of Committee.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; the Committee to sit again to-morrow.</P>

    <P>In addition to the written test in Irish, candidates for competitions (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g) above are required to pass an Oral test in Irish, which is of a qualifying nature and to which marks are not assigned.  Candidates for the Junior Administrative Officers' and Assistant Inspector of Taxes' competition, and the Gaeltacht Post Offices Learners' examination are required to undergo a competitive test in Oral Irish.  The marks allotted are included in the aggregate which determines the placings.  An Oral test in Irish has not so far been required in the case of the examination for Typists and Shorthand-Typists. Such a test will, however, be applied in future.</P>
