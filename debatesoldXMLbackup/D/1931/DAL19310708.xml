    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Séamus O Riain Séamus O Riain">
      <NameTxt>Séamus O Riain</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the President whether, in view of the depression in the bacon and grain industries, the Executive Council would refer to the Tariff Commission the question of the advisability of imposing a tariff on (a) imported bacon and pig products; (b) <Col N="1558" /> imported oats and oat products; and (c) imported barley and barley products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="The President The President">
      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to (a) I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a similar question on the subject on 17th ultimo to which I have nothing to add save that I understand that an application to the Tariff Commission by persons engaged in the production of bacon is in contemplation.</P>
      <P>In regard to (b) the Executive Council have already referred to the Tariff Commission the question of the desirability of imposing a customs duty on imported oats.  So far as oat products and imported barley and barley products mentioned at (c) are concerned, it is not the intention of the Executive Council to refer the advisability of imposing a tariff on these to the Tariff Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if it is correct that sponsored programmes have been broadcast from 2RN for which the music was supplied by gramophone records; and whether, in view of the unemployment now prevalent amongst musicians he will consider the advisability of insisting that in all such programmes the musical items should be supplied by native musicians and bands.</P>

      <P>Gramophone records are used occasionally for sponsored programmes and to a limited extent in the ordinary station programmes.  In view of the programme value of gramophone records, it is considered inadvisable to exclude them entirely, but having regard to the desirability of providing employment for artistes, their use is, in fact, being strictly limited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already stated in this House on the 24th of last month the cancellation of these trains was directed for the reason that the declared object of the proposed assembly was a parade of bodies purporting to be of military character not authorised by law, contrary to the Treasonable Offences Act, 1925.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he proposes to introduce proposals for legislation extending the provisions of the Railways (Existing Officers and Servants) Act, 1926, for a further period, with a view to ensuring that railway employees dismissed as a direct result of amalgamation shall receive compensation for disturbance as provided in the Act; whether he was requested by the Railway Trade Unions on 28th April, 1931, and subsequent dates, to receive a deputation for the purpose of discussing the question; whether he declined to receive this deputation; and, if so, for what reason; whether he has been in correspondence with the Great Southern Railways Company on the matter, and has accepted their point of view without hearing a statement on behalf of the employees through the deputation asked for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been asked by the Railway Trade Unions to receive a deputation which would represent that railway employees would be discharged after the 23rd July as a direct result of amalgamation and would not then be entitled to compensation. The Great Southern Railways Company has informed me that there would not be discharges after that date as a direct result of amalgamation. I saw no useful purpose in receiving the deputation to discuss a situation which has not yet arisen.</P>
      <P>If I have reason to believe that discharges do take place without compensation after the 23rd July as a direct result of amalgamation I will introduce retrospective legislation to secure that the employees concerned do not lose their right to compensation. But I, and, I have no doubt, the public, would expect that seven years after amalgamation was effected the responsible parties should have been able to dispose of reorganisation questions without further recourse to the Oireachtas.</P>

In regard to the concluding portion, I have given careful consideration to the proposal, and do not see my way to adopt it, as I am satisfied that on several grounds the scheme is not a practicable one, including the difficulties which would arise in attempting to make it applicable to butter-makers other than creamery suppliers, and the fact that the subsidy would be greatest when least needed, and lowest when most required.  Any funds available for the assistance of the dairying industry could, in my opinion, be utilised to much greater advantage in other ways.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>In page 8 before Section 13 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>13.  The duty imposed by Section 11 of the Finance Act, 1928 (No. 11 of 1928), shall not be charged or levied on any casting, stamping, pressing or forging which has not undergone any process of machining and is not an assembly of motor car component parts (howsoever joined together), and is imported either separately or packed only with other articles which, if imported separately, would be exempted by this section from the said duty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to that, will the Minister for Finance try and make arrangements to have this clause or a corresponding clause introduced on the other side?  In Cork we export castings from this country for motor works and other purposes to Great Britain and on account of the facility which we here give to Great Britain to export castings I think the Minister should be able to arrange that we should export our motor castings free of duty to them also. I think he should take this into consideration as there is a definite possibility behind them.  Possibly he is aware of the circumstances.</P>

I think the attention of the general public should be drawn to the fact that there is this opportunity for enterprising firms.  It cannot be forgotten that some motor works, now of very large size, started as bicycle shops 20 or 25 years ago.  There is no reason in Ireland where we have so much ability and so many mechanics why we could not use this to help to build up the motor industry.</P>

      <P>Certain concessions similar to this have been sought from time to time.  With regard to certain classes of cars for some time past the revenue have been able to admit them under the law as it stood without amending it.  It was felt that this change might be made without endangering the revenue, and would convenience a certain number of people engaged in manufacture.  I do not anticipate that it is going to lead to any substantial import, but it will, I think, certainly lead to some employment being given by a development in a particular type of assembly and manufacture here.  With regard to reciprocity, I do not think that any negotiations can be based on a very small change such as this.</P>
      <P>The whole question of the reciprocal free importation of motors and motor parts was discussed at great length with the British Government some years ago, and in fact a draft scheme was evolved, but finally we had to break off negotiations on the ground that the scheme&mdash;and it was the only scheme that the British would agree to&mdash;would be unfavourable to this country.  I do not think there would be any hope of doing anything better with reference to a small thing like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1580" /> Amendment put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill as amended be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill now reported to the House differs in one important respect from the Bill which was submitted to the Dáil by the Minister, in so far as he has seen fit to accept an amendment which stood in the names of Deputy Shaw and Deputy Egan to insert before Section 20 a new section. The purpose and the intention of that new section was to pass on to the public a tax which the Minister, in the Bill as originally introduced, proposed to levy upon sound films.  I have been reading the debate on that matter, and I am not satisfied that the Minister and those who proposed that amendment have justified it to the House.  In that connection, I would like to refer the House to the Minister's original financial statement, in which he indicated that this new tax would be imposed and I would like to emphasise the words with which he defended it.  The Minister stated</P>
      <P>For some time past the silent film has been going out of use in picture houses in the Saorstát, as in picture houses elsewhere, and the long queues in the streets testify to the popularity of the sound film and to the large sums of money which are going to support it.  It is supplanting not merely the silent picture but also the orchestra.  It has been felt for some time that the rate of tax which was appropriate to silent films was an insufficient levy on talkies.  They are not only a more complex product but their attractiveness to the public enables them to bear more tax.  Further, they are also more effective agents for the reduction of our revenue in other directions than the old films.  I propose, therefore, that the customs duties on sound films, whether they themselves bear the sound record or whether they are adapted for use with a separate sound record shall be increased from one penny to threepence per linear foot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1581" /> The original intention of the Minister is quite clear from his statement and that was, not to increase the amusements tax, but to put such a duty upon sound films as would compensate for the loss to the public and the public particularly of the Free State and to those who have earned their living by following music as a profession.  He proposed to compensate for those losses by imposing a tax upon sound films.  I think that that is a tax which in all the circumstances was justifiable because the introduction of the sound film has enabled every picture house in the Saorstát to dispense with its orchestra. We know that in the largest picture-houses in Dublin the orchestra has been entirely dispensed with and these Dublin citizens who formerly earned their living as members of these orchestras are, many of them, now facing destitution.  I believe that some of them ultimately will either be compelled to emigrate or will be supported out of public funds.  Merely as compensation for the public moneys which would be spent in supporting those disemployed members of the orchestras, the tax on the sound film would be justifiable.  The people who are reaping the profits&mdash;and there is a considerable amount of profit out of the talkie films, firstly because of their popularity and secondly, because of the economies which the proprietors of picture-houses are enabled to make by using them&mdash;are the renters and the exhibitors.  The public only benefit to the extent that their taste is gratified and it is to my mind unfair and unjust that the Minister who designed this tax as a tax on renters and exhibitors should now, owing to political pressure within his own Party, pass that tax on to the public.</P>
    <P>In proposing his amendment, Deputy Shaw endeavoured to justify it by asking the Dáil to behold the piteous spectacle of the poor film exhibitor. He said that the renters intended to pass this tax on to the exhibitor. Well and good, if the renters do, the film exhibitors have had ample compensation, and still will have ample compensation, for that tax if it is passed on to them, in the increased <Col N="1582" /> audiences which these films are bringing to their picture-houses.  But, as I pointed out in the debate on the Committee Stage of the amendment, so far as Dublin is concerned, the film exhibitors and the film renters in the case of two and, to a certain extent in the case of a third, of the largest picture-houses in Dublin, are one and the same interest.  I think the biggest, or the second biggest house in Dublin is owned by a film-producing corporation in America.  A picture-house which is either the biggest or the second biggest, either of these alternatives, is in close association with a British film-producing corporation, and a third one has also certain contracts and affiliations with a British film corporation. If Deputy Shaw's amendment had not been accepted by the Minister those picture-houses would not be able to pass on the tax to the public.</P>
    <P>Those picture-houses, I believe, represent a seating capacity which is equal to more than 60 per cent. of the total seating capacity of the cinemas in Dublin.  They will be unable to pass this tax on to the public as they would have been if the Minister had not accepted this amendment.  We say that the film renters ought to be compelled to bear this tax, but now on account of the flexibility, as it has been euphoniously described, of this amendment, a flexibility which Deputy Shaw states is necessary, these picture-houses will be able, as I have said, to pass on the tax.  What the Minister originally intended, I believe, was to put the tax upon the external monopolies which control the film business in this country, but now they will be able to make it a tax upon the Irish public.  That was not the original intention, I believe, of the Minister or of this House when it accepted the principle of this increased tax on films.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House, I believe, would be prepared, to a certain extent, to meet the point of view of the smaller cinemas and of the provincial cinemas, but I do not think we are entitled to meet it to the extent which Deputy Shaw asks us to do, or the Minister in the amendment he has accepted. I believe we could meet Deputy <Col N="1583" /> Shaw and the provincial exhibitors if we only permitted the alteration in the rates of the entertainment duty to apply to houses of a certain limited capacity.  Very few of the provincial cinemas have a seating capacity of more than 800 or 1,000 at the outside. If we limited the alteration only to those houses which have a seating capacity not exceeding 1,000 or 1,200 we would be excluding those houses in which the film producers, renters and exhibitors represent one and the same interest.  We would be compelling them to refrain from passing the tax on to the public and would enable the smaller houses in certain of the provincial towns where, in the majority of cases, competition does not exist, to meet any extra charge which the film renters might pass on to them.</P>
    <P>Even though we would be prepared to meet Deputy Shaw to that extent we would like to make it clear that no figures and no data have been put before the House to justify the statement the Deputy has made, that the provincial cinemas are at the mercy of the film renters, and that if this amendment is not accepted they will be compelled to pay exorbitant rates for their films.  For myself I do not believe that, because while I believe it is true that there is a shortage of suitable films in Dublin, where you have a considerable number of picture houses, and therefore competition for the films available, there is no shortage of suitable films for exhibition in the provincial towns. I suppose it is correct to say that you have nineteen or twenty picture houses in Dublin competing for the limited number of films released by the film censor each week.  They are willing and anxious to pay a great deal in order to get a programme.  In the case of the provincial towns you have at most one or two picture houses in each town.  These picture houses have a choice of the films that are released for the use of the Dublin houses week after week.  I believe that the film renters have to deal with the provincial exhibitors on competitive terms.  Because of that I do not believe that the provincial exhibitors would be <Col N="1584" /> able to pass on this tax to the film exhibitors in the way that Deputy Shaw fears.  For that reason I do not think that the amendment has been justified to the House either by Deputy Shaw or the Minister.</P>
    <P>The only good argument from the financial point of view of which the Minister could justify his acceptance of the amendment was that it was going to mean no loss of revenue.  He is going to get exactly the same revenue from the tax under Deputy Shaw's amendment as he would have got if it were not accepted.  The important thing for the House to bear in mind is that the original intention of the Minister was to tax the film renters and the film producers in order to compensate for the dislocation in the economic life of the State which the introduction of the films has produced.  That was his point of view, and certainly I believe it was not his original intention to seek that compensation at the cost of the Irish public.  The effect of the amendment will be to pass the tax from the foreign film producer to the native Irish public.  Unless the Minister is able to defend the amendment on its merits, and unless Deputy Shaw is able to produce more cogent reasons in support of his amendment than he has given hitherto we will be compelled to oppose it.</P>

      <P>It is very strange, after the very full and free discussion that we had on this matter on the Committee Stage, that Deputy MacEntee is now so loud in calling for a division. If the Deputy wanted to discuss this matter then he should have given notice to members of the House by putting down an amendment.  In view of the fact that his Party unanimously agreed to the amendment and that no notice was given that it was intended to raise this on this stage of the Bill, I am not prepared to discuss it now. I agree that it is a most difficult thing to talk about a subject that one knows nothing about.  Deputy MacEntee knows nothing whatever about this, but his friend Deputy Flinn does.  He made a speech on the last evening which stated the position exactly. Deputy Flinn knows more about it <Col N="1585" /> than I do, and I wish I knew even less than I do.  Deputy MacEntee talked about the renters passing the tax on.  He does not say how we are to get over that.  If he can make any suggestion to get over that I will welcome it but the present position is that the renters can dictate their terms.  The tax will cost the exhibitors £30,000.  Those in country towns would not be able to meet the extra charge that would fall on them.  I would like to have got better terms than even those set out in the amendment.  I would like to have seen all seats up to sixpence exempt from tax.  The terms in my amendment represented the maximum that there was any possibility of getting accepted.  I again protest against Deputy MacEntee's method of springing this question on the House without putting down an amendment.  I think it is unfair to me, the Minister and the House.  I ask Deputy Flinn to contradict what Deputy MacEntee has said.</P>

      <P>There is only one question that I wish to ask the Minister. It is in relation to Section 2. Arising out of the point that was made by Deputy Thrift the Minister said he would consider whether anything could be done to clarify the position, and made a reference to two cases which are still more or less sub judice.  In another part of his speech the Minister said that there were cases where writs had been issued and where no costs would be incurred.  I do not think that would be possible.  There are several cases in which considerable costs have been incurred.  If the Minister would let the House know his intentions with regard to these cases I would be very glad.  What he said on the previous occasion was not very clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the information given to me the cinema proprietors were introduced to the Minister by Deputy Shaw, and their case was heard and dealt with.  I was interested in hearing what the Deputy would say contra to Deputy MacEntee's arguments, because if Deputy Shaw is right in the views he holds with regard to larger cinemas, which are the only ones that will benefit, and which, as Deputy MacEntee pointed out, are not, in a sense, domestic cinemas at all, the smaller cinemas throughout the country, and twenty in the City of Dublin, will get practically no benefit.  The benefits proposed in the amendment only deal with the higher-priced seats in the bigger institutions. Deputy MacEntee alluded to these.  I desire to support what he said.  I believe Deputy MacEntee would have a different point of view, and possibly would have expressed it, if the case was made by Deputy Shaw that the persons who were to be given some benefit were the smaller people. Deputy Shaw pointed out that it was impossible to put a tax on the renters that they will not pass on.  It is the practice of renters to rent pictures to the smaller cinema proprietors in Dublin, and they pass on the tax, so that the smaller people will get no benefit.  I feel that Deputy Shaw has made a bad case for his amendment.  It is only the very poor in the congested areas, where there are small cinemas, are being asked to pay the full amount. They will get no remission, while foreign-controlled houses will get a remission. I do not know why Deputy Shaw did not allude to that, because I understand that representations have been made to him and to his Party.  I received particulars about the matter. I think that a gross injustice has been done to the smaller people.  There was no necessity of introducing an amendment under which remission will be given to the wrong people.</P>

      <P>Now that we have done our best with reference to the income tax proposal this year I would suggest that in the next stage of the Bill in another place the Minister would introduce the same facility for executors that he introduced on a suggestion from this side with reference to property, namely, that it would be possible for an executor to get a certificate stating that income tax had been paid, so that the executor's position would not become an impossible one. Otherwise an executor would not, for a considerable time, know whether he could distribute an estate or not.  He would have to wait at least three years before he could do so.  If that happened it would be a cruel thing on a number of people who would be beneficiaries under the administration.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should consider carefully the application of the principle, so that an executor could get a certificate showing that all tax had been paid and that no further claims would be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>All that I am concerned with is that I regard entertainment tax as a perfectly legitimate tax.  It is fair game for the Minister as a method of gaining revenue so long as, in the method of taking it, he does not do damage which he does not intend to do. As far as dealing with entertainment tax which is paid upon the income of people to whom amusement is simply amusement, as distinct from a psychological necessity, then the Minister is entitled to it.  My difficulty in all these cases in relation to this and every other schedule put forward is that I have not been able to find any logic in the schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had experience of this thing, and I have given information to the Minister that was in my possession at <Col N="1588" /> one time or another.  That on the same revenue from entertainments the lower prices you charge the public the more tax you have to pay.  That is wrong. That is my fundamental objection. Entertainment of a cheap and wholesome character, whether indoor or outdoor, is a national necessity in this country.</P>
    <P>If I might take a one side line in order to illustrate what I mean, in my opinion the biggest value in the Shannon scheme was the brightening of the little towns.  In exactly the same way there is a definite social, financial, economic and national value in being able to provide for poor people in Ireland something which will take their minds away from the drabness of a good deal of their lives.  I would be prepared to accept the schedule which raised steeply on the higher prices if I could see that people who really did require amusement as a necessity were not taxed.  That is the only line on which I am prepared to press the Minister now or at any other time.  The fundamental badness in the Bill, apart from the sugar tax which it enshrines, is Section 2.  I notice that all the people who asked for another opportunity to review this matter on the Report Stage are unanimously absent. Deputy Myles said: &ldquo;I think the Minister ought to give us a further opportunity on the next stage to discuss this matter.&rdquo;  Apparently he has thrown in his hand, and so have Deputy Thrift, Deputy Murphy and the rest.  What was wrong a week ago is wrong now, and the fact that they could get a division and go safely into it on this specific issue, does not excuse them from being here when they have to speak and vote on the Bill as a whole. We had very high morality in relation to finance, spoken from these benches, playing the game, playing all the rules, honesty and decency in legislation.</P>
    <P>That was all right when it was possible to go into the Division Lobby, knowing that Cumann na nGaedheal had with them the Labour Party to make it perfectly safe to be independent. This is the sort of conduct which makes the name of Independent stink in the nostrils of honest men. <Col N="1589" /> That is what gives a definite meaning, a cruel meaning, because a true meaning, to the statement of their own organ that every man has his price. I certainly think that their absence to-day ought not to have been introduced by the high moral tone, the hauteur of the speeches of a week ago. In this Bill, and in this clause in relation to this Bill, the Minister has frankly claimed the right, not merely as constitutional, but as a thing right in itself, not a legal right, but the right of decency and the right in morals, of an Assembly of this kind, not merely to interpret the law, but to interpret the law retrospectively in every case which suits them.  We have had the mad-dog theory in relation to the law that extraordinary results would follow if the courts were allowed to interpret the law in a way different from what the Minister or the Executive have been practising.  It would be an extraordinary thing that people who were doing what they were legally entitled to do should not be expected to be subjected to penalties for doing that by the Executive.  It would be an extraordinary thing that, at their own initiative, or whenever the idea struck them, they would not be able to manufacture a crime that a man had committed previously.  It would be an extraordinary thing if the courts were prevented from making a man liable to-day for penalties for doing a thing for which he was not liable for penalties when he did do it. If that is not a subversion of all law as we know it, as conventional people regard it, I do not know what law is.</P>
    <P>As I have said, this is not the first case.  We have had it in every single area, and if we pass this precedent, if we allow people to be penalised now through the State, penalised through their successors, penalised through the people who are occupying fiduciary positions and serving them, then anything is liable.</P>
    <P>Apply the law to any other thing, apply the law to other cases in which Ministers have been found to be wrong, and in which they have put people in jail and then found that they had no right to have them in <Col N="1590" /> jail; in which men have damaged their property and the Free State Courts have said that though the Minister did intend it, though he thought that was the law, it was not in fact the law when he had those people under arrest.  You cannot make water-tight compartments in these matters.  The principle which the House is going to vote for when it votes for this clause is one which may rest like a whip across the shoulders of the men who have contriyed it and they thoroughly deserve it.  There is no man who consents to this Bill in this form, who consents to the principle of clause 2, who will have any complaint if any future government in this country, in relation to his interests in any matter which the Executive thinks right, shall declare that what was right when he did it is wrong now when it no longer suits that Executive.  I am giving that warning definitely.  It will come home to roost.  This evil counsel which they are giving may be improved upon and let the consequences rest upon those who have created the cause.</P>

      <P>When this Bill was before the House on Second Reading I opposed Section 2.  I did so on the grounds that it was legally, constitutionally, and morally insupportable. I have heard and read the debates which have since taken place and I am more than ever convinced that the view which I took then, and which reluctantly compelled me in honour to refuse to vote for this Bill, more than ever prevails.  We have been told by the Minister for Finance that he has got somebody in Somerset House, where he evidently received his inspiration, to send him a letter telling him that what they are doing to-day is in accordance with English precedent.  There will be very little difficulty for the Minister if that statement is accurate to give us the English precedent which he quotes. There need not be anything mysterious about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where in the course of the history of England, where they have not the advantage of our Constitution which in my submission to the House puts <Col N="1591" /> the matter beyond all doubt, has there ever been a case in which while an appeal is still pending a British Government took it on themselves to bring into the House of Commons a Bill to reverse the decision of a competent court which the Revenue Commissioners found out or had come to the conclusion they could not challenge on appeal?  I say it is an unfortunate thing for this country if it is to go forth that the power which the Revenue Commissioners are now seeking, and which apparently they have got from the Government through the Minister for Finance, is to prevail. It means one thing and one thing only, that nobody can go to law with the Revenue Commissioners no matter how wrong or unjust their decision may be, as the decision will be reversed and their decision will stand. They care not one damn about the law.  That is the position they take up.  That is the position even which some officials are good enough to tell you, if you call on them and receive the courtesy which we have been told here by some Deputies they get from them.  If they had as much experience as I have, they would not be complaining of over-courtesy.  One thing they are consistent about and that is, that they make it clear to you that they care nothing about the law, that they make the law conform to them and that they will not conform to the law.  It is because of that principle that we have the Minister for Finance here to-day introducing a section which I respectfully submit to the House is contrary to all precedent, contrary to the principles of natural justice and contrary to the principles of the Constitution, which we have come here sworn to maintain. By all means alter the Constitution and then re-consider the matter, but the idea of turning into a penal offence&mdash;because that is what it is, no matter how they try to wriggle out of it&mdash;something that a man had done yesterday quite lawfully is quite immoral. What he did yesterday quite lawfully he may be sent to jail for to-morrow.</P>
    <P>That is the principle the Revenue <Col N="1592" /> Commissioners have shoved down the throat of the Minister for Finance.  I am opposed to that.  It is almost said that there is no pending appeal.  There is a pending appeal.  Certain steps are taken, and a case is stated, and it was only when the Revenue Commissioners found out that they could not stand over that, and that the decision of the learned Circuit Court judge would be upheld they said: &ldquo;We don't care a damn about the law, and we will square the Minister for Finance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are told that the Minister has given a very valuable assurance in that the decisions in the cases of people where litigation is pending will not be interfered with.  I would like to know how many cases are referred to there. If the Minister was only referring to one, and if there is only one, I think it is hardly fair to mislead the House with the idea that he was referring to a number of cases.  I do not think it was candid or quite fair to the House. I would like to know now how many cases are pending in which he will not enforce Section 2 when it becomes law.</P>
    <P>It is said that this can only affect people who have fraudulently evaded the law.  It is said that it can only affect estates where the testator made a false return.  There is not a word of truth in that.  Take the case of an executor when he got an assessment which was void on its face, made in excess of jurisdiction, and said: &ldquo;I will ignore it.  I will close, as the law permits me, my account with my beneficiaries,&rdquo; and he does close it.  What is the position that the Minister for Finance and the Revenue Commissioners are going to take up in regard to that case?  They say, &ldquo;we made an assessment void upon its face, in excess of jurisdiction.  Every citizen is presumed to know the law.  You know the law, and you ignore this assessment, as you are bound to do.  You close your estate, distribute your assets to your beneficiaries, but, to show our utter contempt of the law, say we are going to get a Bill passed into law and we will make you pay out of your own pocket, and if you do not do that you know where we will put you.&rdquo;  That is the attitude of the Revenue Commissioners.  I would <Col N="1593" /> like to know from the Minister for Finance when he promised to look into the matter if he looked into it, and what did he find as regards the position of the executor who has closed his account on the face of the existing law?  Is he going to make him pay again?  Is he going to make him pay for carrying out the duty which the law, as it existed then, cast upon him? If he is not, then this Section 2 must be remodelled.</P>
    <P>Now let us take the other case of an executor knowing the law upon whom the assessment was made void. When he got the notice he may have, as I know has occurred in many cases, taken no notice of the void assessment. He has allowed the time of appeal from the void assessment to go by.  That does not alter the fact that the assessment, when notice of it was served upon him, was so much waste paper.  Does the Minister suggest that the Revenue Commissioners will not come down on that man again and that they will not contend that Section 2 has put new life into that void assessment?  Does the Minister suggest that the Revenue Commissioners will not contend that Section 2 makes, what was just waste paper, an instrument of live torture?  Does he suggest for a moment that the Revenue Commissioners will not make the case that the time for appealing has gone by and that the effect of Section 2 will be to take away from this man the right of appeal?  They have done that in many instances.  I have seen them more than once make the point the time for appealing had gone by because the notice of assessment had been delayed owing to troubles that existed in this country.  It had been delayed in that way in some instances, and I have seen them make the case that in consequence the right of appeal had gone by.  There are some of the Commissioners who made that point. I have heard them myself make the point when a man got notice of the fact that he had been assessed that the right of appeal dated not from the date on which he got notice, but from the date on which the document was sent out in Dublin, Cork or elsewhere. That is nonsense.  It is not the law <Col N="1594" /> and never was the law, but it does not prevent the Revenue Commissioners holding that it was so and that the precedent for it is there.  And it is to these same Commissioners that we are asked to hand this fresh instrument of torture.  I would like an assurance from the Minister for Finance if he suggests that I have wrongly interpreted the position that in the case of void assessments&mdash;that is, assessments that are to-day void in accordance with the decision of the Circuit Court judge&mdash;that these void assessments would not be operative.  At all events it would be some measure of relief to those unhappy people that they should have an assurance in trying to meet the demands of the Revenue Commissioners with the one mouth that would enable them to meet these demands closed in death, that the assessment void on the date of the passing of this Act would not be operative and that the executors would get an opportunity of getting a fresh assessment.  That is only a trivial concession and does not at all meet the injustice that is really done by this section.  But if the Revenue Commissioners are not inexorable in their desire to hunt to death the taxpayers certainly that concession is not too much to ask.  It will not get rid of the difficulty, but the idea of this retrospective legislation trying to turn void documents into living forces is immoral, unconstitutional, and no good will follow from it either to the Revenue Commissioners or to the Government.  I shall vote against this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to the question of the entertainment tax I have been pressed many times in the House to make the scale of duties more flexible and I have also been pressed to adopt a percentage basis and on more than one occasion I have been very much inclined to adopt that percentage basis, because of the flexibility that it would give to owners of picture-houses. I have only refrained from adopting it simply because in practice it would not be possible to apply it to all picture-houses.  It would not be possible to apply it to a <Col N="1595" /> certain number of picture-houses from which the Revenue Commissioners declined to take certain returns. When I was asked by Deputy Shaw and others, whether I would agree to accept proposals for modification in the scale of flexibility on this occasion if they did not involve a loss of duty, I was willing to agree to that.  I am satisfied that whatever may happen immediately it is not possible permanently for the renters of picture-houses and producers to escape some share of this duty.  What share they will have to meet, it is difficult to say.  The question of attendance at these picture-houses, the question of the price of seats and all that is governed to a very considerable degree by competition.</P>
      <P>We are dealing in this matter with a luxury thing, something in which the public demand can fall off very substantially without any great damage to the community.  Consequently, when there is an increased burden to be borne, the ultimate fact will be that burden will have to be shared in some way.  If it were all pushed on to the public I think the result would be some decline in the attendance at picture-houses or else a tendency on the part of the public to go towards the cheaper seats&mdash;something that would be, from the point of view of the picture-houses, practically equivalent to a decline in revenue. Therefore, there will be an incentive remaining whatever may happen to the scale of taxes on the picture-houses, to fight the battle as well as they can with the renters and producers.  I am quite satisfied that that will continue to be done and while it is difficult to get at the fact there does seem, temporarily at any rate, from the point of view of the picture-house owners, a shortage of pictures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be that they have not explored sufficiently all the sources from which they might possibly get supplies. But there does seem a shortage at the present time and it seems to be possible for renters or producers to make their own terms with the picture-houses <Col N="1596" /> than would be the case if there was a plentiful supply.</P>
    <P>I believe that that shortage of supply is only temporary and that when it ceases the picture-houses again will have an opportunity of picking and choosing which perhaps they have not at the present time, and that they will be able to cause those who undoubtedly wish to sell this luxury article to meet some share of the cost.  I do not think it would be a good thing to limit the concession to larger picture-houses. Perhaps the smaller picture-houses would not be able to take advantage of it.  If the larger picture-houses could not, I think it would probable prove exceedingly difficult for the smaller houses to do it.  I think that there is nothing to be done in the matter but to allow picture-houses some possibility of varying their prices in accordance with the conditions as they exist, remembering always that the competition and the desire of the public to have their entertainment as cheaply as possible will operate to prevent an undue increase of prices.  I do not think that we could do much in the way of increasing the scale of duty at the top.  That would lead simply to the higher priced seats being unoccupied.</P>
    <P>With reference to the question raised by Deputy Murphy as to whether Section 2 could be clarified or not, we have come to the conclusion that it does not require clarification and that in any case it would be difficult to put in anything in the section to suggest that it would only apply in cases of fraud.  If we were to do that it would mean that we would be driven into the position of accusing people of actual fraud who were dead.  It is clear that the case will only apply to actual cases of evasion.  Deputy Wolfe has asked a certain question about assessments received since Judge Shannon's judgment was delivered in regard to which the executor might be taking no action and where the time for appeal had passed.  So far as that is concerned additional time will be allowed.  That is, the executor will not be at any disadvantage in that respect because of the amendment being passed in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>Either a new assessment will be made or no objection will be taken to his appealing after or beyond the usual time so that he can appeal in the ordinary way and he will not be injured by this.  On the point of substance as to whether an executor might lose the right to appeal against an assessment because of any confusion in this matter I want to make it clear that that will not happen and that the executor will continue to have the right to appeal. With regard to the cases that have been before the courts, on inquiry I find that there is only one case where the point has actually been argued before the courts.  In that case what has happened is that the assessments have been discharged.  With regard to the assessment for the three years which this section governs there will be no appeal taken against that.  The judge has discharged those assessments for three years and also the other assessments.  With regard to the appeals dealt with by the circuit judge, the position is that no appeal will be taken against his judgment and, therefore, the assessments remain discharged.  The person has won his case and, therefore, it will not be affected.  There was another case where there were certain preliminary points before the court.  There may have been some other cases that have proceeded to some extent.  What it is proposed to do in respect of those cases where the point of dealing with the section has not come to argument before the courts, is simply to pay the costs of the litigation in which these people have been involved.</P>

      <P>There was a certain amount of confusion in the previous debate which had been as it were reintroduced to-day, that is, the question of penalties.  There is no question of penalties involved in this.  All that will happen will be this.  The tax which the man became liable for in his lifetime, except that the amount was not determined, will now be recovered from his estate, but there will be no penalties whatever.  Nothing will be recovered, and nothing will come into the Exchequer except the tax, which the man during his lifetime, avoided making payment of, by failing to give complete returns.  I will not go into the question as to whether that was fraudulent or not.</P>
      <P>Deputy Little asked about the question of a certificate to executors in order to enable them to wind up an estate.  That is a matter which I will have to consider further before I will finally answer him.  I will just say this that the section in this Bill does not alter in any way the time for winding up an estate, because an additional assessment must still be made within three years of the year in which the death occurred.  So far as that is concerned there is no change in the time within which an estate can be wound up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Little's point was that an executor, in the usual course of affairs, endeavoured to wind up an estate within what is known as the executor's year and that it will not be possible henceforth for that executor to receive a certificate at the end of the executor's year to enable him to distribute the estate to the beneficiaries.  To keep himself free from any liability he will have to hold up the final disposal of the estate for three years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>That point does not really arise in connection with this particular section, but with regard to the question of what is being done in England, I think Deputy Wolfe must have misunderstood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1599" /> What I said was that the law is the same, almost word for word, here as it is in England.  In England, it has always been understood in precisely the same sense in which it has been understood here.  It has been acted upon in that sense and assessments have been made just as they were made here.  It has not been challenged in England, but it has here. With regard to the judgment, what I say is that the judgment was a Circuit Court judgment.  Revenue cases are heard in the Circuit Court in camera.  In this particular case there was only counsel on one side.  There was no counsel appearing for the Revenue, because it came on in the ordinary way of Circuit Court cases. It is for that reason and because that often happens that we do not generally, and people outside generally do not, regard a Circuit Court decision as very conclusive in regard to the law. Of course there are two other courts to which we might appeal.  There is no guarantee that the case was fully argued in the Circuit Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not regard it as at all certain&mdash;I have been advised that there is considerable doubt&mdash;as to what the ultimate decision would be, but I am not prepared to let the matter remain over and have a great deal of costly litigation and a great deal of revenue remain out of the Exchequer and burdens imposed on other people who have paid all they were liable to pay, for the benefit of the successors of those who avoided what they ought to have paid.  It has happened in England that before a matter was finally decided in the courts legislation <Col N="1600" /> had been introduced to see that the existing practice was upheld by law. As a matter of fact, in the Finance Bill of the present year in Great Britain there is a section dealing with a point which was before the court and on which no judgment had been delivered by the final court at the time the section was introduced.</P>

      <P>On amendment 1 to Section 2, and also on the other amendments there is an important point of order which, although I have not had an opportunity of discussing with you, I think is too important to allow to go by default.  If we take the point of order on amendment 1, I want to say this amendment would create a completely new class of beneficiary under the Act.  The Act proposes that the supplementary grant shall be applicable in like manner as the supplementary grant in the Act of 1925.  The Act of 1925 arranges that the money therein provided shall be distributed in like manner as is arranged under Section 51 of the Act of 1898.  When the agricultural grant was originally provided, it was expressly provided that the grant should extend to agricultural land within the meaning of the Valuation Act, but should not extend to land which was part of a railway or canal or to an hereditament situated within the boundary <Col N="1604" /> of a borough or of any town which was an urban sanitary district. The amendment proposes in a Bill which provides money to be distributed in like manner as the Act of 1925 that land that would be expressly excluded under the 1898 Act shall be included.  That is as far as the first amendment to Section 2 is concerned.</P>
      <P>As far as the second amendment is concerned, that is contrary to the letter and the spirit of the Bill as it is before us at present.  Under the 1898 Act, where land was outside an urban district or a county borough at the time of the passing of the 1898 Act and because of that reason became entitled to benefit from the agricultural grant, where such land passed into an urban district or county borough subsequent to 1898 the benefit of the agricultural grant passed to the urban district in respect of the land that came into the urban district and to the county borough council in respect of land which came into the county borough council.  I would point out that this Act provides in respect of land which has passed into the county borough area prior to the passing of this Act that no part of this money shall pass in respect of land that has previously passed into that area.</P>

      <P>In the amendment in Deputy Goulding's name and mine, land within the county borough other than agricultural land is excluded. <Col N="1605" /> The amendment seeks to have the grant given under this Bill to any land within the boundary of a county borough, occupied and used as an ordinary farm in accordance with proper methods of husbandry, and so forth, and the Bill is for the relief of agricultural land.  The amendment simply seeks to extend the benefits under the Bill to people who have unfortunately been excluded up to the present.  I do not want to argue the thing now unless it is to be ruled out of order.</P>

      <P>The two amendments seem to be similar.  The form in which Deputy Hennessy's amendment appears on the Order Paper now is somewhat different from the form in which it was originally handed in.  The two amendments seem to aim at including in the Bill agricultural land not included in the Bill. Apart from the merits of the amendment, with which I have no concern, the point of order would appear to be this, that the Bill contemplates additional relief of rates on agricultural land where the occupier of the land pays rates to a county council, and Deputy Hennessy's amendment introduces an occupier who pays rates to an urban council.</P>
      <P>Amendment 2, in the name of Deputy Goulding and Deputy Aiken introduces land where the occupier pays rates to a county borough.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that it would be too narrow a definition of the scope of the Bill to maintain that the amendments are outside it.  The Bill is a Bill to provide for the relief of rates on agricultural land.  The amendments seek to bring in certain types of agricultural land and in the absence of a definition of agricultural land, which would rule out the amendments, it seems to me that the amendments are in order and may be argued.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2.  In sub-section (2), line 29, after the word &ldquo;boroughs&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;and shall also be payable by the councils of such counties to the councils of urban areas (other than county boroughs) <Col N="1606" /> in respect of agricultural land within such urban areas which are excluded from the application of such grant by sub-section (4) of Section 48 of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898 and that sub-section shall be construed accordingly.</P>
    <P>Section 48, sub-section (4) of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898 provides:</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Act with respect to agricultural land shall extend to every hereditament entered as land in the valuation list within the meaning of the Valuation Acts which is not part of a railway or canal, but shall not extend to any hereditament situate within the boundary of any borough or of any town which is (for the time being) an urban sanitary district.</P>
    <P>That particular sub-section, I think, rules out any urban area urbanised prior to that Act.  Section 50 of the same Act provides:</P>
    <P>Where, by virtue of an order respecting the constitution of an urban county district, whether by the constitution of a new or the extension of the boundaries of an old urban county district, any agricultural land in a rural district becomes included within the boundaries of the said urban district, such portion of the agricultural grant payable to the council of the county comprising the district as is proportionate to the rateable value in the standard financial year of that agricultural land shall be applied by the county council in manner directed by the said order for the relief of the said land from rates, whether by the payment thereof to the council of the urban district in exchange for an adequate exemption from rates or otherwise.</P>
    <P>That section provides that agricultural land situate in a district or area not then urbanised but which became urbanised subsequent to the passing of the Act of 1898, shall continue to get the relief of the agricultural grant.  I put down this amendment for the purpose <Col N="1607" /> of bringing agricultural land within areas which were urbanised prior to the passing of the 1898 Act within the reliefs provided under the agricultural grants.  What are agricultural lands?  I do not know that we have any clear definition of them, but I notice that in an amendment in the names of Deputies Seán Guilidhe and Frank Aiken they have defined to some extent the term agricultural land as &ldquo;lands occupied and used as an ordinary farm in accordance with the proper methods of husbandry.&rdquo;  I think that is a very good definition of agricultural land.  The owners or occupiers of lands within these urban areas that are exempted from this relief feel that they have a grievance, and I think they have.  At the moment the world-wide depression has affected these urban areas just as much, and perhaps more in many cases, than it has affected any other area in the Saorstát.  Many of these urban areas are very heavily rated, and I think it must be conceded that it is impossible to expect or that it is not fair to expect the occupiers of these lands, who use them for agricultural purposes, to compete with their neighbours in adjoining urban areas whose lands receive the benefit of the agricultural grant.</P>
    <P>The transport system that we have experienced within recent years left a great many of these urban areas without business.  Some Deputies, I think, have the idea in their minds that everyone living within an urban area is wealthy and hence that there is no need of relief for them.  I do not think that there is any farmer whose lands will get relief under the agricultural grant or under this Bill who will object to portion of this money being applied to agricultural lands within urban districts.  We must regard land in the urban districts as being part and parcel of the agricultural industry.  They are worked in the interests of the industry and they must carry overhead charges just the same as in the rural areas.  Nowadays, when competition in the markets is so keen, it is not fair or equitable <Col N="1608" /> that we should ask occupiers of land in urban areas, urbanised prior to 1898, to go into competition with their neighbours who have the advantage of this relief.  I do not consider that we would be doing any injustice to farmers in the rural areas if this amendment were accepted.  I feel confident that the House and the Minister will accept my amendment.  It does not propose to do an injustice to any other section of the community. It will confer on the owners of land in the areas referred to very great benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing the amendment.  What the amendment proposes is that the agricultural grant should be applied to land in these urban areas.  These lands were excluded from the benefit of the agricultural grant under the Act of 1898, and again they were expressly excluded in 1925 when we increased the agricultural grant.  The amendment is adopting for the first time an entirely new principle with regard to land in urban areas.  The Towns Improvement Act of 1854 provided that lands in towns would be rated to one-fourth of the ordinary town rate.  It was considered that it ought not be rated to the same value as other hereditaments.  It was provided that the rates falling upon property in an urban area should be adjusted intra the urban area, and not as part of the general scheme for assessing agricultural land throughout the country generally.  At the time the agricultural grant was given in 1898 certain changes took place in the incidence of rates.  At that time the poor rate was raised on the district electoral division.  The poor rate was rather heavier in the towns than in the country areas comprised in the district electoral division.  The area of charge was changed to the rural district council area.  In that way at the time of the passing of the 1898 Act, towns got a certain amount of relief of rates on agricultural land situate in those towns.  In addition to the fact that the land was only rated at one-fourth of the town rate it got a further benefit in respect of the incidence of the poor <Col N="1609" /> rate by the extension of the area of charge.  When the De-rating Commission was set up no evidence was produced before it to show that, as regards this question, there was any serious problem.  No evidence was put forward in respect to agricultural land in towns, and no claim in that respect was made when the 1898 Act was going through.</P>
      <P>Owing to the development that has taken place in the matter of housing schemes these lands have a much greater value now than they had at the time the 1898 Act was passed.  Their value has increased considerably. When the Greater Dublin Bill was going through a principle similar to that now in operation in the case of these towns was adopted with regard to agricultural land and other hereditaments in the county borough.  That is to say, the land is rated to half the valuation of the full municipal rate.  I submit there is no case for this amendment. It is entirely contrary to the spirit and letter of this Bill, which has been introduced for the purpose of giving assistance to the agricultural industry, as such, generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister knows very little about the subject when he says that what the amendment proposes is not fair.  He has stated that land in urban areas which may be used for building purposes has gone up in value, and that it is only paying one-fourth of the ordinary town rate.  I have a map of Drogheda before me.  It shows that there are fifty farmers with a valuation of about £2,000 within the area controlled by the Drogheda Corporation.  The Minister can see from the map that about one-fourth of the entire land within the borough boundary is occupied by houses.  It has taken five hundred or six hundred years, since the Sack of Drogheda, to put up that number of houses, and at that rate of progress it will take another five hundred or one thousand years to cover the remaining three quarters of the area with houses.  In the meantime the people who own that land are working it as agricultural land. Years ago a very high valuation was put on land situated within two miles <Col N="1610" /> of the centre of the town.  That was because of its proximity value, but that proximity value, due to the introduction of motor transport, has changed altogether within the last five or six years.  Farmers now, instead of deriving any benefit from having their land near a town, suffer a good deal owing to the cost imposed on them by the upkeep of their fences.  The proximity value is not of any use to them at all.  In the case of a man who has portion of his land inside the borough boundary and portion outside, notwithstanding that the portion inside is subject to a certain reduction in rates, the fact is, that the rates on the land inside the urban boundary are twice as much as the rates on the lands outside.</P>
      <P>It is not fair of the Minister to try and put the matter off by saying that no representations were made on behalf of these people at the time the 1898 Act was going through, or before the De-rating Commission.  If there is a fair case to be made for them now, then it should be considered.  If a case was not made at the time referred to by the Minister on behalf of these farmers, it can be said that they were then not properly organised, and perhaps they let the matter go by the board.  In my opinion, a man living within a town area, who used his land as agricultural land, and not as a residential holding, uses it for the purpose of making a living out of it for himself and his family, should get the same reduction in his rates under this Bill as the farmer who happens to live a few yards outside an urban boundary.  Up to now the farmers within the urban boundary have got no benefit out of the agricultural grant.  That is all the more reason, I think, why they should get some benefit out of the present grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister goes into the matter he will see, I think, that what the amendment proposes would not cost a lot.  There will be no harm, but very much good done by applying the present grant to farmers who come within the definition laid down in the amendments of Deputy Hennessy, Deputy Goulding and myself.  If the land becomes building land, then I <Col N="1611" /> am sure that none of us would feel that it should get a reduction in agricultural rates, but as long as the land is used for agricultural purposes, and is farmed in accordance with proper methods of husbandry, it should be entitled to the same benefit as land outside an urban boundary.  On other Bills we stood for giving powers to urban councils to acquire land at a fair valuation.  In the case of farmers inside a borough boundary, we stand for giving them a fair reduction in their rates, just as it is proposed to be given to farmers who are outside the borough boundary.  Some time ago a farmer who has land inside and outside a borough boundary showed me his rate dockets.  The rates on the land inside the urban boundary were double the rates on the land outside the boundary.  I think there is a very good case for giving these farmers the relief that is asked for them.  The fact that they have got no relief up to now makes it all the more incumbent on the Dáil to give them fair play, and whatever relief farmers outside urban boundaries are going to get.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOHanlon" hpid="Mr. O'Hanlon Mr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Deputy Hennessy's amendment.  I think if the Minister had all the facts and figures before him he would accept it. I do not suppose anyone can now say what reason there was in the minds of those who passed the original Act in excluding the owners of such land.  I think it is fairly accurate to assume that land in urban districts, prior to the passing of the agricultural grant, was excluded simply because few people imagined that there was any agricultural land within these areas. In a few urban districts there are men who derive their principal means of living from farming.  I brought the case of a small urban district in my constituency before the Department. I refer to Belturbet, which is in the unfortunate position of being an urban district with a small valuation, where I think 1d. in the £ on the valuation only produces £15.  In that area there is a valuation of over £650 on purely agricultural land from which the farmers derive their sole livelihood.  It is <Col N="1612" /> not accommodation land owned by shopkeepers or professional men.  I think if the Minister could narrow down Deputy Hennessy's amendment, which is a little too broad, he should do so in order to ensure that those who derive their sole living from farming would benefit.  If some qualification of that kind were put into the Bill I think the Minister would find that by accepting the amendment he would be doing no injustice to farmers generally.  He would be removing a considerable injustice, which was perpetrated by previous Acts, on farmers living within urban districts, who enjoy none of the facilities they provide.  As an example, many of these farmers get no benefit from urban water or sewerage schemes, although they have to pay their share of the cost.  This amending Bill is not a further addition to the agricultural grant but was brought in as a result of the agitation to reduce the overhead charges on farmers throughout the Saorstát.  I do not see why farmers who happen to be within urban districts, and who suffer disabilities by not getting all the benefits they are entitled to, should be excluded, particularly as their inclusion will not reduce by the smallest decimal point the benefit given to the rest of the farming community.  I think the Minister might give way in this case and get a form of words which would ensure that people who own land within urban districts, and who have no other means of livelihood&mdash;who are not shopkeepers or professional men&mdash;would get the benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanGoulding" hpid="Mr. Goulding Mr. Goulding">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Goulding</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that this amendment introduces a new principle.  What if it does?  It means fair play for a small section of the community who have not agitated at all.  They did not send any representatives before the De-rating Commission but at the same time they are people with a real grievance.  They are subject to very heavy charges for which they derive no benefit.  I have in mind a town in which a very expensive sewerage scheme will be carried out.  That will mean an increase in the rates in the urban district, and the farmers there will be heavily mulcted as a result of the <Col N="1613" /> sanitary facilities that are to be provided for their neighbours.  They will not benefit, but neighbours who happen to be outside the boundary will benefit. I think it is not fair that farmers in urban areas should not get some relief. I do not know why Section 48 of the Local Government Act excluded them.  No one dreamt that purely agricultural holdings would be excluded from the benefit of the agricultural grant.  Every one knows that one of the arguments put up against the inclusion of these farmers is that they derive certain advantages from the facilities provided by the urban districts.  In the majority of cases they do not benefit either by water or sewerage facilities.  They have to pay very heavily for the benefits that are enjoyed by their neighbours, and it would be in their interests if the Minister could see his way to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will see a good deal of reason in this amendment.  Speaking for the town of Drogheda, an area that I know well, I take it that when the Act of 1918 was passed things were quite different from what they are now. Proximity then had some value and an idea existed that many of the farms, if not built upon, would be turned into cottage gardens.  That is out of the question now.  About 50 farmers in Drogheda have no facilities whatever.  Some may claim that they have water supplies, but that is only in a few cases.  In the majority of cases the water is a long distance away while they have extra expense in maintaining fences.  An important point also is that many of the farmers go in for stall feeding cattle, and instead of shipping them from Drogheda, owing to the operation of through freights they take them across the country and load them at Duleek in order to save a few shillings in that way.  So that in that part of their business no claim can be made.  It is quite true that they did not take any steps to put evidence before the De-rating Commission.  These people are very small in numbers and as they were purely agricultural they did not think there was any necessity as farmers <Col N="1614" /> in general were putting up the case.  They always considered themselves to be purely agricultural and consequently they thought there was no necessity for them to put up evidence.</P>
      <P>I look on their position as being one of sheer hardship.  Some of them have farms a portion of which is inside the boundary and another portion outside. The portion inside the boundary has to pay double the rates of the portion outside.  Farmers some distance away from them are able to market their crops in the town of Drogheda at much less cost of production than they are. Proximity means nothing even in the supply of milk at present.  At the time the Act was passed it did mean something, but to-day no one can argue that it is any advantage whatever. I am sure that the Minister will see reason in adopting these new principles. We have to adopt them every day and we will have to continue to adopt them.  I am confident he will see reason in this and accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister made the point that the owners of these lands in urban areas made no case before the De-rating Commission.  I want to say that when the Commission was set up the urban councils discussed their position with regard to it.  I discussed it with many members of urban councils throughout the area and it was decided that we would not move in the matter, that we would not do anything that might place difficulties in the way of the Commission on the farmers getting the full benefit of de-rating or of any de-rating proposals made by the Government. We might have come in at the time as urban councils and put up a very good case against de-rating because of the very high rates and the very high valuations in these urban areas, but we decided not to do so.  As Deputy O'Hanlon pointed out very properly, it was not intended that any benefits which might accrue from my amendment, if accepted, should go to wealthy shopkeepers if there are any such people, living within urban areas who own land and who do not use it for purely agricultural purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is made that the agricultural grant was not made to apply to urban districts in 1898 because people did not dream that there was any agricultural land in these areas.  So far from that being the fact, under the Towns Improvement Act there was an explicit provision by which land was rated to one-fourth of the town rate.  It is a recognition that people did dream that there was agricultural land inside urban areas and that there was to be, as far as a town is concerned, some kind of differentiation between land and other hereditaments.  Deputy Aiken's amendment and the last remark of Deputy Hennessy, Deputy O'Hanlon's remarks, and Deputy Goulding's remarks, both now and when dealing with this on Second Reading, show how half thought-out the whole problem is.  We are told that relief is not wanted for land in urban districts held as accommodation land by shopkeepers or owned by rich people, or that is not used as a farm proper. Deputy Aiken would put on the Minister for Local Government the task of declaring by order what lands in an urban district or county borough area were ordinary farms, and in addition to that what lands, while being an ordinary farm, were not cultivated by proper methods of husbandry.  I must say that an inquiry on these particular lines with regard to urban areas and county borough areas is certainly not going to expedite the granting to the farming community of the rating relief proposed in this measure.</P>

      <P>Deputies say that it is never too late to introduce a new principle even in this particular way. The principle that existed from the initiation of the agricultural grant is that in so far as there were urban districts prior to the initiation of the grant that had land inside them, and in so far as there was to be differentiation of rating as between lands and other hereditaments inside these areas it should be differentiation worked out inside the areas themselves and not related to the position with regard to agricultural land in the country generally. That is the principle that we are holding to in the distribution of this money, and these are the grounds upon which we oppose these amendments, apart altogether from the great difficulty of applying in any reasonable way, in any reasonable period of time, the changes that all this will bring about, if it were possible to work the second amendment at all.</P>

Agricultural land is the general definition, in England at any rate, of the kind of land that has been relieved from rates over there.  In all probability the courts here will ultimately decide that agricultural land would really cover all land that is being used in an agricultural way.  The Minister has not attempted to show any reasons <Col N="1617" /> why there should be discrimination between agricultural land inside county boroughs as against agricultural land outside.  It seems to me that it would be most unfair, particularly when the present state of affairs has gone on for such a long time, that we should give a further remission of rates without taking these people into consideration. A man who has land inside a county borough is paying very heavy rates&mdash; heavier than the man outside.  The agricultural industry is far less fitted to bear heavy rates than any other industry, and we know of industries that, if they got an opportunity, would probably be able to make a very substantial case for a remission of rates.</P>
      <P>Any grant that would be given to them would mean more employment, and the fact that agriculture generally is in a state of depression outside the areas, obviously it will be in a still more depressed condition when it has to pay heavy rates.  We can well imagine the condition of the farmer inside the County Borough of the City of Dublin at the present time.  The Minister has not really attempted to answer the question why there is discrimination. There was never any discrimination in Great Britain.  Under the 1896 Act, all agricultural land was relieved of half its rates, and under the 1923 Act it was relieved of three-fourths of its rates.  It did not matter where the land was situate.</P>
      <P>The points regarding the De-rating Commission made by the Minister to the effect that those people had not made their claim up to the present is not a worthy one, because they have not really had an opportunity of going into this question; but as the de-rating question has been pretty fully ventilated and as a definite step has been taken in that direction by the Government, I think the Minister should at least admit that the case of these people is worthy of consideration.  It might create some difficulties with his Department and might take some time to work out.  Certain adjustments may have to be effected, but I think the Minister should assure the House he will consider the question, and if he could do anything perhaps he might move in the matter.</P>

      <P>The Minister gave us one reason why the injustice under which these farmers suffer should not be remedied, and that is, that they have not agitated.  I do not know whether that is a signal to all those who want to get their injustices remedied that they should create as much noise and trouble as possible&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is not a question of creating noise and trouble, but of stating the problem, and examining it in the way in which the problem of the farmers generally was stated and examined before the De-rating Commission.  The same applies to the general problems of urban areas.</P>

      <P>The urban areas are concerned mostly with townspeople, and the rural areas with the farmers. The farmers concerned in this amendment are in a rather peculiar position. They are naturally disorganised.  There may be five or six in one town, and not more than fifty in any town or borough.  It is very hard for them to come together and organise.  The Minister found fault with the reference to better methods of husbandry.  I am quite certain Deputy Goulding and Deputy Aiken will accept any form of words that the Minister would like to put the amendment in if he accepts the principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. Fahy Mr. Fahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>They will accept any form.  These men are farmers, living on farms and by farming, and although they happen to be inside these particular areas they should get relief. As has been pointed out, they do not get any of the services supplied by the town.  Their proximity to the towns is not now of much advantage to them.  Then we are told their land has a potential value as building land. It may possibly in cases of sale have a potential value for building in ten years or a hundred years, or a hundred and fifty years' time, but the position is not much use to the farmer in such areas who is trying to live on his farm this year, next year, or this time ten years.  His rates may be <Col N="1619" /> lower, we are told, in comparison with other citizens in that area, but would the Minister deny that his rates are higher in the total than are the rates of the farmer who lives one hundred yards or maybe fifty yards outside the town?  In these circumstances, I think the Minister might take into consideration the small number of farmers affected, and to whom relief should be granted, and who are badly in need of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister complained that these farmers did not organise and put forward their problem before the De-rating Commission, but their problem is exactly the same as that of the farmers who did put their case before the De-rating Commission.  As a matter of fact, in many cases the farmer inside and outside the town is one and the same man.  They have land inside the boundary and land outside it.  The whole problem of agriculture was discussed before the De-rating Commission and representations were made that owing to the present depressed state of agriculture it should be relieved.  These men covered by the amendment are agriculturists. They are making a living out of the land.  They are not getting any great benefit from their close proximity to the town any more than their neighbours a few miles out, and they are suffering from certain disabilities because they are inside the town boundary and also because they are close to the town.  For one thing, it is hard to keep up their fences, and another is that their rates are much heavier.  The Minister can do this if he wishes.  No Deputy is going to stick by any form of words that he himself puts forward and if the Minister wishes to relieve these men who own land inside town boundaries, and if he admits the fairness of their case, he can have an amendment drafted to cover their case completely.  I want to put this to the Minister.  Although he will not bring the owners of land inside the town boundary within the scope of the Bill, the farmers within the town boundaries are made to pay to the Land Annuities (Guarantee) Fund when the annuities are not paid. <Col N="1620" /> The Minister cannot have it both ways. The ordinary burdens of farmers outside are extended to farmers inside the town boundary and for the same reason any benefit given to farmers outside should be extended to the men inside the town boundary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister should agree to this amendment. There is not much in it, and I do not think it is worth while discussing the matter very long.  Further, the quantity of land is so small within the urban areas that I do not think if the relief is granted it would make any serious inroad into the capital sum of £750,000.  I believe there should be no difficulty in making this concession.  A man in an urban district is entitled to this relief.  I do not agree with Deputy Hennessy when he says that wealthy shopkeepers who own this land would be entitled to no relief. Where are the wealthy shopkeepers at the moment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephHenness" hpid="Mr. Hennessy Mr. Hennessy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Are there such?  Most of the shopkeepers in the town are engaged in wine and spirit business and they are taxed nearly out of existence, and I think they are entitled to any relief that may come, if they happen to have a few acres of land within an urban area, out of this £750,000 grant.  I do not think the Minister has made a strong case against this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated it introduced a new principle.  The fact of introducing a grant for £750,000 is a new principle; in fact whenever a new Bill is introduced into this House there is a new principle.  There would be no necessity for the Dáil, or for any other Parliament, to sit if new principles were not to be enunciated.  I do not think, therefore, that this is any great argument from the Minister.  Further, the Minister states that the value of land is greater in urban than in rural areas.  But we must bear in mind that the cost of land is greater in urban than in rural areas.  Wages are higher, rates are higher and the working expenses of the people living in urban areas are much greater than <Col N="1621" /> the expenses of those living in rural areas.  I think the Minister should accept this amendment, seeing the way in which it has been debated by the Deputies from the different Parties who have spoken on this amendment and who have seen the justice of it.  I think the Minister should work out the details as to the allocation of the money.  He may rest assured that it will be very small, as my experience is that the amount of agricultural land cultivated within the urban bounds within the country is very small indeed.  It is hardly worth while.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Coburn minimised this thing.  He said it is a very small thing, but arising out of this small thing we are to involve ourselves in the distribution of money to ratepayers who are not properly scheduled and to a small number of people in respect of whom there are very considerable differences of opinion even here as to the extent to which any set of them should be relieved.  Deputy Coburn wants them all relieved and other Deputies only want some of them relieved.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy says this is in respect of a small number of people and a small amount of money.  Deputies on the opposite side have asked that this should be considered, and it has been considered. It has been considered by us.  It is after consideration of the desirability or otherwise of doing what is proposed here that we decided that it should not be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, in respect of land or any other type of hereditament in an urban district there are special problems, whether it be the incidence of the rates or whether a particular class of ratepayers do or do not get the benefit of the services that are provided in the town, we will have to look to all our urban problems as such, and not confuse the whole picture by having our rural problems ramified into our towns and our urban problems ramified into the country.  The <Col N="1622" /> argument that at this hour of the day farmers inside urban districts should be relieved in a way that we have not been prepared to relieve them before is one that we are not prepared to accept.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Hennessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad the Minister has made these remarks.  I think the Minister has come a long way to meet us.  The discussion on this amendment to my mind has been very healthy.  For the first time, I think, in the history of this House, we are endeavouring to grant some little relief to urban areas.  We have on many occasions been discussing the question of relief to agriculture&mdash;a very important industry.  We all concede that.  But we must also consider that there are very important people living in the urban areas who are very seriously menaced in their business at the moment.</P>

      <P>Some of them are farmers and very good farmers.  We do not desire the application of these grants to any land that is not used for purely agricultural purposes. Since I put this amendment down I understand a deputation from areas affected is to approach the Minister, and the Minister, I have no doubt, will give the matter much more consideration. Probably when these deputations meet him, he will be able to hammer out some machinery whereby he can relieve the farmers within these urban areas in some other way than by eating into the £750,000 that we are granting under this Bill.  I do not wish to confuse the issue and I do not desire to press the amendment because of that.  I hope when this deputation meets the Minister that they will be able to evolve some machinery that will satisfy the owners of these lands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move this Bill with a great deal less pleasure and much less satisfaction than I have ever moved any Bill in this House before. There are three things in it.  In Section 6, sub-section (2) a sum of two million pounds is mentioned.  I am asking for leave to have ready for advance to the Board two million pounds.  In Section 4 a sum of two thousand pounds is mentioned.  I am asking that the Board may be directed to pay that two thousand pounds in the manner stated.  In Section 3, sub-section (1), the phrase occurs in relation to the sums of money previously mentioned, that there shall be advanced &ldquo;as and when requested so to do by the Board all such sums as the Minister for Industry and Commerce shall from time to time certify to be reasonably and properly required by the Board.&rdquo;  Those are the three main things in the Bill.  With regard to the sum of two million pounds I wish to have it at my disposal for the Board's purposes.  Instead of that sum being handed over as in the previous Acts in certain half-yearly sums on a demand made by the Electricity Supply Board, I propose that it shall now be handed over as the Minister for Industry and Commerce shall from time to time certify to be reasonably and properly required by the Board.</P>
      <P>In addition to these three things which are in the Bill, there are two other matters which are somewhere in the shadow of the Bill.  One is the question of why the Executive Council accepted certain resignations of the members of the old Electricity Supply Board and secondly, what is the position of the present part time members or, as they are generally called, the business representatives who are associated with the Board in a part-time way.  All these five things are somewhat tied up with the past history of the Electricity Supply Board and of the Shannon scheme, and I propose to give that history so as to secure the perspective in which these matters should be discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been put to this House two main Bills dealing with the Shannon, one in 1925, the Shannon Electricity Act, which was amended <Col N="1629" /> in 1929, in its financial provisions, and secondly the Electricity (Supply) Act of 1927, which was amended in 1929 in certain small respects, and amended further in 1930.  As far as the first of these Bills is concerned, it has very little if anything whatever to do with this general measure, but I refer to it to get the scheme properly set out.  In the first Bill, the Shannon Electricity Act, the sum of £5,200,000, afterwards raised by the 1929 amending Bill to an effective sum of £5,700,000 was given for the construction of what was described and defined in that measure as the Shannon Works.</P>
    <P>In addition there was a certain sum of money, which in the 1929 Act became £156,000, set aside to meet deficiencies and interest in the non-productive years.  There were therefore the sums of £5,700,000 if we take the second Act plus this sum of £156,000, and for that there had to be constructed the whole Shannon Works as described in general in the Siemens Schuckert plan of many years ago. The sum of money I mentioned, £156,000, was supposed to be the sum which, with the revenue derived from the sale of current sold in bulk, would remunerate all the expenditure necessary in connection with these works and their construction, provide the interest payments, repayment of principal, depreciation, renewals, repairs, management and so on.  Some of these things were not to be brought into account in the non-productive years, but it was estimated that if the maximum current that, in a dry year, would be produced for sale at the outskirts of towns and villages, namely, 134 or 138 million units, could be sold at a figure established by the experts, a sum of money, roughly £500,000, would be secured, and that would be sufficient to pay all I have spoken of, the interest, sinking fund, renewals and repairs, management and operation and other expenses of that kind.  That was the first system, the Shannon system properly so-called.</P>
    <P>I stated when the 1929 Act was under consideration that the sales figure of .84 of a penny mentioned by <Col N="1630" /> the experts, in their report, and taken as the basis of the calculation in the 1925 Act, had obviously suffered an enlargement and would now have to be raised to .9 of a penny.  The position then was stated to be that if a sale of 138,000,000 units could be secured at .9 of a penny, we would have secured the all important sum of £500,000, which would meet all the Shannon construction expenses, interest on advances, repayment of capital and so on.  That was the Shannon Bill proper.  There was an Electricity Supply Act which dealt with distribution as apart from generation and long distance transmission.  I want to go in more detail into the provisions of that Act.  Under that Act a sum of money was voted&mdash;two and a half million pounds.  It was voted to the Board to enable them to carry out all the purposes that were stated in the 1927 Act.  It was the sum that was estimated to be the proper sum to enable them to carry out all the obligations imposed on them under the 1927 Act.  They were to carry out all distribution, where it meant new net works to build new net works, and where there were old works to take them over, and if they were privately owned to take them over at a fair valuation, which in default of agreement was to be decided by an arbitrator, and to reconstruct such old net works as had to be reconstructed. It enabled them, or it was supposed to enable them, to have money free for house wiring, for the purchase of appliances for sale, for the provision of show-rooms, to engage in manufacture and to meet their own management and office expenses&mdash;that and the revenue they would derive as they went along.</P>
    <P>The sum of money, as I say, was £2,500,000.  Based on that sum, the scheme of the 1927 Act was this: A board was set up, a board which was declared to be independent from day to day inquisition either in Parliament or elsewhere.  The consideration&mdash;and I stated that several times during the course of the debate on the 1927 Act&mdash; for this great freedom which the board was to be given was that there should <Col N="1631" /> be the fullest publicity possible of all their activities and, in particular, that there should be special publicity with regard to their accounts.  The Dáil decided that there were certain accounts which must be produced. They detailed those.  They said: These must be brought forward with regard to the Board's activities in a certain year.  They said further that there might be produced such other statistics and returns as the Minister for Industry and Commerce thought fit, under a certain section, to demand. There was independence balanced by publicity and particularly by publicity on the financial side.</P>
    <P>The Board was to have a maximum term of appointment of five years. In the clause establishing them, there was a sub-section to say that the members of the Board were subject to removal at any time by the Executive Council if in their opinion the effective and economic performance of the functions of the Board rendered dismissal necessary.  Again, counter to that, was the fact that, if a dismissal took place, a statement of that fact and the reason for it had to be put before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>There are several sections which dealt with the accounts.  Section 7 is the main section dealing with these. Section 32 is the section to which I have referred already, the section which ordained that an annual report must be made, and which also gives the Minister power to demand certain statistical and other returns as he may require them, and to publish these if he thinks fit to demand them.  The Board were given £2,500,000, but they were not given any borrowing powers. They were limited to the sum of money set down, that is, £2,500,000 and this was to be advanced in certain instalments&mdash;or at least not more than a certain amount of it would be claimed in half yearly instalments. The interest was to be paid on each advance as made, but repayments of advances, that is to say, sinking fund arrangements, were not to begin until after the appointed day.  The appointed day was to be the end of the <Col N="1632" /> year 1932, or such later day as might under stated conditions be determined. The Act looked to an appointed day, unless otherwise determined, of the 1st January, 1933.  Interest on anything given to the Board had to be paid running from the date upon which each particular advance was made.  Repayments of capital were not to start until after the first of the new year, 1933.  Similar conditions held with regard to the Shannon Works, and the moneys involved in them as and when they were handed over to the Board.  As each piece of the Shannon Works, representing a certain capital sum, came into the hands of the Board interest began to run on from that date.  Repayment did not start till after the appointed day.</P>
    <P>The Board was given a direction as to its operations under the Act&mdash;rather it was given an order as to its operations on the finance side.  Section 21 detailed the system of charges that were to be made.</P>
    <P>The first sub-section laid down that the charges must be such before the appointed day as would conduce after the appointed day to certain conditions being met.  These are detailed in sub-section (2) of Section 21.  That sub-section provides that charges for electricity, goods or services, should be</P>
    <P>&ldquo;fixed at such rates and at such scales that the revenue derived in any year by the Board from such sales and services together with its revenue (if any) in such year from other sources will be sufficient, and only sufficient (as nearly as may be) to pay all salaries, working expenses, and other outgoings of the Board properly chargeable to income in that year (including the payments falling to be made in such year by the Board to the Minister for Finance in respect of interest and sinking fund, payments on advances out of the Central Fund), and such sums as the Board may think proper to set aside in that year for reserve fund, extensions, renewals, depreciation, loans, and other like purposes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later sections gave power to the <Col N="1633" /> Board to acquire existing undertakings. Section 39 details the process and the results of acquisition of authorised undertakings.  Authorised undertakings were distinguished into two types, authorised municipal undertakings and authorised private undertakings.  As far as an authorised private undertaking was concerned the Board might make a vesting order, and after certain formalities that are detailed had been attended to, a fair value was determined, fixed by a certain process, if not by agreement.  On becoming possessed of such property under the order the Board had to set aside the determined sum.  In regard to municipal undertakings the Board had power to take these over.  There did not vest in the Board the liabilities of the previous undertaking, but the Board under Section 39 of the Act was bound to indemnify and keep indemnified the undertakers against all undischarged liabilities, borrowings, etc., previously made for the purposes of the undertaking.</P>
    <P>That is, more or less, the scheme of the 1927 Act.  I would like to summarise it.  There was to be set up a Board, independent but subject to removal. The Board was bound to publicity, especially in regard to its finances.  It was bound to the production of certain specified accounts. It was bound further to produce, at the request of the Minister, certain statistical reports.  These were to be published under certain circumstances. The Board was bound to take over all the undischarged liabilities of authorised municipal undertakings on condition of indemnification and was bound to set aside a sum of money equal to the fair assessed value of privately-owned authorised undertakings. The Board was bound up by the limitation of the sum of two and a half million pounds given to it.  It had no borrowing powers given to it, and therefore it had no borrowing powers under the law.  It was given an instruction that its charges must be such as to conduce to meet all the things I have detailed: salaries, working expenses, interest, <Col N="1634" /> sinking fund, reserves, extensions, renewals, depreciation and so forth.  It was clear from that, I think, that the indication that Parliament gave to the Board was that it must run the scheme on the basis of supplying people at cost, but at a cost which had to include all the items that are specified in the particular section to which I have referred. The costs were certainly to include these items after the appointed day and before the appointed day the charges must be such as to conduce to these expenses being met afterwards.</P>
    <P>There may be inquiry made as to how this sum of two and a half million pounds was arrived at.  There were many checks put on that sum when it was first considered.  I mentioned on the Second Reading of the 1927 legislation that certain groups outside this country had shown a tendency to come in here with a view to securing the service of electricity in the country, and that one group in particular had advanced to the point of making very detailed calculations as to the amount of capital that would be required for purposes similar to those that were afterwards incorporated in the electricity supply legislation.  I had that particular financial statement in my possession and discussed it with a person who afterwards became a member of the Board.  I had from him memoranda prepared on various points which indicated that for all the purposes set out in the legislation the sum of two and a half million pounds should have been not merely sufficient, but amply sufficient, to meet all that the Board had to do.  I had, in addition, material for a further test which was applied at that time.  I had before me the capital accounts of a great many undertakings in many parts of the world, and from those it was clear that the ordinary disposal of capital was almost in equal one-thirds as between generation, transmission and distribution. As we had previously set out a very carefully considered and expertly advised scheme to provide £5,200,000 for generation and transmission, our next calculation was that the sum of two and a half million pounds should be taking it as a rough figure, a proper sum for the purpose set out in <Col N="1635" /> the 1925 Act.  That was the legislation, and that was the sum of money. These were the directions that to my mind the Oireachtas gave to the Board to be appointed, with regard to this duty.</P>
    <P>The Board was in due course appointed. I found myself at a very early stage in the Board's life faced with the question of what exactly was my responsibility for the Board, and if I had any responsibility at all how was it going to be exercised.  There was the section in the Act, to which I have already referred, giving the Executive Council power to dismiss, in the interests of the effective and economic performance of the duties of the Board, any member or all the members of the Board.  It seemed to me that where power to dismiss was given, in other words power to decide when the interests of the effective and economic performance of their functions by the Board demanded certain people's dismissal it was part of some Minister's duty and his right to satisfy himself as to the effective and economic performance of their duty by these people.</P>
    <P>There was an accidental circumstance which happened at that time and which drew me into very close contact with the Board.  The construction works were not complete.  There were certain works which I was still carrying out and was clearly bound to carry out under the 1925 Act.  I had contractors on the scene for the purpose of carrying out these works.  It was represented to me that there were certain other works which the Board required and which could most effectively be carried out by my contractors with the plant that was on the spot at the time and under the expert supervision of my contractors and my own engineering staff.  The Board put it to me that acting for the Board on an agency basis I should get my contractors to undertake specified work for the Electricity Supply Board.  That led to a certain amount of investigation as to what these works were and to the type of control to which I was myself properly subjected on the construction of the works.  Consequently I had to exercise a limited supervision <Col N="1636" /> over the works which the Electricity Supply Board requested my Department to have carried out for it.</P>
    <P>In that way I was thrown into certain touch with the Electricity Supply Board, probably closer touch than I would have insisted on having if I was merely operating the section which gave me power to dismiss.  But, let me repeat.  Nevertheless, I hold that under the 1927 Act unless the power to dismiss was only an empty threat, then the people who might have to use that power in certain circumstances must have some right of investigating how the affairs of the Board were going.</P>
    <P>At a very early stage in the Board's career, I sent letters to them stating that the construction works had got to a certain point, that the finances of the construction works to that point were amounting to a certain figure, pointing out that the final cost of electricity depended, not merely on the cost of generation and transmission, but the cost of distribution, and asking for an assurance that they were optimistic&mdash; no further than that&mdash;that they could, within the limits of the money granted by the Oireachtas, carry out all the work put upon them in such a way that at the experts' price sufficient units were likely to be sold as would recoup the money expended on the whole scheme and meet all necessary outgoings. I got very little satisfaction from the early letters.  I did not expect a great deal of satisfaction then from letters written at the end of 1928, but in the course of correspondence that followed one fact clearly emerged, and that was that the Board felt that the sum of two and a half millions which they were entitled to demand from the Minister for Finance did not include any undischarged obligations that they took over from municipal undertakings.  I had some conferences and wrote some letters on that point.  In the conferences I pointed out that the undischarged liabilities were clearly in the sum which the foreign concern had decided to expend if it were allowed to electrify the country, and as that was the basis of our calculation, the undischarged liabilities were clearly intended to be within the sum put at the <Col N="1637" /> disposal of the Board.  I argued that the undischarged liabilities, whatever they might be at the date of the vesting of the municipal undertakings in the Board, must be subtracted from the two and a half millions, and that the residue was what the Board might demand.</P>
    <P>I got a statement from the Board at one time which showed a certain expenditure to that date and certain commitments beyond that date, and when I added the undischarged liabilities as estimated by me&mdash;for I had no precise knowledge of them&mdash;I found that the total sum had gone substantially higher than two and a half millions.  A letter was again sent calling attention to what we felt was the intention of the Oireachtas with regard to this, but, nevertheless, asking if they could show us that this money could be remunerated.  I stress this latter point as the main demand ordinarily made by us.  In conversations or correspondence I had with members of the Board I frequently said or implied that once any stage of the Shannon had been completed in such a way that the accounts could show that it was financially sound, it would be an easy matter to get money for further development.  I instanced the type of Bill that is brought frequently here with regard to the Telephone Capital Account and said there might be debates as to whether or not the telephone system was properly functioning but there was no hesitation in granting further moneys, because people knew where they were under that particular system.</P>
    <P>My endeavour was to get some stage of the Shannon completed and its finances rounded off, showing the units being sold, the price at which they were being sold, the money that had to be remunerated, capital spent on it and all other charges met. As soon as that was shown it would be easy to provide further money for development.  Although I raised the undischarged liabilities point at the very beginning, the moment I heard that undischarged liabilities were not regarded as being in the two and <Col N="1638" /> a half millions, nevertheless, I wrote to the Board asking it to show how this capital sum of two and a half millions, plus the surplus which I saw they had announced they were likely to require, was likely to be remunerated, the basis upon which the calculation that it would be remunerated rested.  Again, I got no satisfaction on that point.</P>
    <P>Eventually I took the opportunity offered by the introduction of a Bill in 1929.  I had previously written to the Board to say that if the two and a half millions was not clearly to be read as including undischarged liabilities on acquired undertakings, then I would put that clearly into the Bill and go with it to the Dáil.  I felt that that was the only thing that could be done. Deputies who were here at the time will have to search their memories for these debates, but I certainly was under the impression that I had left the House under the impression that the two and a half millions was the full capital sum the Board would have to remunerate, that it was inclusive of the undischarged liabilities, and that they certainly had not two and a half millions, in addition to the other sums.  I argued to myself that that was clear and I used this argument to others to demonstrate to them our clear intention.  What was the good of imposing finance restrictions, and not giving borrowing powers if the Board had this way of easing its financial position, that they could as controllers of authorised undertakers, and they had power to control, make these undertakers incur certain expenditure prior to being formally acquired, regard that fresh expenditure as an undischarged liability, and so free a larger amount of the two and a half millions for their own building expenses?  Finally, arguments not having been much good, I brought in my 1929 Bill.  I called the Board together and told them that I was going to insist on moving two amendments.  One was a clause making it quite clear that the two and a half millions did include undischarged liabilities, and the other was that in Section 12 (1), which says: &ldquo;the Minister for Finance shall advance&rdquo; I was <Col N="1639" /> going to put in the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and by this change have a definite declaration in the Bill that until the construction period was over, as long as there was overlapping, and as long as I had certain contact with the Board's operations, I was clearly faced with responsibility. The Board met me under these circumstances and made an appeal to me not to put in the two amendments.  They gave a written guarantee that they would scale down their expenditure so as to keep within the two and a half millions, minus the undischarged liability of the acquired undertakings. They made certain arrangements with regard to liaison, so as to keep a better flow of information between my Department and the Board, and on these two guarantees being given, I agreed not to bring in these amendments to the 1929 Act.</P>
    <P>That meeting was held in the beginning of July, 1929, and the agreement was reduced to writing in August of that year.  After that, operating on the new liaison arrangements, I asked again for certain information.  The information I asked then and later can nearly all the time be summed up in the request put in letters during August or September, 1929, to this effect, that we wanted an assurance that the Board could, within the moneys given to them by the Oireachtas, carry out all the work put upon them, and that they could do that in such a way that the charges they would fix would remunerate all the capital put into it, and enable them to pay all the other expenses set out in the Act.  Always we persisted in this, that we wanted a clear picture of their finances.  Letters passed and certain information was given&mdash;certain very incomplete and unsatisfactory information was given. Finally, making a calculation from figures put before me in a letter in the early part of 1930, I issued a letter stating that in my opinion the Board had definitely gone beyond the sum of money which they had agreed was at their disposal.  In the month of April, 1930, I had a letter from the Board proving&mdash;at least the letter began by saying that the purpose of the letter was to show that the Board <Col N="1640" /> had kept within the bounds of the two and a half million pounds, minus the undischarged liability.  In the month of June, 1930, the Board made another approach to me, stating that they felt that they could not any longer keep within that limit unless they were to close down abruptly on certain schemes, and they felt that a sudden stoppage would cause wastage, and they asked that they should be relieved from any agreement they had given.  I think somewhere about a month later they advanced to a further point, not so much that they could not any longer keep to their agreement, but that they had not kept to the agreement.  Later I got a letter which announced to me that it was then clear that in December, 1929, the Board had passed the limits of the expenditure sanctioned&mdash;that at least in January, 1930, they had gone beyond the limits of the money that was allowed to them.</P>

      <P>I think that also was a June letter.  I shall get the date afterwards if it is material.  I still persisted in my inquiries.  The agreement was there and talk as to whether the agreement was kept or was broken was, while important, relatively a secondary matter.  The main thing that had to be determined was in what state were the accounts of the Board; how was consumption going; what relation did consumption and charges bear to expenditure; how far were the Board's operations likely to remunerate all the capital that had been involved?  In the autumn of 1930 under the section which gives me the right to demand certain things, Section 31, I demanded certain statistics and returns and demanded further that if I could not get these statistics and returns at once I would be told the precise date by which they would guarantee to let me have these things.  I might say that I have not got these returns yet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

      <P>Section 31 the Minister says.  Is it not Section 32?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Section 32 is the one under which the annual reports <Col N="1641" /> and returns may be demanded. I have not yet got the returns I then demanded.  That is why I said at the beginning that I have less satisfaction in coming to the House with a proposal such as is before it now than I had with any proposal that I ever had to introduce, because I am without the financial information that I should have upon which to base a demand for more money for the Board.  But this, at any rate, I can state as clearly revealed to me: that there was a sum of £2,500,000 voted by the Oireachtas; that the Board agreed that that sum should be regarded as including undischarged liabilities of acquired undertakings; that these amounts came to a sum of about £800,000 at the date of their vesting in the Board, and that, therefore, there should have been given to the Board under the agreement £2,500,000, minus £800,000; that the Board have in fact got more than that money; that they have in fact spent more than the amount of the advances actually made to them, and that they have in fact committed themselves to an expenditure of at least a quarter of a million beyond that again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It became clear, apart from the agreement altogether, as this correspondence drifted on, that the whole accounts system of the Board must be very incomplete.  Financial information could not be supplied as it was demanded, nor could it be supplied months later.  In probing around for the reasons I found that the Board had been operating a particular policy.  It is quite clear now that that policy was wrong.  I do not know what judgment I would pass on that policy if I had been a member of the Board at a particular time and had been asked to decide upon the policy.  But it is quite clear that the policy which the Board adopted right from the start was that they must get revenue speedily without having before them any statement of the expenditure necessary to get that revenue, and therefore not having taken into their consideration the actual money that they were expending at any time.  They had not got these details, or if they had, they have withheld them from me for a period <Col N="1642" /> extending over a year.  The Board were going on that policy apparently, whereas the policy laid down in the Act is clearly a different one.  It is that they should make their charges in such a way before the appointed day as to conduce to certain things arising after the appointed day, and that was that they should meet, but only just meet, all the things set out in that particular section.  Instead of that, the Board operated another policy.  The result of that policy was, as I say, that they made capital commitments without previously considering what was going to be the remuneration of that money or how that money was going to be remunerated, if at all.</P>
    <P>There is a further point.  It appears in the course of the later stages of this long drawn-out correspondence that the Board felt that the first scheme, the partial development of the Shannon, had been exploited, that they had committed themselves to something beyond that; that they required the provision of money for certain extensions; that, in fact, they had done what I have said was not in the mind of the Oireachtas at all when the measure was being passed.  They had gone on to a new scheme without giving the Minister concerned, the Executive Council or the Parliament an opportunity of deciding whether or not that new scheme should be gone on with.  The Board declared that their policy, such as it was, and whatever I may imagine it to be, was in their minds the proper policy and they seemed to me to indicate in a very definite way that that policy being approved of by them was the policy which would be pursued in future.  In these circumstances I was told that further money was required for certain extensions and certain stand-by arrangements.  If I had granted the money requested in the circumstances I have detailed I would be granting it with the whole history of the Board revealed to me over a couple of years and on a more or less definite statement of policy of a type which was definitely to my mind not what the Oireachtas intended them to have.  In these circumstances, when certain resignations <Col N="1643" /> were offered, I asked that they should be accepted and they were accepted. The position we find ourselves in at the moment is that if we count the undischarged liabilities in the sum of money which the Oireachtas put at the disposal of the Board, the Board have overspent by a sum of about £600,000 and they have committed themselves, I cannot say whether it is inextricably, but I am afraid it is, to the extent at least of another quarter of a million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

      <P>Perhaps the Deputy will listen to me.  If we take the two and a half million pounds as including the undischarged liabilities, and if we subtract the sum of those from the two and a half million pounds, there ought to have been disbursements of a certain figure.  There have, in fact, been disbursements of £300,000 in excess.  When I tot up the excess and other things I find that the Board have overspent by £600,000 and committed themselves to an expenditure of about a quarter of a million more.</P>

      <P>Counting in the undischarged liabilities, yes.  That is what I want to say at the moment on the question of resignation of certain members <Col N="1644" /> of the Board.  As to the part-time members and our attitude to the part-time members, it is this: The Executive Council has re-appointed the three part-time representatives for a period of six months from a date in April last.  We want that six months period or the portion of it now left in order to discuss with them from their inner knowledge of the Board what is the proper scheme to have of part-time representation or if part-time representation on such a Board is a proper system at all.  Personally I am strongly in favour of having the business point of view represented upon the Board.  I feel that a scheme can be worked in which part-time representatives of a business type can pull their weight on a Board, but there has to be made for the future some definite relationship which is not there at present as between their power on the Board and their strength to modify the affairs of the Board and the responsibility they will carry if and when the affairs of the Board go wrong.  That has not been determined yet; and as I regard the whole plan of the Electricity Supply Board as not merely a good thing for electrical development but a very good experiment of a sociological type, I want to have it better argued out before I can come to a final scheme.  The part-time members remain on for a limited tenure.  But as far as I am concerned that is for the purpose of enabling me to get certain discussions with them on their inner knowledge of what has happened, and to relate all that to the future to see what should be their authority and equally their responsibility as things go right or wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask in these circumstances with great hesitation for the sum of money set out in the Bill, that is the sum of two millions, some of which is required, of course, to meet what I call the over expenditure plus what I think are the inevitable commitments. In regard to the rest, I asked the Board, after certain resignations had been accepted, to make out for me as speedily as they could and as accurately as they could a statement of their requirements over a reasonable period.  I pointed out to them when talking about the period that the <Col N="1645" /> scheme was more or less at a transition period now; that there might have to be a considerable amount of discussion and Parliamentary drafting of new legislation was required, and so I asked them to give me a statement that would cover and amply cover what they thought they would require over a reasonable period.  I emphasised that there might be delays in getting before the Dáil again.</P>
    <P>I ask that this sum of money should be put, not at the disposal of the Board, as heretofore, not subject to demand in certain half-yearly instalments from the Minister for Finance, to which the Minister must respond by giving the money, but I ask that it should be more or less put at my own disposal for the Board.  I ask that this money shall be given out as the Minister for Industry and Commerce shall from time to time certify it to be reasonably and properly required.  If I am asked does that mean that I have decided upon a complete change in the whole scheme of the Electricity Supply Act, I want to answer very definitely no! But I want to relate the change now suggested and the circumstances of the suggestion to circumstances in which that sum of two and a half million pounds was previously voted.  Previously we had a good idea of the Board's duties though we might be conjecturing on certain points.  We knew the field they had to cover, and we had two or three outside minds working on the same problem, and we saw what they had decided as the amount of capital they required to sink for the purpose of the Act if they got possession of the electrical supply of the country. Therefore we had some data on which to go when we decided that a sum of two and a half million was required for the purposes of the Board.  At this time with regard to the future we have practically none.  I cannot say that I am satisfied with regard to any of this money, but I want to say that I shall have to be satisfied before any of the money will go to the Board.  This is the only plan I can think of at this moment.  There must be money at somebody's disposal for the purposes of the Board.  We cannot leave it as it was under the old Act, that the <Col N="1646" /> Board could demand it at will and it must be given, because we have no clear evidence of their programme and no basis on which to form our own judgment as to whether or not that programme is good and sufficient and likely to be a remunerative one.  This puts a responsibility on me which I am very loath to take.  I was very happy under the Act of 1927, because to a certain extent, though not completely, I had shed my responsibility for what the Board did.  I think it would be fatal to the whole electrical development of the country if the Minister was to become so far associated with the Electricity Supply Board as, say, the representative of the Government is with the Post Office.  I do not want that situation with regard to the Board.  All I do want is that now, not having the material available for a decision as I had when the previous sum of two and a half million was voted, I shall be able to demand that material for certain blocks of this money as and when people come and demand it from me.  As I do not want this responsibility, as, indeed, I want to shirk that responsibility, the House can take it from me that the moment I do get sufficient justification for a block sum I am coming again to the House to rechange to the old scheme, and that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or the Minister for Finance will have no responsibility in the matter other than the responsibility the Ministers concerned have in the matter of the appointment of the Board, and I should add such other responsibility as arises from the fact that they are entitled to dismiss in certain circumstances, and, I argue from that, entitled to supervise to a certain limited extent for the purpose of ascertaining if and when dismissals should take place.</P>
    <P>I am asking that the House should assent to Section 4: &ldquo;As soon as may be after the passing of this Act, the Board shall pay to Thomas A.  MacLaughlin, lately a member of the Board, a sum of two thousand pounds.&rdquo; I ask for the money for certain reasons, and mainly for this: Dr. MacLaughlin brought the Shannon scheme here, and brought it here at a time when the tendency in electrical development was <Col N="1647" /> in another way, in a way that if it had been allowed to proceed would have stopped national electrical development for centuries. He therefore did this country a great service by turning it to a scheme which meant a national instead of a local scheme, and a local scheme of such a type that it would, by absorbing the biggest number of available consumers have stopped for many a year all possibility of a national development of electricity.  By reason of the fact that he was the author of the scheme, and by reason of the very great industry he showed in it, and the tremendous amount of energy and enthusiasm he put into its promotion, and the great amount of hard work he put into its development since its inception, I ask that we do now what an ordinary business firm would do.</P>
    <P>He has followed a policy which I put to the House was wrong, but it was a policy which was honestly taken up. An ordinary commercial undertaking would allow a man in such a position who left their employment at least a year in which to look around for other work, and would finance him accordingly, and we want in this case to pay a sum of money which would be equal to a year's pay if he had remained on in the services of the Board.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: That the Bill be read a Second Time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult for the members of the Dáil not possessing the inside information of the Minister to discuss the Bill that is before us on the statement we have just heard. For the majority of the members of the House and the general public the Press announcement of the acceptance of the resignation of Dr. MacLaughlin was the first intimation of any differences between the Minister or Executive Council and the Electricity Supply Board.  Up to that time such statements as had been made by the Minister, both in this House and outside it, led us to believe that satisfactory progress was being made with the Shannon scheme in all directions and that no cause of friction of any sort existed.  The Minister <Col N="1648" /> has now made a statement which would seem to show that differences and causes of friction existed between his Department and the Board from the beginning of 1929 onwards.  We have heard the history of these differences for the first time.  They reveal a situation which, I am sure, will cause considerable uneasiness in the minds of Deputies because they seem to show that the causes which have produced the necessity for this demand for £2,000,000 are of long standing and might have been eradicated if the Minister had taken action earlier.</P>
      <P>The Minister dealt at length with the whole history of the Shannon scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will remember that when the scheme was first brought to the House they were given to understand that its cost would be limited to the figure of £5,210,000 in respect of the generation and transmission sides. That figure was exceeded.  The Minister came to the House in 1929 and got the amount which he was entitled to spend on generation and transmission increased by, approximately, £600,000. Even then, however, the Minister quite clearly gave the House to understand that the £2,500,000 provided for the Board plus the additional £156,000 secured in 1929 was adequate, and more than adequate, to meet all the expenditure likely to arise upon the distribution side. Deputies will even remember that as late as the middle of last year when the 1930 Act was under discussion here and an amendment was introduced by Deputy Fahy, which, if passed, would have had the effect of increasing that £2,500,000 by a half million pounds, the Minister vigorously opposed the amendment and stated definitely that there was no reason to believe that the two and a half millions voted in 1927 would prove inadequate to enable the Board to meet the duties and functions imposed on it by the Act of 1927.  Now we are informed that long before the introduction of that 1930 Act the Minister had grave doubts as to whether the sum provided would be adequate and that before the 1929 Act was introduced here he had a conference with the Board on these matters, a conference which resulted <Col N="1649" /> in a certain agreement which was broken, according to the Minister, in December, 1929, or in January, 1930. Certainly it was broken long before the 1930 Act was introduced.</P>
    <P>In the statement made by the President to the Deputies here when the first announcement of the dissensions between the Executive Council and the Board was made, the point that struck many members of this House, and many members of the general public, and which the Minister has not answered, is this: It was stated that the differences of opinion on major matters of policy had existed for a long period between the Executive Council and the Managing Director. The Minister has detailed the differences which existed between the Executive Council and the Board.  The point to which I wish to refer is this: how did it come that the Managing Director had dealings with the Executive Council other than through the Board?  Were not the whole Board responsible for the policy of the Board? Should not the resignation of the Managing Director have been accompanied by the resignation of the other members? The fact that only two members resigned and that the other members continued in office would seem to suggest that the Executive Council, or the Minister for Industry and Commerce, was having discussions on matters of policy with individual members of the Board and not with the Board as a whole.  Such practices would seem to be very undesirable indeed.</P>

      <P>&mdash;to understand what the Minister's position is.  He has given us a detailed statement of his dealings with the Board which would seem to show that in his opinion the direction of the affairs of the Shannon scheme by that Board was most unsatisfactory. It had embarked upon a wrong policy.  It had broken agreements made with him.  It had been unsatisfactory in the manner in which it kept its accounts.  It had failed to furnish information which it was obliged by statute to furnish.  Despite all these facts, the Minister apparently is taking up the position that if members of the Board had not resigned he would have allowed them to continue in office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to find out what the Minister's position is. As far as I can understand it now, he has been forced to come to the Dáil with this Bill, and to undertake the reorganisation of the Board, not because the affairs of the Board were going wrong, but because certain members resigned.  Their resignation concentrated attention upon the mismanagement that existed, but if they had not resigned he would not have dismissed them, and this reorganisation could not have taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will explain myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Board was established, as the Minister stated, an independent body, absolutely free from control by the Executive Council. This Dáil gave them certain statutory powers and charged them with the <Col N="1652" /> responsibility of running the Shannon scheme in such a manner that the revenue from the sale of electricity would meet all the charges specified in the Act, the payment of interest, the repayment of capital, maintenance of the works and charges of that kind. Despite the declared independence of the Board, behind which the Minister always sheltered when its activities were criticised in this House, it appears that quite early in 1927 the Minister was inclined to interfere with its activities.  He found that a section of the Act gave him power to dismiss members in certain circumstances. He interpreted that section to mean that he was entitled at all times to be informed as to the activities of the Board and of its policy, so that he would be in a position to say whether or not the situation had arisen or was likely to arise which would necessitate the use of his powers of dismissal.  It is, I think, and the Minister has admitted it, most desirable that a Board of this kind should be independent of political control, yet it appears to me that it was from the time that the Minister attempted to exercise that supervision over the affairs of the Board that friction arose, friction which has continued since.  The Minister is now proposing, though deploring the fact, to destroy the independence of the Board, at any rate, for a period.  The Board which is given this two million pounds on the condition that it could not secure it unless the Minister is satisfied as to the purpose for which it is being expended could not be described as an independent Board.  In future the Board will be directly subject to the control of the Minister in all matters relating to policy and administration. Is not that so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the Board will not be able to procure any part of that money until it has submitted its plans to the Minister and got the Minister's approval would indicate to any ordinary commonsense individual that it could not be described as independent. The Board may not have <Col N="1653" /> been independent heretofore.  It certainly will not be independent if this Bill is passed.  The future decisions upon its policy will be made directly by the Minister, on the advice no doubt and with the assistance of the Board.  But the final authority on all matters of policy and administration will be the Minister.  Does the Minister think that that is likely to produce fewer causes of friction in the future than appear to have existed in the past?</P>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister told us the whole story concerning these causes of friction.  The Board appears to have embarked upon a very widespread policy at the beginning and to have embarked upon it vigorously. The Minister told us that its policy, no matter how widespread it was or how vigorously embarked upon it may have been, could have been carried out within the financial limits of the 1927 Act, but those financial limits were originally devised by the Minister and not by the Board.  The original limit of £2,500,000 was fixed by the Minister.  He gave the data upon which it was fixed.  It may have been right.  It may have been wrong.  It is quite possible that any Board in the circumstances in which this Board found itself, endeavouring to fulfil all its functions within the Act, could not have done so within that limit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear about that at all.  There may have been disagreement as to the legal significance of the wording of the 1927 Act as to whether or not undischarged liabilities of the acquired municipal undertakings were properly chargeable against the amount provided for the Board under the 1927 Act, in which event obviously the Board appeared to have acted correctly <Col N="1654" /> in the manner in which it dealt with the situation.  If it is clear from the wording of the Act that these undischarged liabilities were properly chargeable against the two and a half million pounds, then the Board's duty was obviously to bring that fact to the attention of the Minister as early as possible, and the Minister has informed us that they did bring that to his notice before the 1929 Act was introduced.</P>

      <P>The Minister informed the Dáil that before the 1929 Act was introduced he had concluded that the Board must, on the programme it was then following, exceed that limit, taking into account the undischarged liabilities of the acquired undertakings.  He stated that while that Act was before the Dáil he had a conference with the Board in which he said that he was going to introduce two amendments unless he got from them an undertaking that they would reduce their expenditure, so that the total of that expenditure with the total of the undischarged liabilities would amount to two and one-half million pounds.  He got that undertaking: he states that it was broken, that subsequently he got a letter from the Board stating that it would be impossible to keep to its undertaking and asking to be released from it after, in fact, it had broken the undertaking.  The position was that after the 1929 Act was introduced the Minister knew that the Board had either to abandon its original programme or exceed the limits fixed by the 1929 Act.</P>

      <P>These are the Minister's words: Before the 1929 Act was introduced he wrote to the Board asking them for an assurance that all the work could be carried out under the financial provisions and got little satisfaction.  One fact emerged, namely, that the Board held that the two and a half millions did not include the undischarged obligation of the undertakings taken over.  He got no satisfaction when he asked the Board whether the financial provisions could be adhered to, and he knew then that it was the Board's opinion that these undischarged liabilities of acquired undertakings were not chargeable against the two and a half million pounds.  He then came to the Dáil and said that under no circumstances was there any possibility of the total expenditure of the Shannon scheme exceeding five million eight hundred thousand pounds plus two million five hundred thousand pounds plus one hundred and fifty-six thousand pounds.  He said there might be variations, in other words, the charges which were originally intended to be brought against one item would be put against another but under no circumstances would the gross total be exceeded.  It has been exceeded.  The Minister said that although he knew that the Board could not carry out its programme within the financial limits and at the same time meet its undischarged liabilities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

      <P>The Minister has just stated that the Board wrote to him in April, 1930, that it had kept within the limits of the agreement made when the 1929 Act was before the Dáil.  In his original statement he stated that in that month and in that year the Board wrote to him to the effect that <Col N="1656" /> it could not keep within the limits and asked to be released from the agreements made when the 1929 Act was being discussed here.  We are anxious to get the whole facts clear; it is necessary to wander from point to point because we have been given a whole lot of information concerning the Shannon Board and its activities which we have not had an opportunity of getting before.  The Minister must remember that Deputies are dependent on the meagre information given in the daily press.  We have not even accounts of the Board for the financial year 1929/30 much less for the year 1930/31.  We are completely in the dark as to what it has been doing. We are anxious to find out how the necessity of providing another two million and adding that two millions to the cost of the Shannon scheme has arisen.  The Minister might have gone into that at greater length than he did.</P>
      <P>He said as far as he has been able to discover the Board has overspent to the amount of £600,000 and that it has entered into liabilities amounting to a quarter of a million pounds and that if we add those figures on to the original two million five hundred thousand pounds we get a total of what it has been responsible for, taking into account the undischarged liabilities of the undertaking, but the Minister has not accounted for the balance of the two million pounds.</P>

      <P>The Minister must.  The Minister came to this House in June, 1930, that is twelve months ago, stating that he could see no necessity whatever for increasing the £2,500,000 which had been given to the Board by the 1927 Act.  When a proposal was made here to increase that amount he opposed it.  He stated that all the factors in the situation had been taken into account when the original estimate was made, and that in that month, June, 1930, he was satisfied that the two and a half millions would be adequate to meet all the expenses of the Board, including those statutory undertakings. Now he comes and asks for two <Col N="1657" /> millions more.  That is a large sum of which he can account for only £850,000.  What is the balance going to be spent on if the original two and a half millions was sufficient to meet the cost of all the activities of the Board?</P>

      <P>To carry out all the functions placed on the Board by the 1927 Act.  The members of the Board whom the Minister considers unsatisfactory are gone.  We are going to get a new Board at the end of a few months.  Under what circumstances can that Board be called upon to spend a sum of money equal to half the total granted in 1927 to meet all the activities of the Board? The Minister is not treating the Dáil fairly in the attitude he is taking. £2,500,000 was estimated in 1927 to meet all the expenses of the Board from 1927 to the end of 1932.  That amount has been expended plus another £850,000 on something.  The distribution networks must have been erected or acquired or reorganised. The privately-owned undertakings have been acquired.  The wiring installation business has been established.  Showrooms have been procured.  Stocks have been purchased.

I think the Dáil ought to be slow to give this money, particularly in view of the financial history of the Shannon scheme.  Remember that Deputies, confined to the information which the Minister has given from time to time to the House, have only these facts to go on.  There was an estimate for £4,600,000 cost of construction at first.  The Minister said he had a binding estimate for that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In the year 1929 a sum of £5,800,000 was provided, increased by £156,000, which was to pay the accrued interest to date, decreased by £132,000 which was not chargeable against the scheme, because it went against navigation.  That was as far as the cost of the scheme was concerned. When the 1927 Act was going through a sum of £2,500,000 was granted to meet the cost of distribution and the other activities of the Board.  That has been exceeded.  It has been very considerably exceeded, as the Minister has just informed us. <Col N="1663" /> Now he comes and asks the Dáil to provide another £1,150,000 for purposes which he cannot detail, the necessity for which he does not know. It is to be given to him with power to expend it without any obligation on him to come to the Dáil for the purpose of getting approval for it. The Minister talked about new developments. What new developments is he going to undertake?  Have they any reference to statements which appeared in the Press with regard to the extension of the Shannon scheme? A considerable amount of uneasiness has been caused in the City of Limerick by these reports and the possible effect which the developments will have in regard to the trade of that city in the district served by the Shannon.  Are these the developments which the Minister has in mind, and if so, is he going ahead with them? What works are being undertaken and has the Board been consulted?  Is the idea of the Minister, before he advances the money, to insist on the Board coming into conformity with his wishes on the matter?  I certainly think the Dáil is entitled to much more detailed information than the Minister has chosen to give before the Bill can be passed?  There are two big issues involved.  The first is the provision of £2,000,000.  It is a big sum to be asked to pay in part for mismanagement and in part for purposes we do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, there is the issue of the independence of the Board which has been destroyed by this Bill.  Whether, in fact, the Board was really independent in the past we do not know.  We have reason to believe the contrary. The Minister has given foundation for that belief in the statement he made to-day, that he interpreted the section of the Act dealing with powers of dismissal as giving him the right to insist to be informed at all times concerning the progress and policy of the Board.  Can the House be told when it is likely that the overdue accounts of the Board will be published?  If the Minister is anxious to get the position rectified I suggest that he should confine himself to this extent, <Col N="1664" /> to ask the Dáil for the £850,000 which he says is essential, and suspend his request for the balance until the Dáil has been furnished with the accounts to which it is statutorily entitled.</P>
    <P>The Dáil was informed last week that these accounts have been submitted in a provisional form to the Government.  It may be a long time yet before they are ready.  In view of the unsatisfactory nature of the accounts for 1928-29, we think that before the House should agree to sanction such a large addition to the cost of the scheme the available financial information should be brought up to date, and in a form which would be considered satisfactory by the Dáil.  As Deputies will remember, the form of the accounts published for 1928-29 was not satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Statements have appeared in the Press that some of the friction which appears to have arisen between the Board and the Executive Council arose out of appointments made by the Board.  I would like if the Minister could inform us whether there is any truth in that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has stated repeatedly in the Dáil that the Board was at perfect liberty to employ whatever persons it wished, and that it had perfect independence and control over its own servants.  The Act setting up the Board provides that the Board is at liberty to avail of the machinery of the Local Appointments Commission if it so chooses.  It did not do that, but made its own appointments in its own way.  It promoted <Col N="1665" /> and dismissed officials according as it believed that course to be satisfactory or otherwise.  The Minister says that we cannot take it that no representations were made to the Board concerning the personnel of its staff, and at the same time he informs us that the question of the employment of the staff was not part of the cause of the friction which arose.  I think it is very unsatisfactory that the Dáil should be treated in this cavalier fashion.  What exactly was the position between the Executive Council and the Board in relation to the employment of staff?  The Minister cannot ignore the question.  It has been stated in quite a number of newspapers throughout the country that the prime cause of the resignation of the Managing Director was friction arising over the personnel of the staff.  That statement has been published and has not been denied. The Minister says in one breath that it is not true, and in the next breath he says that representations have been made by the Executive Council to the Board concerning the staff.  What exactly is the position?  Was the Board given absolute independence in that matter?</P>

In any case we are in the position that I think we are bound to refuse the Minister the two millions which he asks for on the information that he has given to the House.  The Government may have been justified in its attitude to the Board if the affairs of the Board were conducted in the manner which the Minister has stated. If the Minister has given us the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, there would be a strong case not merely for accepting the resignations but for utilising the power to which the Minister has adverted of dismissal in the case of other responsible members.  The fact, however, that such mismanagement has occurred in the past and may occur in the future is one strong reason why the Dáil should insist on getting the fullest possible information concerning what has happened and what is in contemplation before agreeing to the expenditure of any more money.  No one wants to delay the progress of the Shannon scheme.  If it can be shown that the money is essential for its progress, no Party in the Dáil will refuse to give it.  I submit that has not been shown.  The Minister has merely contented himself with the statement that he thinks it may be necessary.  For what purpose he does not know.  I do not think the Dáil should provide money on that basis.</P>

      <P>I am completely at sea over this whole business.  The Electricity Supply Board is a concern with a capital of two and a half million pounds.  Is it not absurd that after sixteen months they cannot produce any report for the twelve months ending March, 1930?  No business concern could carry on on those lines. What I want to find out is, who is responsible for that chaotic state of affairs?  Is it due to the inefficiency of the Board?  Why cannot they produce their accounts?  The Minister has not told us that.  We have got into the soup over this thing and I sympathise with the Minister because I think he has been let down by the Board.  The House is now asked to vote £850,000 to pay the debts of the Board.  I would also like to know <Col N="1667" /> from the Minister in connection with the money that we are asked to vote whether any member of the Board has submitted a programme to him or not. If the Minister can tell us who is responsible for the failure to produce the accounts I think the House should know that, too.  If Dr. MacLaughlin, the Managing Director, was responsible for telling the Minister that up to a certain stage two and a half million pounds was all that was necessary to carry out the programme of the Board, and if he was responsible for misleading the Minister to the extent of nearly a further million I fail to see why he should be remunerated for doing that.</P>

I do not want to take the line of saying that the Minister is as innocent as he pretends to be, or as ignorant of the Board's affairs as he tried to make out he is.  The Minister knows that before the first set of accounts came out there were doubts in the minds of many people as to the advisability of certain lines of action that had been taken by the Board, and also as to the benefits that would accrue to the Board as a result of their policy.  I asked for the production of the earlier accounts of the Electricity Supply Board half a dozen times.</P>

      <P>March, 1929, and also March, 1928.  It was very difficult to get these in the very early stages.  I do no know what the difficulty was. If the Minister had looked at the <Col N="1668" /> accounts as any member of the House did he would have found out at that time, and he should have taken the steps he has now taken, if the conditions were as they appeared to be from the accounts.  The Accountant to the Minister pointed that out in his very meagre report.  Dealing with the two and a half millions the Accountant stated that the Board appeared to be at sea with regard to stocks, accounts, and works in progress.  If the Minister read the accounts as any ordinary member of the community read them, if he was interested, as he must be, he could not possibly plead ignorance as he pleaded it in his speech, because letters appeared in the Press at that time from citizens of Dublin pointing out that the whole situation required to be looked into. The Minister spoke about the amount of money due as a result of taking over undertakings and their undischarged liabilities.  Take the case of Dublin. I understand that the undischarged liabilities on the Dublin plant are about £300,000.  The Dublin station was worth two millions and it showed a profit of £70,000 a year.  I think the Board would have been foolish when they had the powers if they did not take it over, although I resented and opposed their action in doing so.  The Minister was a party to that, but at the Chamber of Commerce he stood over all this confiscation of property without compensation.  In acquiring all the other undertakings he knew very well they had undischarged liabilities.</P>

      <P>The Minister cannot blame the Shannon Board because he created it.  Therefore the Minister cannot blame the Board.  It was his creation.  It is all very well to beat a man when he is down.  If the Board was up against great difficulties, and if there were differences of opinion which have resulted, as the Minister stated, in the person who thought out the Shannon scheme having to give up his public position, it is not fair to put all the responsibility on his shoulders, or on the shoulders of the Board.  The Minister had two civil servants attached to this Board for a considerable time, both of whom must have been reporting to him, because they were <i>au fait</i> with everything that was going on.  The Minister could have stepped in long since if he meant what he said. In the early days the Minister was not anxious to give this House any information beyond what was gleaned when the Minister thought it good policy to deal with the matter on public platforms in the interest of his Party. On public platforms, when the Shannon scheme was discussed, it was frequently stated if it had not been for the previous behaviour of Fianna Fáil there would have been a dozen Shannon schemes Perhaps it is just as well there is not&mdash;at any rate, until we get this one right.  I made a little report for myself about 12 months ago when the first accounts came out, and I am sure the Minister, who has very able civil servants at his disposal, knew the points that I would put to him.  I asked the Minister when he would set aside a day for discussion of the report of the Shannon Board.  He always refused to give it and, consequently, he deserves no sympathy from this House in his predicament.  If he had discussed the accounts 12 months ago we would have a better picture of the situation, and Deputy Murphy's questions would not be asked to-day about a scheme that everyone hoped would be a success.  The Minister was asked how much the Board owed.  They did not even know the amount of their stocks. <Col N="1670" /> I also pointed out that there was grave discontent on the part of traders who could not get paid their accounts by the Board.  I do not blame the Shannon Board.  I blame the Minister, because he refused to give them money for over nine months.  The Board had to carry on out of revenue while they were not selling the full development of the scheme.  If anyone is to blame for damaging the prestige of the Board and the country, because the Board was not able to pay, it is the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>Recently I asked when the last payment was made to the Board under the Act, and I was told that it was nine months ago.  How anyone could expect that Board to function under the difficulties that it was faced with I do not know.  How could it be expected to develop when the money to which it was entitled under the Act was denied it?  I asked a question recently about the accounts for the year ending March, 1930.  That is several months ago.  The Minister said that he had these accounts in hands since May but the House has not got them.  Deputies will probably recollect that on many occasions I had to fence with the Minister in asking him to present the accounts.  He always took up a supercilious and sarcastic attitude, as much as to say: &ldquo;I am the head bottle-washer and no one can get any information unless I desire to give it.&rdquo;  Now he comes along and repeats the provisions of the Act which say that this House must be furnished with the accounts. Still he refuses to give them.  When the Minister speaks of liabilities as the result of taking over other undertakings he puts the figure at £850,000. Are we to take it that it is the intention of the Minister to pay that amount immediately he gets the money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Minister does not need £850,000 for that purpose. Are we to take it that the interest has not been paid on these moneys to whoever holds the bonds, as in the <Col N="1671" /> case of the Dublin undertaking, and that only the interest will be paid? The Minister says that he wants £850,000 to discharge these liabilities, but when he is asked if he is going to pay them he says &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  Therefore the £1,150,000 is reduced by £850,000, so that all the Minister's requirements would be to pay off the immediate trade liabilities of the Board, and to give them sufficient to carry on development which should be in the neighbourhood of £300,000 to £400,000.</P>
      <P>We do not know what the Shannon Board owe to the Minister.  I think he hinted it was about £250,000.  The Minister says we are not going to discharge these liabilities.  Then what is the sense of asking for the money now? Why has not the Minister presented to the House the last accounts of the Board in view of the present demand? Why is he giving no information as to how far they have developed and what number of units they sell?  We had grand reports on the last occasion with pictures of transformer stations, and we were told about the amount of current.  What we want to know now is, apart from what we heard at the Rotary Club and street corner meetings during elections, how far has the scheme advanced, and what is the position to-day?  I may not be in agreement with members of my own Party on this, or with the House, but when the Shannon scheme was started the development that I would like to have seen was the getting of customers for electricity who had not hitherto been using it.  Instead of that they grabbed all they could in the shape of existing plant.  They took over the Rathmines plant and the Pembroke plant, thus committing themselves immediately, in order that Shannon current would be used, to replacing every implement, every piece of machinery, every motor, every wireless apparatus, and even every vacuum cleaner.  They had to replace all these for the users for the purpose of getting the customers in Rathmines and Pembroke.  I consider that that was a silly thing to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am entitled as an illustration to refer to a particular plant and to particular transactions which took place.  I say that whoever engineered the policy of taking over an existing plant which necessitated, <Col N="1673" /> in order to work the Shannon scheme, the complete wiping out of every implement formerly used with the electrical current, and the expending of capital sums of money to put the people owning these instruments back again on the basis of customers, was, to say the least of it, foolish.  Certainly, the Minister who stood for that against public opposition has to take as much responsibility as anybody else.  The Minister spoke about his agreement with a member or members of the Board.  As far as we are concerned, any private undertakings given or agreements made between the Minister and the Board, outside the Act, or beyond the Act, do not concern us.  We must judge this thing on the basis of the Act and on the debates which took place on the setting up of this scheme.  If the Minister, when putting through the Shannon scheme, had at the back of his mind the over-riding of the House by having other agreements outside the purview of the House it was certainly wrong. The Minister admits that he led the Dáil to believe that a sum of two and a half million pounds would be sufficient for the Board and he wants the Dáil to support him in his present attitude because they believed him when he made that statement.  I have no doubt that the Minister did believe it.  I will go that far with him.  I have no doubt that the Dáil hoped that the two and a half millions would be sufficient. But is there any reason why the Board should be blamed if the Minister and the Dáil miscalculated? As a matter of fact, the Minister took me to task several times because I said the scheme would cost £10,000,000. Now we have it that it has cost £12,100,000.  The Minister took me to task in this House and poured all kinds of abuse and ridicule on me because I said that the scheme had cost at that time almost £10,000,000.  Now the exact cost to the State, from what we know or from the figures admitted, is £12,100,000, not counting the value of the plant acquired by the Board without compensation to the districts concerned.  If we include these we will find that the cost of the scheme is somewhere about £15,000,000. <Col N="1674" /> I am not one of those who wants to score because the scheme happens to be in difficulties, but we should face up to the facts.  If the scheme requires the help of the nation to put it on its feet let us do it, but let us do it in a fair and open way and not by all kinds of political scoring such as the Minister has indulged in.  I am almost tempted to say that the great publicity given to the Drumm battery is only beating the drum to take our attention off the Shannon scheme.  That is what it appears to me.  It is most unfair.</P>

      <P>The Minister refuses to give the House facts and figures which he himself knows.  He says he does not know them.  I asked on the 12th June, 1929, the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he has received the report from the Electricity Supply Board of its proceedings for the first year's work as prescribed by Section 32 (1) of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927.  The Minister answered:</P>
      <P>I will answer questions 9 and 10 together.  The Electricity Supply Board was appointed in August, 1927, and its operations and expenditure in the financial year 1927-28 were, therefore, of a preliminary nature only.  In view of the heavy pressure of work on the Board, I have arranged that its accounts and the auditor's report thereon, together with the annual report, should, in respect of the years 1927-28 and 1928-29 be furnished together.  I expect to lay copies of these accounts and annual reports before each House at the commencement of next Session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then I asked a supplementary question: &ldquo;Does the Minister feel that he has power to do that within the terms of the Act?&rdquo; The Minister said: &ldquo;Yes, certainly.&rdquo; Then I asked further: &ldquo;So that the Act can be read one way for the Minister and one way for the people?&rdquo; The Minister replied: &ldquo;I would not take the Deputy's point of view on that.&rdquo; It <Col N="1675" /> appears to me that not only does the Minister want to read the Act in one way for himself and in another way for the Dáil, but he also wants to have a third way of reading it as far as the Board is concerned.  Is the Minister in a position to give the House a true and accurate reflex of the capital position of the Board?  He says he is not in a position to give a true record of its trading and revenue activities.  Has the Minister made any effort to get from the Board separate accounts with regard to the sale of current, as distinct from the sale of fittings and plant and machinery and the installations in houses? The Minister must not forget that when the Shannon Board was set up it took away the livelihood of many men who were engaged on these plants and it also endangered the livelihood of those engaged in the electricity business.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Board went out to undercut and to undersell in every shape and form of their activities the ordinary traders.  Attention was drawn to that on several occasions, but the Minister refused to give any expression of opinion on the matter.  I say it will be discovered at a future date when the accounts are properly examined, that the traders in regard to this and other parts of the scheme had to fight against unfair competition by the Shannon Board, and that the Minister will find that he has a great deal more to account for.  Several firms in the electrical supply trade pointed out that wiring was done by the Shannon Board on a basis and at a price that it could not be done by ordinary firms, yet we were told that they were able to do it.</P>
    <P>I want to know if they were able to wire houses and do it right, and what are the figures and what is the amount of loss, if any, due to the fact that the house-wiring operations of the Board were at fault.  Another point I put to the Minister was that the Shannon Board were trading in competition with the ordinary ratepayers and taxpayers. No one knows whether their shops are on a paying basis.  We should get separate accounts for these moneys. <Col N="1676" /> The Minister will not say to what he will devote this money or portion of it. He wants £2,000,000.  As I pointed out, as the Minister is not going to pay out of that money immediately the amount required for the acquiring of local undertakings, he does not require that £850,000 at the moment.  Deputy Lemass asked what he required the money for and to what extent he required it.  The Minister should take the attitude of getting from this House a sufficient amount of money to enable him to carry out the activities of ordinary development.  The House is not going to take up the position which the Minister did of holding up the Board for nine months, and then trying to put the responsibility for the extra loss which accrued on to the Board by the stopping of their operations.  The House is agreeable to give what money is necessary to enable the Board to function in its normal way.  But the House should be careful of giving this £850,000 to the Minister for a purpose for which he says he does not want it. He is not going to use it immediately; why, then raise the money and put the charge and the responsibility of having to pay the interest upon the Board?</P>
    <P>I have gone through the Act section by section&mdash;Sections 71 to 79, deal with the activities of the Board in relation to local authorities.  I do not know whether the Board ever advanced money to local authorities to develop the use of electricity.  I do not know whether the Board has gone guarantor for local authorities to develop the use of electricity.  The Board has all these powers under the Act, but we got no information on the subject from the Minister as to whether these liabilities are there.  Let the Minister come here and put his cards on the table.  As far as I am concerned I knew this was coming some years ago, and the Minister said that because I was descended from a nation of prophets I should not pretend to prophesy here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I can pick it out all right.  The Minister gave the House no opportunity of criticising the Electricity Supply Board accounts.  I wrote the Minister a personal letter asking would he ever give the House an opportunity of discussing the accounts presented, and the Minister's reply was that he would oppose it. The Minister has a majority and there is no sense putting down a motion when he would oppose it.  Like his colleague, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, if he is opposed to anything it must not be done.  I wanted to know from the Minister if I would have an opportunity of criticising the accounts.  I do not think we will have that opportunity, but I hope the Minister will bring the accounts into the House some time.  I cannot find in the Act, or any discussion relating to the Act, any item that would give the Board the right, for instance, of capitalising any office expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You will find in the first year's business office expenditure put down as capital expenditure, notwithstanding that they took over concerns and plants which were producing revenue. Another thing I would ask the Minister is if he would give us some indication <Col N="1678" /> as to the actual generation cost of the current generated from the Shannon proper as distinct from current developed in plant taken over and generated under the Electricity Supply Board.  Let us get an idea of what the generation costs are.  I ask the Minister if the Board is in a position through him to tell the House if they have any idea of their distribution costs, if he can give us the cost to the Board per unit of the distribution of electricity.  There is an item there for management expenses and overhead charges and we see a lot of property here.  I ask the Minister if he can tell us what properties the Electricity Supply Board have acquired and where they are.  As far as I can see, everywhere in Dublin you see offices of the Electricity Supply Board. Surely all these could be consolidated into one building and the cost attached to the keeping of so many buildings cut down?  The Minister put the proposition that the Electricity Supply Board was outside the control of the House.  It was nobody's business, and now it is everybody's business.  I do not know whether the Board is functioning now as a Board under the Act or whether the resignation of Doctor MacLaughlin and the man who was Chairman and afterwards Director have taken effect, or whether the Board is still there or whether there exists as Deputy Johnson at the time pointed out there might exist, a state of chaos there.  The state of chaos, if it existed, would not exist for many days, because before he would dismiss a man or call for any change he would have somebody in his mind to take over the running of the place.  Is the Minister prepared to say that whatever money he gets from the House he is going to be responsible to the House for that money and that he is going to give a full, clear and detailed statement of the affairs of the Board as they are now and from time to time in the future?  I am not going into all these figures here, because they can only be dealt with if accounts are presented. I only want to say that the Minister himself on the Second Reading of the Bill juggled between the independence of the Board and interference <Col N="1679" /> by the Dáil in the management of the affairs.  First of all, when the late Deputy Cooper, Deputy Good, Deputy Hewat and a few others pointed out that they would feel better pleased if the accounts and the affairs of the Board would come under the control of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, the Minister pooh-poohed the idea of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and pointed out that if he were to be given any look in at all the whole development of the scheme would be upset and retarded. And on the other hand he pointed out that civil servants could not be expected to run the service on a business basis, that running it as an ordinary Government Department would be quite as dangerous.  &ldquo;In saying that,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I am passing no criticism on the Civil Service as we find it at the moment.  The Civil Service was not recruited for the purpose of running business undertakings like this...&rdquo; That is in Column 1907, 15th March, 1927, Volume 18 of the Official Debates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>In Column 2023 the Minister said: &ldquo;If it is suggested that an Executive Council wants to remove a member of the Board for political purposes, and is going to do so, whether these political purposes be good, bad or indifferent, as long as it has a majority of the elected representatives of the House behind it...&rdquo; I do not see where that comes in at all except the Minister states about having created a political storm over the removal of a member.  The Minister definitely states there that once the Board is set up he shifts all responsibilities and washes his hands out of it. But how has the Minister acted in the last few years?  As far as I understand the Minister has changed his attitude in this House with regard to the Board. As far as I understand his attitude in this House was always that of giving the point of view of the Board, but his attitude to the Board was that he was speaking as the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>In view of the serious situation, he refers to letters and correspondence he had with the members of the Board. He points out that he spoke always as the Oireachtas, and if one reads the debates one will find that he always spoke as the Shannon Board here.  Certainly, since September, 1927, since I came into this House the Minister has never been in any way helpful or anxious to allay any suspicions that were in the minds of the Deputies, or any doubts as to the success of the undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have certainly got a lot of figures from the Minister, peak loads, units, and so on.  I think Deputy Thrift, on a certain occasion here, asked for certain assurances that things were <Col N="1681" /> going right, and that the normal development of the undertaking was satisfactory.  Is Deputy Thrift satisfied to-day?  Is he satisfied that the Minister is entitled to get £2,000,000 without giving the House any information as to what he wants that money for?  The state and finances of the Board are in such a way that he does not know where it is going to end or how much more they are liable for. Is Deputy Thrift going to take the attitude of saying &ldquo;We will give you as much money as you require immediately so long as it will not stunt the normal development of your scheme, but we will give the Minister no money he needs until he comes to the Dáil with a definite statement of the affairs&rdquo;?  I would go almost as far as to say that Deputy Thrift's attitude would be, judging by the interest he took in the original setting up of the Board, and having regard to the ambiguous nature of the published accounts, and the manner in which the Minister has treated this House in his statement to the House with regard to the present position, that we should give no further money, except what is absolutely certified as being necessary for the economic development of the scheme until we have a definite statement from the Minister as to the exact position.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister was disputing with Deputy Lemass the amount of money stated to be required for the Shannon works.  The Minister stated at that time that the figure for the Shannon works would be £4,500,000 and £2,500,000 for the Board, plus £600,000 interest during the years up to the year 1932.  The Minister all through his debate took the line of assuring the House that not one penny more would be required, that he was not trying to get £600,000 by a trick-of-the-loop, in other words.  He took great care to show that he wanted so much money.  Now we come to the stage where a whole lot more is required, and I say that as much care should be taken by the House now in voting £2,000,000 to make good the deficiencies of management as was taken by the House to grant 2½ million <Col N="1682" /> pounds before there was any Board, before there was any mismanagement, or any liabilities incurred.  The House then took great care before they gave 2½ million pounds.  I think they had no reason to refuse it then.  They were then committed to it, having engaged themselves in a contract with Messrs.  Siemens-Schuckert.  We are in a much more difficult position to-day and we should be much more careful.</P>
    <P>In discussing the question of the Comptroller and Auditor-General the Minister stated, amongst other items, that he wanted an outside auditor. He did not want the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  He wanted a more impartial audit.  &ldquo;I would like to have the audit as impartial as can be achieved.  In so far as it aims at greater publicity more accounts should be given to the public who are the shareholders.  I am all for that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is in col. 646, 31st March, 1927. The Minister's attitude then was &ldquo;We will have no Comptroller and Auditor-General, but I will have my own private accounting officer, and I will have him for the reason that I will have an impartial audit of the Shannon scheme, so as to insure that the public will have greater publicity and more accounts to be given to the public who are the shareholders.&rdquo; What is our experience of these accounts of the Shannon Board?  We have had no publicity.  Again in col. 649 we find this, for the 31st March, 1927:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Professor Thrift: I desire to say that I voted against Deputy Cooper's amendment on the strength of two statements made by the Minister which seemed to me to be most important.  I agree that it is desirable to keep the doings of this Board as far as possible from general discussion in the Dáil.  I agree with the Minister also that it is desirable that as much publicity as possible should be given to the financial work of the Board.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hope Deputy Thrift still subscribes to that attitude.  I hope he will still stand for and support the demand for full publicity of the doings of the Board, particularly as regards the financial position.  I am <Col N="1683" /> not going to go into all the figures the Minister gave us in regard to the units of electricity and so on and all the technical points but I must say that the Minister's statement to-day has been most disappointing.  I think it is, to say the least of it, not manly for the Minister to try to shed himself of his own responsibilities and to throw the full responsibility on to the shoulders of one or two individuals.  He has definitely made a cleavage as far as the Board is concerned, though the whole Board is responsible as far as we are concerned. Dr. MacLaughlin has been thrown to the wolves.  Would I be correct in saying that the previous Chairman of the Board resigned from the Board whether at the request of the Minister or the President of the Executive Council?  The President said it was not so when I asked a question.  The fact remains that the Chairman resigned and went back as an ordinary member of the Board. What I want to ask the Minister is &mdash;did that Chairman get compensation to the amount of £500 when he resigned his chairmanship of the Board?  Is there any foundation for the statement that the previous Chairman of the Board was given any compensation whatever when he resigned from the chairmanship?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could answer that question simply by saying no, but that would be misleading.  He did not get it on resignation, but he got it by way of extra remuneration on being re-appointed as a part-time member.</P>

That Chairman was brought back as an ordinary member of the Board.  He has also gone out with Dr. MacLaughlin.  I do not suppose he is getting compensation again this time.</P>

      <P>The fact remains that he resigned.  A certain statement was made to me and it was denied in this House.  I asked if the resignation of the Chairman was the result of a request that was made to him and the President said &ldquo;No.&rdquo; The Minister's present attitude in reply to Deputy O'Kelly's questions is certainly not very impressive.  The <Col N="1686" /> Minister knows more about that particular situation than he pretends to know or wants to give this House particulars of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a great pity the Minister did not do so.  He would have had much more sympathy in the House if he dismissed the man because he had come to the conclusion that he was not developing the scheme in the best interests of the country or of the finances of the State as a whole; but for the Minister to get it done in a way in which it is kept from the House I think is not fair or reasonable. I am not going to delay the House any further in going into a lot of information that I have here, but I want to know from the Minister if he is going to take this House into his full and open confidence and to give us an opportunity of satisfying ourselves as to the exact position of the scheme as regards its development from the technical point of view, and certainly as regards its financial aspect, so that the House can decide in what way further money may be given, and so that the House may find whether development on any great scale at the present time would be advisable or not, or whether it should go on for a certain number of years until certain things are wiped out and certain changes take place.  On the other hand, the House may come to the conclusion that it would be far better to go on immediately with the further development of the scheme which the Minister stated he would give to the House.  I hope the House will hold that what has been requested by Deputy Lemass is reasonable, that only such moneys will be given the Minister at the present time as will enable him to carry on for a particular period.  That is distinctly different from the attitude of the Minister who left the concern high and dry&mdash;to carry on on the revenue from the sale of current and forced them, I imagine, to use certain revenues which should have been applied to other purposes than what <Col N="1687" /> they were used for.  I hope the House will make the Minister come to his senses and realise that he is only going to get so much money that will enable him to carry on until such time as we know where we are in regard to the scheme.</P>

He then said he wants £850,000, of which £600,000 is to pay the amount of liability incurred in taking over existing undertakings. He says he is not going to pay that £600,000 just now.  Therefore all he requires according to himself for immediate disbursement is a sum of £650,000, which I contend he could get without this Act if he paid up the balance due to the Electricity Supply Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The main disagreement between the Minister and the Board was this, that the Board felt that the liabilities of existing plants which they took over would not be a part of this two and a half millions.  The Minister's contention was that it was to be included in that.  Either one or the other is right.  The fact is that this money is not immediately required. No one is asking for the liabilities to be paid at the moment. The Electricity Supply Board own the plants, and the plants, if they are any thing like the Dublin Electricity plants for which £300,000 was paid and which was worth £2,000,000, were very cheap.  The only money the Minister wants is first of all an amount to pay the liabilities in the ordinary trading manner and, secondly, whatever money is required to carry on the transmission lines.  I know as a result of the Minister's attitude for the last nine months that the Board were not able to bring the current to certain houses which had been wired and people have been issuing writs against the Board in the case of houses which were wired nine months ago.  If the Minister had <Col N="1689" /> given the Board money to lay their cables or to take down cables which were overloaded and which could not take extra current he would be getting extra customers to consume his units of electricity.  At the moment he need not get £2,000,000 or anything like it. He says he requires £250,000 for debts and another £250,000 for the Board to have in hands for ordinary developments for the next three months.  I think he should get it but no more and then on the next occasion we should get a complete statement of accounts.</P>

That is why I am anxious to get Deputy Murphy to see the sense of our attitude.  That is, that we are anxious to give the Minister sufficient to pay all existing liabilities.  All he wants is enough to pay the trade liabilities and the running expenses.  Let him state what is that figure, and the House will give it to him.  The House does not want to see traders held up, and they do not want to see anything taking place under the Shannon Board that will restrict developments, or the leaving off of men engaged on constructive work that will be of benefit in future.  If the Minister is prepared to say that £700,000 is the amount involved, as far as I am concerned, I would be prepared to give him that, but we should not give him more than that until we see something in the way of what Deputy Thrift requires, full publicity as far as the financial aspect of the Board is concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is perfectly clear from Deputy Murphy's statement that he had made up his mind that the merits lay with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and that the Shannon Board were hopelessly in the wrong, that they had made a mess of their business, and that they deserved whatever punishment it was in the power of the House to give, even to the withholding of sums of money which we are supposed to give them, even the sum proposed to be given to the Managing Director.  That seemed to me, at any rate, to reveal an attitude of mind which I hope, and which, in fact, I feel certain, is not the attitude of the majority of members.  There is a dispute, a dispute that involves very big issues, and it is our duty to insist on getting all the information that is necessary to enable us to form an impartial decision on the merits of the dispute.  We want that information.  What the Minister has given us does not supply us with anything like the information necessary to enable us to form a judgment on it, and even if he did give us full information it would be purely an ex parte statement.  He is one of the principals in the dispute.  The other principals are the Shannon Board.  On account of the fact that two of the members of the Board have resigned a situation has developed in which there is discrimination between one set of members of the Board and the other. As far as we in this House are concerned, we ought not to discriminate between members of the Board until we have information which enables us to discriminate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is at issue, as far as I have been able to gather from the statement made by the Minister, is concerned with the question of accounts.  It would appear that certain accounts which the Board was obliged to furnish have not been furnished.  That is a fact, I take it, but further than that fact, what is the cause of the delay in furnishing these accounts? Is it, for example, interference by the <Col N="1693" /> Minister?  I am only taking that as a possibility.  What is responsible for the delay in furnishing these accounts? Was it possible for any Board to furnish these accounts in time?  Was the rate of development so fast, for example, as to make it very difficult? I do not know, neither does any member of the House, what has transpired here in connection with these accounts.  A year ago, in September, 1930, the then Chairman of the Board was, it appears to me, forced to resign.  I think that was the conclusion that every member who was here at the time must have come to. He was forced to resign by the Minister. Was it on the question of the accounts?  Each member of the Board was responsible for the accounts if there was a division of responsibility. Was the Chairman responsible for the accounts?  If he were, and if there were a difficulty back in September, 1930, the Minister's new nominee was put in his place.  Why, if the question were one of accounts, have not the accounts been furnished since September, 1930?  Was not that time sufficient to make good?  I do not know, neither does any other member in the House.</P>
    <P>We have no information.  All we know about this matter is that the Minister when he came here asking the House to set up this Board, made a show of the fact that this was to be an independent Board, acting independently without interference from him.  He was to have no responsibility whatever for it.  He washed his hands out of it and at the very same time or very soon afterwards, after he said that, he looked round in the Act and found there was a clause which completely negatived everything he said then.  He said to himself: &ldquo;I have power to dismiss these people.  If I am going to exercise that I must have supervision over the work of the Board and I must know everything that happens.&rdquo; He then provided himself with a liaison officer.</P>
    <P>The Minister himself was not apparently able to keep that contact with the Board that was necessary for supervision.  What did he do?  He <Col N="1694" /> handed over to somebody who is to report to him, who is to be the medium by which he is to get information. What does that mean?  It means that the control simply passes from the Minister himself to one of the permanent departments.  There was some one Civil Servant who had access to the Minister and was able to point out what was wrong.  This liaison officer, who was really in control of the Board, was to be in a position in which he would bring about a situation in which the members of the Board and the Minister were going to be at loggerheads.  I do not know anything about it further than what we see on the surface.  That position was a fundamentally difficult one.  You cannot have this half-measure of control.  The Minister's idea of having a Board that would be free from Parliamentary control in the ordinary sense, capable of doing its work as a business Board was in my opinion a valuable idea and one that should be supported.  I agree that it was an experiment of great sociological value.  In fact, some of us believe there are certain developments necessary in the country and that they can only take place if pursued in that manner.  I, for one, am anxious that no clash of personality which appears to be at issue here or that no question of pique should come in here to risk the possibility of this valuable experiment being a success. I am anxious about this experiment, this enterprise, in the success of which so much national money is involved. We do not want to see this experiment wrecked on any petty ground.</P>
    <P>There is a difficulty undoubtedly.  Is this House going to hand over to an independent Board full and complete powers, and is it going to keep no check?  If it is going to keep a check, how is it to be made effective?  I have no doubt that originally, when the House agreed with the Minister's proposal, it came to the conclusion that the check provided in the Act was the least that it could have if it were to feel that it had any control whatever. Again, that depended upon the person who was to exercise the powers given. <Col N="1695" /> Responsibility was placed upon the Minister to exercise those powers wisely and in such a way that this experiment would be given a decent chance to be a success.  I do not think the Minister's speech to-night indicates that he has fulfilled this obvious duty in a satisfactory manner.  This thing has been going on for two or three years.  As regards the accounts, we have the same mess, apparently, under the new Chairman as we had under the old.  What is the reason for that?  The Minister had the whole country to pick from when he required a Chairman.  Nobody interfered with his choice or with the choice of the Executive Council. They could select from the best men available.  In appointing the first Chairman I take it they had good grounds for believing that he possessed the qualifications necessary to do the work in a successful way.  I remember many years ago the President of the Executive Council talking to me in very eulogistic terms about the man who was later appointed Chairman of the Board, of his ability in matters of finance.  Is the position now to be that this man, who was chosen for his ability in matters of finance, has not been able to deal with this particular work and, so to speak, has had to be fired?  I find it hard to believe that if the Minister for Industry and Commerce really approached that question sympathetically, and did not want to insist too much on his own views being taken in detail, that the present situation would not have been reached. However, as I say, that is only an opinion.  It would be as wrong for me to form a definite judgment on that opinion as it was for Deputy Murphy to form a definite judgment on the other matter.  The members of the House have not got sufficient material to enable them to form a sound judgment on this, and therefore we ought not to vote this money until we get all the information that we require.</P>
    <P>The only point of real importance that I want to make in connection with the accounts is that apparently the new Chairman, who is a civil servant, was not able to do any better <Col N="1696" /> than the old Chairman.  The question naturally arises whether any of these men, not being experts on the question of electrical supply and its economics, was capable of doing this work satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>The question of some agreement which was supposed to have been arrived at is, I think, the next point in dispute.  The matter in dispute there apparently was whether or not certain liabilities of the acquired undertakings were to be met out of the two and a half millions.  The Board apparently under the provisions of the Act was given the right to make requests for money and to get it on demand.  The Minister was not empowered under the Act to dole out money in the way that he proposes. This doling out is clearly a violation of the principle embodied in the original Act.  If the Minister were to be in a position to dole out money in that way he would be in a position to interfere from day to day in the policy of the Board, and that above all things was the thing to be avoided if the principle in the original proposal was to be followed out properly. Until the Minister gets such power as he is seeking now he is not in a position to interfere from day to day. The Board, having been told when they were set up that they were put in a position of independence, naturally proceeded to act independently and to say that they had a public responsibility for the scheme, to say to the Minister &ldquo;You have washed your hands of that responsibility. Because we have that responsibility we are going to follow our judgment and not yours.&rdquo; They were perfectly entitled to do that.  Who was to arbitrate between the Minister and the Board in a matter like this? I, like other members of the House, have looked up the debates that took place at the time, and I have certainly not come across anything to show where it was suggested by the Minister that the liabilities of these acquired undertakings were to be met out of the two and a half million pounds.  The Minister has not shown us that they were to be so met.  I am perfectly certain that if the Minister <Col N="1697" /> were able to show that to the Board, to show that he was in a legal position to compel the Board to do what he stated to-day, the Board would immediately have surrendered to his view and admitted that the position was as he says, but apparently the Board were within their rights&mdash;that the whole of the two and a half million pounds should be delivered to them as requested in accordance with whatever plans they, in the exercise of their own judgment, were to make. The Minister refused to give them that money.</P>
    <P>Holding the view that they did, is it likely that the Board made this agreement which is referred to?  Is the position this, that the agreement was made under some sort of compulsion, that self-same sort of compulsion that was used a few years ago to get the first Chairman of the Board to resign and to get the Managing Director to resign recently?  Some sort of agreement, apparently, was come to, and the Minister now holds it was broken.  It is the duty of the Minister to furnish the House with all the evidence, to enable Deputies to form a judgment upon that agreement.  I hold that before the Minister asks for this money he ought to table the correspondence that took place at that particular time.  Deputies are entitled to see that.  We want to know in regard to this agreement where the merits lie.</P>
    <P>The next point refers to the questions of major policy to which Deputy Lemass referred.  What are they? What exactly is the policy that the Board was following, and what exactly is the policy that the Minister is following? As well as I remember the Minister gave some sort of explanation on these lines: that the Board proceeded to develop without concerning themselves with the question whether the revenues that would come from the ultimate development would be such as to warrant that development, whereas the Minister said &ldquo;You must first of all calculate nicely what are to be the returns from a certain development, and when you have made these calculations then the development is to take place.&rdquo; I do not think that the Shannon scheme would ever <Col N="1698" /> have been started if these calculations were to be insisted upon.  Certain estimates were made at the beginning, but the Minister has had to come to the House from time to time to look for increased sums.  His estimate was based, as I take it, on certain rough calculations.</P>
    <P>In my opinion the Board could not do more than was done as far as extra development was required. What has the Minister done?  Apparently he has destroyed for some months past the whole credit of the Board.  The letters appearing in the Press and the rumours current about the city make it clear that the Minister completely destroyed the credit of the Board.  By withholding the sums that they were entitled to receive he put the Board in this position, that the further development which they had entered upon under their scheme could not be undertaken.  It does not require one very well versed in questions of electrical supply to realise that it is the final step in all these cases that matters.</P>
    <P>Suppose you have the mains laid in the streets and that they are ready to supply users with electricity, the possible revenue cannot come in until the final fitting up is done.  Therefore, it is not sufficient to leave these things in the air, to bring the networks and the distribution up to a certain point. It is not fair, in my opinion, to judge the Board on its success or failure on the position that was largely the creation of the Minister himself.  I think everyone must admit that if the Minister wanted to destroy any Board he could do it.  Powers were left with him, and we have to judge him on the manner in which he exercised these powers; whether he exercised them wisely or whether, in fact, he exercised them in such a way as to make for a certainty that the Board would not be a success.</P>
    <P>To summarise, the first point that we want information on is in regard to this whole question of the accounts. Why is it that, although a new Chairman was appointed, he has not been able to settle up the accounts since the time of his appointment in September, 1930?  The House must remember <Col N="1699" /> also that there were direct representatives from the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Finance on the Board.  There must, therefore, over a long period, have been direct contact between the officials of these two Departments and the Board.  The Minister cannot say that over a long period he was not in possession of intimate knowledge as to the position of the Board.  If that is so, why did he wait so long, why did he allow things to get into the mess that we have now?  Why did he bring about a situation in which the whole credit of this particular enterprise in which so many millions of money are sunk, as well as the credit of an experiment which he himself admits was one of great sociological value, has suffered over a long period without taking action to remedy it?  As regards the agreement, we want to see all the information contained in the correspondence that took place.  It is the duty of the Minister to put it before us.  It seems to me that the Minister in elevating two of the matters at issue to a question of policy has done so without a great deal of justification. What is the policy as far as the Minister is concerned?  Does he want to see as many consumers as possible for the power provided by the Shannon scheme or does he not?  If he wants to see that must not any body that is going to undertake the development have certain wide powers to enable it to take the steps that it thinks necessary in order to make that development a success?</P>
    <P>Is it fair to put upon the Board the restrictions that the Minister proposed to put upon them?  If it is and if the Minister wants to see this thing out in detail then he should not talk of washing his hands of the Board because it simply means that he is going to exercise supervision from day to day over the Board.  I do not believe that major matters of policy are involved.  If they are, how are we to choose between the view of the Minister and the Board without some deciding body on whose opinion we can rely?  What does the Minister know about these things?  What does he know about the question of electrical <Col N="1700" /> supply and its economics?  I do not believe that he knows anything about it.  If we are to take the opinion of one man as against another on it would we not be on safer ground in taking the view that has been expressed in contradiction to that of the Minister, the view that has been expressed by the Managing Director who, the Minister admits, was the originator of the Shannon scheme in its present form?  He, at any rate, can claim a certain amount of expert knowledge.  What expert knowledge has the Minister to back up his opinion on the matter?  If it is a question of the accounts simply then we must naturally ask what responsibility had the Managing Director for these accounts?</P>
    <P>I think that at one time the Minister spoke about the Chairman of the Board being one who had enjoyed exceptional knowledge of public finance and of the care that should be exercised in dealing with such moneys. I take it that was one of the reasons why that particular Chairman was appointed, because he had that knowledge. He was accustomed to dealing with public moneys and had experience of the care with which they should be handled.  He was a man who was eulogised greatly.  I fail to understand why he should change so suddenly when he got control as Chairman of the Board and turn out to be a different type of man.  I want to know what the expert opinion is that the Minister is backed by as against the admitted expert opinion of the Managing Director.  These are questions that I want to have cleared up before I am asked to give judgment on this.</P>
    <P>As regards looking for the sum of two million pounds, I think that is altogether unjustifiable.  Can anybody imagine a Minister coming to the House and asking for £2,000,000 to have at his disposal to dole out, to compel subservience from a Board which he says is to be an independent Board?  The Minister ought to give some indication of what he wants. Questions have been put from this side of the House, but we have not yet got any really definite set of figures such as a Minister looking for an appropriation <Col N="1701" /> of this size should produce.  As regards the commitments that have to be met, £700,000 has been mentioned, but even the figures relating to that total sum we have not got accurately. Surely the accounts ought to be able to clear that up?  As regards the future, why should the Minister want so much as two million pounds in excess of the sum that it was estimated in the past would be required?  Is it that he may be in a position to put the new Board into the position that they will be able to say, &ldquo;All is well, because we have not been hampered by any niggardliness as regards funds?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The House would not be justified in giving the Minister a blank cheque for this two million pounds.  He might be able to make a case for £300,000 or £400,000 to meet immediate requirements until this matter is straightened out, but surely when it is straightened out the House ought to get an opportunity of reviewing the situation.  If at that time it is shown that any further moneys are needed, the House ought to have an opportunity of reviewing the whole situation and of determining whether the extra moneys are or are not to be given.  In my opinion, the Minister has not treated the House fairly or candidly in this matter.  If there is a question of difference of opinion on what have been called major questions of policy we ought to have an inquiry into the whole position Previously, before the House entered on large capital commitments in connection with the scheme, certain experts were called in, not representatives of the Department of Industry and Commerce, and not civil servants who cannot claim to have any real knowledge of the economics of this matter.  Therefore, I say that we ought to have an inquiry by an independent expert group before we are asked to vote this further sum.</P>
    <P>It is the duty of the House to see that.  It is time for us now.  This enterprise is an important one and it is in the balance.  If we act unwisely, we may wreck the whole thing. It is our duty to the country and to ourselves as representatives here to see that whatever action is taken in <Col N="1702" /> this particular matter is only taken after the most careful inquiry, with all the information, technical and otherwise, that the House has a right to get.  I suggest, therefore, that we should not precipitately deal with this matter and pass this money until we get the why and wherefore and information, if necessary, by setting up an expert Committee to examine into the whole situation.  I think the situation is of sufficient magnitude to warrant a special inquiry, an inquiry, if you like, with members who will be all chosen so as to be impartial and members who will be able to give information worth something on the technical issues involved.</P>

      <P>As one who had some criticism to offer as to the constitution of this Board when the matter was in the first instance before this House, I should like to say, what I said on several occasions then, that I was very doubtful from my experience of business matters of the success of the proposals of the Minister.  I agree, however, with Deputy de Valera that as we have the scheme now it is the anxiety, or ought to be the anxiety, of all of us, not alone members of this House, but all those interested in this State, to make a success of this scheme.  Whatever criticism one may have offered in the past, as far as I am personally concerned I am anxious to do everything now to further the scheme, as such a large sum of State money is invested in it.  That is my attitude at present. But I am not satisfied that from the inception of this particular Board its business was carried on in a businesslike way.  I have no information that would help me in coming to a conclusion as to the cause of the trouble.  There may have been too much interference by the Minister's Department, or there may have been insufficient care on the part of the members of the Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I happen to know some of the members of that Board, including the past Chairman, and in view of one's knowledge of these particular men in the past I am not prepared to condemn them in the whole-hearted way that they have been condemned this afternoon <Col N="1703" /> in this House.  Many of them are able business men who have discharged duties in the past in a most satisfactory manner.  Then they were brought into this Board and now they have been censured without having been given an opportunity of making their case.  As I say, we have these statements put before us and we are not able from the information we have at present to say whether the fault is that of the Board, on the one hand, or of the Executive Council or the Department of Industry and Commerce, on the other hand.</P>
    <P>The House will agree that there is financial chaos in the affairs of that Board at the moment.  That being so, what is the best method of dealing with that difficulty?  Supposing any of us were on a Board of Directors who had to face such a situation, how would we deal with it?  It appears to me that the first step such a Board would take would be to call in an independent firm of auditors of repute and get from them a financial statement of the existing position, showing, on the one hand, the liabilities and, on the other hand, the assets.  In addition to that, we should get from these auditors a figure that would meet the commitments entered into by that Board.  With these two figures we should have information as to what developments were necessary in the immediate future and an estimate of the cost of these developments.  Before any further step is taken the House ought to have information before it on these three points.</P>
    <P>There is a further difficulty in the matter.  The services of the present Board, or portion of it, have been dispensed with.  Further members of that Board are under a sort of sentence of suspension.  In other words, they have only been reappointed for a period of six months.  What the position of the balance of the Board is I do not know. The balance of the Board apparently is a minority of the Board and it is to continue.  These are factors that would want to be cleared up.</P>
    <P>I think, with all respect to the Minister and the Executive Council, that the House is not in a position at <Col N="1704" /> present to decide on this matter.  I suggest that the whole consideration be adjourned, and that a firm of auditors be called in to give the figures which I have suggested should be before the House, just as they would be before any Board of Directors that is called upon to decide vital issues such as those the House is now called upon to decide, and that while that statement is being prepared the Executive Council should make up their minds as to the form of that Board for the future for the carrying on of this undertaking, and then come before the House and state: &ldquo;That is the Board we recommend; that is the financial position; and we now come forward with an estimate of so-and-so to discharge the liabilities that will accrue if the House adopts this recommendation.&rdquo; If that course were adopted it would be a businesslike way of dealing with the problem, and it would do away with a lot of discussion that is not going to do the electricity undertaking any good, and is not going to help the reputation of this country for dealing with problems of this character.  I suggest that the matter be adjourned, and that this information be obtained, and as soon as all this information is ready that the matter be brought before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce introduced this discussion by a statement that he had never come to the House with more distaste and more embarrassment in relation to any task he had undertaken.  I have never listened to the introduction of a discussion in this House of a serious matter with more distaste, and with more deep pain and regret, than the one we have heard to-day, because I am genuinely and deeply interested in the Shannon scheme.  I want to see it a success.  I think someone or other is responsible, that this discussion we are having is evidence that someone has been responsible, for very gravely risking the future success of this <Col N="1705" /> scheme and, in risking it, risking the reputation of this country as a business institution, and risking also, as Deputy de Valera has said, an experiment of very great, fundamental, psychological and political value.  I am speaking now as one who has no use, ordinarily speaking, for Governmental interference in commercial affairs. Judging by the experience of the world up to the present&mdash;I am not saying there are not certain experiments going on that would change one's opinion in that matter&mdash;but up to the present we have been justified, as individuals, in saying that the further the State keeps away from business enterprises the more likely they are to be a success.</P>
      <P>But we had in this a great State enterprise which was attempted to be carried on under State control and under which a very ingenious machinery&mdash;I am saying that sincerely &mdash;a very ingenious and well thought out machinery was put into the Act to enable a State enterprise to be carried on as nearly as possible with the advantages of a private enterprise, while having behind it the support and assistance of the State.  It will be a tragedy not merely for the Electricity Supply Board, but a tragedy for a great many possible developments which might take place in this country if, as the result of what has happened here, we have to say that in this Free State, with the resources of men and their intelligence and decency which we have at our disposal, we are not able to set up successfully a board upon the lines of the Electricity Supply Board, and find it efficient to carry out a big enterprise in close connection with the State.  It is for that reason that I would regard it as a very great tragedy indeed if we have to say that there has been a failure in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now it is obvious that somebody has failed.  Either the Electricity Supply Board has failed as a whole, or certain constituents of it have failed, or the Electricity Supply Board has broken down through interference and lack of sympathy of the Minister, or it has broken down through lack of efficiency and lack of sympathy and <Col N="1706" /> understanding of the purpose of the Electricity Supply Board by the permanent officials.  As Deputy de Valera said, these are questions on which we ought to have evidence.  I am not going to judge.  I want to leave this question to-day an open question.  If we were here in the position of giving evidence we could decide.  I want to leave the thing to-night in the position in which this House, as a whole, without any division of political party, will insist that to us, individual members of the Dáil, shall be given that sufficient amount of exact and detailed evidence in relation to the history of this matter that will enable us to come to an honest judgment, as if we were jurors in a case trying the issue between those who say that the Electricity Supply Board have let down the Free State and those who say they have not. There is no evidence as yet on which any honest member of this House could, with a sense of responsibility as a juror, give a verdict.</P>
    <P>We have had one witness in the box, and one witness only.  And again I say it with regret, because I do chalk up to the Minister, to his credit, the great ingenuity and largeness of vision which was represented in the actual constitution of the Electricity Supply Board&mdash;we have had one witness in the box, and every member of this House is in a position to form an opinion as to whether or not that witness was there to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, in scorn of consequences and in disregard of interests of anything except the truth.  I personally think that the Minister has not merely not been fair to this House, and not merely not been fair to the Board, but that he has been thoroughly unfair to himself by the exhibition of ill-timed reticence, of calculated suppression and suggestion which he has given us to-day.</P>
    <P>Now we have unfortunately another witness who has not been before this House, a witness whose reputation the President of the Executive Council will stand over without hesitation, that is the late Treasurer and Town Clerk of the City of Dublin, who was Chairman of the Board.  He was <Col N="1707" /> appointed Chairman of the Board with the enthusiastic consent of the President and of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  That gentleman has made statements in relation to the circumstances under which he resigned, which, if true, mean that every word of testimony which has been offered to us by the particular witness in this case must be regarded, to say the least of it, as doubtful.  If the circumstances under which Mr. Murphy resigned from the Electricity Supply Board are the circumstances which Mr. Murphy stated they were to two members of this House, and not in confidence, then there has been interference with the Board, not merely of a financial kind but of the most grossly wrong and improper character.  An attempt has been made, if these statements of Mr. Murphy are correct, to do with this Board that which would make it, as a successful runner of the Shannon scheme or anything else, impossible.</P>
    <P>I personally am not prepared to say that Mr. Murphy has turned his back upon a lifelong association with the President; that he has turned his back deliberately upon the truth and has deliberately invented a story as to the circumstances of his resignation. Unless I am prepared to say that, I am to say that there are two witnesses now before you who definitely contradict one another in relation to the facts.  Let us now take the Electricity Board as a whole.  It consisted of the Treasurer and ex-Town Clerk of the City of Dublin; the ex-President of the Incorporated Chamber of Commerce and Shipping of Cork, and the ex-President of the Associated Chambers of Commerce of the Irish Free State; the Secretary of the Agricultural Organisation Society; two senior civil servants and now as Chairman an ex-principal officer of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>According to the statement which the House has received from the Minister&mdash;and I am not to judge that statement.  I am only to tell you that it is a statement which, on the evidence, requires other examination than his mere statement&mdash;a Board so <Col N="1708" /> constituted has been as utterly inefficient, has been as criminally negligent, has been as recklessly reticent of the things which it ought to disclose to the Minister, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce has said.  Do you believe that?  Do you believe that the ex-Treasurer and Town Clerk of the City of Dublin has been as inefficient as that?  What are the Associated Chambers of Commerce of the Free State going to say to their ex-President, who has held their honour and their reputation in his hands, when he has, according to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, so shamelessly neglected his duty?  Do they accept that?  Do they accept that they appointed as Chairman of that body a man as recklessly inefficient as the Minister has portrayed him?  The whole co-operative industry of this country, co-operative marketing and co-operative manufacturing of butter, was under the control of the man who was put in as a member of this Board by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Is he as inefficient, as reckless, as disregardful of his duties as the Minister for Industry and Commerce has said?  There have been altogether, I think, four civil servants of one type or another upon that Board.  Liaison officers is one of the terms.  Did all those officers hold their tongues?  Did all those officers see these things going on and say nothing, or were those officers so utterly inefficient that they did not see any of these things that the Minister for Industry and Commerce said were happening?</P>
    <P>A principal officer of the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;Mr. Brown, I think, or Dr. Brown&mdash;was appointed.  I do not know whether he would be called a business man, but he most certainly is a man who would be regarded as financially expert, as capable of going through accounts.  Is it alleged that he, when appointed instead of Mr. Murphy as Chairman of the Board, so continued to neglect all these financial matters that they were allowed to remain in that condition?  You have got to choose; you have got to say that everyone of those people are as inefficient as that.  Does the House believe it?  Does not the House believe <Col N="1709" /> that when Mr. McLaughlin said so, and their reputation stands against it, that there is a case for inquiry?  That is all I am asking.</P>
    <P>What is the main issue when you come to boil it down?  I want to recall to the mind of the House the speeches we have heard and heard with great gratification and pleasure from the Minister in relation to the Shannon scheme.  It was a huge success!  They had done in two years what their programme required of them to do in four! Instead of 110,000,000 units they had produced 150,000,000 units! Instead of its being a doubtful proposition it was an outstanding and flagrant success and to the credit of this country. That is what was said in relation to that thing.  Has any evidence been put before you that one single penny of all the money that was put into the possession of that Board has been misspent? Has evidence been put before you that one single penny has been spent by that Board before it should have been spent?  Does not everyone who knows anything about the electrical position in the country know that these people have underspent, that at the very moment at which the money ought to have been available, the money which would produce 100 per cent. interest because it would make fruitful the dead capital that was lying behind it, that at that very moment this money has been cut off?  There is no evidence at all at the present moment in relation to that Board, even on the speech of the Minister, except a neglect to provide him with accounts. That may be very serious but that does not involve the future of the Shannon. The Minister does not now even himself state&mdash;I read his speech as carefully as I could&mdash;that there is an agreement with the Board.  The case which was made by the President in his statement most certainly is not being stood over in detail and in set terms by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  There is a change of front and we want to know why there is a change of front.  If we have taken in our hands the reputation of the competent business men in this country and the reputation of the young engineers who we claim were bringing <Col N="1710" /> credit and honour to this country, and if we have chosen to smash them we have got to do it upon evidence.  Where is the evidence?  We have got to do it in a case which has not been altered in the middle of the statement of the case.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that there is a sum of £600,000 or something of that kind&mdash;we had better get that clear. The amount which is involved is the amount of the undischarged liabilities of the undertakings which were taken over.  That debt amounted to £835,000 when they took them over, and that is pushed down or reduced to a sum of £600,000 now.  The Minister contends that that £600,000 has to be met out of the £2,500,000.  The lawyers of the E.S.B. have advised them to the contrary.  The Minister knows that they have advised them to the contrary. He knows that they would not have refused to come in line with him if they had not that advice, just in the same way as they refused to pay rates in Dublin until the law was changed, because they were advised by their lawyers.  If they had used this £600,000 to pay these obligations in the way the Minister says they ought to be paid they will be using that £600,000 to pay money in a way in which their lawyers say it is illegal for them to use it.  The Minister went to them, according to his own statement, and asked them to go behind the back of the Dáil, to contract out of the law with him.  He had no contractual position of any kind.  There is no agreement of any sort or kind which they could enter into with the Minister.  The House had better get that clear.  There is no agreement into which they could enter with the Minister, because the Minister does not exist in the matter. There is no agreement which they could make with the Minister which they are entitled to plead in law, and yet it is that agreement or a breach of that agreement to go behind and void the law, which is the sole gravamen of the charge which is brought against them.  I have read the Act. I do not know any Act of this unfortunate Dáil which I have read with more care, and personally I have never seen any evidence whatsoever that they should pay that as <Col N="1711" /> a capital sum.  They took over these undertakings.  They took over their assets and they took over their liabilities as they were.  They took over liabilities to pay interest and sinking fund on their debts, but they did not take over liability to extinguish those debts at once.</P>
    <P>There is one difficulty in that and I want to be quite fair.  When we come to investigate this matter it will have to be investigated that the only possible line of country on which they could possibly have an obligation to pay off these moneys as a capital charge, namely, that they themselves were unsound financially, or that that particular obligation of indebtedness being left upon the local authorities made them to that degree less financially sound. When the Shannon scheme was set up with the authority of the Dáil, and with the finance of this Dáil behind it, and with the enthusiastic support of every member of the Dáil to make the best of it, did anyone suggest that it was financially unsound?  It can get now every penny that was required for it.  If ever a man set himself out in fact to produce that very condition of insolvency, to produce that very condition in which creditors would foreclose and demand their money instead of interest and sinking fund, it is the men who have been behind whatever mess there is here.  It is a fact that the E.S.B. have been asked to send cash for a £10 order.  It is a fact that responsible firms have rung each other up and said: &ldquo;We have an order from the E.S.B. for £40; are they good for the money?&rdquo; It is a fact that letters have been written by firms saying that owing to the non-payment of debts by the E.S.B. that they must insist on arrangements of that kind before supplying goods.</P>
    <P>And during the whole of that time what is the actual position?  The actual position is that the Minister has been holding in his hands £546,000 which he had no right to hold, which he illegally held.  He had the right to dismiss members of the Board; he had the right to come to the Dáil and say he made a mistake, and if he did he had the right <Col N="1712" /> to smash it up; he had the right to come to us, but he had no right under the Act either to make that agreement which he alleges, to void the Act, nor had he any right, nor had the Minister for Finance any right, to refuse to hand to those people money which the Act says that the Minister on demand &ldquo;shall&rdquo; hand to the Board.</P>
    <P>Here is a great institution which with its acknowledged capital is somewhere like £12,000,000 and which upon its hidden capital is somewhere about £14,000,000, and it is like some miserable hard-run shopkeeper, with the bailiffs in on him, its credit destroyed by the neglectful and unbusiness methods of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, either in not giving them the money or not coming to the Dáil.  Which was it?  He could have come to the Dáil when he made the arrangement with them.  He made an arrangement with them on consideration of his not telling the Dáil what he believed to be the truth.  He said that himself.  He came along here, and he was going to put in two amendments in the 1929 Act and he was going to tell the Dáil why he was going to put them in, and he said in consideration of my not doing that this Board was induced to enter into this agreement, which on the face of it is illegal, with a man who had no legal existence to make an agreement with them.  That is the position.  The only evidence I have produced here to-night is the evidence of Mr. Murphy, who had previous association with those who controlled the Board and interfered with it and the Minister's own speech.  On these things alone there is manifest evidence that we have got to inquire into, who has tried to wreck the Shannon scheme?</P>
    <P>The end of this may be the smashing of a Minister, the smashing of a Civil Service Department, the smashing of the personnel of the Board. The one thing which it must not mean is the smashing of the Shannon scheme.  Let me be perfectly clear. Whoever goes down the Shannon scheme itself integrally is the same as if this thing never happened.  Someone is going down, but our business is so to see that whatever accidental and <Col N="1713" /> incidental circumstances surround the scheme because of the large amount of human nature which has been shown in this matter, the scheme itself goes on.</P>
    <P>My difficulty on the face of it is that the Ministry does not seem to have been concerned with the benefits of the scheme.  That money should never have been held up.  If the Minister felt that this Board was unfit then he should have come to the Dáil.  He had no right to allow it to continue for one hour in existence while he was holding from it the money he was withholding, and so destroying the credit of that scheme and, in so far as he could do it, destroying the credit of the country as well.  I think to many of us and for many more years than we have belonged to the Dáil the electrification of the Shannon and the big development which would come from it has been a dream which we are glad to see realised.  I want in so doing to give every credit that I possibly can to the imagination and the courage of those who did decide under adverse circumstance, and possibly in the face of better economic advice, went on with it.  The time now has come to show our real fealty to the Shannon scheme by coming together as a jury, determined to find out accurately and absolutely the whole facts, determined to deal out justice and not more and not less than justice to all those concerned in the matter.</P>
    <P>It is in that spirit that I commend to the House this appeal.  I want an investigation.  I want to see the thing is fairly done.  There is any amount of evidence available.  I suppose I heard thousands of rumours of the things that have been done by the Shannon Board.  I have investigated everything as far as an individual could.  I know of nothing, at any rate of a practical character, which, at the present moment, stands to the discredit of the Shannon scheme, or those who operated in it, and I do not know if anybody else has.  I only want to say one more word, and that is in relation to the Board as it at present exists.  It consists, at the present <Col N="1714" /> moment, of three civil servants, who hold their position at the will and pleasure of the Executive Council.  It consists of three people who, in the name of business representatives, have been put on under conditions in which in my opinion they cannot be of value. It consists, as far as I understand, of an inner and an outer cabinet.  The three representatives of the business community have not, in fact, been attending; they have not been summoned. There have been statements of policy, and so on, issued by the Board and over the photographs, at any rate, of members of the Board, without consultation with the business element.  Now, unless the business element on that Board can have that security of tenure and can have that freedom and independence of function which enables them to do some good work, they had better get out.</P>
    <P>At present the reputation of the whole business community of the Irish Free State is involved if this thing is a failure.  If, according to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, we cannot find, within the whole Free State, three business men who can render a better account of themselves than the Minister for Industry and Commerce says these men have rendered, then it is the duty of the business people of the Free State to see that such representatives are not upon that Board.  I am absolutely in favour of an independent Board. The more independent is its function the greater is its authority in relation to its policy.  The less interference by any Party or any Government, whatever it may consist of, the less interference the civil servants have with it, the more hope I have in the Shannon scheme.  Unless we can have some machinery set up, a Board which will be an independent Board of responsible business men to run that thing, it is going to be a failure whatever we do in the matter.</P>

Some of them would sneer at us because I suppose, not being in a position of affluence, we would venture to discuss and criticise the proposition to vote £2,000,000 of the public money, to give a blank cheque into the hands of the Minister who was responsible for concealing from the House the fact that since 1928 a serious difference of opinion has arisen between him and the Board which he created with regard to the expenditure of a sum of two and a half million pounds.

      <P>The proposal in this Bill is to place £2,000,000 under the control of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to dole out as he wishes to a Board of his own selection and nomination.  The whole of the Minister's speech, I would like to remind the House, was an indictment of the late Managing Director and the former Chairman of the Board.  In the course of it he did not advance a single argument that would justify the grant of this £2,000,000.  He said that he was without information which he should have in submitting such a proposal to the House.  He told us that the Board had overspent to the extent of £600,000 and had incurred commitments to the extent of a further £250,000.  He also told us that the total expenditure and commitments of the Board at present amounted to £3,350,000 approximately, which is computed as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is approved expenditure, I have to call it approved expenditure, because the Minister has indicated that to the extent of £1,700,000 he is prepared to approve of the expenditure which this nominally independent Board has already undertaken.  In addition to that there is an excess expenditure already incurred and in respect, I presume, of works already finished, amounting to £600,000. There were, he said, in addition to that, other commitments amounting to £250,000 and then, he said, there are the liabilities of the municipal undertakings transferred amounting to £800,000.  Under the Electricity Supply Act of 1927 there was originally <Col N="1717" /> granted to the Board a sum of £2,500,000.  It is in regard to the balance of £800,000 that the difference between the Board and the Minister is supposed to have occurred.  That sum, according to the Minister, represents liabilities of the undertakings which were taken over by the Board from the local authorities.  It is in regard to that sum that the differences between the Minister and the Board have arisen.  It is common ground between the Minister and the Board that the Board eventually, whether out of the £2,500,000 or whether out of its profits and revenue from the operation of the undertaking, must provide for the liabilities of the transferred undertakings.  There is no difference between the Minister and the Board as to that.  I would like to make that quite clear.  The Board accepts the responsibility for the liabilities of the transferred undertakings. The Minister states that they are bound to accept these responsibilities under Section 37 of the Electricity Supply Act.  How then does the difference arise?  It arises as to the manner in which that provision is to be made.</P>
    <P>The Minister's attitude, so far as I can apprehend from his speech, was that out of the £2,500,000 provided by the House to enable the Board to equip itself with all the plant and the machinery required to distribute and sell locally 110,000,000 units per annum, the Board was bound to take one-third of the sum, £800,000, and immediately discharge the liabilities of the transferred undertakings.  I would like to ask the Minister if that is a correct presentation of his position, that he desires that out of the £2,500,000 granted to the Board or authorised to be advanced to the Board under the Electricity Supply Act, he wishes the Board to take £800,000 and immediately to discharge the liabilities of the transferred undertakings?</P>

      <P>Does it matter in the long run so long as we know what the yearly commitments are?  Surely there are certain sums to be paid each year.

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather from the Minister's statement that the estimate of the capital liabilities was £3,350,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>He arrived at it in this way.  There was £1,700,000 which had been legitimately spent.  There was in addition to that a further capital sum of £800,000 which he stated should be set aside, earmarked, or in some way taken to discharge the liabilities of the undertakings transferred from the local authorities.  Is that not the Minister's attitude according to his statement to us?  He put it in this way.  He said that £2,500,000 was placed at the disposal of the Board.  He said we have to take away from that a sum of £800,000, representing the transferred liabilities of the undertakings taken over by the Board from the local authorities.  That, he <Col N="1719" /> said, leaves us with a nett sum of £1,700,000, which the Board had at their disposal and could use to provide for the plant, new local distribution, and net-works which were required in order to enable them to sell 110,000,000 units of electricity.  Is that not the case which the Minister has presented to the Dáil?  The Minister is silent.  I take it that is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot pay attention to all these questions because I am going to reply on my own case.  The Deputy can make his case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the use making a case to which quite obviously the Minister is not going to reply, because the Minister is not listening?  We have got to establish some point of contact, at any rate, in respect of these figures.  The Dáil has a right to get a correct presentation of the Minister's case.  I do not want to say anything over which the Minister will not stand in his reply.  I take it that what the Minister stated at the outset is correct.  I am ready to admit that £800,000 had to be taken out of the capital sum of £2,500,000 and set aside to redeem the liabilities of the undertakings transferred from the local authorities.  He said that when you do that you have £1,700,000 which the Board might legitimately expend on new capital works.  That is the case which the Minister made to the Dáil, that and no other, and it is on that supposition, upon the supposition that that £800,000 is to be taken out of the £2,500,000 and set on one side, that he states now that the Board has over-spent to the extent of nearly £850,000. The exact words of the Minister were that &ldquo;the Board had indicated, in fact, the position at the present moment is that the Board has over-spent to the sum of £600,000, and has committed itself to a further expenditure of £250,000.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that means anything, it means, as I said, that £850,000 of the two and a half millions which was placed at the Board's disposal by the Dáil had to be used immediately to discharge the liabilities of the transferred undertakings. What would anyone think of that <Col N="1720" /> merely as a business proposition? Here is one-third of the total capital of the Board to be taken from the reproductive use of the Board, to be withdrawn from fruitful investment in plant, equipment and organisation, and used to redeem moneys advanced, in many cases at from three and a half to four per cent., when that fresh capital could not be raised in the market at less than five per cent.</P>
    <P>That was the first consequence of the position which the Minister wished the Board to take up, and I put it to any business man in the House, that if he had £800,000, the major portion of which he got at four per cent., and had freedom to do otherwise, would he immediately withdraw that £800,000 of capital from his business and use it to pay off that money?  Yet that is the position that the Minister endeavoured to manoeuvre the Board into.  The Board quite rightfully said &ldquo;No, we have £800,000, we have to pay interest on it at a rate to be determined by the Minister for Finance, a rate, as far as we can see, that will not be less than five per cent.  Instead of using that to re-pay liabilities which mainly carry interest at four per cent. we are going to invest it in net works, plant, and use it to discharge the prime obligation imposed upon us by the Electricity Supply Act, to sell in this country one hundred and ten million units per annum.&rdquo; When it is remembered that inside two years the Electricity Supply Board&mdash;mismanaged and all as it has been according to the Minister&mdash;has succeeded in more than doubling the consumption of electricity in the Twenty-Six Counties, it can be seen that so far as excess expenditure, with which the Minister charges the Board with incurring, is concerned, that it has been a very fruitful investment.</P>
    <P>What was the legal position of the Board in regard to the matter? The Board in refusing to accept the preposterous proposal, from the business point of view, that had been put up to them by the Minister, to withdraw this money from investment in the undertaking with whose management they were charged, in acting as they did, in over-spending to the extent <Col N="1721" /> of £600,000 which the Minister alleges, and in entering into further commitments of £250,000, in going to the very limit of the authority which the Dáil had granted to them to demand this money from the Minister for Finance, when they did demand it were acting strictly in accordance with the Act.  They did not exceed by one iota their responsibilities under the Act.  In his opening statement the Minister referred to Section 39 which relates to the liabilities of the transferred undertakings.  Sub-section (6) of that section reads:</P>
    <P>Whenever the former undertaker is a local authority the new undertaker shall as on and from the date of the vesting order become and be by virtue of this sub-section liable for and bound to indemnify and keep indemnified the former undertaker against all capital loans (including current bank overdraft) outstanding at the date of the vesting order and borrowed by the former undertaker for the purpose of the undertaking and all mortgages and charges on the undertaking or the assets thereof outstanding on the date of the vesting order... and also the interest on such loans, mortgages, and charges from the date of the vesting order.</P>
    <P>Now, what obligation did that sub-section impose on the Board?  Merely the obligation of taking over, becoming liable for and indemnifying the former undertaker&mdash;in this case the local authority&mdash;in respect to all capital charges that might arise because of moneys borrowed by the local authority to finance the electricity supply undertaking within its area.  According to the concluding portion of this section all the Board was bound to do <Col N="1722" /> was to make provision for redeeming the loans in due course, in accordance, of course, with the terms on which the loans were originally raised, and to pay interest annually.  That was the position which the Board took up, and it was the position which Deputy Flinn informed the House they were legally advised they were bound to take up.  What was the position which the Minister wished to put them in? He wished to hamstring them to the tune of £800,000.  If there was any justification at all for granting this Board the sum of two and a half million pounds in the first instance, it was because the Minister admitted that two and a half millions was necessary to put the Board on its feet, and to enable it to provide itself with the capital, plant and equipment required to dispose of one hundred and ten million units in the small towns and villages of this country each year.  If the purpose of the Minister in asking the Dáil to grant that £2,500,000 was to ensure that the liabilities in respect of the local undertakings transferred to the Shannon Board should be immediately discharged, then the proper course for him to take was to have given the Board a certain sum which would provide for the new plant and equipment which was required, and to have asked the Dáil to authorise the Minister for Finance, in accordance with the Act, or within its terms, to discharge the liabilities of such undertakings immediately they were transferred to the Electricity Supply Board. I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Fisheries whether he is aware that acute congestion exists in the parishes of Claremorris, Ballindine and Crossboyne; and if he will state what steps, if any, are being taken by the Irish Land Commission to acquire part of the lands of Castlemacgarrett, held by Lord Oranmore and Browne, which contain over 1,500 acres, for the purpose of providing economic holdings for the tenants in those parishes whose valuations are under £10.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Fisheries whether he will state the approximate acreage of land dealt with in (a) Leix, (b) Offaly, <Col N="1576" /> during the past three years, viz.:&mdash;(1) acquired for distribution; (2) actually distributed to uneconomic holders and others, giving number of benefiting tenants; (3) land considered unsuitable, following inspector's report; and (4) estates at present under consideration by the Commissioners.</P>

      <P>I will give the Deputy the figures of lands acquired and divided during the three financial years from 31st March, 1928, to 31st March, 1931, as most readily available. During those three years the Land Commission, under the Land Acts, 1923-29, acquired for distribution 6,240 acres of land in County Leix and 9,284 acres of land in County Offaly and they divided 5,335 acres of land among 204 allottees in County Leix and 9,448 acres of land among 294 allottees in County Offaly.  It is not practicable to give the information the Deputy asks for in part 3 of his question&mdash;&ldquo;land considered unsuitable following inspector's report&rdquo;&mdash;for a particular period, as lands are frequently judged by the Land Commission as unsuitable for present action but are taken up again later for reconsideration in cases where more suitable land is not available.</P>
      <P>As to part 4 of the Deputy's question, some 8,000 acres of untenanted land in County Leix and some 12,000 acres of untenanted land in Co. Offaly, which have been inspected, are at present in process of acquisition or under the consideration of the Land Commission with a view to acquisition.  Further areas of some 9,000 acres in County Leix and some 17,000 acres in County Offaly are the subject of preliminary inquiries with a view to inspection.</P>
