      <P>I am not aware that any such report as is suggested has been circulated, but I am prepared to believe that it has.  The prisoner is, in fact, not seriously ill, but undoubtedly his health has suffered from his refusal to take exercise.  He is not allowed the privileges of writing letters or of receiving letters or visits because these privileges are granted only to prisoners who obey the prison rules.  His friends and relatives have frequently been informed to this effect. I do not understand what the Deputy means by suggesting that I should &ldquo;remedy this grievance.&rdquo;  It is within the prisoner's own power at any time to qualify for the privileges in question by obeying the prison rules.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>The outstanding financial event of the year 1930-31 was the flotation of the Third National Loan.  This loan, as Deputies are aware, had been under consideration for some months, and in the meantime Exchequer requirements had been defrayed by means of temporary borrowings.  It was felt in May of last year that conditions in the Money Market were favourable, and that it was undesirable to continue adding further to our floating debt, which had already reached fairly substantial proportions, amounting on the eve of the decision to issue the loan to nearly three and a half million pounds.  The loan was an unqualified success, a result which, in view of its terms and the price of money at the time, was very gratifying.  Contrary to the usual practice, both in Government and other issues, it did not offer investors a marginal yield greater than that obtainable by investment in our existing stocks.  The yield was, in fact, less, and not a few well-known people feared a poor response.  About the time at which we went on the market a number of other Governments were borrowing on terms much more attractive from the investor's standpoint. In May, Japan made an issue of 5½ per cent.  Stock at 90, New Zealand of 5 per cent.  Stock at 99, India of 6 per cent. Stock at 99, while in June the German Government issued a 5½ per cent. Stock at 90.  Our 4½ per cent.  Stock at 93½ offered a return, taking redemption at the final date, 1970, of £4 17s. 6d., while the <Col N="754" /> countries mentioned, calculating interest on the same basis, offered, in the case of Japan £6 13s. 8d. per cent., New Zealand £5 1s. 8d. per cent., India £6 4s. 9d. per cent., and Germany £6 13s. 8d. per cent.</P>
      <P>In consequence of events in the Money Market original subscribers to the Loan have the satisfaction today of seeing their security standing at a premium of over £7 7s. 0d. per cent. (exclusive of accrued interest) above the purchase price.  And as practically the whole of the loan was taken up at home, we need not bemoan the fact.</P>
      <P>As in the case of previous loans, we found that the success of the Third National Loan stimulated the demand for Savings Certificates, and this stimulus was strengthened by the fall in money rates, which made the terms obtainable from Savings Certificates more and more attractive.  There was in the end such an avalanche of buying that, in self-defence, we had to close down the issue.  By the 20th February last, the date of closing down, we had received a total in cash of a little over £8,000,000 from the time the issue of certificates started in June, 1923.  Cash receipts from sales in 1930-31, though covering a period five weeks short of the twelve months, exceeded by over £500,000 the record sales previously reached in the financial year 1928-29, when a total of £1,385,000 was attained.  In the five days prior to 20th February last £193,000 in cash was subscribed.</P>
      <P>Though the rate of interest on the new issue, if held to maturity, works out at £4 2s. 9d. per cent., as compared with £5 6s. 2d. on the original issue, the sales to date have been very satisfactory, amounting to £35,000 in cash in the first week, £45,000 in cash in the second, and £41,000 cash in the third.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding the fact that during the past financial year there was grave and growing economic depression throughout the world, the yield of taxation in the Saorstát was considerably in excess of the Estimate.  The consequence was that in spite of substantial outlay on relief schemes and on foot of guarantees under the Trade <Col N="755" /> Loans Act, for which no provision had been made in the original Estimates, and in spite of the fact that non-tax receipts were below the figure set out in the Estimates, it was possible to close the year with a small surplus of normal revenue over normal expenditure.</P>
    <P>Income from the duty on sugar was up by over £60,000 as compared with the previous year, and exceeded the estimate by some £34,000.  The yield of the entertainments tax was again increased, producing £20,000 more than in the year 1929-30.  It was, however, the duty on tobacco which gave the most satisfactory result of all the indirect taxes, producing £240,000 more than the estimate.  A part of the increase was due to withdrawals from bond for a new factory which was opened in Dublin and to ordinary fluctuation, but part of it was also due to additional consumption.  During the past twelve months the manufacturers of home-made matches evidently continued the process which has been going on for several years of driving their foreign competitors out of the market.  The amount collected by way of excise duty was up by £1,600, while the yield of Customs duty was down by £1,800.  It is remarkable that in every year since 1925 the tax returns have indicated a similar small increase in the consumption of home-made matches and a similar small decrease in the importation of foreign matches.  Though the change which took place in any individual year did not seem of much consequence, the cumulative effect of the Saorstát manufacturers' efforts has been that whereas six years ago one-third of the matches used here were of foreign manufacture, the fraction is now only slightly more than a fifth. The tariff on butter imposed on 21st November, 1930, produced no revenue; but on foot of the duty of 4d. per lb. fixed on 23rd January, 1931, a sum of £42,000 was collected.  The tax on wireless apparatus produced £4,500 more than last year.  In spite of the presumably deleterious effect of the hospitals' sweepstakes, the betting duty, though it yielded slightly less than in 1929-30, exceeded the estimate.</P>
    <P>The return from the taxes on beer <Col N="756" /> and spirits was definitely disappointing. In the case of the duties on spirits, as Deputies are aware, the yield which had declined very rapidly during the first few years after the establishment of the Saorstát had seemed since 1925-6 to have become practically stabilised.  In the past financial year, however, there was an appreciable decrease in consumption with the result that the Exchequer got more than £60,000 less than was anticipated. The deficit seems to have been attributable to a proportionate decrease in the use of both imported and home-made spirits.  The shortage in respect of beer duty was substantially greater, totalling £140,000.  Here, however, a considerable part of the fall was due not to declining consumption, but to a reduction of brewers' stocks. In the year 1929-30, the revenue from beer exceeded the estimate by over £120,000, because during that period brewers had thought it desirable to increase their stocks.  In the last twelve months those in charge of the industry have pursued the opposite course and the inevitable decline in Revenue has ensued.  Whether or not their policy in regard to stocks indicates the views held by brewers as to the prospects of the trade, we have no means of knowing.</P>
    <P>Coming to the direct taxes we find that return from death duties was almost £90,000 in excess of the estimate. Income Tax, together with Surtax and Super-tax, produced £50,000 more than in the previous year and exceeded the estimate by over a quarter of a million pounds.  On the other hand, Stamp duties yielded £40,000 less than in the previous year and the return from Excess Profits Duty was down by practically £50,000.  The increased sum which was obtained from Corporation Profits Tax was due principally to the fact that two years' tax from one important firm was received within the last financial year.</P>
    <P>While it cannot be anticipated that in the current year the yield of taxation will be as little affected by the slump in prices as it was in 1930/31, there are no grounds for fearing a catastrophic fall in any direction.  It is clear, however, that there is less <Col N="757" /> likelihood this year than ever before of the return of tax revenue substantially exceeding the estimate.</P>

    <P>When the aggregate of these, together with other smaller items, has been deducted from the gross total of National Debt already given, we get a net figure of £15,274,000, which may be compared with £14,779,000 last year. During the year 1930-31 the dead-weight burden of debt was therefore increased by £495,000.  This is not <Col N="758" /> a large addition relatively, and if we consider how it was brought about it will be seen to be of less importance than would appear on first view.  Included in the expenditure on Central Fund Services financed out of normal revenue is the very large provision which we make for sinking fund in respect of three National Loans and Compensation Stock.  The amount by which liability for these loans and stock was reduced during the year from that source was about £526,000, apart altogether from the sum of £566,950, representing the nominal value of compensation stock paid off during the year at the option of holders, a transaction which was financed out of borrowing.  In addition to the sum of £526,000 mentioned, a sum of over £114,000 was carried forward representing sinking fund which, owing to the state of the market, could not be applied to cancellation of stock but which created an additional asset to set against the gross liabilities of the State.  Expenditure on normal supply services included, in the Votes for the Post Office, Railways and Public Works and Buildings, annuities of which the capital portion amounted to approximately £81,000, which reduced by an equal amount the State's liability on foot of minor miscellaneous borrowings.  The total amount, therefore, by which public debt was reduced out of normal current revenue was £721,000.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, however, dead-weight debt was increased by expenditure on certain items which, for Budgetary purposes, were regarded as abnormal and not such as need be defrayed out of the proceeds of taxation. The total of this expenditure, exclusive of £550,000 for capital of the Local Loan Fund, was £370,000, of which approximately £300,000 was in respect of compensation paid for private property injured or destroyed between the years 1916 and 1923, or in respect of the replacement or restoration of public buildings destroyed during the same period.  To this must be added the increase caused by an advance of £85,000 for telephone capital.  The effect of these transactions was to increase the gross dead-weight <Col N="759" /> debt by £455,000.  When this amount is set against the total contributions to sinking fund already mentioned we find that so far as ordinary Exchequer transactions were concerned the burden of dead-weight debt was reduced by £266,000.</P>
    <P>But there are other factors affecting debt which do not arise immediately out of cash outlay.  The issue of the £6,000,000 Third National Loan at 93½ placed on the State liability in respect of £390,000, against which no cash was received into the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>In this connection I may diverge for a moment to point out that if the loan had been issued at par at 5 per cent., though there would have been no increase in the dead-weight debt as a direct result of the issue, the charge for interest in respect of an equal sum of cash raised would have been higher by £7,600 per annum than interest on Third National Loan plus sinking fund in respect of the discount.  Thus the issue of a loan at 4½ per cent. at a discount rather than at 5 per cent. at par, though it added to the nominal burden of State liability, actually reduced the yearly cash levy upon the taxpayer.  If we suppose that it had been decided to issue a 5 per cent. loan at a premium of 1 per cent., and that the flotation had been successful, the nominal total of State debt would actually have been reduced thereby, because the amount of cash received would have exceeded the face value of the stock issued.  Even in such a case, however, the taxpayer would have been worse off than at present, because the annual charge between 1930 and 1970 in respect of interest would still have exceeded by £4,800 the amount required to pay the interest and to make good the discount in respect of a like sum derived from Third National Loan.  Thus the nominal increase of debt caused by the issue of Third National Loan at a discount did not put the State in a worse financial position.</P>
    <P>I shall proceed now to other factors which influenced the debt position. There was an increase during the past twelve months of £183,000 in the face <Col N="760" /> value of the Land Bonds issued under the Land Acts, 1923-1927, for payments to the Costs Fund and to provide the State contribution to the price of tenanted land, to meet the loss on the resale of lands purchased for distribution to uneconomic holders and landless men, and for certain other purposes. Furthermore, it was found that the assets represented by creamery undertakings which had been purchased out of voted moneys in previous years required to be written down by a sum of £168,000 and £20,000, representing an advance previously made out of Revenue to the Land Commission, has been paid into the Exchequer. The total of the four items mentioned represents an increase in the dead-weight debt of £761,000.  If from this we subtract £266,000, the sum by which ordinary Exchequer transactions would have reduced the dead-weight debt, we get the net total of the addition made during the year to the nominal dead-weight burden of debt.  It is, as already stated, £495,000. The operation of the Land Act passed last month will, it is estimated, result during the present year in the issue of £1,200,000 worth of Land Bonds for the service of which the Exchequer will be solely responsible.  Thus in the current year we shall have a bigger increase in the dead-weight debt than has occurred since 1924.  After the end of the present year, however, it is anticipated that the issue of Land Bonds, the charges on which will not be covered by tenants purchase annuities, will not exceed £500,000.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note that in the figures which I have given of dead-weight debt I have not taken account of the sum which is being repaid to the British Government by means of the annuity of £250,000 authorised by the Damage to Property (Compensation) (Amendment) Act, 1926.  Neither have I taken account of the sums due in respect of the Dáil Eireann External Loans.  The effective total of these liabilities is about £5,500,000.</P>
    <P>The White Paper issued a week ago shows that the estimated amount required to maintain public services and meet other necessary public charges during the year 1931-32 is in respect of <Col N="761" /> Central Fund Services £4,442,677, and in respect of Supply Services £21,921,573, or an aggregate of £26,364,250.  From this total, in order to find the sum which must be met out of revenue, we must deduct certain items of abnormal or capital expenditure for which borrowing may properly take place.  They are as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>The total of these items is £1,131,100. When that sum has been deducted from the gross aggregate estimate of expenditure we get a figure of £25,233,150.  The amount regarded as abnormal is taken from the same subheads (with one omission) as the corresponding figure last year.  More than <Col N="762" /> half the total represents the provision of new capital for the Local Loans Fund, money which clearly should never be found by means of taxation. Of the remainder, two-thirds arises mainly from damage to property which occurred during the Anglo-Irish struggle and during the civil war, and which is now being paid for or repaired. The item from the Land Commission Vote represents an advance which will be repaid to the Exchequer with interest.  The repayment of the Dáil Eireann Internal Loan, so far as capital is concerned, represents simply the redemption of a short-term loan out of borrowed moneys.</P>
    <P>Although I have not reckoned the value of State-owned woods amongst the Exchequer assets of which I have already given a list, it is nevertheless certain that our annual expenditure on afforestation is creating a saleable commercial property the value of which it is safe to place at half its cost. We have taxes of two kinds on wireless reception.  Of these, the Customs duty on wireless apparatus is the more important, being estimated to bring in £35,000 in the present year.  When this tax was first levied in 1926 it was promised that the proceeds would be devoted to improving the broadcasting service either by erecting a number of new stations similar to the Dublin station or by erecting a centrally-situated high-power station.  It is calculated that the establishment of the high-power station at Athlone will so increase receipts both of Customs duty on wireless apparatus and licence fees that all the expenses of broadcasting, including interest on capital outlay and adequate sinking fund provisions, can be met out of income arising in connection with the reception of broadcast entertainment.  The service will then be, as it has always been contemplated it should be, a self-balancing one.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, it does not appear to be inappropriate to regard the cost of erecting and equipping the new station as a capital item which may be defrayed out of borrowed money. While expenditure under the various heads which I have mentioned is indubitably abnormal or of a capital nature, nevertheless there are certain <Col N="763" /> objections to picking a number of rather small items out of the Estimates of expenditure and separating them from the outlay which must be met out of the proceeds of taxation.  In the first place, it is a practice which might easily lead to abuse, in view of the fact that minor abnormal items will always continue to appear in the estimates, and ought, taken in bulk, to be regarded as a normal feature of our expenditure.  Moreover, it may be taken that there will be from time to time losses in connection with capital expenditure defrayed out of borrowed money, which minor capital items, if defrayed out of revenue will not do more than balance, taking one year with another.  Again the practice of picking out a number of small items to be paid out of loans is liable to be misrepresented, and so to depreciate National credit.  In view of these facts I have not included any new heads of expenditure in the list of abnormal and capital items which I have deducted from the gross aggregate estimate of expenditure.  In the ordinary course two out of the seven items at present in the list will disappear at the end of the present year, and another will become relatively unimportant. If no new items are added, the position will be reached in two or three years that deductions from the estimates in respect of abnormal expenditure will take place only in cases in which a definite asset of a realisable character is being created.</P>
    <P>In calculating what taxation is necessary, it has for several years past been found possible, and (in view of our ample sinking fund provisions) desirable to make allowance for the element of over-estimation present in the sixty-nine Votes for supply services, taking them as a group.  Last year I fixed the amount which might be allowed for over-estimation, together with savings, at £575,000.  With careful scrutiny of expenditure, outlay of the kind that I have classified as normal and non-capital should in the present year be kept short of the Estimate by a similar figure.  If we deduct, therefore, from the net Estimate for ordinary recurrent expenditure <Col N="764" /> which, as we have seen, amounts to £25,233,150, the sum of £575,000 in respect of over-estimation and savings, we get a figure of £24,658,150.  This is the amount which must be defrayed out of revenue.</P>
    <P>Turning again to the White Paper, we find it estimated that taxation at the rates at present in force will produce an income of £20,456,000, while a non-tax revenue of £4,205,000 is anticipated. The total revenue in the current financial year will consequently be £24,661,000.  When this sum is compared with £24,658,150, the net total Estimate of the amount required to provide normal services and defray other normal outlay up to 31st March next, we find that without any increase in taxation the Budget will balance with a nominal surplus.  That this should be the position for the third year in succession gives no small ground for satisfaction.  If the estimates of expenditure for the current year are compared with the Estimates which were submitted to the Dáil twelve months ago it will be seen that the cost of normal services has gone up by £459,000.  It must be pointed out, however, that the increase is not so serious as would appear at first glance.  Nearly £200,000 of the total excess is due to increased interest payments.</P>
    <P>A great part of this additional burden will be counterbalanced by additional receipts of interest from the funds and enterprises to which the major part of the extra money borrowed has been or will be advanced. About £230,000 of the estimated increase in normal expenditure is attributable to the supply services.  No figure for relief schemes appeared in the Original Estimates last year, so that £140,000 of the excess now shown over the figures of last year arises under that heading.  Of the remaining £90,000, a great portion is due to the fact that we are not this year so assiduously seeking out smaller individual items which might be classed as capital or abnormal.  As a matter of fact, if we adhered this year to the standards hitherto adopted in classifying normal and abnormal expenditure, the abnormal figure would have been increased by over £60,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="765" /> In the course of last year's Budget statement, I referred to the fact that a departmental committee had for some time been examining the problem of simplifying our income tax code and the system of administration prescribed by it. It was then hoped that the Committee which had been formed in October, 1929, might be able to report by last autumn and that it might be possible to consider their recommendations and lay proposals before the Dáil prior to the introduction of this year's Budget.  In fact, however, the investigation was found to be fraught with the greatest difficulties. Many of the more obvious ways of securing simplification were barred by the question of expense&mdash;the removal of the complexities would have meant losing the cash.  Accordingly, the task of the Committee has proved to be arduous and prolonged, and the report which has just been received consists of three hundred pages, including appendices.  Besides holding fifty formal meetings, members of the Committee engaged in a great number of informal conferences, spending a large part of their time over a period of seventeen months on examination of the problems which arose.  It has not yet been possible to consider the recommendations which have been made. If it proves possible to carry them out in their entirety, a complete overhauling of the income tax code will be involved.  Even if the recommendations, which are very drastic in character, be accepted only in part, I am satisfied that an important measure of simplification can be submitted to the House.</P>
    <P>The existing Income Tax Acts contain nearly 600 sections.  If the proposals of the Committee are adopted it will be necessary to repeal all existing enactments and pass a new Income Tax Act which could scarcely have less than 150 sections.  It would not be possible to prepare such a heavy Bill within a period of several months, but the whole matter will be dealt with without delay.</P>
    <P>A little over two years ago the Oireachtas Joint Committee, which was considering the Betting Act of <Col N="766" /> 1926 and the amendments which might be made in it, presented an Interim Report recommending the remission of the tax on betting carried on at race-meetings. The matter was, of course, entirely outside the terms of reference of the Committee, and I have observed that when a Commission or Committee of Inquiry is bursting to offer remarks on a subject which it was not asked to examine, its observations are generally more notable for zeal than for discretion.  I was not greatly impressed by the Interim Report, which certainly was not justified by any evidence submitted to the Committee.  In the two years that have elapsed the matter has formed the subject of many representations to me.  I have received several deputations and have been supplied with a number of memoranda in support of the contention that horse-racing in the Saorstát is going to be destroyed if the tax on course-betting is not removed.  I must say that, in my opinion, the case has not been proved.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly Irish racing has declined in recent years, and is still declining. Race meetings are, in very many cases, run at a loss owing to the small attendance of the public, and there is no indication of a generally increased support.  But I am quite satisfied that the tax did not do any serious direct injury to Irish racing, and that in itself it had only an inconsiderable psychological effect.  The harm was really done by the consistent propaganda which has been carried on against the tax.  As one observer put it to me: &ldquo;Before any tax was actually collected the general public were told that the tax had killed racing, and naturally the public were not going to pay expensive admission charges to view a corpse.&rdquo;  To whatever extent the imposition of the betting tax and the propaganda that followed it may have injured race meetings, I am satisfied, on the testimony of many members of the general public, that they were only minor factors in damping down interest in racing.  The position remains, however, that while racing executives have been blaming the tax, and while I and others responsible for the tax have had <Col N="767" /> some difficulty in repressing our inclination to blame the racing executives and others in control, the sport or business itself has been getting into a more and more depressed condition. Now I acknowledge that the maintenance of racing is essential to the prosperity of the horse-breeding industry. The sum obtained from the tax on racecourse betting is not large and has been declining.  Consequently, without hope of any important direct result, but with the object of putting those who are in control of racing in the position of having nobody to blame but themselves, I propose to insert in the forthcoming Finance Bill a section remitting the tax on racecourse betting.</P>
    <P>I hope that after that beneficent gesture I may be permitted to offer a few observations that will be almost in the nature of advice.  When the novelty of dog-racing first wore off, the attendances began to dwindle.  The owners of the tracks, however, reduced the admission charges very considerably, speeded up the programmes, added to the number and value of the races, and introduced special features of various kinds.  The result, I am informed&mdash;I have not gone to the dogs&mdash; is that attendances are as high as ever before.  Moreover, in certain cases recently where horse-racing executives have introduced special attractions, there has been a good response by the race-going public.  Finally, let me say that I think there is too much horse-racing in the Saorstát.  Last year racing took place on 122 days, 53 of which were devoted to meetings held at courses convenient to Dublin.  In addition there are large numbers of point-to-point meetings, which are, I gather, better attended in many cases than the regular meetings.  Economic conditions being what they are, I think if we are to have better race meetings we shall have to have fewer of them.</P>
    <P>In last year's British Budget the scale of death duties was increased in the higher ranges.  As a consequence, if no change is made in the Saorstát scale the operation of the Double Taxation Relief Agreement will cause us to lose taxation to the extent of £12,000 per annum solely for the benefit of the British Exchequer.  On <Col N="768" /> the other hand, if we adjust our scale in the ranges affected to the British level the loss will be avoided and some £16,000 to £18,000 additional taxation will be collected.  It is proposed now to adopt the British scale up to our existing maximum.  The extra receipt this year will be only £6,000, but in future years, as already indicated, a sum of £28,000 to £30,000 will be involved.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to make two other changes of a minor character in the law relating to death duties.  In Great Britain there have been many attempts to avoid liability to tax on a life interest in an estate passing at death. The method adopted is the formation of a company to which is transferred not only the interest of the holder, but also the interest of the person entitled to succeed, so that when the former dies the estate does not pass and no tax is payable, the interest of the heir or reversioner having already been transferred to the company.  Both the holder in whose lifetime the interest is transferred and the person entitled to succession usually receive certain shares in the company and annuities from it, which are equivalent to the income they would have received from the estate transferred.  Recently it has been learned that such companies are being formed and such transfers made in the Saorstát.  It is accordingly proposed to introduce into the Finance Bill a section somewhat similar to the provisions already existing in Great Britain to deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>By Section 20 of the Finance Act of 1896 it is provided in case of pictures or other works of art suitable for a place in a national collection their value shall not be taken into account in computing the estate duties payable on the death of the owner.  But if they are afterwards sold, duty is payable on the value as at the date of death. The works of art, however, are deemed to be a separate estate and not aggregated with the other assets of the deceased.  The consequence is that the rate of duty charged on the value of the pictures or other works of art is much less than the rate charged on the other assets of the deceased.  The position thus created is anomalous. <Col N="769" /> There is no logical reason why, if a man's general estate bears duty at the rate of twenty-five per cent., the duty charged in respect of valuable pictures which he owned and which were sold by his heirs or executors should be only five per cent.  The British Parliament last year amended the law so that in future British tax will be chargeable on the price of works of art, when sold, at the same rate as on the rest of the estate.  In the case of certain estates failure on our part to enact a similar section would mean that the Saorstát Exchequer would fail to get its fair share of the total tax levied.</P>
    <P>Before I pass away from the question of death duties and in connection with the fact that we have more than once felt constrained to alter our scale of estate duties simply because the British scale had been altered, and we were threatened with loss of revenue if we adhered to our old scale, I should like to say that the Government has come to the conclusion that the present arrangement for affording relief from double estate duty and double legacy duty falls in various respects so far short of being fully satisfactory from the Saorstát point of view that it has been decided to open up negotiations with the British Government with a view to finding a more suitable method of dealing with this aspect of the problem of double taxation.</P>
    <P>For some time past the silent film has been going out of use in picture houses in the Saorstát, as in picture houses elsewhere, and the long queues in the streets testify to the popularity of the sound film and to the large sums of money which are going to support it.  It is supplanting not merely the silent picture but also the orchestra. It has been felt for some time that the rate of tax which was appropriate to silent films was an insufficient levy on talkies.  They are not only a more complex product, but their attractiveness to the public enables them to bear more tax.  Further, they are also more effective agents for the reduction of our revenue in other directions than the old films.  I propose, therefore, that the Customs duties on sound <Col N="770" /> films, whether they themselves bear the sound record or whether they are adapted for use with a separate sound record, shall be increased from one penny to threepence per linear foot. The higher tax will bring in additional revenue to the extent of £32,000 this year and £35,000 next year.</P>
    <P>For a considerable time the revenue obtained from dramatic and musical entertainments by artistes personally present has been declining.  The competition of the sound films in the Saorstát, which will not be affected by the increase in duty proposed, is such that, economic and linguistic factors being what they are, there is grave danger that in future practically all entertainment, apart from that transmitted on the electric wave, will come in, like our apricots, in tins.  It is proposed to remit as from the 1st October next the entertainment tax on entertainments consisting mainly of performances by artistes personally present.  The change will be for the convenience of the public and of the officers of the Revenue.  At present concerts and dramatic entertainments given in aid of charities are exempt from duty, subject to compliance with certain conditions, as are also entertainments of an educational character.  In all such cases, however, application for exemption must be made in advance to the Revenue authorities, and in a certain number of cases accounts must afterwards be furnished showing the disposition of the proceeds.  In future this trouble will be obviated.  The cost of the concession in the present year will be about £9,000.</P>
    <P>On several occasions representatives of the Chambers of Commerce of the Saorstát have urged that the capital duty payable by companies on their formation should be reduced from £1 per cent. to 5/- per cent., the rate at which it stood prior to 1920.  The immediate financial loss following a reduction of the duty would be small, say, £5,000 per annum, allowing for a certain resultant increase in the nominal capital of some of the companies floated hereafter.  Since the business community regard the concession as one worth asking for, and as it is felt that in the long run the revenue sacrificed <Col N="771" /> will be more than made good in income tax and stamp duties, it has been decided to make the reduction in this year's Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>The net effect of the minor tax changes to which I have referred will be in the present year to reduce our tiny, estimated surplus by £1,000.  In future years there will be a small gain.</P>
    <P>Deputies have doubtless been expecting that I should make some reference to the question of derating. The reports of the Commission have been circulated, and I think I should take this opportunity of thanking the Chairman, Judge Davitt, and all his colleagues for the thorough and painstaking manner in which they have examined a very important and intricate problem, and for the able and valuable reports which they have prepared. Many members of the Commission took part in its work at much inconvenience to themselves, and I think we have reason for gratitude in the fact that citizens of standing are so willing to sacrifice their time and energy in the study of public problems in regard to which the Government and Oireachtas are called upon to take decisions and in respect of which they are in need of impartial and well-informed advice.  Though there were great divergencies of opinion amongst the members of the Commission, who were so chosen as to be representative of widely different areas and points of view, nevertheless on many matters of the highest importance they were unanimous or practically so.  In regard to the question whether or not we ought to have in the Saorstát de-rating on the British model the Majority and Minority were of one mind.  Even the Minority member, who presented a separate report, was not in favour of the complete derating of agricultural land.  The Commission were practically unanimous in considering that no benefit would be obtained by transferring to the Central Government the cost of administration of services at present managed by the local authorities.  The members of the Commission were also agreed on the impossibility of attaching conditions <Col N="772" /> to any grants that might be given in relief of agriculture.</P>
    <P>It has long been pretty generally recognised that if agricultural land in the Saorstát were completely relieved of rates, as it is in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, local government would, for all practical purposes, have to be abolished, and a conviction that local government ought to be retained was obviously one of the factors which influenced the signatories of the first Minority Report against recommending total remission of rates on agricultural land and buildings.  In that report, however, it is also recognised that the imposition of the taxation required to raise so large a sum as £2,230,000 per annum, the cost of total de-rating, would be a grave matter for the State as a whole.  If the problem dealt with by the Commission is studied in perspective, it will be apparent that the salient feature of the reports is, not the disagreement of members as to whether or not necessary and practicable relief to agriculture should once again take the form of grants towards the reduction of rates, but rather the unanimous opposition of the Commission to that demand for complete de-rating which has got a certain vogue in the Saorstát as a result of British legislation.  The signatories of the Majority Report held the view that de-rating would not appreciably increase agricultural production, and that if money were available for the relief of agriculture it should be expended on an extension of various schemes which are already being promoted by the Department of Agriculture. More active encouragement of cow-testing and further improvement of marketing methods, particularly in the direction of grading and, as far as possible, standardising produce, may be cited as examples of the means which the majority would adopt to help agriculture, believing that the direct method of stimulating production has many advantages over any indirect method such as the total or partial remission of agricultural rates.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the signatories of the first Minority Report, while quite in favour of the methods of increasing agricultural production suggested by <Col N="773" /> the Majority, hold that none of them seems capable of achieving the object in view at an early date.  They also state that they are satisfied that the remission of rates on agricultural land and farm buildings would have a very beneficial effect in securing an increase of production and employment in agriculture. On the matters in regard to which they are in disagreement, the two sections of the Commission have stated their views temperately, and, obviously, with a strong sense of responsibility. Although the Government finds itself in agreement with most of the conclusions set forth in the Majority Report, it accepts the view of the Minority that the means suggested by the Majority for increasing agricultural production would give results too slowly to improve appreciably the position of the farmer within the next few years.  In fact, so much is being done already along the lines referred to that any great, immediate increase in expenditure and activity on the part of the Department of Agriculture would be largely barren of results because the new activities would meet with proportionately less public response than the activities being carried out at present.  While the Government agrees that the public attention which has been focussed on the mere matter of rates is excessive, and that even a complete remission of rates would in the majority of cases probably affect production only in a very minor way; while it is satisfied that the Majority Report disposes of many of the contentions on which it has been sought to base claims for complete or partial de-rating, the Government is, nevertheless, convinced that the present position in agriculture is such that a substantial measure of relief is an economic necessity.</P>
    <P>Farmers, taken collectively, are pretty certainly neither over-taxed nor under-served, as many of them think they are.  On the other hand, though they are incomparably the most important group of producers in the State, it is doubtful whether they manage to get their fair share of the fruits of national production.  Bankers meet and fix interest levels; transport workers have unions which maintain <Col N="774" /> wage-rates; traders have various ways of discouraging unlimited price-cutting; the majority of Saorstát industrialists have now the shelter of the protective tariffs, but the farmer must sell his bullock or his pig at the price of the day in a completely free market. His position is much what the position of the city worker would be if there were no trade unions.  One of the reasons why farmers do not pay much income tax either in this or any other country is that very big fortunes are not made out of agriculture.  A small shopkeeper might be so successful that he would become the owner of hundreds of shops and ultimately win all the yacht races of the world.  But who ever heard of a man who started life as a small farmer, and stuck to farming, becoming the owner of a yacht? A man may start making soap in his kitchen, or motor cars in a shed in his back-yard, and become a multi-millionaire. But however hard the farmer works, and however great his enterprise, he will never, unless he deserts agriculture, become the pride and joy of the Inland Revenue.  Not only is the agriculturist denied the possibilty of making great profits, but in a time of falling prices such as the present he suffers severely from the fact that when the price-level of primary products falls, the price of manufactured goods does not suffer a corresponding decline until after a considerable interval. Thus, as a producer, he must sell cheaply, but, as a consumer, he has to continue to buy dearly.  It is true the prices of his raw materials will always tend to drop equally with other primary products.</P>
    <P>At present, for example, the prices of feeding-stuffs and manures have fallen on the average even more than the prices of agricultural produce.  But many other things that the farmer must buy are proportionately too expensive and his economic position in too many cases tends to become precarious. Moreover, the psychological effects of the de-rating of agricultural land in Great Britain and Northern Ireland are not to be neglected.  If no steps were taken to give any new relief to farmers in the Saorstát, there might grow up amongst them a sense of discouragement <Col N="775" /> which would have damaging economic consequences.  I believe with the majority of the De-rating Commission that in most cases rating relief will do little to increase production. In many cases, however, it will help appreciably to prevent the curtailment of production and, taking the country as a whole, there will be a fair number of cases in which it will effect some measure of stimulation.  Even where economic results may not be discernible, it will to some extent hearten the workers in an industry which is passing through a difficult period and which can be assisted in no other way. It has been suggested that if a grant in relief of rates is now given, it should be a temporary grant.  There are those who think that the economic depression which is afflicting nearly the whole world at present will shortly begin to clear away.  Even if it does, the benefit of improving conditions will not reach our agricultural population for some time.  Consequently any relief given now must be continued for a few years and grants which have been payable for several years cannot be withdrawn or reduced without upsetting local finances.  It is proposed to ask the Dáil to vote a sum of £750,000 for the relief of rates on agricultural land.</P>
    <P>[<i>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle took the Chair.</i>]</P>
    <P>A good deal of consideration has been given to the question of how the grant now proposed to be given ought to be distributed.  We are clearly of opinion that it ought not to be distributed on the basis of rate assessments either for the current year or for last year or for the last three years.  To adopt that basis would be to penalise those counties the affairs of which had been prudently and economically administered and to reward the counties which had had wasteful and extravagant councils.  Though it was decided in 1925 that the new agricultural grant then given should be distributed on the same basis as the old agricultural grant, it is felt that that basis has now become a somewhat arbitrary one.  Its principal recommendations are usage and the fact that the <Col N="776" /> different counties have become accustomed to it and accepted it in 1925 without protest.  We must take care, however, not to magnify the elements of unfairness in it.  On the other hand, the task of estimating the needs of the various counties on the assumption that they were all run with equal economy and efficiency would be long and difficult, if not impossible.  But it would appear that population would afford a rough guide to requirements. It is the usual practice when different countries are joined together in a Customs Union to divide the customs on the basis of population.  In States in which a proportion of the revenue collected by the federal authority is distributed to provincial governments population is commonly the basis of division.  It is not, however, certain that to distribute £750,000 to the various counties in proportion to their population would be entirely fair unless certain adjustments were made for special circumstances.  In any case, distribution on the basis of population solely would represent too violent a change.  Taking the view that the old basis had, when first adopted, a justification which retains at least some degree of validity, the Government have decided that the new grant shall be divided as to 50 per cent. on the old basis and as to the remaining 50 per cent. on the basis of the population of the counties.  Distributed in this way a bigger share of the grant will go to the poorer and more thickly populated areas than was the case with former grants.</P>
    <P>The Government does not feel that any permanent benefit to the farmers of the Saorstát would result from a grant of £750,000 towards the reduction of rates on agricultural land if no reform in the system of local government were carried out.  To say that relief of rates would automatically be followed by a new increase of rates is not to make an attack on the members of county councils.  The signatories of the Majority Report of the Commission, approaching the matter from another angle, have dealt with the point very fairly.  They show that the present doubled agricultural grant is equal to the total amount of rates <Col N="777" /> levied off agricultural land in 1897, and that the net rates now levied off these hereditaments represent increases since that date.  It cannot be denied, as they indicate, that many cases exist where increased expenditure could be justified as either necessary or, at any rate, extremely desirable. The fact that the State had already on several occasions relieved rates on agricultural lands and buildings would justify an expectation on the part of local authorities that the State would do so again.  This expectation in its turn would encourage new expenditure.  If the relief which it is now proposed to give is not to be neutralised within a few years, it is necessary to make substantial alterations in the system of local government which will check the tendency to fresh expenditure.  In any case it has long been apparent that our present system has grave defects which militate against efficiency.  Accordingly, it is proposed to introduce, at a very early date, proposals for the reform of the county councils.  The work of the boards of health will be drawn in to the county councils, the size of which will be substantially reduced.  At present, even when a council has only a normal number of wind-bags, the whole time of a meeting is frequently wasted on a few unimportant items. The consequence is that many of the men who would make the best type of local representative are increasingly unwilling to serve as members of councils.  With a reduction of the number of members it is anticipated that the number of wind-bags on the various councils will decrease more than proportionately. It is proposed to introduce a managership system for counties somewhat similar to that in operation in Dublin and Cork.  It is believed that the reforms contemplated will not only tend to prevent unjustifiable increases in expenditure but will in many cases enable sound economies to be effected.</P>
    <P>Having decided that, with the assent of the Dáil, we shall issue to local authorities the sum of £750,000, the question of where the money is to be got arises.  The signatories of the First Minority Report recommended an <Col N="778" /> increase in the income tax and a duty on petrol.  The suggestion that the income tax should be increased has been carefully examined, and the Government has decided to reject it.  It is true that, if efficiently and impartially collected, the income tax is a just tax. But if it is levied at a high rate it undoubtedly tends to lessen enterprise and is a definite handicap to the progressive and expanding business in which development is being capitalised out of profits.  Such businesses, though all too rare in the Saorstát, are the best hope of sound industrial growth. We believe that if the prospects of economic progress are not to be compromised, an industrially undeveloped country like this cannot have a higher income tax rate than 3/- in the pound, which only seems moderate because we have recently come out of a period of abnormally high rates and because in Great Britain, a country with enormous accumulations of capital, tax is charged at a rate in excess of ours. When our income tax rate was brought down to its present level, it was anticipated that there would be a certain national recovery of ownership of capital through the return to the Saorstát of those who owned it.  That recovery has to some extent taken place and will take place further if our tax rate is kept stable.  The recovery of capital to which I refer also means a recovery of national income and, consequently, more income tax, with, it is hoped, more death duties to follow.  If we increase our income tax rate now, uncertainty as to the future will arise, and the tendency towards further national recovery of the ownership of capital along these lines will be checked.  In this connection also it may be noted that we get every year very large sums of income tax and surtax from wealthy people who maintain houses here, but whose principal residences are in England and whose ties with the Saorstát are not as close as formerly.  They are the sort of people to whom income tax is a very important matter.  It is held in certain quarters that for some of them the fact that we have a 3/- income tax invests the country with greater charm than the effect of horses, foxes, salmon, family association and <Col N="779" /> scenery combined.  Local authorities spend money, and wisely spend money, on the development of tourist traffic, but from the revenue standpoint the visits of the people to whom I am referring are vastly more important than the whole tourist traffic.  If a mere handful of them stopped coming to the Saorstát it might mean a revenue loss of £200,000 to £250,000 a year.</P>
    <P>Though an increase in the income tax would not penalise the wealthy double-residents in question, it might affect their attitude to the country and in certain cases determine them against a visit.  Should we decide, however, to increase the income tax rate, the maximum increase practicable would be 6d. in the pound.  If our rate went above 3/6 we should be obliged to abolish the Corporation Profits Tax, which is a tax chargeable on the profits of companies but not recoverable even by shareholders exempt from income tax.  If we did not do so and our income tax was appreciably above 3/6, we should have industrial and commercial concerns here which were paying tax on their profits at a rate in excess of the English income tax rate of 4/6.  Moreover, we could hardly put more than 6d. additional on the income tax without giving something like the British scale of reliefs.  But if we were to give allowances on the full British scale and remit Corporation Profits Tax, the net produce of an additional 1/- tax in a full year would be only about £250,000.  Even if we imposed only an increase of 6d., certain additional reliefs by way of children's allowances, etc., would have to be given, and it would be difficult to get more than £300,000 additional revenue in a normal year.  But an additional 6d. on the income tax imposed now would not give us anything like that figure before 31st March next. A good deal of this year's tax will not be collected until after the end of the financial year.  Moreover, our income tax revenue includes an element of arrears of tax.  An increase in the current rate would undoubtedly delay the payment of arrears.  It might be two or three years before we should get from an extra 6d. its full theoretical <Col N="780" /> yield.  An extra 6d. imposed now, with allowances half-way between our present scale and the British scale, would yield a little over £150,000 before 31st March next, so that the imposition of other taxes to bring in £600,000 would be necessary.  In all the circumstances we were convinced that we ought not to propose any increase of the income tax.</P>
    <P>[<i>An Ceann Comhairle resumed the Chair.</i>]</P>
    <P>The levying of a duty on petrol stands on a different footing, though the bulk of those on whom it will fall are income tax payers.  There has been general expectation for some years that such a duty would be imposed.  If consumers will not exactly be glad that the suspense is ended, at least they are prepared for the worst.  Although there is now an import duty of 6d. on petrol in the neighbouring country, I shall not ask the Dáil to vote so heavy a tax here.  In this country owing, it is said, to greater costs of distribution, retail prices are higher, allowing for duty, than in Great Britain.  Furthermore, every motorist in this country must pay customs duty on his car, whereas in Great Britain most motorists use English cars, on which no duty is payable.  I think, therefore, it would be undesirable to impose a higher duty than 4d. a gallon, which is the amount I propose.  This levy will only bring the import price of petrol up to the level at which it stood four or five years ago.  In view of the present relative levels of wholesale and retail prices it ought not to be necessary for the whole of the duty to be passed on to the public.  The 4d. tax will yield revenue before 31st March amounting to £450,000.  There remains £300,000 to be got by some other tax.</P>
    <P>At first it was thought that an increase in the tobacco duty might afford the best means of obtaining this sum.  But the tax on tobacco is already very high, higher in proportion to the value of the article than on any other commodity except saccharine, and it appeared questionable whether an increase could be borne without checking the consumption.  Last year there was a sharp rise in the yield of tobacco duty, but part of the increase <Col N="781" /> was due, as has already been stated, to withdrawals from bond for a new factory which was established in Dublin and to the ordinary fluctuations which take place from year to year.  On the whole, receipts from the tobacco tax have been merely steady with a slight tendency to rise.  It is well known that in recent years there has been a considerable increase in smoking by women, but when we put that fact alongside the fact that the Exchequer receipts from tobacco have little more than maintained their level, we are driven to the conclusion that the retail price of tobacco is already so high, having regard to existing wage levels and prices of produce, that many men must have been obliged to curtail their consumption. I do not accept the other possible explanation that men are giving up smoking because they regard it as an effeminate habit.  When a taxable commodity is very dear and the tax yield static it is dangerous to increase the duty.  Those who hold that no moderate increase in the levy on tobacco could appreciably affect its fruitfulness as a source of revenue forget the possibility that if retail prices were raised further, people might begin to give up cigarette smoking for pipe smoking, thereby cutting down their consumption of tobacco and their contribution to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>We have come to the conclusion that from the Exchequer point of view it would not be prudent to increase the duty on tobacco.  Although the standard rate of duty in Great Britain is 8d. per lb. higher than the Saorstát rate, the operation of Imperial preference, which does not exist here in relation to tobacco, has the effect of reducing substantially the average rate of duty paid in Great Britain.  As more and more Empire leaf is used in Great Britain, the average rate of duty paid on tobacco imported into that country will fall below the rate of duty payable on importation into the Saorstát.</P>
    <P>Taxation designed to produce a large sum such as £300,000, must be levied on commodities of general consumption. The duties so frequently advocated on little-used articles of a highly <Col N="782" /> luxury character would bring in practically no revenue.  Consequently, a tax on tobacco being considered unwise, and additional duties on alcoholic liquors being out of the question, we must look for the sum we require to articles of necessity.</P>
    <P>Although tea is not an absolute necessity of life, it is reckoned, more especially by the poorest of our people, as such.  We frequently hear it said that they drink too much tea, but taxation, unless carried to altogether unthinkable lengths, will not change their habits.  Consequently, if we levy a duty on tea we shall impose a burden, from which they will take no steps to escape, upon the section of our people which can least afford to bear it.</P>
    <P>Sugar is a more valuable item of consumption than tea, but it is not looked upon as so indispensable by the poor.  Furthermore, the price of sugar is now phenomenally low.  An additional duty of ½d.. per lb. would not suffice to bring it up to the level at which it stood less than three years ago when the import price was 12/4 per cwt. as compared with about 6/4 per cwt. at the end of last month.  On the other hand, an increased tax of ½d. per lb., or 4/8 per cwt., would, in the present financial year, give a return to the Exchequer of £315,000, or slightly more than the sum required.  It is accordingly proposed to levy an additional Customs duty of that amount, together with a consequential increase in the rates of duty on sugar, confectionery and composite sugar articles.</P>
    <P>In this connection I must have regard to the fact that a considerable proportion of our requirements of sugar is now made at home.  The subsidy in the Beet Sugar Act of 1925 payable to the Irish Sugar Manufacturing Company is restricted by agreement to a production of 125,000 tons, spread over a ten year period.  During the first three years of the ten year period there was no limit to the quantity of sugar which the company might make in any one year for subsidy purposes. The agreement provided, however, that during the fourth and fifth year no more than 10,000 tons per annum should be made for subsidy <Col N="783" /> purposes, and that in the sixth or any subsequent year the production for subsidy purposes should be limited to 15,000 tons per annum.  In 1926, the first year of the subsidy period, 9,843 acres of sugar beet were grown, and from that year's crop 11,979 tons of sugar were made.  In 1927 the acreage was 17,698 and the production of sugar was 18,066 tons.  In 1928 the corresponding figures were 16,624 acres and 19,519 tons.  The restriction as to annual production was, as already mentioned, first to operate in respect of the 1929 crop and the manufacturing season of 1929-1930.  Were the company to restrict their contracts for the growing of beet to such acreage as was calculated to produce only 10,000 tons of sugar, the area devoted to beet would have had to be very considerably reduced. This was obviously not desirable, particularly so from the growers' point of view, and accordingly I came to an understanding with the company that, in addition to manufacturing 10,000 tons of sugar for subsidy purposes, they might manufacture to the full capacity of the factory, and that in respect of the quantity of sugar produced in excess of 10,000 tons, the company should receive benefit of the then existing Customs duty of 11/8 per cwt., without the imposition of a countervailing excise duty, provided they passed on this benefit to the growers in the price they paid for beet.  Under this arrangement the production in 1929-30 and 1930-31 was not limited to 10,000 tons per annum, and the negotiations as to the price to be paid for beet of this year's growth proceeded on a like basis, namely, that the company would enjoy a protection of 11/8 per cwt. in respect of such quantity of sugar in excess of 15,000 tons as they might manufacture during the coming season.</P>
    <P>It is now proposed, for purely revenue purposes, to increase the Customs duty on sugar from 11/8 per cwt. to 16/4 per cwt.  It is not proposed, however, to permit either party&mdash;the Sugar Company or the beet growers&mdash;to benefit from this increased duty.  We are satisfied that the company are receiving sufficient help from the taxpayers&mdash;sufficient <Col N="784" /> to provide for reasonable depreciation of the factory and to provide reasonable dividends for the shareholders, and at the same time to enable the company to pay a reasonable price for beet.  It is proposed, therefore, to take such steps as will leave the company and the beet growers in the same position as they would have been had no change in the Customs duty on sugar been proposed.  To achieve this end it is proposed to impose an Excise duty of 4/8 per cwt. on sugar manufactured from home-grown beet.  Four shillings and eightpence represents the difference between the existing import duty of 11/8 per cwt. and the proposed new total duty of 16/4 per cwt.  This Excise duty will be payable by the Sugar Company on such quantity of sugar as they have in stock, and, of course, in respect of their future production. This arrangement will leave the net protection enjoyed by the company on non-subsidised sugar at the figure at which it stood last year, viz., 11/8 per cwt. of sugar, and as a necessary corollary it is proposed to insert in the Bill a provision which will ensure that the position as between the company and the beet growers is not affected by the increase in the Customs duty on sugar.</P>
    <P>Of the total of £750,000 which it is proposed to raise by the taxes on petrol and sugar, only a relatively small portion will fall to be paid by the farmers of the Saorstát.  The new grant in relief of rates will definitely shift a substantial burden of taxation from the shoulders of agriculturists to the shoulders of other sections of the community.  Our financial prospects do not admit of more being done.  Even should there be no great fall in the yield of taxation during the current year the balancing of next year's Budget will not be an easy matter.  The Estimates of miscellaneous receipts contain important non-recurrent items such as repayment of advances made some years ago out of revenue to the National Land Bank and to the Land Commission, some of which it had been intended to recall last year, but the unexpectedly good yield of tax revenue made it unnecessary.  It seems certain that such outstanding reserves will <Col N="785" /> have to be used up in the present year, and if this time next year the imposition of fresh taxation for ordinary Budget purposes is to be avoided it will only be by a very special drive for economy being made during the next six or eight months.  I understand that the Economy Committee which has been operating under the chairmanship of Deputy Heffernan and which, as I have stated on previous occasions, has already made valuable suggestions to the Department of Finance, is nearing the end of its examination of the entire field of Government expenditure. With the support derived from the recommendations of the Committee, I hope it will be possible to carry through measures of retrenchment sufficient at least to fill any gaps caused by shrinkage in the yield of taxation or the disappearance of individual items of non-tax revenue.  Much will depend on the general trend of economic affairs throughout the world.  A comparatively slight improvement would prevent our Budgetary difficulties from increasing.  On the other hand, worse conditions outside our borders would in many ways react unfavourably on the Saorstát.</P>
    <P>While we may hope for the best, we must prepare for something less satisfactory. Our present relatively good economic position, and the fact that we have again been able to close a financial year with a surplus and to balance the ordinary Budget for the coming year without an increase in taxation, are due to our having in the past declined to embark on rash schemes of expenditure and to our having endeavoured to keep in check increased outlay even on the most desirable objects.  I am convinced that if the same line of policy is pursued in future in, if possible, a more rigid spirit of economy, we shall be able to escape all the major difficulties under which so many countries are at present struggling.</P>

      <P>It is usual for us at this stage simply to comment in a formal way on the Budget statement made by the Minister for Finance. Every Deputy probably came into the House as I did, expecting one principal item, namely, the item which would indicate the extent of the immediate relief which the Minister proposed for the farmers.  I am sure that most of us, whether we express it by our votes or not, are genuinely disappointed&mdash;disappointed that after all the promises that have been made by the Government of relief for the farming community, the £1,000,000 which was specifically mentioned on previous occasions should now be cut down by one quarter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When certain elections were on and the Executive Council wanted the support of the farming community they told the electors that they realised the depressed condition of agriculture and that it was their intention in this Budget to come to the relief of the farmers.  It was admitted by members of the Executive Council that our farmers were severely handicapped in competition with the farmers of Great Britain and Northern Ireland by the fact that de-rating operated in Great Britain and Northern <Col N="787" /> Ireland, while our farmers had to pay to the full all the local rates.  A million pounds was promised, and now they propose to give £750,000.  We have had the De-rating Commission Report before us, and some of us, at any rate, expected that the one important suggestion in that report might have been adopted, and that in so far as relief was being given by way of de-rating a system of distribution would have been chosen by which there would have been relief given, in particular, to the smaller farmers.  We had hoped if the Government proposed to give indirect relief to the farming community by way of relief of rates that they would have adopted that system by which those under £15 or £20 valuation would have been relieved of their rates on agricultural land, and that a similar relief up to the £15 or £20 would have been afforded to those of higher valuation. The sum of money required to do that would have been just about £750,000, and there would have been available, if the full relief of one million pounds were to be given, a still further sum of £250,000 to be distributed in some such equitable way.  Notwithstanding all the fault that the Minister found with the existing system, at least fifty per cent of the £750,000 is to be distributed in the same manner as before. We have not had an opportunity of examining how this distribution partly on the basis of population will work out, but it seems to me, at any rate, that when the Minister was giving relief it was a pity he did not adopt that other suggestion.</P>
    <P>As to the manner in which he proposes to raise the money, with the petrol tax as a whole we have not much fault to find&mdash;at least I have not. But when it comes to the tax on sugar the position is quite different.  Already the percentage of indirect taxation, as compared with direct taxation, is very high here, much higher, I think, than in most other countries.  Yet, just as when he wants economy he thinks of the old age pensions and cuts them down, so too when he wants to get £300,000 he proceeds to filch it out of the pockets of the poorer section of the community, including, of course, the <Col N="788" /> farmers, particularly the small farmers. The suggestion, with which we agreed, which came from the Labour Benches when my motion was put forward in the House, that in whatever manner the money for the relief of agriculture was to be found it should not be found in a manner which would impose a burden upon the small farmer, whom it was ostensibly intended to relieve has not been adopted.  The Minister makes no discrimination between the large holder and the small holder of land as far as relief is concerned, and, in fact, the relief is bound to work out for the benefit of the larger land holders only. As far as the benefit is concerned, no discrimination is made in favour of the small holders, and when it comes to raising the taxation discrimination is made as against the small holders, because, proportionately, the small holder is going to bear the burden of this taxation very much more than the large holder.  I think that the feelings which I have expressed are likely to be echoed not merely here on the Opposition Benches, but, I am sure, in the hearts of many Deputies who are supporting the Government at present, and that they will be re-echoed throughout the country.  It is a disappointing Budget, disappointing as regards the relief proposed to be given to the farming community, and as regards the manner in which the money is to be raised.</P>
    <P>A great deal can be said for and against income tax, but, as far as I am concerned at any rate, and as far as any studies I have made in the matter would guide me.  I see no reason at the present time why, if an extra burden is to be imposed it should be imposed by way of indirect taxation and imposed on a necessary of life.  The Minister's own argument from his own point of view would have indicated that portion of it could be borne&mdash;at least half of it&mdash;by direct taxation.  With an increase of 6d. in the £ in income tax the Minister could have got half the total balance required and that should have been raised in that particular manner instead of putting the whole burden upon a necessary of life.</P>
    <P>With regard to the balancing of the Budget, we had to complain in the past <Col N="789" /> about the manner in which the Minister segregated the normal and abnormal items, and we found it very difficult to find exactly the basis on which he made the segregation.  There is one item this year&mdash;it has appeared, of course, in the past also&mdash;which it seems to me is unjustifiably put down as abnormal or capital expenditure, that is the sum of about £190,000 for public buildings.  There is no indication that depreciation in buildings is allowed for.  If depreciation, as I think, is not allowed for, then obviously this sum, or a great portion of it, ought to be regarded from year to year as normal and not abnormal expenditure. I feel that that item is not properly classed, and that to balance the Budget that sum will have to be met out of taxation.  With regard to the other changes, as I have said, the principal item was that of the relief of agriculture or failure to give relief, and the manner in which the money was proposed to be raised.  The other items, such as the betting tax and so on, are comparatively small items, and we shall have an opportunity of examining them in detail when we come to discuss the main resolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>While we might feel inclined to offer our personal congratulations to the Minister for Finance on having created something like a record in introducing his eighth successive Budget, in this House, we are not by any means of the same mind as to the nature of the Budget he has introduced.  So far as we on these benches are concerned, we must, at the very outset, express our profound disappointment with the proposals laid before us for consideration.  Once again the Minister has produced what can only be described as a rich man's Budget, and the people who will clap him on the back for having produced these proposals will be, in the main, the better-off members of the community. The main feature of the Budget, as Deputy de Valera pointed out, is the proposal to give relief to the farmer.  There are many disappointing features in connection with that.  There is no distinction made whatsoever as between the man who holds a large amount of land and <Col N="790" /> makes very little use of it so far as the community is concerned, and the farmer who, on the other hand, uses his land to the best advantage from the general community point of view. I do not at all accept the view of the De-rating Commission that it is impossible to make this distinction.  I believe a plan could be devised whereby such a distinction could be made. That is one feature of the Budget, and it is a very objectionable feature.  But, as already pointed out, the greatest objection is to the method in which it is proposed to find a very great proportion of the relief that is proposed to be given to the farmer, because the farmers themselves are going to find a large share of it&mdash;at least so far as half of it is concerned.  That is what it amounts to.</P>
      <P>I cannot at all agree with the statement made by the Minister that this halfpenny a lb. on sugar will not fall upon the farmer to any great extent. Do the farmers take their tea without sugar?  Certainly not, in my experience, although some of them may be forced to do so in the future.  In any case the proportion of the relief the small farmer will get by this proposal is very small.  I believe that in many case it will be found that the small farmer or landowner from the West will be paying as much or more in the tax of a halfpenny in the lb. on sugar than he will get in relief of rates.  I believe many cases will be found where the small farmer or landowner would be better off if he got no relief of rates under this proposal, because he will have to pay more in sugar tax than he will get by way of relief.</P>
      <P>The petrol tax is bound to be passed to him to a great extent.  The travelling shops and merchants who have to pay extra petrol tax will undoubtedly, to a very large extent, endeavour to pass on that tax to the small farmers, so that the very small measure of relief that the farmer is to get will be more apparent than real under these proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is typical and characteristic of the present Government to refuse to increase the income tax.  That is a tax which everybody admits the farmer is free from.  The Minister, however, refuses <Col N="791" /> to increase that tax, and increases the sugar tax, which, undoubtedly, in the case of the majority of the farmers, will fall heavily upon them, and will fall most heavily upon the smaller farmers, who are the people deserving of the greatest share of relief.  They are proportionately our best producers and therefore entitled to the greatest measure of encouragement.  They will have under these proposals to pay the greater share of the tax which is intended to relieve them.</P>
    <P>We shall have further opportunities of discussing this on the general proposals. I should just like to say a word on one or two other of the proposals. I was glad to see relief given to the dramatic societies and concerts.  That is the one feature that the Minister can be congratulated on.  On the Resolution which is before us, I have only to say what I have already said: that I would prefer to see income tax increased rather than sugar tax increased, and, again, I express my disappointment that we have no proposals made for the alteration of the incidence of the tax so that the small taxpayers would get the same relief as is given in other countries.  The point has been made from time to time that we pay smaller income tax here than in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, but so far as the great majority of those with small incomes of £500 and under are concerned, they are, in fact, paying more income tax than persons of similar incomes would be paying in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. On the whole, those of us sitting on these benches have no welcome whatever for the Budget statement, and will take opportunity, when the occasion arises, to mark our disapproval of the items to which I have referred.</P>

      <P>While the Minister was speaking, I noticed that the Press Gallery was very full, and I am sure that there were representatives here from outside this country, I am also sure that the universal captions that will be seen in the morning papers will be that the Minister's address was an exceedingly dull one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="792" /> I think that is the greatest tribute that possibly can be paid to the Minister for the Budget he has introduced.  It was dull; it was exceedingly dull, and I think that speaks volumes for the stability and solvency of the country. The one outstanding feature in his Budget speech is the fact&mdash;and I think that he was almost too modest in stating that fact&mdash;that the amount of revenue that this State has to obtain is £24,658,000 odd, and that the amount of revenue which will be obtained on the existing basis of taxation will be £24,661,000 odd, thereby showing a small nominal surplus, but a surplus. That is a matter for supreme satisfaction in this Dáil, and especially of congratulation to the Minister and his Government.  I have been present on similar occasions in other places. Whenever a Minister or a Chancellor of the Exchequer was able to get up in his place and say that he was able to balance his Budget that statement was greeted by uproarious applause from all quarters in the House.  I think we are entitled in this Dáil to congratulate ourselves and our Government on this satisfactory state of affairs.</P>
    <P>The Minister seeks to impose fresh taxation, not to balance his Budget, but for the purpose and object which we all expected and upon which we all agree, the relieving of farmers by some means or another.  He dwelt upon the Report of the De-rating Commission. He agreed substantially with the Majority Report and to a certain extent with the Minority Report, and he has come to the conclusion that rates should be relieved if not wholly at least partially.  He proposes to make a grant-in-aid of £750,000, and with that proposal I do not think any member of the Dáil will be in disagreement. There may be disagreement on the question of amount, and probably on the means whereby that sum would be raised.  He proposes to raise it by the imposition of a tax upon petrol, in the first place, amounting, as he says it will, to a sum of £450,000, and also by increasing the tax upon sugar.</P>
    <P>What Deputy O'Connell has said, I think, stands to reason, that the farmer undoubtedly will have to pay something <Col N="793" /> towards both in taxes.  The difficulty, as far as I can see, is to create any taxation to impose any new burden on the people of this country which inevitably and ultimately the farmer will not have to pay his share of.  After all, farmers comprise the bulk of the earning community, and it is all very well to talk about raising the income tax.  I think the Minister has disposed of that himself by showing that an extra sixpence in the pound would only produce £150,000.  Is it seriously suggested by Deputy O'Connell and his associates that income tax sufficient to raise £750,000 should be imposed?  If that is their suggestion, then I think they will have very little support in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamArcherRedmond" hpid="Captain Redmond Captain Redmond">
      <NameTxt>Captain Redmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I say if that is their suggestion they will have very little support in this House.  If that is not their suggestion, what is the use in saying that an income tax imposition would have been better than the one proposed by the Minister?  I am not in love with an increase in the sugar duty. Undoubtedly sugar is as necessary, more so, as the Minister says, than tea; perhaps more so for the farmer's growing family than almost any other article of consumption.  He has shown that the imposition of this extra duty will not increase the price of sugar out of all proportion to what it has been, at least during the last three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As for the tax on petrol, of course the old system here used to be, when this Dáil came into existence first, that we could not do anything, because it was done in a like way across the water.  Now the wheel seems to have gone completely round, and if they play hearts for trumps we must immediately follow suit; whether that is advisable in this case or not is another matter. I think personally it is.  The petrol tax will hit a certain class of farmers, it is true.  It will hit them not only directly but indirectly, because, as we all know, transport conditions have changed in this country considerably, and farmers have to travel very often by bus as well as by their own private motor conveyances. Undoubtedly they will to a <Col N="794" /> certain extent feel the increased cost of petrol, but possibly there is this much to be said for them, that they may not feel it quite as much as they would any other form of imposition which is to be made, because in order to get £750,000 it is necessary to produce a new form of taxation.  That is the basic fact that we should not get out of our minds.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased to hear the Minister, though in a rather reluctant and half-hearted manner, propose to remit the taxation on betting on the racecourses. I do not think in his statement, though he sought to minimise the extent of that tax, he actually told us what was derived from it. However, let us be thankful for small mercies; I think that is a step in the right direction.  Nobody will quarrel with what he has said in regard to there being almost too many race meetings in this country, and undoubtedly the remittance of this tax will, to some extent at any rate, if not altogether, help to rehabilitate the racing industry because, as he has admitted himself, it is largely the backbone of horse breeding in Ireland.  The main purpose and the main upshot of this exceedingly dull and dreary Budget is that we are to provide £750,000 to endeavour to bring some form of relief for the farmer.</P>
    <P>The Minister has, I think, endeavoured to show that these fresh burdens will be borne mostly by the non-farming community.  That may be true, but I would like to say, in passing, that I am largely in agreement with the Majority Report when they state that they believe that it is not by de-rating the farmers will be put in a better position in the future, but by some other means of help and encouragement to the agricultural industry.  I need scarcely say that I intend to support this proposed grant of £750,000. I do not really know why the sum of £750,000 was chosen instead of a million.  Perhaps it was because a million was proposed elsewhere.  Be that as it may, three-quarters of the million is now forthcoming and it does not matter who will get the credit for it.  Let us hope that the farmers will derive some benefit from what the <Col N="795" /> Minister has described as this temporary grant.  Of course, we all know what temporary grants are, and with his tongue in his cheek I imagine the Minister is telling the Dáil and the farmers of the Free State that this is merely a temporary grant.  I noticed that while he said it was to be merely temporary, at the same time he said in view of this grant we must reform the county councils.  Why, if it is only going to be a temporary grant, should the county councils be reformed, or are they only going to be temporarily reformed?  I do not want to disguise the fact from the Dáil that the grant has come to stay.  That may be all for the good.  However, we will dispose of it shortly and will vote for it as a temporary measure.  Let us trust that it will go some way at any rate to alleviate the hardships which we all know farmers are suffering under at present.  I think the Dáil and, above all, the country should be proud of the fact that we are able to be present to hear our Minister saying that our State is solvent, that it has a surplus, small though that surplus may be, and that the only reason that he has to raise money is because he wants, if possible, to grant relief to the most necessitous portion of the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Although these are only temporary resolutions as far as the Opposition Party is concerned, and speeches made after the Budget statement are regarded as formal, I think we will have to protest by opposing the resolution on this particular article, not because it is part of the sum proposed to be given to the farming community but for reasons I indicated already.  Our objection is that it is an indirect tax and falls on the poorer sections of the community more than upon any other section.  I indicated also that from the Minister's own statement there was an alternative source from which half the amount could be got, by an increase of sixpence in the income tax, which would have given £150,000.  As to his statement with regard to tobacco, while I know that Deputies have different views as to whether or not it could be regarded as a luxury, it is certainly less of a necessity of life than sugar.  If I had to choose between getting portion of the sum required from tobacco or sugar I would not hesitate to put it on tobacco rather than upon sugar, just as I protested on a previous occasion and said that as long as sugar would have to be taxed I would prefer to see the tax placed upon something that was not in the nature of such an absolute necessity.  The whole attitude of the Minister justifies the statement Deputy O'Connell made with reference to the Budget, that it is a rich man's Budget rather than a poor man's Budget, that it was the outlook of a Party particularly anxious to keep in the good graces of the wealthier sections of the community.  I heard the remark made when the statement was being made by the Minister that it was the eve of an election Budget.  It was certainly an election fund Budget, and in order to mark our disapproval of it I propose to vote against this resolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The members of the Labour Party desire to register their emphatic protest against this tax.  The only way in which that can be done is by asking Deputies who agree with us or who are opposed to it to go into the Lobby and vote against it.  We realise as well as Deputy Redmond <Col N="806" /> that the £750,000 required for the relief of the agricultural community has to be raised in some way by a direct tax.  Deputy Redmond apparently agreed&mdash;and that is where I differ from him&mdash;that in approaching consideration of the means by which the money is to be raised we are to abolish the betting tax, and then go and impose a halfpenny in the lb. on sugar, which affects the poorer sections of the community.  This tax is going to have a direct and a very serious effect on the 84,000 people at present drawing home help, upon the 30,000 unemployed, and upon every old age pensioner in receipt of 10/- a week, many of whom have no other means of support.  The mentality that says you can get rid of the betting tax, make it easier for people with money to bet, and that then looks for money in this direction is certainly the Chamber of Commerce outlook.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a dangerous one. Deputy Good repeated the Minister's statement in this direction when he said that when income tax was reduced by 1/- in the £ the benefit would go to the development of industry and that there would be greater industrial production.  Is Deputy Good in a position to say that the reduction of 1/- in the £ on income tax has helped production in any industry?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy de Valera that the House will have to divide on this question.  We contend that the Minister in looking for portion of the £750,000 should have looked to people who are in a better position to pay than those who will have to pay the extra ½d. per lb. on sugar.  The farming community, a great many of whom will be getting portion of the £750,000 relief, will also have to pay, and this is merely a means of taking the money out of one pocket and putting it into another.  We protest <Col N="807" /> against this duty because it hits the poorer sections of the people.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to reply at length to what has been said at this stage.  I would just mention that you cannot get a large sum of money in this way without being faced with difficulties of all kinds.  For instance, it might be argued that you should tax tobacco rather than sugar, but I should not like to create the same position with regard to tobacco, from the revenue point of view, that exists at present with regard to alcoholic liquors. I know that there are grounds for stating that the consumption of alcoholic liquor has decreased, but notwithstanding the fact that the decrease is a good thing, nevertheless it has caused a great many difficulties in balancing the Budget.  I should not like to get the sort of decline we have experienced in regard to tobacco.  The other alternative, an increase in income tax, was also mentioned.  We have to have regard to the possibility of development. The situation is quite different in this country from that in countries where industrial development has proceeded to a very large extent.  I know business, <Col N="808" /> some of them tariffed businesses, which are extending and financing their extensions to a very large extent out of profits.  Firms like those are the sort of firms which are most directly hit by income tax.  To hit firms like those would do harm not only in the present but also in the future.  When we look at the question of taxation we have to look all round.  There is the point that the price of sugar now is abnormally low.  Sugar is being sold&mdash;I am talking of the duty-free price&mdash;very much below the cost of production.  When this tax is added, sugar will be sold to the public at a cheaper rate than it was sold a comparatively short time ago.</P>

      <P>I was about to say that the consumption of petrol has gone up tremendously.  If, in future, the consumption proceeded to rise in anything approaching the degree to which it has risen in the past we would have a source of revenue which ought to make it possible to review the means which we are now adopting of finding this sum of £750,000.</P>

      <P>(1)  That in lieu of the duties of Customs chargeable under Section 15 of the Finance Act, 1924 (No. 27 of 1924), as amended by Section 25 of the Finance Act, 1925 (No. 28 of 1925), Section 15 of the Finance Act, 1926 (No. 35 of 1926), and Section 20 of the Finance Act, 1928 (No. 11 of 1928), there shall be charged, levied and paid on all sugar confectionery imported into Saorstát Eireann on or after the 7th day of May, 1931, a Customs duty at the rate of four and four-fifths pence on the pound, in addition to any duty which may be chargeable in respect of any spirits or saccharin contained in such sugar confectionery but in lieu of any duty which might otherwise be chargeable on any other ingredient contained in such sugar confectionery.</P>
      <P>(2)  That in the case of fruit (not liable to duty as fruit) in syrup, containing not more than thirty-three and one-third per cent. of sweetening matter and imported in sealed tins or cans, the duty mentioned in this Resolution shall be charged and levied at the reduced rate of twopence on the pound in lieu of the full rate of four and four-fifths pence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  That in this Resolution the expression &ldquo;sugar confectionery&rdquo; means confectionery made from or containing sugar or other sweetening matter and not containing cocoa, and includes breads, biscuits, cakes, cake mixtures, puddings and powders (other than medicinal powders) sweetened with sugar or other sweetening matter, and not containing cocoa, and also sweetmeats, jams, marmalades, and jellies not containing cocoa, and also peels and fruits candied, crystallised or otherwise preserved with sugar or any other sweetening matter, and not containing cocoa but does not include <Col N="811" /> ginger preserved in syrup imported into Saorstát Eireann in wooden barrels or casks of a capacity of not less than one hundredweight.</P>
    <P>(4)  That the provisions of Section 8 of the Finance Act, 1919, shall apply to the duty mentioned in this Resolution with the substitution of the expression &ldquo;Saorstát Eireann&rdquo; for the expression &ldquo;Great Britain and Ireland,&rdquo; and as though sugar confectionery as defined in this Resolution were included in the Second Schedule to that Act in the list of goods to which five-sixths of the full rate is made applicable as a preferential rate.</P>
    <P>(5)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    <P>This will increase the effective duty on sugar confectionery by 1d. per lb. following the increase of ½d. per lb. on sugar.  It is to prevent the measure of protection which is enjoyed by the sugar manufacturers being reduced. On a previous occasion when the sugar duty was increased we did not increase the duty on sugar confectionery.  It is felt that it should be done now.</P>

    <P>(7)  That in this Resolution&mdash;</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;company to which this Resolution applies&rdquo; means any body corporate, wheresoever incorporated, which either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  is so constituted as not to be controlled by its shareholders or by any class thereof, or</P>
    <P>(b)  has not issued to the public, or, in the case of a company which is about to make an issue of shares to the public, will not, when it has made that issue, have issued to the public more than half of the shares by the holders whereof it is controlled;</P>
    <P>the word &ldquo;share&rdquo; includes any interest whatsoever in a company, by whatsoever name it is called, analogous to a share, and the word &ldquo;shareholders&rdquo; shall be construed accordingly.</P>
    <P>This is to prevent the avoidance of a <Col N="820" /> payment of estate duty by the transfer of a certain class of interests to limited liability companies which are floated merely for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Resolution put and agreed to.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the motion of Mr. Davin: &ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Previous to the adjournment of the House on Friday last, I gave very briefly and in the short time at my disposal four reasons why Deputies should vote for the amendment on the Order Paper.  The first reason was for the purpose of giving the House an opportunity of showing its disapproval of what I described as the Minister's half-way house policy for industrial development.  By that I mean as far as I understand the Minister's policy, the policy which he has adopted of encouraging the development of industry through the agency of the Trade Loans Guarantee Act, plus the policy of selective protection which is the Government's policy with regard to industrial development.  In answer to the question which I addressed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce last week, the Minister informed me that between the date of the passing of the Trade Loans Guarantee Act of 1924 and the 31st March of this year a sum of £325,840 had been sanctioned by his Department under the Act. The number of persons employed at the date of the passing of the Act by the firms who have received guaranteed loans was 110; the number of people employed on the 31st March this year by the same firms was 873. In other words, between the date of the passing of the Trade Loans Guarantee Act and the 31st March last the Minister's policy has had the effect of finding employment for 793 persons. Assuming that it is correct, and I am not going to say it is, that the total sum of £325,840 would eventually have to be found by the taxpayers of this country, it would have cost the taxpayers £130 per person to find this <Col N="825" /> employment for 793 people in the intervening period.</P>
      <P>I do not think that the Minister will claim that that is a very great or a very marvellous contribution towards the solution of the problem of unemployment, and that it is no great effort on the part of the Government to encourage industrial development.  The Trade Loans Guarantee Bill when originally introduced into the House received the qualified support of the members of the Labour Party.  If the Minister will read the Official Report of the Second Reading debate on that occasion he will find that many of the things which were pointed out by the then leader of the Labour Party have since happened.  He will find that if the suggestions then put forward had been adopted by the Government there might have been very different results now.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to tell us, if he can, what portion of the £325,840 was given to firms in industries that had already received the benefit of tariffs.  What portion, if any, of that money may now be treated as a bad or irrecoverable debt, and what amount of new capital has been put into tariffed industries by private capitalists? I am sure the Minister will agree that that has a bearing on the matter. The members of this Party contend that the industrial policy of the present Government has failed to achieve the objects for which the Government themselves adopted it.</P>
      <P>[<i>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle took the Chair.</i>]</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are perfectly satisfied that it is practically useless for the taxpayers of this State, and we are satisfied that all these taxpayers will have to pay either one way or the other for the development of these industries and for the guaranteed loans which may have to be found unless these industries are reorganised on a national scale.  We have a considerable number of industries which have received the benefit of tariffs, and I do not see that there is any co-operation between the firms concerned in these industries&mdash;cooperation of the kind which would <Col N="826" /> enable them to turn out and manufacture in quantity and quality the commodities that are required by the citizens of this State.</P>
    <P>I take the boot industry as a clear case in point.  As far as I know there is very little reduction in the numbers of pairs of boots imported into the Saorstát since the tariff was put on. There has been very little effort on the part of those firms who got the benefit of a tariff to turn out the type of boot which the majority of the people of this country require.  I am extremely anxious to find out to what extent new capital has been put into that industry and whether the Minister believes that the policy of the Government in giving the benefit of the tariff to people engaged in the industry has brought about the results which the Government hoped to achieve at that particular period.  The tariffs have got and are getting a fairly long trial, and in our opinion the people who were given this form of assistance have not done their duty in manufacturing the type of boots which the majority of the people of this State require.  On one occasion I gave the Minister a copy of an advertisement which appeared in the &ldquo;Daily Mail&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; on one day and which was inserted by a Northampton boot firm. That advertisement appeared in the &ldquo;Daily Mail,&rdquo; circulating in England, and in the &ldquo;Independent,&rdquo; circulating here, and showing clearly a photograph on the body of the advertisement that the price was 16s. 9d. in England and 18s. 9d. in Dublin, proving clearly that the people who want this type of boot, and will get it, will have to pay the amount which is put on the boot in the shape of a tariff.</P>
    <P>The members of the Labour Party believe that the benefits of a tariff should not be given to any industry or to any group of people engaged in an industry unless there is some reorganisation of the present methods of production and until there is an assurance given by the Government that there will be a monopoly of the whole market available for the home manufacturers. The population of this State is only three million people.  On the other side of the Channel there is an <Col N="827" /> available market of forty-five million people.  The policy of rationalisation or nationalisation, or whatever one likes to call it, is being pursued there very vigorously by the industrial people, with the result that the available capital at their disposal makes it possible for them to throw their surplus boots or other manufactured articles into our market at prices considerably below what the firms here can turn out these articles at in the ordinary way. The experience of seven years which the Ministers now have of the boot tariff should go to show the necessity there is for insisting upon the reorganisation of these small industries on national lines and the necessity there is for guaranteeing the home market if that can be done without any disadvantage to the consumer.  That guarantee should be given to every industry which gets the benefit of a tariff at the expense of the taxpayers of this State.</P>
    <P>The point is, can we establish new industries or maintain existing ones by tariffs or guaranteed loans unless we give a monopoly to those who control such industries in our own limited home market?  I would like the Minister's answer to that in the light of the inside experience he had of the working of the firms who got these advantages during the last six or seven years.  Can this be done without a reorganisation of the existing industries and a greater and more direct form of national control?  We say not. If the Minister believes there is any good ground for that opinion then it is up to him to alter the policy of the Government which they have followed and face the new situation that confronts him.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that I would like to refer to.  From my own personal observations of the manner in which the Trade Loans Guarantee Act has been and is being administered, it is being administered only nominally by the Department of Industry and Commerce but in reality by a well-known firm of chartered accountants in this State.  An application for a loan is referred to an Advisory Committee consisting of certain selected persons, people who are heads <Col N="828" /> of certain firms of chartered accountants in the State, plus one person&mdash; very seldom more&mdash;who has some experience of the working of the industry. The loan is sanctioned by the Minister through the agency of the Industrial Trust, the directors of which consist practically of the controlling individuals of these very same firms of chartered accountants and auditors. The Industrial Trust, then, has the power to appoint directors or a certain number of directors on Boards of the firms which get the benefit of the loan. Again, these firms, consisting of accountants and auditors, nominate a representative of their own as a director of the firm that gets the benefit of the loan, and when it comes to the winding-up of the firm, strangely, it is wound-up by the same individuals. If there is any responsibility given in the future to the Minister of continuing the policy outlined in the Trade Loans Guarantee Act there must be more authority and more responsibility thrown upon the Minister and far less upon the people who have been administering this Act up to the present.</P>
    <P>In dealing with this Trade Loans Guarantee Act and its results so far as the finding of employment for citizens of this State is concerned, I think the Minister will agree that it has been a very costly experiment up to the present.  I asked the Minister, and I hope he will be able to furnish the figures when replying, to give us approximately the amount of irrecoverable debts which will have to be met hereafter by the taxpayers.  We all know that certain firms who got the benefit of this particular Act have since closed down and that others, I am very sorry to say, are on the verge of closing down.  This is the only Vote on which this matter can be thoroughly thrashed out, and the House is entitled to get such information as the Minister has at his disposal on the working of the Act up to the present time.  I hope that he will supply the figures that have been asked for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that answer is not satisfactory to the Deputy.  We know, at any rate, that a considerable amount of money was given for the purpose of establishing a dead meat factory in Drogheda.  I do not know to what extent the State will be involved in a bad debt in connection with that particular transaction.  We know also that a fairly decent amount has been guaranteed to the Glass Bottle Co. at Ringsend, and I regret to say that that particular firm, which up to last November was giving employment to close upon 200 people, is now, for all practical purposes, closed down.  I would like to know whether the Minister has any information in that matter, or whether there is any possibility of giving any assistance whereby that particular industry can be carried on.  I was one of a number of members of this Party who were asked to meet a deputation representing the people on the workers' side. We heard a very long story concerning what led up to the closing down or partial closing down of that particular factory.  I was one of a number of members of this Party also who subsequently met those who had some responsibility for the management of the concern. Any ordinary-minded man deducting fifty per cent. from what had been said on both sides could not come to any definite conclusion as to where the real responsibility rests in connection with that particular matter.  From what I could gather, it is a regrettable state of affairs, considering that the concern had received £50,000 at the expense of the taxpayers of this country, that both the management and employees of the concern should so differ as to lead up to the closing down of the concern and thus deprive 200 people of very valuable and useful employment. There are other Deputies in this House who have a far greater responsibility in connection with that particular matter by reason of the fact that they <Col N="830" /> represent the area concerned, and perhaps it might not be right for me to go any further into the matter.  Perhaps the Minister could say whether, for all practical purposes, the firm is closed down, and whether the amount of the guaranteed loan will eventually have to be found by the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>I come to another firm.  On this I could say a good deal, but I will say as little as I possibly can for the present. It is the firm of Ailesbury Brothers, Edenderry.  The number employed by that firm before the loan was asked for in 1922 was 350.  In 1929 and long after the loan had been given by the Department of Industry and Commerce the figure dropped to 250.  Unfortunately, at the present time, as far as I can find out, there are only 98 persons employed, many of them casually, in that particular concern.  Rumours have been circulated by the management of the concern that there is a likelihood of the Edenderry factory closing down in the near future.  Deputy Lemass has been touring that part of my constituency, and he is reported in the local Press to have held conferences, whatever that may mean, with some people, and possibly with the management of the factory.  Perhaps he will be able to give some information in addition to whatever the Minister may be able to give in the matter. However, the number of people employed in 1922 was 350, and it has now dropped to 98.  There is something radically wrong with the management or working of the place.  This particular industry got the benefit of a tariff of 33? per cent. ad valorem duty on imported furniture and a guaranteed loan by the Government of a very respectable sum.  The industry that cannot carry on and pay its way with such a generous measure of State assistance is not worth propping up, and the cause requires to be investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I contend that there is something radically wrong with the management or present conduct of the particular concern.  This is a case where there can be a fifty-fifty argument as between the Minister and the shadow Minister, Deputy Lemass, in connection with the working of this particular concern.  A <Col N="831" /> loan has been guaranteed by the present Government or by the Department of Industry and Commerce, and the manager is a very responsible public representative of the Fianna Fáil Party.  There will be, therefore, no trouble on that particular score.  I am only concerned in this particular case in so far as whatever is wrong can be put right, and I say that anyone and everybody who can should help to find employment in that particular concern, if employment can be found for the numbers that were employed there in 1922.  I might inform Deputy Lemass, and the Minister also&mdash;I am not sure whether they know it or not&mdash;that the representatives of the trade unions and the trade unionists have given considerable latitude to the people responsible for the working of that factory in so far as they have been allowed to encroach upon existing trade union regulations.  Boys have been employed, and are being employed, even in spite of protests, where men should be employed. Skilled workmen who have served their time in many cases are being paid improvers' rate of wages.  Trade union officials and trade unionists working there have put up with that for the purpose of helping the factory to carry on, and not giving the management or the Minister an opportunity of saying that trade union action was the cause of the closing down of the factory.  I should like Deputy Lemass to bear that in mind, particularly in view of the fact that he has been holding some conferences there.</P>

      <P>Is it due to the conscientious outlook of the people responsible for the management? Is it due to the fact that they do not believe in using the taxpayer's money for advertising against the other people engaged in the same industry who are not getting Government assistance?  Any good business concern, whether boot manufacturers or anything else, believes in advertising in these days of competition.  I have been asked by people who have a life interest in the future of that factory to find out why the present management do no advertising.</P>

I ask the House also to express their disapproval by their vote of the policy of the Minister as regards his responsibility for the chaotic condition of the transport industry&mdash;the go-slow policy of the Government which is leading to the bankruptcy of the transport industry. The Minister referred briefly in his opening remarks to certain proposals which would be brought before the House in the shape of legislation dealing with the railway situation.  Of course, I am not in a position to anticipate what the Minister is likely to do in connection with that matter.  I do <Col N="834" /> not know whether he is in a position to get up&mdash;if he does, he certainly could not justify it&mdash;and tell the House, after six years' working of the Railways Act, that his amalgamation policy is a success.  If he has any intention of doing that, will he tell us from what point of view the amalgamation policy has succeeded?  Is it from the point of view of giving better paid employment and more employment to workers who have a life interest in the industry? Has it succeeded in giving better dividends to the 14,000 or 15,000 shareholders, or has it brought about decreased rates for the trading and travelling public?  These are the only things upon which one can judge of the success or otherwise of the Minister's policy in regard to the Railways Act of 1925.</P>

I hope it does not mean the continuance of a deadweight board of directors of fourteen or fifteen members, many of whom would be considered over age if they were working at manual or clerical work in the service.  How many of the present board are over sixty, which is the retiring age for all railway men from active service?

      <P>I hope, at any rate, that the Minister will bear in mind the remarks I have been allowed to make on that most important aspect of the matter.  I should also like to ask Deputies to disapprove of the policy of the Minister in so far as he has, apparently deliberately, refused to deal with the profiteering evil which has had such a disastrous effect upon the poorer sections of the community in the cities and towns.</P>
      <P>The Minister very hurriedly made reference to this in his opening remarks on the last occasion that he addressed the House at considerable length on the matter, and said he was satisfied that profiteering did not exist to any great extent, and therefore there was no necessity for the Government intervention or of the taking of remedial measures to put the matter right in the interests of the community.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister, when making inquiries into this particular matter affecting the main body of the citizens of this State, to inquire what the farming community are getting for eggs, bacon, butter and milk in the local market, and what price the people have to pay for the same commodities in the cities and the towns. Would he be surprised to hear that <Col N="836" /> during the winter I know people who sold milk, and found it very hard even to sell it at the price, at 8d. or 9d. per gallon to people in the city who retailed it at 2/4 per gallon?  There is surely some margin between the figures in that particular case to justify the intervention of the Minister.  The same thing applies to-day and applied for the past three or four years in connection with every one of the necessaries of life on which the poorer section of the community have to rely.  I hope the Minister will, if he satisfies himself that there is some grounds for the complaints that I make, bring in whatever measures are likely to prevent the continuance of this profiteering.</P>

It is a matter for himself to decide on the ways and means that may be adopted to give effect to the recommendations of the Commission.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Davin moved that the Vote be referred back for reconsideration. It is our intention to support that motion, though not necessarily on precisely similar grounds to those advanced by Deputy Davin. Apparently Deputy Davin based his main case on the administration of the Trade Loans Guarantee Act, which, he said, was by no means a marvellous contribution to the solution of the problem of unemployment or of industrial development.  In arguing that the policy of the Government for assisting industry, as indicated by the annual enactment of that Act, has been a failure, Deputy Davin is undoubtedly in a position to produce <Col N="837" /> facts which appear strongly to support him.  Under that Act the State was committed to a liability of £326,000, over £175,000 of which it has already had to meet.  The net result has been to increase employment in industry by only 773 persons.  These facts appear to support Deputy Davin's plea that assistance of that kind to industry is unduly expensive, and not productive of substantial results. At the same time I do not consider that we can, on that account, abandon altogether the possibility of promoting industrial revival in that way.</P>
      <P>In any scheme that we adopt for giving financial assistance to industrial concerns that need it, we must make a very considerable allowance for mistakes.  Mistakes will occur. The type of concern that requires assistance from the State is a concern which cannot get assistance from banks, and on that account, the State Department dealing with the matter is liable to have a much higher proportion of failures than any bank directorate could contemplate.  At the same time, however, we have to note the fact that the proportion of failures under the Trade Loans Guarantee Act here is substantially higher than the proportion in England under the Trade Facilities Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been recently laid upon the Table of the Dáil a return of the State guarantees which the taxpayer is about to be asked to make good.  I would like to make it clear that I do not consider it advisable that the Minister responsible for the administration of this Act should be subjected to any undue criticism on account of the failure of the firms to which he gave assistance.  At the same time, the Dáil should not allow any case of this kind to go without a very thorough examination.  I would very strongly urge upon the Minister that a Select Committee of the Dáil or of the Dáil and the Seanad should be established to inquire into the facts relating to the six cases in which the taxpayer is asked to make good the guarantees.  It would be possible for such a Committee to deal with matters that cannot be very well discussed <Col N="838" /> in public and in much greater detail than is possible here.</P>
    <P>Of the six firms mentioned in the Report, I wish to make some remarks. As I have said, the total amount which the taxpayer is asked to provide is £175,000, made up of £150,000 in respect of principal and £25,000 in respect of accumulated interest.  The first firm in the list is Allihies Copper Mine, Ltd., in County Cork.  I understand that when the assets of this firm came into possession of the State they were sold.  The plant has been broken up and the possibility of the mine restarting at some future date has been definitely destroyed.  This mine, I understand, ceased operations in consequence of the slump in the price of copper.  It was possible that the slump would be only of a temporary duration and that in the future there would be a possibility of the mine restarting again.  I am sure it is not necessary for me to tell Deputies how important it is to the very poor district of West Cork, in which this mine was situated, that no possibility of employment there should be lost sight of.</P>
    <P>Certainly no possibility of future employment should be wantonly destroyed.  These mines, while working, gave employment to 130 or 150 men, and the cessation of that employment has caused very great hardship in that area.  The only hope which these people had was the prospect of the mine being re-started, and that is now definitely removed as the result of the action of the Minister in ordering the scrapping of the machinery, some parts of which, I am informed, were sold at an amazingly low price.  I am told, for example, that a Crossley engine which cost £4,000 was disposed of at the ridiculously low sum of £170, and that other parts of the building were sold at corresponding prices.  When the Minister for Finance was in West Cork recently he was approached by a deputation from these districts and asked to consider the advisability of allowing that plant to be retained and kept in working order so that the possibility of taking advantage of any rise in the price of copper could be availed of.  Apparently the Government has <Col N="839" /> decided otherwise.  I doubt very much if the financial advantage of scrapping the machinery can have been very considerable. In that connection I would like if the Minister would tell us where information relating to the amounts secured by the realisation of the assets of any of these firms can be obtained by a Deputy.  We have been furnished with a statement which would seem to indicate that the taxpayer will be asked to pay the full amounts of the guarantees plus the accumulated interest without regard to any sums secured by the realisation of the assets.</P>
    <P>The next firm mentioned in this list is the Carrickmacross Knitting and Hosiery Company, about which I know nothing.  The third is the Irish Fresh Meat Company, Drogheda.  I think I am correct in saying that a guarantee of £70,000 was given in the case of this firm against the advice of the advisory committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>My recollection is that the Minister has so stated, but I will take his word that that is not so.  In any case a guarantee of £70,000 was given.  The directors of the Company in their report to the general meeting of the members, which was held on the 1st March, 1929, stated that the losses which they had experienced as a result of their trading operations were due, mainly, to insufficiency of working capital, and a consequent necessary restriction by the Company to a small weekly kill, which was insufficient to carry the weekly factory expenses.  It was obvious from the beginning that the capital resources were inadequate and they could not possibly extend their operations, so that its weekly or monthly or annual revenue would be sufficient to meet its overhead charges. In addition, however, complaints have been made, and I want the Minister to tell us how far he has investigated these complaints, that some part of the failure can be attributed to the fact that excessive commission was paid to cattle salesmen, some of whom were salaried directors of the Company.  I think the Minister should state why it is that he did not take action in respect <Col N="840" /> of this Company earlier than he did and before the sum of £8,446 had accumulated in arrears of interest.  It seems that the pending failure of the Company was obvious early in the Company's operations, and the delay as between the period in which it, in fact, ceased operations and the date on which these returns were submitted to the Dáil has been very considerable.</P>
      <P>The next firm mentioned here is Cornelius Connor &amp; Sons, Ltd., which received £6,000.  I do not know anything concerning the circumstances of that firm, but I think the Minister should give them to us.  As far as we can discover from the information which was tabled, that firm was engaged in the business of trading in milk in the neighbourhood of Dublin and was given this sum of £6,000 to extend its operations. Surely there are enough people trading in milk in the neighbourhood of Dublin to obviate the necessity of the State financing another?  In fact, the Minister will recollect that the Food Prices Tribunal reported that the price of milk was being maintained in Dublin at an excessive level, due to the fact that there were too many people trading in milk.  Despite the fact that everyone knew what the circumstances were, the Minister decided to give £6,000 to this firm for the purpose of enabling it to extend its operations and allowed £686 to accumulate in arrears of interest.</P>
      <P>The next is the Wicklow Mineral Grinding Company, the only point arising in connection with which was the additional cost in which the State was involved arising out of the legal action which the Minister undertook apparently on wrong advice.  The last one mentioned here is the Irish Glass Bottle Company, Ltd.</P>

      <P>Not always.  Occasionally they make mistakes.  In any case, I want to deal with the Irish Glass Bottle Company.  Deputy Davin stated that the failure of that company appears to have been due to the fact that there was continuous friction between the manager and the directors. I do not think that was the prime cause of failure.  It is quite obvious that the capital liabilities were altogether in excess of what it could bear.  There was no possibility of the company, even if it got a monopoly of the glass bottle trade, paying the interest on all these capital charges. The Deputy will, no doubt, remember the circumstances under which this £50,000 was given and the other liabilities which the company had at the time.  The only possibility which that company had of ever making progress lay in a reduction of these capital charges in some way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the taxpayer has provided this £50,000 such a reduction may be possible, but it has not been possible heretofore.  It is well known that there <Col N="842" /> was friction between the workers and the management.  It appears to have been continuous and must have affected the efficiency of the Company. I cannot accept the statement that responsibility for that can be evenly divided between both parties.  As far as I have been able to discover, the management appears to have been unnecessarily dictatorial and shortsighted in their dealings with the workers.  Whether I am correct in that or not I am satisfied that no matter what the management of the Company did it was not possible to meet the interest charged on the loan much less repay any of the principal, in view of the other capital commitments.</P>
    <P>Altogether, I think the Minister for Industry and Commerce can have no reason to feel satisfied with the manner in which he has administered the Trade Loans Guarantee Act.  I think better results could have been achieved, and I said so before.  I take it that it is the considered policy of the Minister to allow the Act to expire and to substitute for it some other form of legislation.  Statements to that effect have appeared in the Press, and I would be glad if the Minister would tell the House exactly what he intends to do in this connection.  The Act is due to expire in June or July, and inasmuch as the Minister has not abandoned all hope of giving State aid to industry, whatever legislation he intends to substitute for it will have to be introduced before then.  I do not intend to discuss the circumstances of any other firm which does not come before us in consequence of a report from the Department.  The firm to which Deputy Davin referred has apparently met its liabilities in this respect.  If it has done so I think it is a considerable tribute to the management in view of the very difficult circumstances in which that concern has to operate.</P>

      <P>I do not know anything about the Deputy's figures.  The Edenderry factory was at one time doing a very substantial business in the construction of coach bodies, on which a large number of people were employed. That industry has been allowed to die out by the Government.  An application for protection which was under consideration by the Tariff Commission for four years was recently reported on unfavourably.  When a motion asking the Dáil to reject the report was moved here it was defeated by the Cumann na nGaedheal majority, although not one voice was raised to justify the Vote given on that occasion. I do not know whether the Minister's inability to defend the Government's action was due to lack of argument or to natural shyness.  I wish to suggest to the Minister that if it was due to sudden shyness he has an opportunity of doing so now, and I will be very glad to get an indication of the Government's attitude to the report and to know if they see any hope for the coachbuilding industry in this country other than through the granting of protection which it asked for.</P>

      <P>It is eighteen months since I visited Edenderry.  The Deputy may know more about my movements than I do myself, but I can assure him my statement is correct.  I wish to leave that subject and to come to another of very great importance and that is likely to attract considerable attention from the public in the near future.  It is a long time since we had a discussion here on the conditions existing in the flour-milling industry. It is an industry which applied for a protective tariff, and whose application was referred to and reported on by the Tariff Commission.  By a majority the Dáil confirmed the report of the Tariff Commission, and in the discussion which took place, fears having been expressed from certain parts of the House that the flour-milling industry was about to go as the coachbuilding industry has since gone, Ministers were at great pains to assure us that they were keeping an eye on developments in that industry, and that if anything took place which they considered detrimental to the interests of the people they would not hesitate to take action to prevent it.  Developments have taken place, and on the 25th of last month it was announced that a scheme of rationalisation for the Irish flour-milling industry would come into operation on the 1st May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was stated that the general idea was to restrict the output of the mills in such a manner that the price of the product would be increased and that trading would be gradually confined to a definite area.  That Press announcement drew an official statement from the Flour Millers' Economic Association, a statement which did not contradict anything I have read, but which stated that as there were no redundant mills in the Irish Free State there was no question of closing down mills, and also that there was no price agreement <Col N="845" /> in the parties concerned.  In a comment on this development, the official organ of the English Flour Millers' Association, quoted in the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; of April 5th, stated: &ldquo;The Irish mills did not feel the troubles of the over-production of late years as easily as the English mills.&rdquo; I do not know if it is necessary to advance any argument to convince members of Cumann na nGaedheal that you cannot have over-production in an industry in which the productive capacity does not exceed our total requirements. The Irish flour-milling industry never suffered from over-production, but it has suffered and is suffering from over-importation. The purpose of the rationalisation scheme appears to be to stabilise the existing volume of imports. The production of the Irish flour mills may not be decreased, but, if this rationalisation scheme is allowed to go through, all possibility of getting it increased is going to be destroyed. The Minister looked without concern on the invasion of the industry by the British flour-milling combine and thought, in fact, that it was a good development, but now he is faced with the situation that the mills in this country are going to be restricted to a maximum output equal to the average over the past few years.  That is the declared intention of this new organisation at present, although it is quite likely that in the near future its aims will be changed and that we will find a gradual restriction of the output of the Irish flour mills coming into operation, with the consequent gradual increase in the importation of English flour.</P>
    <P>We are definitely opposed to this rationalisation project because we think that it is fraught with considerable danger to the Irish people, and we think that the Minister should take action to prevent it as soon as possible. There is probably need for some organisation that would increase the efficiency and improve the selling methods of the Irish flour mills, but that does not appear to be the purpose of this organisation.  We do not suffer from over-production, as I have already said, and there is no necessity to restrict our mills to a definite quota or <Col N="846" /> to limit the area in which they can sell.  The only purpose which the promoters of the organisation could have would be to ensure that the importation of English flour will be maintained at the present quantity.  We know from the trade returns of this year that flour imports are going up while wheat imports are going down.</P>
    <P>It is natural in that situation that Irish mill-owners should jump at any project which would appear to offer them security on the present basis for the future.  Under the rationalisation scheme they are, apparently, guaranteed a certain share of the market, whereas the only future they could see otherwise, in consequence of the Government's refusal to impose a tariff and the continuous increase in the importation of foreign flour, is ultimate extinction.</P>
    <P>Not merely are we opposed to the rationalisation project on the ground that it is detrimental to the best interests of our people, but also because we see that if it is allowed to develop it will prove a considerable hindrance to any Government that attempts to improve the situation in the future. An international combine, controlling production inside and outside the country, can defeat any tariff which is imposed by any Government by a mere manipulation of prices.  If the rationalisation scheme goes through, and if the flour-milling industry here is definitely linked up with the combine in England, no tariff imposed in the future will be able to improve the situation.  The effect of a tariff will be merely to increase the price of imported flour, the revenue from which will go to the Government, whereas the price of home-milled flour will also be increased, the profits going into the pockets of the combine.  The Minister, in introducing this Estimate, made some reference to two movements which he said appeared to be in restriction of trade, which took place last year, and in relation to which he took action.  As a result of that action he said that one of these movements had definitely disappeared and that the other was forced into a channel in which it could not be harmful.  Here <Col N="847" /> is another similar movement now, and I would like the Minister to tell us what steps he will take to prevent it developing in a manner which will be very detrimental to the interests of the industry and to those of industrial revival in this country as a whole.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin made reference to the transport situation and said that amalgamation had been a failure.  He left us under the impression that it was his desire that the railway situation should be restored to the condition that existed before the Amalgamation Bill was passed by the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, when introducing the Estimate, said that he had been considering the transport situation last year, and had prepared a Bill the purpose of which was the betterment and the preservation of the existing railway system, but during the and of last year, or the beginning of this year, he had certain conversations with the railway directors, as a result of which he found it necessary, he said, to embark on another line.  I find it difficult to know what other line the Minister could be embarking on other <Col N="848" /> than the betterment and preservation of the existing railway system.  Either the Minister told us too much or did not tell us enough.  I think that it is due to the Dáil that we should get from the Minister some clear exposition of his intentions in regard to the transport situation.  We have heard rumours and have seen reports which would seem to indicate that it is the policy of the Minister, if not of the Executive Council, to hand over complete control of all the transport resources of the country to the Great Southern Railways Company.  The transport policy for which the Minister has stood heretofore does appear to have failed.</P>
      <P>The amalgamation of the railways has not produced the results which he appeared to have anticipated.  After five years the Great Southern Company has not come within 80 per cent. of the standard revenue, and the whole purpose of the Railways Act and of amalgamation was to put the company in a position to earn a certain minimum revenue known as standard revenue.  Even the operation of standard charges as from the 1st July last does not appear to have improved the situation in the slightest.  The Minister appears to recognise that fact.  The difficulties of the railway company arise mainly out of the fact that a large part of their passenger trade has been diverted to the roads.  In fact, the revenue from goods traffic has been maintained at a remarkably steady level, despite the decline in commercial activity during the past few years. The policy of this Party in that regard has already been made known.  We believe that the interests of the railway company and of the transport users of the country require that the road and rail services should be brought under one control, but we do not think that that control should be the existing railway management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Davin used some hard words about certain railway directors.  Whatever we may think of these directors as individuals, we cannot consider that Board is necessarily the most suitable which we can get to control the transport of this country.  There is need for some policy.  The Chairman of the <Col N="849" /> Great Southern Railways Company, at the annual meeting this year, spoke as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whether the future policy of the Free State is to be nationalisation or a continuation of company ownership, the whole question of transport demands immediate attention in the interests of the country.  At the Congress held in Madrid in May last it was abundantly demonstrated that of all the countries there represented in none did such chaos as regards road and rail control exist as in Great Britain and the Irish Free State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A need for a policy there undoubtedly is, and that policy apparently the Minister has not yet attempted to formulate.  He has promised us three Bills dealing with transport before the House rises for the summer, and he said that even after these three Bills had been considered the whole general transport question will have afterwards to be reviewed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

If the Minister tells us that the policy of the Government in respect to the transport situation will be given effect to by these Bills, then, well and good, but from other remarks made by him on Friday last when he was speaking he certainly definitely left the impression that certain delays had taken places as a result of which the preparation of these legislative proposals have been very considerably delayed, and would have to be delayed for some time longer.  If the Minister has any doubts on the matter I will quote him the relevant sentences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So I take it that the Dáil will have to wait a considerable time longer before it will have any idea or explanation of what the policy on transport is.  The Minister refuses to give any indication of policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should certainly think so.  I do not know what the Government's <Col N="851" /> proposals are, but in respect to the majority of Bills an indication of policy is usually given beforehand, sometimes, I admit, at country meetings rather than in the Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are certain cases in which it is not impossible to give an indication of policy.  Certainly the policy of this Party here is to bring the transport services in this State under State ownership and unified control. I do not think any serious results are likely to accrue from the fact that it is known that is our policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion the Minister is open to criticism for having allowed the situation to develop as it has and for having held his hand so long before taking action to remedy it. It was obvious very shortly after the Railways Act came into operation that the original anticipations of the Minister were not going to be realised. Everybody expected that the second step to which President Cosgrave referred then, and to which Deputy <Col N="852" /> Davin referred to-day, would be taken shortly afterwards.</P>
      <P>In the course of his remarks the Minister dealt with a number of other matters to which I want to refer.  He gave us a promise that a number of publications were going to come from the Statistics Branch.  I do not know what reliance we can place on these promises.  Similar promises given in the past have not been fulfilled, but if the publications to which the Minister referred are made available I admit that there will be a very considerable addition to our knowledge of the economic conditions existing in the country.  I cannot, however, accept as reasonable at all the Minister's explanation of the delay in relation to the publication of the Census volume on unemployment which the Minister called the Volume on Industrial Status.  As far as I can understand the Minister's remarks, these statistics are available for publication, but the written matter necessary to explain them away is not yet ready, and that without that written matter the Minister does not think that any useful purpose would be served by giving the statistics unadorned by this written matter.</P>
      <P>I think that the Minister can take the risk that some irresponsible people may misunderstand the figures.  It is now four years since these figures have been collected, and their value is daily growing less.  I suggest that if necessary we could do without the written matter to which the Minister has referred. There is, in fact, in my mind a very strong suspicion that the whole anxiety of the Minister is to present these figures in the form most favourable to the political party of which he is a member.  I do not think the delay in the publication of the figures is due to the pressure of business in the Statistical Branch of the Department so much as to the political difficulties of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the Bill implementing the Article in the Constitution&mdash;the Minerals Bill. He said that the Minerals Bill has now been received from the office of the Parliamentary Draftsman, and that it has been finally discussed in the Department.  On June 30th, 1927, the Minister said in connection with this Bill: &ldquo;It will probably come before the House in the autumn&rdquo;&mdash;that is, the autumn of 1927.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The autumn of 1927 came, but the Bill did not.  On the 16th May, 1928, the Minister said that &ldquo;Legislation is at present being considered; part of it, in fact, has definitely left the Department's hands, but there is no hope of having it introduced before the Autumn Session.&rdquo;  That was in 1928. He went on to say: &ldquo;I hope that before Christmas there will be no obstacle as far as this House can take away that obstacle, to proceed with that Minerals Development Bill.&rdquo;  Now he tells us in the month of May, 1931, that the Bill is nearly ready, and he hopes that it will be introduced before the Autumn of this year.  I do not know that the Minister's promise on this occasion is of any more value than the promises he made in 1927 and 1928, on each of which occasions he said that the development of the mineral resources of the country was being impeded by the absence of that legislation. The same thing applies to a number of other Bills which the Minister here has promised from time to time.  Speaking on Friday last on the matter of prices he said that his Department had taken action which resulted in the reduction of the prices of one commodity and that in relation to a number of other commodities disputes concerning prices were in progress and that he thought that it was much better that the problem of excessive <Col N="854" /> prices should be tackled in that way rather than by the introduction of legislation giving them compulsory powers.  The Minister has long ago declared his opposition to compulsory price regulations but he did promise when the Food Prices Tribunal reported to introduce two Bills, one dealing with Short Weights and Measures and the other with Merchandise Marks.  The Minister knows that the Food Prices Tribunal urged the introduction of such legislation, saying that certain poor classes of the community were being robbed by unscrupulous shopkeepers through bad measures of one kind or another. Speaking last year, the Minister said that he had a Short Weights and Measures Bill drafted in his Department. That Bill has not yet appeared. He also said that he had a Merchandise Marks Bill fully prepared.  That has not yet appeared either.</P>
    <P>I do not know why it is that the Minister's Department in so far as the Dáil is concerned appears to be the most inactive of all Departments of the Government.  It may be that the Minister has to give portion of his time to the management of another Department. In that case I would strongly suggest to the Government that the work of Industry and Commerce is so important as to require the whole time of a Minister, and that it is work that we cannot afford to neglect, no matter how important such things as the Royal Style and Title and other such things with which the Minister is so much concerned may be.  It is almost seven years since a Departmental Committee set up to examine into the working of the Workmen's Compensation Acts reported.  The Minister promised legislation to give effect to its recommendations, but he did not do so.  Two members of the Minister's Party, Deputy Rice and another, introduced a Private Member's Bill seeking to effect some temporary improvement in the position while the Minister was preparing a permanent measure. When that Bill came before the Dáil the Minister asked to have it withdrawn, on the ground that additional information had become available and that he was to re-summon the Committee <Col N="855" /> to consider that information.  The Bill was withdrawn; the Committee was re-summoned, but it reported that the additional information had no bearing on the subject at all and reaffirmed its original report.  The Minister has not taken any action since, and the permanent legislation, which has been in preparation since 1924, has not yet appeared before the House.  Is there any prospect that it will appear, and that those other Bills will appear in the course of the year?  I have spoken for a longer period than I had intended, but I do not think that the inactivity of the Department of Industry and Commerce in respect to a large number of matters should be the subject of severe criticism by members of the Dáil.  The dissatisfaction which has been felt throughout the whole country should be expressed by the members of this House.  I therefore support the motion moved by Deputy Davin to refer this Estimate back for reconsideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The House has listened to a very venemous attack by Deputy Davin on the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It seemed to me that was a most illogical attack.  The Deputy pointed out in the course of his argument that certain payments for the relief of the unemployed were being made throughout the country at present.  I remember when the Bill was passing through the House to legalise these payments that Deputy Davin was one of the strongest supporters in the Dáil of the Bill. It seems to me that, in view of the support Deputy Davin gave to the passing of that Bill through the House it is now rather illogical that he should condemn or even criticise its failure.  I think it is a very poor thing that a Deputy who supports a Bill legalising these payments should, when they afterwards appear in black and white, treat them as something that should not be done, or as something unworthy of the Department of Industry and Commerce, or, indeed, something of which the nation should be ashamed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would think, listening to the <Col N="856" /> arguments of Deputy Davin, that the Department of Industry and Commerce had done absolutely nothing for the expansion of Irish industry in this country, that no steps had been taken by the Department to encourage industry.  If anybody would consider the reports which the Department of Industry and Commerce issued recently they would see what the facts of the situation are.  Anybody who has read the reports, which have been sent to every Deputy of this House, would notice that one fact stands out pre-eminently; that is, that the industries of this country are not alone holding their own against world-wide competition, but that they are actually progressing in the present condition of economic depression that exists throughout the whole world.  There is one thing that the Department of Industry and Commerce has got to be careful about.  It seems that this House never takes notice of the fact that one-third of the people of this country earn their livelihood in industrial pursuits.  Speaking upon this question, purely as a business man, it is one of the most important things that the Department of Industry and Commerce is charged with&mdash;to safeguard this one-third of the population who are earning their livelihood in industry.  If the greatest care is not taken by the Department of Industry and Commerce, it is simply a matter of destroying all the industrial progress that this country has made within the past eight or nine years.</P>
    <P>I think, in view of the many statements that Deputy Davin has made, that it might be interesting for me to point out, very briefly, some of the industrial progress that the Saorstát has made in the past few years.  I regret that the Minister, when introducing his Estimate, did not give the House a short review of the industrial progress that the State has made for the past few years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps he would have been in order in stating that in the past three years there has been a considerable <Col N="857" /> expansion of industry in the country.  However, I think if one considers the many industries with which the Department of Industry and Commerce has recently dealt, one can only come to the conclusion that considerable progress has been made.  If one looks at the margarine industry, for instance, what has happened in the output of that industry?  The industry is now practically supplying the whole of the Irish market.  The output is now £331,000, and imports have fallen from £167,000 per annum to £3,987.  Was not that due to some effort on behalf of the Department? In the confectionery and jam industry twelve new factories have been established since 1926.  Was no progress made by the Department in the matter of these factories, all of which are working prosperously at the present time?  Since 1926 the output of these factories has increased from £879,329 to £1,172,418 in 1929, an increased output of £293,086, or 33 per cent.  It may be well to mention that there has been an increase also of 53 per cent. in the chocolate trade and 29 per cent. in the jam trade.  There has been an increase of 542 hands employed in these industries, and the wages paid have increased by £60,000 per annum.  I would like the House to recollect that these are practically new industries as far as this country is concerned, and the Labour Party, above all parties in this House, ought to give honour where honour is due, as far as industrial progress and industrial employment are concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I will refer to the items that I want to refer to.  There has been a lot of talk about the bacon-curing industry.  In the bacon-curing industry two new factories have been established since 1927.  All these establishments at the present time are practically working full time, and there has been an increased output of almost half a million pounds.  The farmers have received £639,000 in increased prices for their commodities.  There has been an increase of 650 hands, and wages have increased by £41,548.  If there is one industry more than <Col N="858" /> another that has been criticised from the opposite side of the House as being in a very depressed condition it is the bacon industry.  We ought at least to be fair to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, no matter from what angle we speak, when we are speaking about industrial questions.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us speak of things as they exist, not as the Labour Party, perhaps, would have them to exist. Look at any other of the trades which have been dealt with by the Department. Take the clothing trade.  Has there been no industrial progress made in the clothing trade?  If Deputies would look at the reports to which I have referred the fact that there has been considerable progress made in the clothing trade would be evident.  Would it astonish the House to know that since 1926 there have been ten new factories opened?  Despite the world depression at the present time, ten new factories have been established in a trade that is practically new to the country.  That is something that the Minister ought to be congratulated on and not be criticised about.  In that industry at the present time we have 4,500 hands employed, an increase of 1,300 hands, and that is one of the industries about which there has been very severe criticism.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell asked me to deal with boots and shoes.  I want to look at that in as fair a way as possible.  In the boot and shoe industry the wages bill is now £93,726 per annum.</P>

I think there is no Deputy in this House who sticks more closely to the subject than I do.  I will be very brief as far as this particular industry is concerned.  There has been an increase of 126 hands in the industry. There are now 1,125 hands employed.  Let me take another industry. The woollen trade is now employing 600 extra hands.  The blanket industry is employing 390 extra hands. We are making now 80 per cent. of the blankets required in the Irish Free State.  The progress made in these industries has been made during the period to which I refer, and part of it has been made in the period under review.

      <P>In dealing with the administration of the Department it is necessary to deal with the policy of the Department and with the methods which the Department has used in the expansion of industry.  It is necessary to ask those criticising the Estimates, not in a constructive but a destructive way, if the policy and administration of the Department have not made for industrial progress.  If one looks at the exports he will find a figure of £10,000,000 for Guinness's stout.  That may not be palatable news to the Labour Party, but at least one has to be fair to the Government when discussing industrial questions.  The policy and administration of the Department of Industry and Commerce have everything to do with it.  If the Labour Party do not know that upon the policy and administration of the Department the prosperity of this industry depends then they are not fit to <Col N="860" /> represent their constituents in the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Anthony is a great wit, especially when he has no argument.  If I am touching the Labour Party on the raw, I think it is time that they got a little touch.  The Labour Party, if they want to be fair, honest and straight, and criticise the Estimate upon its merits, should recognise that we have a smaller ratio of unemployed than any country in Europe.  We have listened to Deputy Lemass for a long time dealing with the problem of rationalisation.  I hope you, sir, will not rule me out of order if I say a word about what rationalisa- <Col N="861" /> tion means.  It appears to me that those who criticise rationalisation in the flour industry do not appear to know what is the object of rationalisation. I am sure Deputy Anthony knows very little about it.  I do not know whether he will support the views put forward by Deputy Lemass or not, that rationalisation necessarily means reduced output.  Anyone who knew anything about political economy would not attempt to make a statement of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>It produces reduced employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not necessarily mean reduced employment.  If rationalisation is carried out in a proper way it means, not reduced employment, but increased employment, and it certainly means increased output.  I have no hesitation in saying that it means a reduction of overhead expenses; it means the elimination of waste in an industry, and the putting of an industry on a proper economic basis, so that it can meet competition. Deputy Lemass was very careful in dealing with this to keep away from the actual state of the grain milling industry at present.  If he had looked at the report of the Department what would he have found the economic condition of that industry to be?  Would he have found it to be in the condition of decay that we were told a few months ago it would inevitably fall into when certain proposals were put forward by Deputy Anthony in this House and were not accepted?  The figures are there for Deputy Anthony to read as well as for me.  The grain milling industry shows an increase of 6 per cent. output in flour and a reduction in imports of over 83,000 cwts.  There is not much sign of decay there.  Is that due to the administration and policy of the Department?  I think the Department has played no small part against very severe criticism in having that state of affairs exist at the present time.  If one looks at the production of maize meal one will find an increase of 15 per cent., or over 811,000 cwts.  If one looks at <Col N="862" /> flaked meal, one will find an increase of 132 per cent., while the imports have fallen off by over 158,000 cwts.  That is the great criticism that has been put forward by the Opposition.  That is the great criticism put forward by Deputy Davin and the Labour Party for the referring back of this estimate. Has there been a single sound argument advanced why the estimate should not be passed?  The only thing I feel sorry for is that the amount of the estimate is not considerably larger. In my opinion, if the industries of this country are to be expanded in the way which it is undoubtedly possible to expand them, the country will have to expend a considerably larger sum of money than the amount contained in this estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one thing I should like to say to the Minister, and I say it by no means in the way of criticism.  I should like to ask him has any progress been made in the negotiations regarding the cement industry.  I have had communications from many quarters asking me to take up this question with the Department.  I do think that when we have available deposits of material for the manufacture of cement here something should be done to satisfy the areas in which these deposits exist that the Department is alive to the necessity for getting ahead with the development of this industry in the same fashion that they have got ahead with the development of the other industries to which I have referred. I realise something that perhaps Labour Deputies do not understand. I realise that large-scale production in this country is practically impossible.  I realise the diversity of the industrial imports that come into the country.  But if there is one industry more than another which, in my opinion, can be dealt with upon a successful basis by this State, it is the cement industry.  I have been written to from the areas where these deposits lie, and it has been pointed out to me that certain firms have bought up these deposits on the distinct promise and understanding that the development of the cement industry would be taken in hands in the shortest possible time. <Col N="863" /> I should like to hear from the Minister if any progress has been made, or if he has any announcement to make.</P>
    <P>I referred to the question of small-scale industries and to the diversity of the industrial products that come in here.  In doing that, I am thinking at the present moment that in a little country like ours&mdash;that is, Denmark&mdash; they have more cement factories, and they are working there successfully at the present time, and they are practically able to supply the needs of their own home market.  I believe we could do just as successfully in the manufacture of cement.  I desire to ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he could inform the House if any progress has been made in the development of the Irish cement industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>(Clare): I am afraid I cannot rise to the same intellectual level as was exhibited by Deputy J. J. Byrne.  I would rather talk in plain, common-sense fashion of plain, common-sense and mundane interests.  If I were to argue on the basis of the logic used by Deputy J.J. Byrne, I would say, possibly: &ldquo;Look at the great fruit crop we had last year, all due to the activity of the Minister for Industry and Commerce,&rdquo; and then I might be asked: &ldquo;Why does the Labour Party propose to refer back this Vote?&rdquo; I would also refer to many other things that the Minister for Industry and Commerce would not claim to have anything to do with, although Deputy J. J. Byrne would attribute all to the activities of the Minister and his Department. I am never so happy as when I find myself in agreement with Deputy J. J. Byrne, and when he says that it is important for the community to realise that the safeguarding of one-third of the community engaged in industrial pursuits is an important matter for the community and for the Minister, who is responsible for the safeguarding of that industry, I agree with him.  But it is amazing to think that while he referred to several industries, he did not tell us what the Minister for Industry and Commerce has done to prevent the flour-milling industry from passing out of the control <Col N="864" /> of the people of the country, and thereby endangering its continuance here. Deputy Byrne would find it inconvenient to mix Guinness's stout and flour, and that is the reason, I suppose, why he left it over, but the danger is, nevertheless, evident, and the Deputy ignored it.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to some things that the Minister has deliberately ignored in his administration in the last twelve months, and it is not for want of knowing something about them.  I have taken considerable pains to bring under his notice the fact that his Department through the administration and development of the Shannon power has thrown out of employment a very large number of men in the Killaloe area who were dependent for their means of livelihood upon the Shannon. Now when the Minister has utilised the Shannon power in the interests of the community for the development of electricity, notwithstanding every effort that we have made, he has so far refused to recognise the claims of these people.  We had not very long ago meetings in that area and we had promises of support, both oral and verbal, from people with reference to the hardships caused through the development of the Shanon power.  I hope these people who wrote promising their support and others who expressed their support in person will give us their support now in this Assembly, which is the proper place to give it.</P>
      <P>I shall endeavour to put the case of those people before the House as understood by themselves.  That case has been issued by the people concerned who give it under two headings. In class one it is stated:</P>
      <P>(1)  When the riparian ownership changed hands the fishermen went with the incoming purchaser, thus establishing an inherent right of fishing on those waters.</P>
      <P>(2)  When a fisherman died or became unable to pursue his craft, he was succeeded by his son or some member of his family; and this was the practice for the past three generations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3) When the riparian owner sublet the water, the incoming tenant <Col N="865" /> paid each fisherman £2 10s. 0d. per week, thereby showing a dual ownership. The fishermen were fixtures on these waters, and their rights were never questioned or interfered with by owner or sub-tenant.</P>
    <P>(4) The fishermen's art or craft is highly technical, and the acquisition of this skill was confiscated when the hydro-electric scheme was put in operation.</P>
    <P>&mdash;that is to say, his skill went by the board.  It was no use afterwards.</P>
    <P>(5)  The riparian owners&mdash;Messrs. Whip Bros., Major Lefroy, and J. Crowe&mdash;were handsomely compensated, whilst the poor fishermen were cast on the &ldquo;scrap heap,&rdquo; and their acquired art and skill absolutely ignored. It is to be hoped that there is not special consideration for the rich, and none for those who require it most when their trade is rendered useless by measures adopted by an Executive Government for the benefit of the nation as a whole.  This Machiavellian policy is absolutely destructive of all right.</P>
    <P>(6) The fishermen on the riparian waters also enjoyed the privilege of trout-fishing in the evenings, thus adding to their emoluments&mdash;7/6 per day on an average for each man.</P>
    <P>(7)  The fishing grounds at Killaloe extended from Lough Derg to a distance of 2¼ miles down the Shannon, to a point where the Garranboy River discharges into the River Shannon.</P>
    <P>(8) The increased height of water, ten to fifteen feet, precludes all salmon and trout fishing now.  The number of licences taken out previous to the Shannon scheme in the Killaloe area was about fifty for salmon, and this year the number issued was one.</P>
    <P>The second class of fishermen concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am not ascribing any wrong motive to the Minister there, but I am putting it that he has not put up any legal argument to prove that he has not power to pay compensation under the present Act.

      <P>Let us argue it this way: That in the administration of his Department he has utilised the Shannon with the effect of throwing a certain number of people out of employment. Surely that is administration, and I am entitled to open up that by pointing out that his administration of the development of the Shannon power has thrown these people out of employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Shannon legislation was passing it was recognised that certain people would be thrown out of their employment, and for certain of those the House approved certain compensation in terms. For certain others it unfortunately did not.  I am advised that it would require new legislation to do what the Deputy is asking.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems clear from what the Minister says that he is advised that he cannot pay compensation to those people for whom the Deputy is concerned without new legislation and, therefore, if the Deputy argues the case on that assumption he would be, in effect, advocating new legislation.  The Deputy knows that would not be in order.</P>

      <P>I do not want to suggest new legislation upon this Estimate. I just want to say that that is an unfair way to ask me to produce my authority to show that he has power to pay compensation to these people.  And the Minister knows perfectly well that is a matter that would require a good deal of research and examination of statutes that I am not in a position to do at the moment.  However, I argue that that is an effect of his administration. He has thrown a certain set of people out of employment.  That action is attributable to his administration.</P>

I suppose if I am ruled out I will have to pass from it, but I would like the Minister to indicate whether he proposes to take and cognisance of their existence at all <Col N="868" /> in the near future.  I will have to take other means of raising this matter.  As the Minister has chosen this method of interfering with me, I will have to choose another method of raising it in this Assembly.  Now, going further on, I think I will be quite relevant and quite in order in dealing with people thrown out of employment because of the operation of the Shannon scheme.  I have a statement here, signed by a good many workers in the district, in which it is stated deliberately that people are brought in from adjacent and far-removed counties to undertake work on the Shannon, while there are people who did work on the Shannon Scheme idle in that district.  I put it to them, was there any particular skill required? The reply was characteristic: some of them told me that the only skill required was the skill in getting the job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to me that I am very much out of order this evening.  However, I will try to have a shot at something the Minister is responsible for.  He seems a very irresponsible Minister this evening.  He is very interesting on all occasions, but never so interesting as when he enters into the realms of fiction.  I want to refer to that piece of polite fiction known as the live register.  It is a masterpiece of polite fiction, and the Minister responsible for the production of that masterpiece cannot be questioned.  We have on these benches on several occasions endeavoured to indicate that the number registered on the live register does not represent the amount of unemployment.  In order to get information I tabled several questions.  It will be found in the Official Report No. 6, 18th March-20th March, 1931, that I asked the Minister if he would state the number on the <Col N="869" /> live register, and the number of books retained in the various exchanges on the latest dates available for his Department.  He gave me for the 9th March, 1931, the number of books retained in the various exchanges. The other day I put down another question, asking him what was the number of books retained.  He gave me the number on the live register on the 9th March.  I wanted the number of books retained on that date, and the Minister has supplied me with figures for the 16th March.  If I read out the figures it will be seen that there is a very grave discrepancy between the number of books retained in the labour exchanges and the number on the live register.  Some of the discrepancies were because some people returned to employment that is not insurable, and therefore did not withdraw their books, but that does not account for the large discrepancy in the return as given here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Unemployment Exchange in Carlow there were on the live register 594.  The number of books retained on the 16th March was 683; in Drogheda the figures were 1,082 on the live register and 1,468 books lodged; in Dublin the figures were 8,818 and 10,434 respectively; in Dundalk, 1,030 and 1,145; Dun Laoghaire, 1,011 and 1,246; Kilkenny, 731 and 888; Wexford, 789 and 1,025; Cobh, 559 and 857; Cork, 3,464 and 3,590; Fermoy, 623 and 887; Limerick, 2,862 and 3,558; Tralee, 637 and 901; Waterford, 1,492 and 1,699; Athlone, 1,423 and 1,525; Galway, 459 and 697; Letterkenny, 303 and 550; Sligo, 634 and 951.  That explodes, I think very beautifully, the live register. On his own figures the Minister has shown us the number of people on the live register.  He has also shown us the number of people whose books are lodged and not withdrawn.  It simply means when people exhaust their unemployment benefit that they do not register further and, therefore, they do not appear on the live register. But their books remain.  The index of unemployment in the country leaves out of account the number of agricultural workers who are not registered and insured.  Surely the Minister could adopt a simple means of trying to find <Col N="870" /> out the number of unemployed in the Free State instead of giving us the live register on every occasion.</P>
    <P>I also want to refer to what the Minister would call a hardy annual, that is to those who pay unemployment insurance and get no benefit.  He knows all about those who work under county councils and who, although they pay unemployment benefit, do not get any insurance benefit.  That is a fairly extensive class.  We have repeatedly asked the Minister to consider their position, and to consider whether it is fair to ask them to pay unemployment insurance when they are not receiving any corresponding benefit.  There is another class, and I have several letters from them, civil bill officers and such who, although they pay unemployment insurance benefit, are deemed not to be entitled to unemployment insurance benefit.  I have several letters from these people.  It does seem unfair. If a person is not to receive any benefit for the payment of unemployment insurance, he certainly ought not to be asked to pay.</P>
    <P>I cannot drag myself away from some consideration of various aspects of the Shannon scheme.  I have the case of people whose cottages have been destroyed and not restored to them.</P>
    <P>[<i>An Ceann Comhairle resumed the Chair.</i>]</P>
    <P>I have a letter from a man who says that his case is still outstanding; that it is nearly four years since an officer from the Department came for possession of his cottage and got possession without hesitation at the time.  The officer of the Department promised him faithfully that a new cottage would be built for him before six months.  That promise was made in August, 1927. Four years have elapsed and yet there is no sign of a cottage being built or of the plot of land being given back. Just imagine what it means to his wife and children when he has to pay 8d. a stone for potatoes.  Justice is not being done to him.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should give careful consideration to the complaint and see that the plot is immediately restored. A plot of land means a good deal to a cottier, as its produce would <Col N="871" /> probably maintain himself and his family for a considerable period.  To ask a man to give up his plot and his cottage and to give him no compensation is not by any means treating him fairly.</P>
    <P>There is also the case where land has been submerged.  I will read an extract from one letter which is typical of many that I received from Scariff district.</P>
    <P>The place is flooded still, about 12 Irish acres, and it is good meadow land.  During the last twelve months I lost the entire produce of it, about 20 tons of hay; also the after-grass, as well as grazing.  From the letter of the Department I can see that they mean to do nothing, neither to pay for the damage nor reduce the flooding until their engineering survey is completed.</P>
    <P>The hay in the meadow and the hay that was saved has been destroyed, while the after-grass, that would be of some use to the farmer, has also been destroyed.  Now that the land cannot be used for any other purpose surely the Minister should consider the desirability of paying compensation and allowing this man some of his claim to meet local and national calls, such as taxation.  These are matters that I would like the Minister to deal with when he is concluding.  I would also like him to indicate whether he has taken any steps to develop deposits where representations have been made to him, such as those dealing with the manufacture of cement.  I regret that I have not been able to deal with the position of fishermen, because evidently there is no legislation under which the Minister could pay the compensation. Even though there is not, the Minister might indicate whether he has any knowledge of their existence.</P>

Deputy Hogan was referring to men whose employment <Col N="872" /> ceased by virtue of the development of the Shannon scheme.

He is not in a position to give them compensation because they are not covered by the Act.</P>

Even without an Act he might be able to find some means of seeing that as regards any employment that is going they would get a preference in the same way as ex-National Army men get a preference on contract work.  The fact that a man has been earning his living as a fisherman does not mean that he could not earn a living in some other employment if it were offered to him.  Surely the Minister should be prepared to say that these men would get some preference in that way.  I do not imagine that an Act of the Oireachtas is required to enable the Minister to do that.</P>

      <P>I could not rule in the terms that the Deputy suggests. The position is that we are here reviewing the action of the Minister within the last twelve months, and we can only discuss the things which the Minister has a statutory power to do. The rule which prevents us from advocating legislation is a sound rule.  There would be no limit otherwise in a discussion on Estimates.  The Minister is asking for a certain amount of money for the expenses of his office.  Deputies are confined to criticism of his administration within the powers devolved upon him by statute.  Of course, as the Deputy is aware, there is no comparison at all between what the Public Accounts Committee normally does and the discussion, which is in order, and what takes place on an Estimate. On Estimates questions of policy can be discussed.</P>

For instance, he failed last year to give any help in the development of civil aviation.  The Minister says there is no sub-head in the Vote dealing with that matter, and that therefore it cannot be discussed.  I want to argue that civil aviation is something that will have to be tackled, and that it is a matter of policy.  The Minister can say that we have no policy in the matter.</P>

I would like the Minister to explain why it is that he has given the Club such limited facilities.  I would like to know why it is that the Minister&mdash;not the Minister for Industry and Commerce but the Minister for Defence&mdash; is giving such limited facilities to this Aero Club for the use of a hangar and with regard to flying machines at Baldonnel.</P>

      <P>No, but the Minister knows very well that if he had any policy with regard to civil aviation he would have made some effort before now to acquire existing grounds as suitable landing places.  If the Minister has any policy on this matter I would be glad if he would give us some indication of it, and what the lines are that he intends to develop on.  I would like to know if any chance is to be given to people in this country who qualify as pilots to make a living in their own country, or whether we are going to continue the present position that people who have a leaning that way and qualify as pilots will have to go abroad to seek a living.  I come back now to the Minister's functions with regard to electricity supplies in general.  Will the Minister inform the House when he expects to be able to give us the information to which I referred a few minutes ago?  He says that when the particular report comes to hand it will be discussed.  Under the Act he is supposed to bring that report to us at certain stated intervals.</P>

If that is the case, we might as well not discuss anything here.  I say that there is a section in the Act <Col N="881" /> which I think is Section 12 &mdash; the Ceann Comhairle will correct me if I am wrong, because he has the Act there.</P>

      <P>The Ceann Comhairle has the Act there.  If the Minister says I am not correct, I shall have to leave the matter at that, and look up the Act before he replies, to see if I am correct.  The Act says that he must bring the balance-sheet to the House once every year &mdash; whether it is twelve months or nine months after the presentation of the last balance-sheet does not make much difference.  The balance-sheet must be presented within twelve months after the last one has been presented.  I wonder if the Minister disputes that point.  I say that it is up to him to give us some information on that matter.  I should like to hear from the Minister a more detailed statement regarding the policy he is to follow in the future regarding trade loans.  He stated on a former occasion that his experience in this respect was so bad that he was considering the question of allowing the Act to lapse altogether.  If the Minister considers that the present system is a bad one, will he state what other means he proposes to try to stimulate or help industry in this country.  I should like to hear the Minister give us an outline with regard to his civil aviation policy, if he has any policy.  I should also like to hear him deal with the matter raised by Deputy Hogan regarding the people who have been displaced from employment or whose livelihood has been interfered with in connection with the Shannon Scheme.  I should like if he would state what can be done by himself in that matter, or if nothing can be done, if he would at least express sympathy and give an indication that some means will be taken to provide for these people.</P>

      <P>(Clare): I desire to raise a point of order.  I do not raise it in any irresponsible way.  The Minister stated, when I was endeavouring to make a case for certain people who were disemployed in connection with <Col N="882" /> the Shannon works, that he had no legislation under which he could com pensate these people.  I do not say that the Minister is deliberately misrepresenting the position, but I put it to you, A Chinn Comhairle, that the position is this: the Minister states that he has no power under any existing legislation to pay certain compensation. With the limited resources available to me, I cannot bring the authorities here to show that he has. Does the duty devolve on the Chair to say whether there is or is not legislation under which compensation can be paid and to rule accordingly?</P>

      <P>I want to have the position clarified.  When a Minister stands up and, for the purpose of avoiding discussion or otherwise, says that there is no legislation under which he can act, and the Deputy concerned says that there is, but has not, in the limited resources available to him, the opportunity of bringing his authorities here, is it the duty of the Chair to say that there is not, in fact, legislation under which a particular Minister &mdash; not necessarily the Minister for Industry and Commerce &mdash; can act?</P>

      <P>Discussions on the Estimates and on all other matters are presumed to take place with bona fides between the parties concerned. If a Minister states that he has not authority under a statute to do a particular thing, that is prima facie evidence to the Chair, and to the House, that the position is so.  If a Deputy desires to make the point that the Minister is mistaken, that he really has the power which he thinks he has not, it is open to the Deputy to demonstrate that to the Chair.  It is open to the Deputy to cite the section of an Act which appears to him to give the Minister the necessary power in the particular case.  If there is conflict between him and the Minister as to what the Act precisely means, the Chair is prepared to allow that discussion to proceed up to a certain point.  It is not the function of the Chair to construe what the Minister's powers under a statute are, nor is it the function of the Chair to say that the Minister has the power which he takes the responsibility of stating he has not.</P>

      <P>I feel that while the Department of Industry and Commerce has, in many respects, been in advance of some of the other departments of State, and has to its credit a scheme which is a tribute to the imagination and ability of its official head, Deputy McGilligan, we should, from the very fact that the Minister has able and efficient assistants, have expected from this Department much more than mediocre and half-hearted measures.  It is, therefore, with the object of stimulating the Minister and his Department to further sustained efforts in certain directions, for which the State has already provided the machinery, that I wish to offer some criticisms on the failure, in some respects, of this Department to satisfy the requirements of our people.  I am not, for the moment at any rate, going to attempt to follow the involved and rather confused mentality of Deputy J.J. Byrne, because the more experience I have of this House the more confused I become in trying to follow his contributions to any debate here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we find that in the matter of home assistance alone we have something like 84,000 people in receipt of relief, that over half a million is being paid out in that respect, and further, when we have regard to the increase in unemployment, surely it cannot be said, having regard to the fact that the Minister has at his disposal the machinery to initiate reproductive work, that his Department has been the success which we would all like to see. The Minister, perhaps, may reply that it is not his function to create or give employment, but I submit that he should take the initiative in this matter of creating employment, and if he has not, as he may suggest, the machinery <Col N="885" /> under his control to do so, he should seek for powers in the Dáil, and I believe that they would be readily granted to him.</P>
    <P>We have on occasions suggested, and I repeat the suggestion now, that the authority and prestige of this State should be actively used in promoting new industries and in reorganising and expanding existing ones. We have suggested the national organisation of our essential industries.  On the discussion on the proposed tariff on flour and on the discussion of the motion in my name in regard to the flour-milling industry, we suggested that it was the function of the State to see that that essentially national industry should not pass into foreign control, and, incidentally, we also suggested that the Minister should take appropriate action to see that this key industry was controlled by Irishmen and financed, as far as possible, by Irish capital.</P>
    <P>Again, we have had the spectacle of a Food Commission being set up in 1926 to regulate prices and to prevent profiteering.  So far as present indications go, and so far as present experiences show, no result whatever has accrued from that Commission.  The prices paid to the farmer to-day do not bear a proper relation to those charged by the retailer to the consumer. We have suggested from time to time that that is one of the problems which the Department of Industry should take in hand and, if possible, control.  We find, for instance, in the case of one commodity &mdash; eggs &mdash; that the farmer gets something like 6d. or 8d. a dozen, whereas the retailer charges the consumer from 1/- to 1/4. The same applies to butter and milk. The position in regard to the flour-milling industry is one which should engage the attention of the Department of Industry at the earliest possible moment.  Very disquieting paragraphs have appeared in the newspapers recently indicating that it is the intention of those who control that industry at the moment to rationalise it.</P>
    <P>In that bland and innocent way of his, Deputy Byrne suggests that rationalisation is a good thing for industry. <Col N="886" /> He suggests, and no one will dispute the fact, that rationalisation aims at efficiency&mdash;efficiency, as translated by Deputy Byrne, at the expense of those engaged in the industry; efficiency which may, in the long run, be at the expense of the people of this country.  I do not know one Deputy in this House, whether he comes from Cumann na nGaedheal or Fianna Fáil, who will go down to his constituents and make the type of speech which Deputy Byrne made in this House this evening.  I have yet to find a Deputy, Fianna Fáil, Cumann na nGaedheal or Labour, who is willing to stand up at a public meeting and tell the people that it is a good thing for the country that one of our principal industries&mdash; in the sense that it is an important and key industry, not in the sense that it gives a great deal of employment &mdash; should be controlled by a foreign firm which is supposed to have such great concern for the industry that it will not reduce the number of persons engaged in it, and will see that it is maintained here as a national asset.</P>
    <P>I cannot help repeating that Deputy Byrne and those who think with him must be very innocent and must not have regard to what occurred even on the other side of the Channel as a result of the combine in this industry. When the industry resolved itself into two or three great combines or trusts they agreed to divide the spoils between them; in other words, they said: &ldquo;Let us rationalise.&rdquo;  In the process of rationalisation one great flour mill in the City of York, employing over 1,000 persons was scrapped.  Surely, neither Deputy Byrne nor the Minister will, or can, tell me that when an English combine has so little compunction in closing down an English mill to suit its own purposes, in other words, to pay better dividends, it is going to keep alive mills in this country.  Surely we cannot expect this foreign combine which now controls the flour-milling industry here to have more regard for the mere Irish than it has for its own countrymen.  Deputy Byrne was indeed very entertaining.</P>

      <P>I am just indicating where Deputy J. J. Byrne entertained us with some figures in which he paid a big tribute to the Minister for the increased employment, for instance, in the hosiery industry, the clothing industry, the boot and shoe industry, and the readymade clothing industry.  I want to show the things that the Minister could have or might have done during the year under review.  We find that the estimated annual requirements in the Saorstát for woollen and worsted tissues approximate to 6,200,000 square yards.  The highest figure which the home sales ever reached was in 1918, during the war period, when the mills found a market at home of £1,684,000, equal to 3,100,000 square yards.  We find a somewhat similar story in regard to the hosiery trade.  For the year 1929 more than £1,000,000 worth of hosiery was imported, and in that year you had a tariff on imported hosiery. I am not an out-and-out believer in tariffs at all.  I have raised my voice on occasions here against some tariffs which I considered unnecessary, but we have the tribute paid by Deputy J. J. Byrne to the Minister in regard to tariffs, not caring whether they were revenue producing or trade protecting. That is the kind of logical criticism we have so frequently from the Cumann na nGaedheal Benches, but more particularly from Deputy J. J. Byrne.  He spoke about the clothing industry and congratulated the Minister on the fact that there were 3,500 persons extra engaged in the readymade clothing this year.  What are the real facts and what are the powers of the Minister and the potentialities of this industry? We find that in the case of clothing, not including boots, shoes and hosiery, no less than £3,200,000 worth at wholesale prices, was brought into the Free State from Great Britain or Northern Ireland in the year 1929.  Goods of half this value produced at home in 1926 provided employment for 6,600.  So much for Deputy J.J. Byrne and his statistics.  We have the same story in regard to boots and shoes, another tariffed industry, all going to show &mdash; and I feel that I will get this reply from the Minister &mdash; that these tariffs <Col N="888" /> have not served the purpose for which they were applied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling, but Deputy J. J. Byrne was congratulating the Minister, and I wanted to show his involved and confused mentality.  It is not due to the Minister or to his Department that we have a steady increase under certain heads, and that we have certain decreases under other heads.  I want at least to show that he undertook, when the flour position was under discussion some time ago, to keep his eye on the situation, or, as they say in Deputy Sheehy's county, to keep his eye on Russia like the &ldquo;Skibbereen Eagle.&rdquo; I am wondering has the Minister anything to report to us on the present position of the flour industry, a position upon which he decided to concentrate his attention.  I do know that in my own area, where there are some mills, a good deal of dissatisfaction is felt at the position created by recent developments. I must express my own disappointment that the position in the way of rationalisation was allowed to develop to the extent it has.  I do hope that the Minister in his reply will indicate what the position is at the moment, and how far his Department has kept its eye on the situation.</P>

      <P>I presume he can supply the money, and that would be <Col N="889" /> an essential factor in the matter.  I might be permitted to ask whether he would assist us in that direction in the near future.  I feel that the position, in general, in regard to the matter of tariffs and the Department of the Minister is satisfactory.  I do not know if I could refer to the question of navigation on this Vote; that is in regard to the navigation of the Shannon. Is the Minister responsible in any way for the existing services carried on by the Shannon Navigation Company?  It has been alleged, I do not know whether rightly or wrongly, in my part of the country, that to facilitate navigation the waters have to be kept at a very high level in some of the areas.  As a result of having the waters maintained at these high levels for the navigation of deep draught boats, extensive flooding has been caused in these localities, particularly where the lands are low-lying. That system of navigation has been initiated lately for deep draught boats. I think some provision might be made by which boats of a lighter draught might give the necessary service to this part of the country.</P>
      <P>If it were necessary to compel those companies to provide light draught boats it would do away with a great deal of the flooding.  Something like five and a half feet of water is required in the lock.</P>

      <P>If the Minister would make representations to these companies to provide light draught boats it might save a great deal of expense and loss caused to the farmers in the area at present.  On the other hand, if it is not possible to do that I think that transport has now become so modern and up-to-date that, perhaps, this water system may be regarded as obsolete.  If the country as a whole has to suffer extreme losses for the purpose of facilitating this particular company, it might be well to review the system of modern transport in the interests of people requiring transport. Those particular areas and small towns in the district could be served by modern transport.  It is in the power of modern transport to deliver goods now almost as cheaply by lorry as by water.  That is a thing that concerns us very much in the midlands.  I do not think it is possible to overestimate the losses endured by the farmers in this particular area all along the Shannon, North Longford, South Leitrim and Roscommon, where the lands are suffering from incessant flooding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not attribute this thing in any way to the initiation of the Shannon Scheme.  This trouble has been there for years and years.  Previous to the setting up of our own Government there were vested interests in connection with all those companies and the interests of the farmers or the other people in the area were ignored.  Now that we have our own Parliament here and that we have people sufficiently interested to look after the interests of the landowners and the farmers, it is, I think, about due that the whole situation should be reviewed from the point of view of enabling the farmers to use their lands to their greatest possible capacity.  There may be insinuations made that the Shannon Scheme caused the flooding.  I have the opinion of a number of farmers who have given me to understand that since the electrification of the Shannon <Col N="891" /> the flooding disappears very much faster than heretofore.  The opinions I have obtained are to the effect that there is a difference of six inches in the flooding now as compared with the time prior to the setting up of the Shannon Scheme.</P>
    <P>As to the question of giving farmers compensation for losses sustained in any one particular area or areas, my own opinion is that that would be impossible so far as any Government is concerned.  The same situation would arise in a very short time again.  There would be a renewal of compensation claims.  There is one thing that would relieve the situation very much, and that would be if those firms using the Shannon for the transport of goods could be induced to put on boats with a three and a half feet draught instead of a four and a half feet draught.  In my opinion that would give considerable relief to the farmers in the district.</P>
    <P>I have heard Deputy Briscoe refer to civil aviation.  The Deputy asked the Minister to supply ways and means for civil aviation.  In my opinion this country has not yet reached the stage when so rapid a system of travel as aviation is required.  Our methods of business have not been so developed as to require that any sums of money should be devoted by the Government to aviation.  The country is sufficiently small for any member of the community to get into a Ford motor car at any time in the evening and arrive here in the metropolis four or five hours later.  That is a thing we can do with for a considerable time to come.  I cannot understand why there should be such stress laid on matters such as civil aviation that do not concern the welfare of the country so very intimately.  There are things very much more important.  There is just one thing that I want to press on the Minister, and that is that he would by direction or otherwise induce the Electricity Supply Board to facilitate the towns throughout the country in the matter of Shannon power&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is one matter to which I would like to direct the Minister's attention.  It is in connection with the imports of second-class harness into this country.  I understand that as a result of the reorganisation of the British Army a considerable quantity of second-class harness has been thrown on the British market. The sale of this harness has been discouraged in England, and it is being dumped over here now.  The coming of the motor car to a great extent has driven the Irish harness makers out of existence.  The Irish harness maker is now depending for his livelihood on the making of cart harness.  As a result of this importation of British Army second-class harness the existing harness makers in the country are being deprived of their livelihood.  The Minister should take some steps to prevent the import of this harness.  If the British people will not allow this harness to be sold in England, surely we should take steps to prevent its sale here to the detriment of our own harness makers.  Harness makers in country towns fill a useful function, and it is too bad that there should be driven out of existence these very useful and necessary trades.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Minister's statement on Friday he gave pride of place to his statistical section.  In that he was probably well advised, because in the opinion of many people it is the one bright spot in the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Certainly everyone will bear testimony to the efficiency of its work.  I want to ask him if his attention has been called to the way in which agricultural statistics are obtained, particularly in regard to the exportation of live stock.  I have heard it asserted on very good authority that these statistics are quite unreliable.  The information is obtained from drovers to whom the animals have been handed perhaps only half an hour previously.  They are not concerned as to whether the animals are bulls, cows, heifers, calves, store cattle or any other description. They are simply asked a question by <Col N="893" /> an official at the North Wall, who is responsible for furnishing the information to the Department of Industry and Commerce, or an official at some other port, and they reply, &ldquo;They are so and so or mostly so and so&rdquo;&mdash; information that as a rule is not at all accurate.  It is taken from quite irresponsible people, and there is no appreciation on the part of the person giving the information of the importance of the information he is giving. I think it is worth while calling the Minister's attention to it, and to ask him if he is satisfied that what I am saying is not the case, as, of course, it would be a very serious matter if statistics that are made so much use of both in this House and throughout the country were so unreliable as my statement would indicate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister gave us very interesting information about the Geological Department and in another of his statements he mentioned that his representations had been a good influence with the Contracts Committee.  He told us how much the Department has been able to do in getting the Contracts Committee to give preference to Irish goods wherever they are available.  I propose to connect that fact with his statement referring to the work of the Geological Survey wherein he laid emphasis on the fact that they have recently been surveying the Connacht coalfield, preparing certain maps of minerals, and so on.  Connecting these two matters I want to call his attention to a statement that was made here to-day by the Minister for Finance as to the respective quantities and cost of Saorstát coal and foreign coal purchased by the Board of Works during the financial year ended the 31st of March, 1931.  His reply to my question was that the total quantity of coal purchased by the Board of Works during the financial year ended the 31st of March, 1931, was as follows: Saorstát coal, 2,120 tons; foreign coal, 11,370 tons.  I may tell you that I have got the impression that the reply was a very guilty one.  It bears the impress of guilt because there is only part of the information asked for given in it.  &ldquo;The foregoing figures,&rdquo; it states, &ldquo;are exclusive of supplies <Col N="894" /> for the army, prisons and for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs outside the Dublin district which, though purchased under contract made by the Commissioners of Public Works, are paid for out of the votes of the consuming Departments.&rdquo;  He also excludes information regarding coal supplied to the Gárda Barracks throughout the country for which information I am referred to the Department of Justice.  I think it is not a too farfetched inference to say that the reply indicates that the Minister did not like to give the full statistics as to the quantities of Saorstát coal and imported coal which are purchased by the Board of Works and supplied by it to the different Departments of State. It does seem curious, presuming representations from the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that the discrepancy between Saorstát coal and foreign coal should be so great, the Saorstát coal amounting to only about one-sixth of the foreign coal used. According to other information that I have been able to get it seems that in the Gárda Barracks throughout the country there is not one ounce of Irish fuel used.  It is an extraordinary thing that if we have a geological survey which is doing excellent work, preparing statements as to the coal supplies available and all that sort of thing, and when we all know we have plenty of other fuel, that we cannot afford to allow such a big consumer as the Gárda Síochána to use Irish fuel.  It seems to me that the Minister could very well look into that department of industrial activity and see whether everything is as right as right could be. It would be a great surprise if it were the case that the Government Departments must depend on imported coal for their fuel supplies.</P>
    <P>There were two important omissions, I thought, from the Minister's statement as to the activities of the section of his Department that deals with trade and industry.  He did not state that any new industry had been established, although he indicated that his Department was active in bringing those with money and skill together. He did not state that any new industry was established or about to be established. <Col N="895" /> Three or four years ago he told us that cement and artificial silk were engaging the active attention of his Department.  Apparently nothing has been achieved in either direction and, though I quite admit that it is not the function of the Government to establish new industries, it would be rather disconcerting to learn that, notwithstanding what the Department is able to do in the way of supplying information and other services, it is not able to induce people to start new industries. If we have reached the limit of our industrial activity, if the State cannot induce capitalists to start industries here, and if the State is not prepared itself to start new factories, that is a very big fact that we will have to reckon with.  The economic position then, I think, would have to be reviewed in an altogether different light from that which has been the case up to the present.  There is a further omission from the Minister's speech. He did not make any remark as to how far his Department interacts with the general public in obtaining support for Irish products.  Is that altogether outside the function of the Minister's Department, or is the Minister satisfied that nothing can be done there?  It is by far the most important opening that there is for encouraging industrial output in this country, and if the Minister can do nothing there, then it is rather unfortunate for his Department.</P>
    <P>I would like if the Minister would tell us whether, in the case of hosiery, he is satisfied that that industry is getting on as well as might be expected in the present situation of the country. I think the imports of hosiery are something like £1,000,000 a year.  That is an enormous sum to be going out for goods which obviously can be produced in this country as well as in any other country.  Many people are concerned to know whether the present tariff on hosiery is sufficient to preserve or to encourage the development of that industry.  Could the Minister tell us whether it is the case that supplies of foreign hosiery are being dumped in the Saorstát, thus making it quite impossible for any growth here of that important branch of manufacture?  It <Col N="896" /> would seem a line of activity which deserves very special attention on the part of the State, and I think the census return for 1929 does not show very much of an improvement on that for 1926.</P>
    <P>We used to be told that peat offered a great opening for industrial development. Has the Minister considered whether there is anything in that statement or is it another of our illusions that must disappear?  We believed at one time that there were by-products of peat that could be developed, and that under a sympathetic administration there could be a great deal done to exploit the peat deposits of the country.  We might be told now whether the Minister's Department has considered that subject or not.</P>
    <P>With regard to rationalisation, it is very interesting to hear from Deputy Byrne that rationalisation means increased employment and increased output.  That was no ordinary chance statement.  It was made in a very dogmatic fashion by one who asserted that he was an authority on the question, and that very few of those who talked about it knew anything like as much as he did.  Except on the question of flour, the Minister has never stated what the attitude of his Department is to the question of rationalisation.  Are we to understand that the State is acting as an organ for rationalisation of industry, that in the case of woollens, for instance, hosiery and other things, it is using its influence to develop rationalisation within these fields, or do the Government regard that question as outside their scope, except in regard to flour on which, of course, they have taken up a very pronounced attitude?</P>

      <P>You, sir, have my sympathy in having to listen to the drivel spoken here.  I wonder why Deputies do not try to know something about a subject before they talk about it.  They talk about shipping cattle. Are they aware that every beast shipped out of this country is examined by a veterinary surgeon thoroughly and branded before it is shipped?  They talk about coal.  Irish mining is a <Col N="897" /> beautiful myth.  There is no such thing as a commercial mine in Ireland.  If Deputies consumed some of the Irish coal they would know what it is like. All this drivel and waste of time should be put a stop to.  It is an extraordinary thing that Deputies who do not employ any person should come along and lecture Deputies who do employ people as to what they should do. Why do not Deputies on the other side start some industry or do something except talk about Deputies over here and say that we do not know anything and do not do anything?  It is about time that that sort of thing was stopped.</P>

      <P>I am very much in line with Deputy McDonogh's last comment, particularly in relation to the Deputy who preceded him.  Deputy Moore has spoken of how disconcerting it is to him to find that although industrialists, capitalists and people with information about industry are brought together, in the end there is no industry.  That must certainly be disconcerting to a Deputy with the mentality which Deputy Moore revealed.  Let me take one thing to which Deputy Moore referred. The most efficient part of my Ministry is the Statistics Branch.  The Deputy went out of his way to praise it. Having done that he went on to state, in the good old phrase which came as a preamble, that he had heard on good authority that these agricultural statistics were most unreliable.  Who is the good authority?  I can counter that statement by saying that I have heard on better authority that they are very reliable and that will carry as much weight as the Deputy's statement. Who are those reliable authorities to whom the Deputy opens too willing an ear in order to get anything that will damage even what he described <Col N="898" /> as the best section in this Department?</P>

      <P>It is like another occasion on which I was told by a Deputy that somebody had put something to him.  I asked for the name of the person and I was told that he was introduced as one of a group, and that the Deputy did not get the name. Those unnamed individuals can go round to cranks where they know that anything derogatory they say will be well received, and that is brought in here &ldquo;on good authority.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I will deal with the question of agricultural statistics any time it is raised specially, and when I hear what is the allegation that is made as to the unreliability and from whence that particular statement proceeds.  I do not think that I should be asked because Deputy Moore heard from somebody whom he describes as a &ldquo;good authority,&rdquo; something with regard to these things, to go into details as to how the statistics are produced, collected and compiled.  Does he think that officials of the type which he knows to be in the Department of Statistics would allow a system to prevail which would enable figures to be got in the way he spoke of?  The thing is ludicrous.  <i>Prima facie</i> the case is against the Deputy, until he gives us some better statement than he has given.</P>

It is impossible that such a system should have grown up.

I have asserted that, and he does not deny it, and it is his duty to say how the statements are corrected or checked.</P>

The Deputy might as well refer to certain other statistics collected, and a particular class of individuals could be mentioned on whom no great reliance could be placed.  It is when the checks that are imposed upon these people are examined that the whole question as to how the statistical material eventually comes out is understood.</P>

      <P>With regard to rationalisation Deputy Moore wanted to know the Department's attitude to it.  I think the Deputy has just the view that rationalisation is a big word to play about with, that it is a satisfactory mouthful in a debate.  What is the meaning of it?  Did he ever hear me describe the work of these Advisory Committees in the different industries, how we try to get the people together when we thought the unit too small, and when we tried to get different groups to concentrate on a particular type of fabric when there were seven or eight different types? Would all that come within the heading of rationalisation in the Deputy's vocabulary?  Rationalisation means better output and better production in every way, and production in a more rational way.  That is the full aim of the Department.  We go in for rationalisation in every way in so far as we can induce members of the Advisory Committees to better their establishments, which again is rationalisation, and then we will bring all the pressure we can to bear upon them to achieve that end.  The Deputy was disconcerted because industrialists will not start here, and then thought that possibly the State should start factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>He said it was a big thing but it was not to be out of his mind&mdash;at least I was to be criticised if I put it out of my mind.  We have started some things here.  There was what could be called a disconcerting reception given to these.  I shall take one that certainly was an aid to industry &mdash; the electrical scheme.  It did <Col N="901" /> not get very much of a reception from the Deputy's Party at the beginning or any other time.  That was one thing we started on lines almost approaching State lines although the method we adopted tried to get away from the worst elements of State control. There is at any rate an atmosphere in this House in favour of the establishment of factories under State management or some type of State control. We have never had any indication given that the details have been thought out, that anybody was prepared to put up a scheme or to indicate in relation to particular industries the precise way in which they think Government factories might be instituted.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has spoken of three industries &mdash; hosiery, cement and peat. With regard to hosiery I spoke at length on that in the autumn of last year.  I described that as one of the best tariffed industries.  I went into detail as to the amount of goods classed as hosiery that were still coming into the country and set that against the home production and gave details of the increased home production, as soon as the tariff was put on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Not an increase all round.  In the case of underwear anyway there has been a decrease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking of hosiery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a class of hosiery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I went into details on these things.  I am referring to the fact that I did allude to them previously. I said that as far as what is ordinarily known as hosiery was concerned there was a biggish import of two types of goods, one a type of cotton wear which certain people want and will not be prevented from buying, and to prevent the purchase of which would certainly be imposing somewhat of a burden on the poorer classes of the community.  In addition to that there is artificial silk hosiery coming in, and coming in against the tariff, and will continue, the manufacturers say, to come in against the tariff, not until <Col N="902" /> a further tariff is put on, but until fashion changes.  As far as the Advisory Committees are concerned, I have not heard any statement either that the tariff has not been effective or that it is not as effective as would be the case if there were a bigger tariff.  I have heard some people say that we should set out to prohibit either artificial silk stockings coming in or the type of cotton stocking or sock that is brought in.  Very few people hold by that, and nobody in this House has stood up to defend that.</P>
      <P>Cement and peat are two things that have got greater consideration departmentally than possibly any other things.  Cement stands out on its own as a thing that has been specially considered. There have been numerous applicants who have come along with views on the subject.  People have got all the information that could be given, and very voluminous information can be given as to where the raw material is to be found, and the fullest costings have been made as to prices of establishments, the workers to be employed, the amount of electric current to be used and the resulting prices for the product made here.  Up to date we have not been able to get anybody to engage in that industry.  The Deputy says that it is one of the things as to which he has always been led to believe there is an abundance of raw material here.  It is not so much a question of abundance as where it lies &mdash; where the different elements are situated, where they can be located together in one spot, and eventually what is going to be the price paid under the very best conditions of, say, a monopoly, as compared with the price at which the imported article can be sold here.  Up to date we have not found anybody, native or foreigner, willing to embark upon the industry under the most favourable conditions, say, of a monopoly. That may disconcert the Deputy. So will a whole lot of other economic facts when he gets to know them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Peat has been the subject of very considerable inquiries.  Peat may have two or three uses &mdash; a use as a fuel, a use as by-products, and a use even as a fabric.  All these have been examined. Again natives and foreigners <Col N="903" /> have looked into it.  The best decision I have been able to reach in the matter is that until there is an application of a very cheap supply of electricity to certain workings in connection with peat very little can be done, except to allow it to be used in the ordinary way for fuel purposes for the poor.  But if anybody wants to make inquiries about peat or cement, particularly cement, I can promise all the information that would satisfy anybody.  All the details of that particular matter are known and can be put at the disposal of anybody who seems likely to engage in that industry. I suppose in the end, when everybody else fails, the State ought to take it up.  We will see how that will work out.</P>
    <P>As to Deputy Goulding's point with reference to harness I have nothing to say on this Estimate.  I do not know how the Deputy intends I should deal with it.  He did not indicate any special way, and if he had indicated any way it would be outside the scope of the Estimate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Shannon navigation has been adverted to.  For that I have some slight responsibility, which I hope to shed very soon.  But at present I do not know what can be done beyond the point of asking the company who utilise the Shannon navigation to use boats of a lighter draught.  If the interests of navigation are to be adverted to and looked on precisely, and if the other navigation levels have rigidly to be kept, then there is going to be increased flooding in certain parts of the country.  It seems to me that there is a possibility, however, that navigation in certain areas may prove not to have any great utility, and, there, examination may reveal that lower levels may be kept.  In that event flooding will certainly be lessened.  I should like definitely to confirm what Deputy Connolly stated with regard to the effect of the Shannon works on flooding <Col N="904" /> in particular areas.  So far from its having caused any further damage, testimony has been borne that in considerable areas of the country the old-time flooding caused through the waters of the Shannon has been lessened to a very considerable extent. As a matter of fact, the better regulation of the two upper loughs as well as these navigation levels led to a runoff being achieved at better periods of the year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am confirming what the Deputy said.  There are outstanding questions with regard to flooding around Lough Derg which is alleged to be due to the Shannon works and about which engineering inquiries are going on.  Deputy Davin criticised the Trade Loans Act, and what he called the Department's policy of standing still in transport matters. In these two things and everything else considered vis-a-vis unemployment there has been certain activity.  Certain employment has resulted.  A wage fund of a certain big amount was created for a period in which the Act in its application to certain cases ran.  In the end, this year the State has to pay the amount of £175,000 less whatever amount may be recovered by the sale of the assets in the hands of the State previously belonging to the companies which were guaranteed.  I am asked what is likely to be the amount realised by these.  I cannot answer that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It can be asked for when a complete sale has been effected but it would be undesirable for me to state the best prices I expect to get on articles sold by me.  I would either have to exaggerate, with a particular type of open bluff, or else state the true thing and diminish the actual return. <Col N="905" /> There are six companies for whom moneys were guaranteed.  In two of these cases, nearly the full amount of the loan had to be met by the State.  In the first case on the list, Allihies Copper Mines, an instalment of £2,000 was paid and in the second case, a small instalment of a few hundred pounds was paid, but on the whole we have to meet pretty definitely the full amount of the money guaranteed and in addition the interest that had accrued.  What I am expected to say with regard to these cases I do not know.  Deputy Lemass gave his view of the reasons he had heard for the failure of some of the cases.  In the case of the Allihies Copper Mines the reason was clearly and distinctly that the bottom dropped out of the copper market and Deputy Lemass's only complaint apparently in this matter was that we should have preserved the machinery in the hope that copper would again pick up and that the mines would be run.  The best information we could get was that there was not the slightest possibility of the price of copper rising to a point which would make the working of these mines economic.  If we did not sell we would have to pay so much per annum in keeping the machinery in order as well as so much per annum for rentals arising out of the leases.  It was a well-worked concern.  Nothing can be said by way of criticism of the management. It was simply that the market went and that the company went after it.</P>
      <P>The second concern was a small one, but its trading results were never satisfactory.  They were unfortunate right from the beginning.  Here certain allegations of unsatisfactory conduct can be made against the management. We had the greatest trouble and found it almost impossible to get them to comply with the Department's requirements.  Owing to the bad state of the company's finances and trouble between the management and ourselves we decided to see if we could save anything from the wreck.  We may save something, but it will be very small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the matter of the Irish Freshmeat <Col N="906" /> Company, Deputy Lemass said that he understood a loan was given contrary to the views of the Advisory Committee. I said that was not a correct statement.  When the guarantee was first applied for the Advisory Committee asked for a special meeting with myself and the Minister for Finance, to which we afterwards brought the Minister for Agriculture.  They told us they had considerable difficulty with the case because they said if they were to view it purely and entirely as a business concern they would have great hesitation about the first application. We inquired where the hesitation arose and they told us certain things. We interviewed the directors of the Company and got them to advance upon certain lines which we considered met some of the points raised by members of the Advisory Committee.  The Advisory Committee, on their own, put to us that they understood there were certain other considerations which precluded them from judging this purely in the ordinary, rigid, businesslike way.  For instance, they said, they knew there was considerable agitation with regard to the packing industry.  There was considerable national feeling over the livestock trade, as opposed to the dead meat trade, and they asked us was that particular feeling to be weighed in their considerations or were they to rule it out.  In the end, the particular point of view we expressed to them was that that second matter was a matter for us.  Their business was to rule more or less on business lines and if they liked to send me a case which was line ball or even a case that they would not ordinarily recommend I would deal with it myself. In the end, I took responsibility for it because the Advisory Committee sent me the case simply saying that the interview had shown their mind.  I, and the Minister for Finance, aided by the Minister for Agriculture, decided further to make representations to the company with regard to the management and particularly with regard to working capital if we were to guarantee this money.</P>
    <P>The Deputy raised the point that he understood one of the causes of failure <Col N="907" /> was the commission on the purchase of cattle given to people who were salaried directors.  If that were a factor in the failure of the company it was a very small point.  The big point on which this company broke was its marketing arrangements.  They found themselves entirely in the hands of distributing firms on the other side with whom they thought at one time they had alliances of a particularly friendly nature.  I cannot say if they persist in that view.  It never became clear to us that these distributors had treated them in a particularly friendly fashion.  At any rate, this company broke down pretty definitely on the marketing side.</P>
    <P>The fourth company was not a company merely, as Deputy Lemass described, for the sale of milk through the city, although, even if it had been, the consideration which Deputy Lemass referred to it could not, I think, have fairly weighed with me in coming to a decision on that line. Under the Act I am not given any specific function with regard to deciding whether or not there are other concerns of the same type in a particular neighbourhood.  I might have to take that into consideration if I thought the concern to which I was going to give money was likely to go down in the struggle.  But if I got an application from a concern &mdash; there being numerous other ones in the district &mdash; and if I thought the concern I was going to give money to would win out, I could not conceive it my duty to refrain from giving the guarantee. At any rate, this company, setting itself out in a certain way, proposed to develop trade of a particular type of Grade A milk, and also a trade in sterilised milk delivered in bottles.  At the time they put up the application one could not say that there was any other development of that particular type of trade in Dublin.  The application was advised on by the Committee in the ordinary way, and finally the guarantee was given.  The trading results from the start were uniformly unsatisfactory, and by the early part of 1929 there was not sufficient resources to enable it to repay the debentures <Col N="908" /> which fell due for repayment.  That we might have passed over if there was any prospect of the business succeeding, but by that time they had accumulated losses of a large amount, and were not able to meet the claims of various creditors, so there was nothing to be done but to close down this company.</P>
    <P>Very little can be said about the fifth company, the Wicklow Ochre Grinding Co.  It had good prospects. There seemed to be a ready sale, and even the economic geologist who was called in to advise stated that the ochre seemed to produce results of an excellent marketable quality, of a particular type, for which there was a demand.  Nevertheless, although it started with rosy prospects, and under probably as good auspices as I have met in connection with any trade guarantee loan, the market did go against it almost from the start, and by April, 1929, it found it had not sufficient cash resources to meet the creditors' claims.  We did not see any prospects of a reasonable life ahead of it, so we came in with our claim.  In connection with that case I do not want to say anything more at this point, except to refer to the amazing view held by Deputy Lemass with regard to legal advice, that legal advice is wrong when judgment goes against you.  The Deputy will have a long trail of disappointed lawyers at his door if he takes that as his motto in dealing with lawyers throughout his life.</P>
    <P>The Glass Bottle Co. is probably one of the trade loans about which there has been most discussion.  It can be stated of this company in some respects that it started with everything in its favour, and in certain other respects had dreadful handicaps to meet. In its favour was this, that it was in a tariffed business.  When it really got going under new auspices it was the only concern of the type in the country. There is no doubt but there is a consuming population for the type of product it had, sufficient to give a good economic life to one bottle factory.  In addition to that there was the effect of the standard bottle order upon the factory's products.  It had a special <Col N="909" /> advantage by reason that the marking of bottles could be done quickly and much more cheaply than it could be done on bottles from outside.  These things were all in its favour &mdash; the tariff, the single concern, the fact that there was a unit of consumption, that is, sufficient consumption to make at least one economic unit in the country.  Against it was the accumulated load of debt or capital liability.  It struggled for a certain number of years before it had to go into the hands of a receiver. It had trouble with machinery.  I am convinced that it had trouble of a serious type with the workers.  There was friction between the management and the workers, and allegations of misconduct by one party against the other.  In the end it was just a question whether it would peter out by reason of the strike or of certain machinery falling in.  The strike won, but only in a very limited way.  The strike took place, and when negotiations were going on with a view to the men going back to work, one of the tanks collapsed.</P>
    <P>It is quite impossible, seeing all the money spent on this concern, to put any more money into it.  Whether any new factory will ever arise in the locality I do not know.  It is a locality which by reason of labour troubles has got a very bad name.  It does not appeal as an area in which a bottle factory should be started by anyone coming into the industry, although the blame will have to be allocated hereafter in the proper way.  With regard to this company in particular, I cannot say anything about the assets, because negotiations are still going on with regard to a sale, and also negotiations to see whether it is not possible to get some new company to take up the business.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin, in addition to alluding to this case, referred to the firm of Ailesbury.  I am not going to say anything about that at the moment. As far as I am concerned, Ailesbury's is still in existence, and while in existence it would be wrong to say anything which might prejudice the firm. I do not think any discussion on the lines more or less pressed by the <Col N="910" /> Deputy could be regarded as anything but unsatisfactory.  While the firm lasts better let it last and leave it alone.  If anything does happen it will appear in a further list.</P>

I only know if instalments of the loan are not being paid, or if the interest is not being paid.  I know that there is a particular situation with regard to that matter in connection with Ailesbury's, and that no action has been taken against Ailesbury's.  I do not want to be asked questions about that, because I do not want to answer them.  Neither would I answer with regard to other loans outstanding, because bringing them into this House raises certain doubts about their future.  Better leave them alone.</P>

If it is continued it will be continued only in reference to certain applications before us.  I do not want to enter into any new period of activity with regard to this Act.

      <P>As to the question of any legislation being introduced to take the place of the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act, I have not in mind any legislation which I would bring in to replace that Act.  Taking into consideration all the cases that came before the Advisory Committee, and the cases put through my Department that never went before the Advisory Committee for various reasons, it is clear this particular type of legislation is too cumbrous.  If there is certain industrial activity which has to be furthered by State aid, it had better be done by the special application of money to that particular industrial activity, just as was done in the case of sugar beet, and just as might have to be done in the case of cement, or any of the things that were spoken of in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="912" /> It might be of interest if the figures with regard to applications made under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act during the years since 1924 were made known.  There were, in all, 770 applications received.  Of that number 623 were not considered by the Advisory Committee.  The 623 cases can be sub-divided in this way: there were 206 determined to be completely outside the scope of the Act, and 408 were not proceeded with by the applicants when certain questions were asked of them with regard to their previous industrial history, their capacity to finance themselves, and when we sought other detailed information from them.  A few applications were withdrawn, and one or two of the others are still under consideration with a view to seeing whether they can be brought within the terms of the Act.</P>
    <P>There were 147 applications considered by the committee.  The committee did not recommend &mdash; they positively failed to recommend &mdash; in 99 cases.  They did recommend in 48 cases, and of these 48, 18 received a guarantee; 16 were not proceeded with again when inquiries were made. Certain applicants preferred to withdraw when they had revealed to them the particular conditions under which trade loans would be given.  There were 9 applications withdrawn.  There were only 3 cases in which the Advisory Committee sent recommendations to me with which I could not agree.  As I have indicated, 9 were withdrawn, and a couple are still pending final decision.  I have the feeling that the Act has not found the conditions which we thought were present when it was introduced.  Even if there may be a few cases hereafter of the type to which the Act might be regarded as suitable for application, we can deal with them by a special vote or as individual cases.  Deputy Davin, touching on the question of transport, asked me if railway amalgamation was a success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Success&rdquo; is the word I took down.  Most assuredly I can <Col N="913" /> say it has been a success.  The Deputy gave me four tests.  He asked me if I could say that amalgamation brought about better employment, more employment, better dividends, or if it lessened fares.  It has brought about all of the first three things.  It has brought better employment than there would have been if there had been no Railways Act; it has brought about more employment than there would have been if there had been no amalgamation; it has certainly brought better dividends than could have been obtained if there were no amalgamation.  Has it lowered fares, the Deputy asked me.  I do not know whether it can be said that the Railways Act has lowered fares.  It set out to do that in the first instance, but the stress of competition has brought fares to a much lower standard than the Railways Act intended.  Fares have been greatly reduced since prior to amalgamation.  The amalgamation did not prevent any fall in rates or fares that would have been brought about in the ordinary course of events.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

      <P>I was asked if railway amalgamation has been a success. Taking into consideration the conditions in which railway amalgamation was determined upon, and having in view the continuance of those conditions, railway amalgamation must be counted a success.  A Deputy asked what was the next step that was referred to by the President in the course of a statement in 1924.  The Deputy mentioned that the President referred to another step that might have to be taken if railway amalgamation did not prove to be the success that we thought it would be.  I may say that the conditions have changed. Who, in 1924, when we were discussing the Railways Bill, envisaged or could have envisaged the present traffic conditions? To take what was said in 1924 in relation to certain circumstances then existing and to criticise that statement in the light of present-day conditions is not fair.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the railway situation in 1924 and the attempt made to deal with it by means of the Railways Act.  Anybody who takes the then existing circumstances into consideration and who looks at what has resulted from the Railways Act &mdash; the economies achieved &mdash; must count it a success, and as big a success as the authors of that scheme ever dreamed it would be.  Tribute in that connection has been paid by the directors, by everyone concerned or who knows anything about the railway world.  What are the new circumstances about the growth of traffic on the roads?  At one time I brought in legislation to allow the railways to run vehicles on the roads.  What was the view of the <Col N="916" /> House then?  That it would be scandalous to give the railway companies full freedom to run on the roads in competition with the private individual, because it was then stated that these railways, huge financial concerns, could, with all their cash and bank reserves, crush out the private undertaker. We had to put limitations in the Road Vehicles Act on the railway companies, and it is those limitations that have prevented the railway companies from getting the full effects of the permission we gave them to run on the roads.  That was the view of the House at the time the Road Vehicles Act was introduced.  Deputy Cassidy wants us to drive back the traffic on to the railways.  He complains that traffic has been allowed to go away from them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>As to the roads, there was a particular scheme with regard to financing them that we accepted about 1926.  We took the old money that was paid by the ratepayers for roads in 1914 and increased that by the difference between what the farmer got for his produce in 1914 and <Col N="917" /> what he was getting in 1926, and said that in relation to his earnings the farmer-ratepayer was not paying more for roads, say, in 1926 than in 1914.  If that calculation was a mistake then, to the extent of the mistake, we erred. But that was the principle of the calculation. Every other item of road expenditure had to be borne by the vehicles that plied on the roads.  When we found that taxation was not sufficient to meet the Bill we raised the taxation.  That is my answer as to who pays.  As a matter of fact people are getting transported throughout this country now at an unbelievable rate, at unfair rates, rates not merely unfair to the railway companies but to competing transport services &mdash; unfair to bus traffic itself.</P>

I hold that the ratepayer is not losing but that the individual bus owners are losing and, to a certain extent, that the railway people are losing.  It was not my intention that they should lose.  When I introduced the Road Vehicles Act I intended to put them in a stronger position, but the House was not satisfied to do that.</P>

      <P>I asked the Deputy before to read the particular extract and he read an extract which did not prove that he was accurate in his quotation. He is quite inaccurate again.  I said that previously I had considered certain legislation and that I was advancing along certain lines up to a certain date last year; that I then went along another line of policy, after consultation with the railway people.  I stated that clearly and distinctly, to stated with.  If it is necessary to get it home to the Deputy, I reiterate it now.  I said it was part of my duty to preserve the railway systems of the country.  I say that again.  Is that either too much or too little for the Deputy?  At any rate, it is as much as he is going to get.</P>

      <P>No.  Let the Deputy take two things&mdash;X and Y.  X is my policy before Christmas of last year.  My present policy is Y.  I said that after I had considered certain things and after I had had discussions with the railway people, I made up my mind as regards certain matters, and that I was now advancing along Y. I have already referred to the legislation I have in hands and intend to introduce, and I am not going into any further detail in regard to it.  Deputy Hogan asked me about landowner cases.  He made the remark that they have never received any unemployment insurance benefit.  I have countered that statement over and over again, and I repeat that the only way to tackle the question is to take a precise case.  If a precise case is raised we can have all the details and all the merits in connection with it brought forward, and we can discuss it.  The Deputy also brought in civil bill officers.  It is the first time I have heard of these gentlemen in this connection.  I should like to get particulars of any case of a civil bill officer who has contributed to the unemployment insurance fund and who has been refused benefit when, in the Deputy's opinion, he should have got it.  Then we can have it all out.  As regards the submerged lands, these are matters that have been under consideration for a long time.  I gave a lengthy answer to a Deputy on this particular matter three days ago, and discussed with him the details of certain arrangements that have been projected in connection with the prevention of flooding rather than paying compensation for flooding that had occurred.</P>

    <P>Deputy Briscoe raised a point about the electricity accounts.  He also pretended to quote from the Act.  His knowledge of the Electricity Supply Act of 1927 is that I must produce within a year certain accounts.  That is not accurate.  The Board have to <Col N="921" /> produce to me certain accounts within a certain period, and I am &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; to produce them to the House.  Is that correct?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. Fahy Mr. Fahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite right, but would the Minister give his interpretation of that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose I appointed the last day in the year as the day on which the Board were to produce the accounts to me &mdash; that I gave them the widest latitude possible &mdash; and that by that date the Board had not given me the accounts, what should I do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>If the Minister is asking me how he should enforce the law, I reply that I do not know.  However, the Act distinctly says that the Board &ldquo;shall&rdquo; do as directed.  I leave the House to judge whether that is not the law as laid down by this House.  If the Board refuse to carry out the law, I presume the Minister has power to compel them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows the power I have.  If the Board make a reasonable case to me that for a particular year they could not produce the accounts before the particular date, does the Deputy say I should dismiss them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="Mr. Fahy Mr. Fahy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but the Minister should have told the House that the Board had put up that case and that he could not get the accounts within the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy had not interrupted me, I would have told him that.  The Board have made the case that with regard to the accounts of last year they have had considerable difficulty.  Notwithstanding that, I am not specially satisfied with the particular reasons they have given, but all that can be discussed when the accounts are laid before the House.  I have had many promises as to when the accounts are going to appear.  The last promise I got was that these accounts would be in hand, if not this <Col N="922" /> week, then certainly next week.  That does not mean that they will reach this House, because I have certain consideration to give them.  Undoubtedly, there has been delay.  It will remain to see how far the delay is excusable.</P>
      <P>Deputy Davin asked for determination from me yesterday as to how far there ought to be a national policy with regard to industry &mdash; whatever that phrase means.  What is the Labour policy with regard to industry?  I read an interesting correspondence during the year between members of the Labour Party and the Fianna Fáil Party as to which of the Parties had failed to insist that some of the new profits of tariffed industries should be passed on to the workers.  Is that the attitude of Fianna Fáil and Labour with regard to tariffed industries?  In the case of all industries which have been tariffed, the tariff has been imposed mainly because the industries are in an infant state and need protection. We imposed tariffs which, in the main, without exception, in the beginning, imposed an extra cost on the consumer, by the very fact that they gave less profits originally to the manufacturer. In those circumstances, Labour is determined not merely to ask for its full pound of flesh but to have something else passed on to it, without regard to the fact that it is an infant industry which is concerned.  Is that the best that Labour can offer us as an industrial policy for the future?</P>

      <P>The live register figures are no index to unemployment. They are an index to unemployment in the insurable trades.  That is the beginning and end of everything I ever claimed for them.  They are substantially accurate in so far as the business to which they refer is concerned.  For any other purpose, the books are useless. The Deputy himself stated the <Col N="923" /> reason &mdash; that the books may indicate people in employment but who are not in insurable employment.</P>
