      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, on a point of order, there has been disagreement in the House about the way the business was transacted here on Friday last.  I have received legal advice, Sir, as also have the Leaders of the Labour and The Workers' Parties.  The advice I have received, which is similar to that received by the others &mdash; is to the effect that, in relation to the handling of business on Friday last, and I quote:</P>
      <P>The Ceann Comhairle erred.  Due notice was not given, nor did the Ceann Comhairle, in the exercise of his discretion, authorise a shorter period to take a time motion without debate. Accordingly the time allocation motion was not properly before the House on Friday last.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of that advice, Sir, and the fact that the leaders of the two other parties in Opposition have separately and independently received similar advice, I would propose to you, Sir, that under the terms of Standing Order 22, we adjourn this House for a sufficiently long period to allow the Opposition parties and the Government to get together in order to resolve what seems to me to be a most unseemly and unnecessary wrangle over procedures in the House.  I think we would all agree that it is preferable that that be done in this House rather than elsewhere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, as you are aware, the Opposition parties left this Chamber in difficult circumstances on Friday of last week.  I, too, would request that this House should adjourn for a short period of time.  I believe that the Taoiseach, as Head of Government, has a role to play in resolving this impasse.  If we are to get our business done on the basis of the legal advice obtained in relation to the decision-making process on Friday last, there is a role for the Opposition parties in this House so that business can be done by agreement.  Agreement was not sought and certainly was not given on Friday last.  I do believe, Sir, at this stage that it would be proper for the Taoiseach to intervene, that the House should adjourn for one hour, that meetings of the leaders should take place immediately when we can sort out the business of his House.</P>

      <P>Arising from Friday's discussion in this House regarding <Col N="1759" /> the question whether motion No. 11 was properly before the House, I sought a legal definition of the Standing Order and of the precedents which existed in the Book of Precedents, and also of the precedents which you, Sir, produced at the meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  The opinion of senior counsel which I sought, independently of the other two parties in Opposition in this House, quite clearly states that the motion was not properly before the House.  As you know, a Cheann Comhairle, I conveyed a copy of this opinion to you yesterday evening.  At point No. 7 of that opinion senior counsel states:</P>
      <P>For all of the above reasons it seems to me that, having regard to the Standing Orders of the House, the previous rulings of which I have been made aware, as are contained in the booklet in that regard, the motion moved last Friday was not properly before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, I appreciate that. The fact is that we had a meeting with you this morning &mdash; I along with Deputies Dukes and Spring &mdash; at which you indicated that you were of the opinion that you acted correctly.  I am not in any sense, as I explained to you, questioning your integrity in that regard, but I do believe that you are wrong, that you have made an incorrect decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask, therefore, that, in view of that and in view of the belief of the three parties here in Opposition that the decision was wrong, that it was an incorrect one, this House should adjourn for a period until such time as this matter is satisfactorily cleared up.  The matter has arisen because of this Government's anxiety to drive the Broadcasting Bill through this House in a matter of a few short weeks.  It is not acceptable for the Government to attempt to do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no wish to in any way add to the disagreeable atmosphere which has been prevailing in the House for some time but I do think that I am entitled to make a few points on the record.  I just want to reiterate that the Government have the duty and the responsibility and the right to order the business of this House.  I think we would be guilty of a grave dereliction of our constitutional responsibility were we to surrender that right as seems to be suggested by the Opposition.  We do not intend to do that.  We also have the right and the responsibility to bring forward legislation and process it through this House in accordance with the rules of order and procedure.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not intend to have that right trampled on either.  We <Col N="1761" /> also, a Cheann Comhairle, have the right, from time to time, if we think it necessary in the best interests of order and procedure, to bring forward closure motions.  That is a well known practice and tradition in this House and, indeed, in most other democratic parliaments.  I have a clear recollection of the Government of which Deputy Dukes and Deputy Spring were members bringing forward a draconian closure motion when we were in Opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I can ascertain, Sir, item No. 11 on last Friday's Order Paper, which was a motion to take a closure motion without debate, was not put to the House.  Neither was motion No. 11.  The three parties in Opposition left this House and the House then proceeded to motion No. 12 on Friday's Order of Business.  That being the case, Sir, nothing that this House did on Friday was valid and this sitting this morning is invalid because Standing Orders provide that unless a different provision is made the House meets at 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday. The order for motion No. 11 was not made last Friday and the closure motion was not made last Friday and if there is any doubt about that, Sir, I propose that there is a very good reason to adjourn the proceedings of this House so that we can all be satisfied as to what has actually happened and the validity of what was done on Friday and today. That, Sir, is in the record of this House. Motion No. 11 of last Friday was not made.</P>

      <P>In relation to the point of order raised, Sir, the record of the House last Friday shows very correctly that when the Opposition parties withdrew from the House the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach went on to motion No. 12 in relation to the visit of Mr. Nelson Mandela to this House.  The record shows&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in order for the record of the House to show what does or does not occur.  On this occasion, Sir, you can check for yourself, the record of the House does not show that business was properly moved last Friday.  When the Opposition parties withdrew business was not done correctly.  I would say to you, Sir, that at this stage the Taoiseach could still intervene to have this matter sorted out.</P>

      <P>You rejected the request for an adjournment of the House on the grounds that you did not see any good reason for having an adjournment to resolve the matters which are in dispute.The point raised by Deputy Dukes is a very good reason for having an adjournment to clarify exactly how this House stands.  As far as I can see from the report of the House that I have had from the Editor's office it does not refer to motion No. 11.  It does not indicate that that motion was moved and carried by this House and I would argue, therefore, that that is a very good reason for adjourning this House for an hour or two hours to have this matter resolved once and for all.  We are not trying to disrupt this House, a Cheann Comhairle.  We are trying to establish proper order here and to establish the fact that Government do not have an absolute right but must also act within the Standing Orders of this House.</P>

      <P>We have obtained from the Editor's office what is commonly known as the &ldquo;blacks&rdquo; of the reports from last week.  Our reading of it shows quite clearly that motion No. 11 was not moved.  Perhaps the Ceann Comhairle's office has a different record from the same Editor's office.  If so, and if that record shows that motion No. 11 was moved, perhaps the Ceann Comhairle would accept that ruling, but we only have what was made available to us from the Editor's office.  Everybody in this House is anxious that we all come back on side &mdash; that applies as much to the Government parties as it does to the Opposition parties.

      <P>The Taoiseach could resolve the problem amicably by accepting the invitation from the Leader of the Labour Party to adjourn for an hour to sort out this matter, not in the office of the Ceann Comhairle who cannot arbitrate on these matters, but between the parties.  We could then come back in here and get on with our business democratically and properly.  I implore the Taoiseach to take that opportunity and to proceed in a manner of which he is well capable.  It is not fair to the Ceann Comhairle's office or to the Ceann Comhairle to attempt to adjudicate when there is clearly conflicting evidence in front of us.  You, Sir, have your information and we have ours.  A private adjournment could resolve the problem very constructively and effectively.</P>

      <P>The record of this House of last Friday shows that motion No. 11 was moved and not put and that motion No. 12 was moved and put.  Since motion No. 11 was never put to the House, the business done last Friday is invalid, the time motion that was made for this week is invalid and the sitting of the House this morning is invalid as Standing Orders clearly provide that the House meets at 2.30 p.m. on Tuesdays if no other provision is made.  You, Sir, should agree with us on the Opposition benches that the only way to resolve this problem is <Col N="1767" /> for the House to adjourn and the parties to get together to agree on business for today.

All three parties in Opposition have made clear they are not satisfied from the records of the House, that the motion was properly before the House and that it was actually <Col N="1770" /> put and carried.  We have sought an adjournment of the House to have these matters clarified, and requested the Taoiseach to meet with us to discuss how proper order could be restored to this House.  The Taoiseach has responded by saying that is a matter which can be dealt with by the Whips but the Whip of the Government party, the Chief Whip, has in recent times simply arrived at Whips' meetings and declared what the business would be.</P>

With your permission, Sir, I will give a broad outline of them now but the Whips will then take up the matter and work out the new programme for us and come back if it is necessary to make an order of the House later today.</P>
      <P>The general concept is that we proceed with the Order of Business today, subject to ending our session at 10 p.m. this evening.  The Insurance Bill, 1990 will not be taken today but will be moved to tomorrow.The Broadcasting Bill, 1990, will be taken next week and two days will be allocated for the Report and Final Stages of the Bill.  The Estimates will be taken next week and two days will be allocated for that debate.  These are just the broad outlines, the Whips will fill in the details and arrange for the dispatch of the remaining items on our programme.</P>

An employer must be a legal entity or person and for this reason the use of the term &ldquo;in that employment&rdquo; would not be appropriate.

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;`industrial action' means any action taken by any number or body of workers, acting in combination or under a common understanding, which involves a partial refusal to work or a refusal to carry out work or provide services normally carried out, or provided, within the terms of their contract of employment, as a means of compelling their employer to accept or <Col N="1783" /> not to accept terms or conditions of or affecting employment, but does not include a refusal to carry out work or provide services which, if carried out or provided, would frustrate a strike or industrial action engaged in by others;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I will await the Minister's reply to this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the most important and outstanding amendments. We have gone for the minimalist approach in this construction.  I am unhappy with the definition of &ldquo;industrial action&rdquo; which is central to the Industrial Relations Bill.  It is imperative that we agree, with as much precision as possible, to the definition of &ldquo;industrial action&rdquo; because it recurs throughout the Bill.  I am unhappy that we have not managed to make more progress on this issue.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated on Committee Stage that he had taken on board many of the arguments made here and he would come back on Report Stage having reflected on the matter.  It is unfortunate that he has not managed to redraft this definition.  It is important to put on the record of the House that this is one of the areas of the Bill with which the Irish Congress of Trade Unions are very disappointed and concerned about its implications.The definition as it now stands is so wide as to encompass the most limited form of collective action goods or pro-include a refusal to handle goods or provide services where this is necessary to avoid frustrating a strike or industrial action taken by others.  No matter how minor or short the duration of the industrial action it will be encompassed in the definition as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell tried to deal with this issue by putting forward an amendment on Committee Stage in which he referred to major industrial action.  I think all Opposition parties are agreed on the implications of proceeding on this basis. We believe it will shift the balance of power in Irish industrial relations, will become inoperable in many areas of the <Col N="1784" /> private sector and, as a result, there will be a rash of unofficial disputes which might have been avoided.  There is no practical way that trade unionists on the factory floor will be able to make contact with their own union head offices and take a secret ballot under the provisions of section 14 for minor industrial action. Because it is impractical and therefore becomes inoperable, workers will take their own unofficial action.</P>
    <P>Unofficial disputes will also be the consequence of it because trade union executives and management committees will now have to tip toe through the tulips.  When they have an application in circumstances like this, they will have to err on the side of caution because of the danger of immunities being removed. The result is the workers will say that if they have to go through the procedures laid down here for minor matters, they will take action anyway.  That will be the consequence and it is very regrettable.</P>
    <P>Seeing that we have gone for the minimalist approach, I urge the Minister to accept this amendment.  It falls a long way short of what would satisfy me but at least it protects the position of other workers who may arrive at the gate and find themselves confronted by a picket. It will also protect people such as those delivering post, oil or fuel since they will not be considered under this legislation as having engaged in industrial action. Traditionally the Texaco driver who finds himself confronted by a picket can go back to his depot without damaging or frustrating the strike and will not lay himself open to any action.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this important area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed this point on Committee Stage and I do not wish to labour it, except to reiterate my concern that the Bill as drafted is loose and may have some of the adverse effects to which Deputy Rabbitte has adverted. I should be grateful if the Minister would take up the points we are making.</P>

I said there would be difficulty in moving from the present wording to an acceptable alternative.  It is not possible to find an alternative.</P>
      <P>During Committee Stage I expressed the view that it would be very difficult to formulate a definition of industrial action which would distinguish between what might loosely be termed &ldquo;major&rdquo; and &ldquo;minor&rdquo; forms of action.  I undertook, however, to re-examine the matter and to consider also an alternative definition proposed by Deputy Quinn.</P>
      <P>This suggested definition has been carefully examined and I have obtained legal advice on it.  I cannot accept the definition for a number of reasons.  First, it is very imprecise and confusing and, secondly, it would not achieve the intended aim which was to distinguish between &ldquo;major&rdquo; and &ldquo;minor&rdquo; forms of action.</P>
      <P>Leaving aside the internal contradictions and inconsistencies which the proposed definition contains &mdash; for example, what is a &ldquo;partial&rdquo; refusal to work and what are &ldquo;services normally&rdquo; provided &mdash; the definition is very restrictive and excludes many forms of primary action as well as all secondary and tertiary action.  I doubt whether Deputy Quinn would really advocate such a broad range of exclusions which could embrace many forms of very serious and disruptive action, from the scope of the balloting provisions.</P>
      <P>I would also make the point that a definition such as that proposed by the Deputy might not be in the best interests of the trade union movement.  The provision in the Bill in relation to injuctions applies only in the case of strike and industrial action as defined.  They would not apply to any forms of industrial action falling outside these definitions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to bear in mind the principle which underlies the secret balloting provisions in the Bill, namely, that workers have an entitlement to a democratic say in any decision as to whether they should become involved in a strike or other forms of industrial action.  I do <Col N="1786" /> not think that anyone would disagree with the principle or that anyone could seriously argue that secret ballots should be confined to strikes.  Other forms of industrial action can be equally serious and disruptive.</P>
    <P>Having established the importance of the basic principle of democracy through secret ballots, we enter into a very dangerous territory if we start to qualify this principle by saying that secret ballots should be required for some forms of industrial action but not for others.  What Deputies have been suggesting is that &ldquo;minor&rdquo; forms of action should be excluded, but when is industrial action minor?  Are we talking about minor in terms of the issues involved, the numbers involved or in terms of the effects of the action?  A dispute over a minor issue could have very major effects.</P>
    <P>The definition provided for in the Bill is clear and unambiguous and entirely consistent with the principle that workers be entitled to ballot before being asked to become involved in a dispute.  The definition is also linked to the provision relating to injunctions.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the definition will cause problems for trade unions in the day-to-day conduct of industrial relations.  Working understandings will operate and the likely scale of any problems is being much exaggerated, as most people would agree.  The arrangements in the Bill will be satisfactory and workable.</P>
    <P>I have found alternatives to a number of amendments but there is not an alternative in respect of this amendment.  I would ask Deputies to see that in the case of industrial action a workforce are entitled to have a ballot.  That is all we are asking.  In the major dispute at Waterford Glass the workers can manage to have a ballot fairly speedily.  In their case they probably have a show of hands in the traditional manner but under the provisions of this Bill they could have a secret ballot.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputies who argued in favour of this amendment that following extensive discussion the definition in the Bill is felt to be best fitted to stand the test of time.</P>

      <P>Deputy Rabbitte raised a point which concerns me.  If a picket is placed outside an industry or a service and an oil lorry driver decides not to pass it, he could be deemed under the Bill to be in breach of the law.  If a number of people on a sub-contracting basis &mdash; which is every widespread now &mdash; decided to stay out of work in support of the main bulk of people on strike, will they, under this section, be deemed to be breaking the law?  I should like the Minister to reply to those two points.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said previously, in a case like that it is a matter between the person and his employer.  It is not necessarily the fact that he is breaking the law which has to be taken into account but the view which is taken by the employer who is not involved in the dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be argued that he is in breach of the law.  Could the existing definition prevent a union from instructing their members not to pass a picket in the kind of circumstances which Deputy Bell outlined if they were not involved in the strike or had not participated in the pre-strike ballot?  In those circumstances, arguments could be advanced to support the contention that the driver and his helper in the case which was outlined are engaging in industrial action as provided for under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not refer to the text of the amendments from the Labour Party and myself which put forward a definition which would leave intact the requirement of a trade union to ballot their members before action is taken, such as a work to rule, an overtime ban, etc.  We were very reluctant to do this on Committee Stage but it leaves the obligation on the trade union intact and in such a manner as to exclude any action designed to avoid frustrating the effectiveness of a strike by workers who were not directly involved in it.  Will the Minister address that point in the amendment?Indeed, the amendment falls a long way short of what we on these benches would have liked and gets away <Col N="1788" /> from the &ldquo;major and minor dispute&rdquo; which the Minister addressed in his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This point was discussed at some length and the widely held view is that, if only one worker is involved, it is a matter for him to discuss the issues with his employer.  This does not necessarily mean that he is in breach of the law. There is also a substantial argument that if a company or firm are asked to take part in the industrial action the workers are entitled to ballot.  If a group of workers were not involved but were supportive of the strike, under the definition they would be required to have a ballot because they would then be participating in industrial action.  As I said, that would not be the case if only one worker was involved, it would be up to him to discuss the issue with his own employer.</P>

As far as I am concerned, we will now live by rules and regulations.  What is the position in relation to amendment No. 3?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to reply briefly because, regrettably, we will have to press this amendment.  The Minister has confirmed the serious change which it will bring about in picketing policy in the operation of industrial relations from the point of view of the trade union movement.It is a matter to which the Irish Congress of Trade Unions take grave exception and it will be discussed this afternoon at their conference.  It will shift the balance of power in industrial relations in favour of the employer and it will make the conduct of industrial relations, from the point of view of the trade union movement, on occasion extremely, difficult.  Many trade unions will now find it very difficult to do their business effectively on behalf of their members because, even where it is not clear that the balance of power has shifted in favour of the employer, it is at least open to the employer to argue that, under this definition of industrial action, such and such an action by workers not directly employed in the plant are engaging in industrial action even though a ballot had not been taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Traditions which had been sacred in the trade union movement for 100 years are being abrogated, including the tradition where you did not pass an all-out picket of congress or frustrate or damage the effectiveness of a trade dispute by your colleagues.  The situation now is that you must either pass the picket or have made all these elaborate pre-strike ballot arrangements which will not be practical in a great many cases.  This is so central and important to the Bill that, if the Minister cannot see his way to taking on <Col N="1790" /> board the import of what we are saying, regrettably, we will have to press it to a vote.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that it has not proved possible for the expert back-up to devise a reconstruction of the clause in question. They should have been able to come up with something which would have been acceptable having regard to the fact that we are talking about the kind of Bill which requires the assent of both sides of industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have allowed this amendment to be the exception and, accordingly, I will allow the Minister to make a final comment but it will not happen again.</P>

      <P>I agree that this is the most important amendment to the Bill and the one on which we spent most time in trying to work out a solution.  I want to make two important points in relation to it.  How the clauses will be operated between the unions, and the working relationships, will work themselves out. The second point is very important from the point of view of the workers.  We must remember that the immunities are not withdrawn even when a ballot has not been held.  That is very important, particularly in regard to what could happen in this case.  The benefit of the ballot is that the clauses in section 19 (1) and (2) would hold and that would mean management not being able to get the <i>ex parte</i> and interlocutory injunctions.  The immunities are not withdrawn even where a ballot has not been held.  In my efforts to find a resolution I think that is an important point to make.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 5 is an alternative to amendment No. 4 in the name of Deputy Pat Rabbitte and I propose, therefore, with the agreement of the House to take amendments Nos. 4 and 5 together.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 7, lines 31 and 32, to delete &ldquo;availed of by custom or in practice in the employment concerned, or agreed procedures,&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;provided in a collective agreement in the employment concerned,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister and Deputies concerned with this Bill are well accustomed to my arguments on this section.  My colleagues in the Opposition parties who did not initially support the points I made on Committee Stage have joined me in making arguments that highlight the importance of this section and, as a result, the Minister has gone some way to taking on board the substance of the points raised.  However, there remains a very serious defect in section 9 (2) as it remains and, notwithstanding the probable acceptance of amendment No. 5 by the House, my complaint on this section is that it effectively removes the sanction of withdrawal of labour from an individual worker in certain circumstances.</P>
      <P>For the sake of this argument I will confine myself to instancing the case of an individual selected by his colleagues in an employment for the purpose of organising a trade union in that employment but who is then dismissed by a vindictive or anti-union employer. Under the law as it stands, that worker would have the solid support of his colleagues as expressed in a vote for industrial action and the mere threat of the sanction of industrial action would, 99 times out of 100, in practice cause the reinstatement of that worker.  That will not prove to be the case under this legislation for the two reasons briefly mentioned by the Minister said that if there are Stage.  The Minister said that if there are no procedures, there is no problem, one can go ahead without a ballot.  However, he also said that if the procedures are exhausted one can go ahead and strike. Both limbs of the Minister's argument are fatally flawed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me take them in reverse order.  The Minister said that if the procedures are exhausted one can go ahead and strike. Technically he is correct but, in practical terms, he is wrong because having regard to the procedures which have to be complied with it is simply not possible for an individual worker in the circumstances I have described to come back some four to seven months later to get the support of his colleagues and prosecute a trade dispute.  The Minister has improved that aspect somewhat by proposing two measures.  We will deal with the first of these when we come to amendment No. 6 which will enable the Minister to preclude one of these procedures being appealed to the civil court.  He refused to insert it on Committee Stage and I thank him for agreeing to insert it now.  What this means is that the appeal to the civil <Col N="1795" /> court will be cut off with the result the process will be shortened somewhat.</P>
    <P>In the normal course of industrial life the procedures to be laid down, including access to a rights commissioner and the Labour Court, will take a number of months to go through.  I am aware from my own experience that it is not practical to go back to the employee to say &ldquo;do you remember me?  Four months ago I was sacked when I tried to organise a union here.  I have lost my case at the Labour Court for whatever reason and I want the support of my colleagues&rdquo; or &ldquo;I have won my case at the Labour Court but &mdash; which is inevitable in a case involving an anti-union employer &mdash; the employer will not implement the recommendation of the Labour Court and I am now asking you, my colleagues, to support me in implementing the recommendation of the Labour Court&rdquo;.  They would not want to know because the next person to raise his or her head would go the same way.  This is most regrettable.</P>
    <P>The Minister's second argument was that if there are no procedures, there is no problem, one can go ahead in any event.  Once this legislation is enacted no employer will be so remiss as to have no procedures.  They will have procedures and the person most likely to have the most tortuous and tedious procedures is the anti-union employer.  He will have his lawyers and advisers draft procedures which are so tortuous and difficult as to make them long winded in terms of their use.  Therefore the Minister's response simply does not stand up.</P>
    <P>I am happy the Minister has taken the spirit of the arguments on board and brought forward amendments Nos. 5 and 6.  There is no doubt that these amendments represent an improvement. Amendment No. 5 proposes the deletion of the words &ldquo;agreed procedures&rdquo; to be substituted by the words &ldquo;provided for in a collective agreement&rdquo;.  I can have no dispute with that.  If there is a collective agreement, in other words, an agreement between the trade union and the employer, it is fair that he is required to go through the steps of that agreement. <Col N="1796" /> I have no quibble with that.  Indeed, I welcome it and thank the Minister for bringing it forward.</P>
    <P>The problem is that the Minister is drawing a distinction between the trade union organised employer who does his business as provided for in a collective agreement and the anti-union hostile employer who says &ldquo;I am not amenable to the Labour Court or to doing business with trade unions.&rdquo;  He will be able to abuse the legislation because of the inclusion of the earlier phrase which reads &ldquo;there are procedures which are normally availed of in employment concerned&rdquo;.Under the Minister's construction that stands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>That is equally offensive for this simple reason: the section now reads &ldquo;there are procedures availed of by custom or in practice in the employment concerned.&rdquo;&ldquo;Custom or in practice&rdquo; has a certain meaning in industrial relations but the point that should be made is that <Col N="1797" /> in the non-union house &ldquo;procedures availed of by custom or in practice&rdquo; means unilateral procedures.</P>
      <P>I do not want to take up the time of the House by going through all the examples I have given but let us take the 7-eleven example, which we dealt with at some length in the House.  Because an employee badly needs employment he or she signs this long winded American style agreement which has always applied in the case of 7-eleven and a great many other employers have adopted this procedure since it was introduced, and under section 9 (2) as it now stands an employer will say that &ldquo;these are the procedures availed of by custom or in practice in this employment&rdquo; whereas &ldquo;by custom or in practice&rdquo; has an entirely different meaning to me as a trade union official.  To a trade union official it means a collective understanding between an employer and a trade union that they do things in the way they have always been done, by custom or in practice.</P>
      <P>I am saying there is a fault in the section in that it draws a distinction between the trade union organised employer, provided for in amendment No. 5, and the non-trade union organised employer who will be able to avail of the colloquial term contained in subsection (2) which has a different meaning in industrial relations between organised employments.  There is an escape hatch for him and it is particularly unfortunate that it is the bad, hostile, anti-union employer who will be able to exploit it while the employer who acknowledges the existence of a trade union and makes an agreement will find it difficult to circumvent.</P>

Perhaps I have still not provided for the fly-by-nights.To satisfy Deputy Rabbitte because of the support he has got from Deputies Mitchell and Quinn, I suggest that if I put in the word &ldquo;agreed&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;procedures&rdquo; that would cover the point.</P>

      <P>I am accepting Deputy Mitchell's amendment as much as I am accepting amendment No. 6.  The parliamentary draftsman made the point that an example is the case of appeals to the Circuit Court on decisions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  While I feel that such a reference is not strictly necessary, as procedures could specify what is or what is not covered, I have no objection to the amendment.  As it is clear that what is involved is an appeal to the civil court rather than the Labour Court, it is not necessary to use the words &ldquo;of law&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;court&rdquo;.

      <P>I have obtained legal advice to the effect that it is not necessary to refer specifically to the past tense. It is a matter of looking at a particular situation objectively and asking whether it is reasonable to regard a particular location as a place of business of the <Col N="1801" /> employer involved in the dispute.  I would not be in favour of an amendment along the lines proposed as it would convey the impression that it was quite legitimate &mdash; and this is the real danger &mdash; to picket a location where an employer carried on bussiness at any time in the past.  The employer could have left the place ten years ago but because he had been there it could be picketed.  In any event I consider that the wording as it stands is adequate and the amendment is not necessary.</P>

      <P>This is to cover the point where an employer purported to have sacked employees and that dismissal was central to the dispute.  An employer could claim that the employee no longer worked for him and, therefore, may not be covered by the terms of the Bill as currently drafted or we could have a situation where the business has been taken over by a new employer.  That takeover could have the effect of subverting the rights of the workers.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1802" /> In page 8, lines 15 and 16, to delete &ldquo;it is reasonable for those who are so attending to believe&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;those so attending believe&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is only one net point I wish to make about amendment No. 9, that is, that the test now for secondary picketing becomes an objective one of &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; belief rather than the subjective one of &ldquo;honest&rdquo; belief.  In as much as it does that it places a heavier onus on the trade union and its members because there will be many very difficult situations where workers know instinctively that they are placing a picket on the secondary employer because there is a connection and because he is damaging, undermining or frustrating their strike.  To be able to show in court that they had a reasonable belief as compared to being able to go into court and swear that: &ldquo;I honestly believed that this was the case&rdquo; makes it more difficult.  God knows, section 11 already makes it quite difficult and onerous from the point of view of trade unionists.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of workers, after the discussion on industrial action, this is another major contentious area of this Bill.  There is a difference a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, as you have pointed out, between amendments Nos. 10 and 11.  In amendment No. 11, although I acknowledge that the Minister by moving the word &ldquo;calculated&rdquo; has gone some way towards meeting the arguments I have advanced on a number of previous occasions and to which my colleagues in the Labour and Fine Gael parties have equally taken exception, I accept that is an improvement but, unfortunately, the Minister has allowed the phrase &ldquo;directly assisting&rdquo; the secondary employer to stand.  If the Minister's amendment is accepted the onus requires them to be able to show that the secondary employer has directly assisted their employer who is party to the trade dispute for the purpose of frustrating the strike or other industrial action.  That requirement of being able to prove that he has directly assisted is extremely onerous and will shift the balance of power again in favour <Col N="1803" /> of the employer.  I submit that my phrasing which reads: &ldquo;has directly or indirectly assisted their employer who is party to the trade dispute with the effect of frustrating the strike or other industrial action&rdquo; is a better formulation.  In very many circumstances it will be very difficult for the trade union concerned to be able to prove that the placing of this picket on the secondary employer was because they had this reasonable belief that that secondary employer was &ldquo;directly assisting&rdquo; their own employer. That will be extremely difficult &mdash; as I explained at some length on Committee Stage if not impossible, in the case of a great many of the contractors and subcontractors who are out there.  In the circumstances that I have adduced on many occasions certainly they will be able to show that of course they are damaging or undermining the strike; they may even be taking the jobs of the people who are on strike but they are not directly assisting the first employer, the first employer will have lost the contract.  All they are doing is availing of the marketplace in order to get a contract for themselves.  Unfortunately, at a time when sub-contract and contract labour is a proliferating feature of the make-up of the workforce this will discriminate directly against contract workers who henceforth effectively will be unable to prosecute a trade dispute for employment because, in placing the picket against the secondary employer, they will be unable to show &mdash; as the Minister's amendment requires &mdash; they were directly assisting their employer.  He is directly in competition with their employer, not assisting him; he is in direct competition in a free market economy. Far from directly assisting him he is endeavouring, not so much to do him damage, as just win the contract from him.  Unfortunately, a whole segment, perhaps 100,000 workers, will be adversely affected as a result of this.  That is very regrettable.</P>
    <P>The Minister acknowledged the substance of some of these arguments, but for whatever reason, has not enshrined it <Col N="1804" /> in his amendment.  I am less concerned about my change in wording from the other amendment in the sense that mine is constructed to have the effect of frustrating the strike rather than the Minister's formulation which says &ldquo;for the purpose of frustrating the strike&rdquo;.  Again it renders it that much more difficult for workers and trade unions because they have to show there was a purpose whereas, under my amendment, all that has to be shown is that there was the effect; in other words, that if the objective effect was that the dispute was damaged then the case applies.  Under the Minister's formulation, one has to prove that they did it for the purpose of undermining the strike.  There is a distinction to be drawn there, an important one, but not nearly as important as the earlier requirement to impose on trade unions the requirement to prove that the secondary employer was directly assisting their employer.</P>
    <P>Take the example of the grocery and retail trade.  Suppose there was a dispute at Dunnes Stores in Henry Street and there is a Dunnes Stores around the corner in which there is not &mdash; there are a great many other Dunnes Stores in the city &mdash; can the workers in dispute at Henry Street place a picket on one particular other Dunnes Store or any other Dunnes Store?  In my view, under this formulation, they cannot.  I say that because, although that particular second Dunnes Store, or any other chain or multiple that would be taking up the slack, thereby damaging the dispute and in that way meeting the first criterion of this section &mdash; that they are undermining or frustrating the strike &mdash; one could not prove, in those circumstances that they were doing anything other than availing of the fact that they now have a whole new segment of customers who have simply changed their business from that particular store to one around the corner. In effect this means the workers could be picketing until the cows come home.  The needs of the customers are being met in the adjacent store of the same multiple but one cannot transfer the picket to it <Col N="1805" /> because of the formulation of this section.</P>
    <P>The Minister has shown himself to be flexible in the course of this debate on aspects of the Bill that are held very dear <i>vis-á-vis</i> industrial action.  The Minister well knows from his meetings with Congress that this is a major area of concern. I accept that the removal of the word &ldquo;calculated&rdquo; renders it that bit more acceptable but, unfortunately, fundamental objections remain for two reasons.</P>

      <P>I was concluding on what I think all sides of the House have agreed is the most controversial area of this Bill.  Under the business arrangements we have now agreed it will be seen that we will proceed very quickly through the outstanding 48 amendments but that this section goes to the heart of the Bill before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving amendment No. 9 I confined myself to making the net point that the test now for secondary picketing being introduced here is the object of one of reasonable belief as compared to the subjective one of honest belief on the part of the workers so involved.  I do not wish to prolong that point but, on the group of amendments we are taking together, there is a very important distinction to be drawn between amendment No. 11 &mdash; which is an alternative to No. 10 &mdash; and the contents of amendment No. 10.  The Minister must acknowledge that the structure of the workforce has changed <Col N="1807" /> dramatically over the last ten or 15 years. I would argue that this is a segment of the most vulnerable workers, indeed often not trade union-organised, in other words, contract workers who have very little security or employment and that such security of employment as they have is entirely dependent on their trade union.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Priority Question No. 5 and Question No. 55 together.</P>
      <P>I understand that the ESB are currently reviewing existing policies for funding future investment.  Funding under existing practice is provided partly from the depreciation and amortisation funds which are used also to meet debt retiral as required, and the remainder is by new borrowing.  When this review is completed the ESB will be submitting their proposals for my consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister concerned at the statement in the ESB's recent report on this topic that their debt, while not as high as previously, is still among the highest in Europe, clearly implying that in 1992 there will be an upward shift in their pricing structure?  Is the Minister concerned about that and will he set some limit so that electricity prices will not rise at a greater rate than the consumer price index?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the size of the ESB debt.  Their debt equity ratio, at about 61 per cent, is too high. The objective is to achieve a figure of 50 per cent.  On the other point the Deputy raised, it is much too early to predict what price increase, if any, will arise in 1992.  As the Deputy knows, electricity prices are mostly influenced by factors outside the ESB's control, such as dual costs, exchange rates and interest rates. To try to predict a trend in this area is virtually impossible and would be akin to crystal ball gazing, an exercise the Minister for Energy should not indulge in too often.  We can only hope, therefore, that the costs to which I have referred do not escalate in the intervening period.  It is premature at this stage to try to predict what prices will be in the post-1992 period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree it is time to reconsider the system of amortisation that the ESB build into their pricing structure, which was criticised by the Jakobsen report who suggested it was adding to electricity prices for consumers in Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has arisen over the years and is the subject of the proposal to create a development fund.  I would not mind giving the House the detail on this if I had time.  If I did so now I would be taking up all the time for priority questions.  There is a popular misconception about the ESB's amortisation charge.  In a private enterprise company, reserves are formed from after-tax profits before dividends are paid to shareholders.The purpose of these reserves is <Col N="1816" /> to make provision for future debts and the cost of capital expansion.  However, the ESB are prohibited by statute from making a profit and cannot therefore make a reserve in the same way as a private enterprise company.  They are a highly capital-intensive body and must have some form of funding to meet their high capital commitments.  Notwithstanding the requirement to break even, it is a desirable policy that the ESB should provide a substantial proportion of their new capital requirements from their own resources rather than having to resort entirely to borrowings, a point also made by Jakobsen.</P>
      <P>The principal mechanism used by the ESB to provide for such internal funds in their accounts is depreciation and amortisation.The amortisation charge has been interpreted by some as concealing a profit which would help to reduce prices but the reality is that if the amortisation charge was to be abolished and not replaced by an alternative funding mechanism, future capital requirements would have to be met entirely from borrowings.  Total reliance on borrowings would inevitably worsen the terms under which the ESB can borrow and, of course, in the long term this would raise electricity prices. As I have said in my initial reply, this whole matter is to be looked into.  Discussions will take place between the Department, myself and the ESB regarding this whole area which, as the Deputy and others have said, is in need of urgent attention.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Priority Question No. 7 and Questions Nos, 29, 52, 147 and 148, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord Gáis Éireann have a statutory obligation to develop and maintain a system for the supply of natural gas on a <Col N="1818" /> commercial basis.  Accordingly, proposals for the extension of the gas distribution grid are a matter for Bord Gáis Éireann and are assessed by the board in the light of that obligation.  I understand from Bord Gáis Éireann that they are currently preparing a register of non-gas estates which will be considered for connection as viable projects are identified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that in the light of a ban on coal next September, the fact that a quarter of the city does not have the option of converting to natural gas imposes on the Government a certain moral obligation to help extend the mains network?  This would give people the opportunity of using the premium and cleanest fuel in the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be delighted if the natural gas distribution network in Dublin city could be extended so as to be available to every household but that is not the position and is not likely to be the position for quite some time.  I would like the House to bear in mind the following facts.  The estimated cost of laying the necessary mains and extensions to non-gas estates in Dublin is approximately £60 million.  On a house by house basis, the cost would be in excess of £1,000.  In addition, householders would have to bear a major part of the cost of changing from existing systems, which would be considerable.  Given the likely penetration rates for gas in these estates, Bord Gáis could hope to sell on average not more than 400 therms per house &mdash; that is their professional estimate.  The return on these sales could not justify the outlay by Bord Gáis Éireann.  I would remind the House that the board are a commercial body and are required to achieve a reasonable return on investments of public money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the average cost of £1,000 per house is not way out of line with the existing cost which is in the order of £600 per house?  Would he not agree that, as <Col N="1819" /> the Government, until very recently, were offering 75 per cent grants on the whole job, there is now an onus on them to offer some small contribution to help Bord Gáis extend the network, on the basis of the most commercial prospects first, of course.  Would the Minister not make some contribution on behalf of the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unwise to suggest that the solution is to give a grant, because the cost would be enormous.  Suffice it to say that Bord Gáis are carrying out an estate by estate assessment.  The cost of the work will vary and in some estates it may be more economically viable to carry out the extension.  As I stated at the outset, my wish is that all of the housing estates in Dublin would have the natural gas option &mdash; I have given the costs involved.  It is going to be a step by step process but, I as Minister, and the Government are anxious to see that achieved.  Responsibility will be with Bord Gáis Éireann who have to operate within certain commercial restraints.  I suggest to Deputies who have individual estates in mind &mdash; representations have been made to Bord Gáis Éireann and to me in this matter &mdash; that rather than make representations to me, they should approach the sales manager of Bord Gáis Éireann who will be quite willing to go into the costs involved and the possibilities of extending the gas pipeline to certain housing estates.  I would prefer if Members of the House availed of the offer by Bord Gáis Éireann in this regard rather than seek to use ministerial intervention to get Bord Gáis Éireann to extend the pipelines in these cases.  I am sure the House will recall the many occasions on which it has deprecated unnecessary interference by Ministers in the work of State bodies.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Priority Question No. 8 and Questions Nos. 37 and 70 together.</P>
      <P>The key objectives of this Government's energy policy are to ensure that there is a reliable and secure supply of energy, that energy is provided at the minimum cost possible and that energy use complies with current safety and environmental requirements.</P>
      <P>The main policy objectives for energy were set out in the <i>National Development Plan 1989-1993</i> and in the Programme for Government.  I am not convinced that the publication of a White Paper on energy would change these objectives or enable them to be achieved more effectively than at present.  I believe it is more fruitful to direct scarce resources at specific areas of energy policy which require to be examined in the light of changing circumstances and I will continue to do so when necessary.</P>

      <P>It is somewhat puzzling that the Minister agrees there is a need for thought about policy but does not agree there is need to publish a policy paper.  Would he not agree that the IEA, on every occasion on which they have commented on Irish energy policy, have drawn attention to the lack of a policy paper and encouraged the Government to proceed with it quickly?  Would the Minister not agree that in the absence of this policy paper the ESB and other agencies are effectively writing their own policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy refers to a statement made by a previous Minister who indicated his intention to prepare a White Paper.  I can confirm that a considerable amount of preparatory work was undertaken in the Department of Energy with the intention of drafting a White Paper on energy policy.  However, in the light of rapid changes on the energy scene, particularly the significant initiatives at European Community level in relation to the achievement of the Single European Market, it was felt that it would be pointless to produce a White Paper which would immediately be overtaken by events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Heightened awareness of environmental concerns in recent times will have significant effects on the energy scene, the full implications of which are not yet clear.  I do not consider that it is sensible at this stage to commit substantial resources of my Department to the preparation of a White Paper on energy policy in a climate where factors are changing fairly rapidly.  It would be a wrong decision from a strategic point of view and a waste of the resources of my Department, which I am devoting to certain areas which I have mentioned as being in need of attention.  These are specific policy areas which include the gas inter-connector with the United Kingdom or Europe where I want the very important strategic policy decision to be implemented as quickly as possible.  This will have a dramatic effect on our energy costs.  There is also the question of <Col N="1822" /> upgrading the Whitegate Oil Refinery and the examination of the best uses of Bord na Móna cut-away bog.  There are also policy matters in regard to combined heat and power opportunities.  These are areas to which I am devoting departmental resources and it would be remiss of me to switch important staff to preparing a White Paper which in these circumstances, where the ground rules are changing so rapidly, would probably be a wasted exercise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the European Commission are dramatically changing the ground rules, how can we face that fact if we are not willing to adopt policies which will secure, for example, a 20 per cent cut in fossil fuel use?  We have to think out these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have expected the Deputy to acknowledge that this Minister for Energy has made a very important contribution to changes in the energy policy of the EC in the initiatives we have taken in securing approval of very important directives in which for the first time an internal energy policy is beginning to emerge.  This follows the six months of the Irish Presidency.  We are more conscious than most of the emerging situation and I believe the stance I am taking in the Department is the correct one in the circumstances.  We recognise our international obligations and we are working with close co-operation between the energy and environment areas in order to achieve stated objectives where limits on emissions and so on are required following international agreements. These commitments were published earlier this year in the Government's environment policy document and I do not see any difficulty in our achieving these objectives through prudent policy management.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Priority Question No. 9 and Question No. 24 together.</P>
      <P>The estimated capital cost of installing desulphurisation equipment at Moneypoint would be £150 million for retrofitting, including interest during construction.  The additional operating costs at the station would be about £15 million per annum.  Replacement generation costs caused by temporary plant shutdown for the purposes of installation of the equipment are estimated at £10 million for each of the three closures.</P>
      <P>The effect of desulphurisation equipment on discharges to the atmosphere from Moneypoint would be to reduce the annual emissions of sulphur dioxide from the station by about 33,000 tonnes.  There will, on the other hand, be an increase in the annual emissions of carbon dioxide, a contributor to the greenhouse effect, by about 23,000 tonnes.  In addition, there would be some additional CO2 emissions from other generating plants to compensate for efficiency losses at Moneypoint which could result from the installation of FGD equipment.  There would also be additional waste disposal problems due to limestone and liquid effluents arising from the process of desulphurisation.</P>

      <P>I have not.  It does not arise.  The limitation on emissions which we have signed on for does not place responsibility solely on the ESB.  Power stations contribute only a certain percentage of sulphur emissions.  Industry also has a role to play.  There are policy decisions and energy management measures which could enable us to live within the limits we have agreed to achieve without necessarily involving ourselves in this huge investment.  It is too early to state whether it will ever be necessary to instal desulphurisation equipment.</P>

      <P>The advice, which was extensive, was conveyed at lengthy meetings between officials from my Department and from the Attorney General's office, and has been confirmed during many discussions I have had personally with the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>May I inform the Deputy that during a recent visit to the ship <i>Greenpeace</i> I extended an invitation to them to have their lawyers meet with staff from the Attorney General's office to discuss the conflicting reports from both sides on the possibility of achieving success in a legal case.  The Attorney General has responded to my request and has agreed to meet with representatives of the Greenpeace organisation, who had in the past submitted extensive documentation to the Department of Energy which did not however, conclusively claim that a successful case could be brought but suggested rather that it might be a useful exercise to gain publicity for this matter. However, I cannot act on that basis.  I must make a decision on behalf of the State.  Finally, of course, it is a matter for the Government but I am not recommending to the Government that any legal action be taken until I am satisfied, and advised so by the Attorney General's office, that a case based on facts will offer a reasonable opportunity for a successful outcome in court.

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are aspects of the Euratom Treaty which I have indicated publicly that I am not satisfied with and I have called publicly for a review of the Euratom Treaty with a view to establishing a more effective Treaty to enable <Col N="1826" /> countries such as Ireland to have their point of view implemented, in particular, Ireland's request for the establishment of a European-wide inspectorate of nuclear installations.  Under the present Euratom Agreement, provision is made whereby the Community can establish such an inspectorate, but there is no obligation on the Community to do so.  I would like to see the Euratom Treaty altered from an enabling provision to a Treaty which puts a statutory obligation on the Commission to set up an inspectorate.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that those changes are required but I would like to suggest to the Deputy that it would be much more helpful to me as Minister for Energy if those who are calling on me to take legal action would indicate to me the basis for the legal action they are suggesting rather than continuing to make the ridiculous call to take legal action without trying to substantiate the case.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the Government decision last April on decentralisation, I have directed my Department to identify areas under its aegis, including the wider public service, for transferring to locations outside of Dublin.  My Department is accordingly consulting its State bodies with a view to ascertaining what further contribution they can make to the implementation of Government policy on decentralisation. I am awaiting the results of these consultations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to bring to the Deputy's attention the extent to which the staffs of the State bodies under the aegis of my Department are already decentralised. This includes the head office of Bord Gáis Éireann which is located in Cork and over <Col N="1829" /> the next couple of months most of the remaining head office staff of Bord na Móna will be transferred out of Dublin to the midlands.  The rest of the Bord na Móna workforce is, of course, located outside of Dublin.  In addition the Electricity Supply Board is extensively decentralised with a presence in 120 locations nationwide.  Most of the staffs of Coillte Teoranta and the Irish National Petroleum Corporation are also located outside of Dublin.</P>

      <P>Increasing timber production in recent years has reduced the demand for imports of sawn conifer timber from 220,000 tonnes in 1980, valued at £42 million, to 167,000 tonnes in 1989, valued at £48 million.

      <P>Overall timber production will continue to increase and Ireland is expected to be a net exporter of coniferous sawnwood by about 1995.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 21, 22, 28, 47, 51, and 61 together.</P>
      <P>INPC operations encompass the purchase and refining of crude oil, the supply of 35 per cent of the market requirements of petrol and gas oil to the distribution companies and associated trading of intermediate and final petroleum products.There are no plans for an expanded role for the corporation in the area of distribution and retailing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Programme for Government Commits the Government to seeking an upgrade of Whitegate refinery with third party participation so that oil product consumers in Ireland will be supplied by full free market channels and are not, <Col N="1832" /> therefore, put at any competitive disadvantage.</P>
    <P>A task force was established in May 1989 by decision of the Government to identify all realistic investment options for the facilities at Whitegate and Whiddy.</P>
    <P>With the assistance of international consultants, the task force evaluated the technical, economic and financial aspects of the options which they identified. Because of the wealth of technical and financial detail concerning the possible future operations at the refinery contained in the task force report, it is not considered appropriate to publish all of this information, much of which is highly confidential.  The report could be used to advantage by potential competitors in the refining industry.</P>
    <P>In the meantime I am continuing to pursue appropriate opportunities which might lead to an oil producer or international oil company participating in the proposed upgrading of the refinery and reactivation of the terminal.  Because of their confidential nature, I am not in a position to discuss the details of individual approaches made by third parties regarding these facilities.  No specific relationships with an oil producer are envisaged in the current context for an upgrading project at the refinery. However, I have reasonable expectations that oil interests will participate in such a project.  Discussions with interested parties are ongoing but no final proposals are under consideration by me as yet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the confidential nature of this issue but may I ask the Minister to give some indication of his thinking on the status of the 35 per cent offtake under an agreement he would conclude?  Is he satisfied that a future operation seeking to distribute oil from Whitegate would be able to enter the market successfully for the excess over the 35 per cent offtake in the face of the existing distributors in that market?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the present mandatory offtake level of 35 per cent was established under a fuels <Col N="1833" /> order and was introduced to secure the continued operation of the Whitegate refinery.  However, the Government are committed to seeking an upgrading of the refinery with third party participation so that oil product consumers in Ireland, notably business consumers, are not put at any disadvantage relative to overseas competitors by the eventual removal of the obligatory update.</P>
      <P>It is clear from what I have said that it is the intention to remove the mandatory offtake of oil products by oil companies. That is part of the agreement in the Programme for Government.  It is a matter for any interested third party as to what arrangements he would make in relation to the distribution of products from an upgraded Whitegate refinery.  It would not be a matter for me to discuss at this point in view of the fact that, first, we are continuing discussions with a number of interested parties and, secondly, it is more a matter for the third party than for me at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give even an approximate time frame for the conclusion of the ongoing discussions which he mentioned?  I raised this issue with the Minister about six months ago and I am sure he understands my concern about it as it relates to my constituency. Can the Minister indicate when he hopes such negotiations will come to a conclusion?The Minister said he is having discussions with a number of parties.  Can he give an indication of the number of companies involved &mdash; is it two, four or ten &mdash; so that we will have an idea of the extent of the interest involved?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Deputy's constituency interest I can well understand his concern about this matter. However, it would not be appropriate for me to give any information about the people with whom we are having discussions on this matter.  It would be impossible for me to give an estimate of the length of time these discussions could take.  I probably share the Deputy's frustration &mdash; if he is frustrated and I certainly am &mdash; at the length of time it is taking for <Col N="1834" /> me to be in a position to make positive recommendations to the Government in the matter.  I am very keen to achieve a successful contract or settlement with an interested third party for the upgrading of the Whitegate Refinery and, in the event of a successful outcome to the planning appeal, to the reactivation of the Whiddy facilities.  These discussions are taking much longer than I had thought or hoped.  I put an estimate on the length of time before but it was not achieved, and I do not think it would make things happen any quicker now.  I can assure the Deputies that this is a matter of top level priority in my Department.  The task force have completed their work so we have all the technical information which will assist us in advancing discussions to a more positive stage but, again, it depends on the interest of the third party and whether he intends to go ahead.</P>

Does the Minister not agree that this is out of tenor with the general trend of the oil industry at present where facilities such as Whitegate and Whiddy are specifically attractive to oil producers seeking entry into the European market? Is the Minister, by deciding not to go that route, cutting off a valuable opportunity for developing those facilities?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The potential for significant additional use of hydro power in <Col N="1835" /> Ireland is limited.  The fact must be faced that most of the best sites have already been harnessed.  The ESB currently have 512 MW, including 292 MW of pumped storage of installed hydro-electric capacity.  This represents 13 per cent of ESB's total installed capacity.  It is estimated that developed capacity represents over 70 per cent of the total technically feasible hydro capacity in the country. Development of the remaining sites will, generally speaking, be more difficult and costly than in the past and will depend on economic and other consideration such as concern for the environment.</P>
      <P>Under the EC Valoren Programme, the ESB recently built a small hydro scheme at Coomhola, near Bantry, County Cork.  This plant, which is currently being commissioned, has an output of 750 kw.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that it is desirable to make every effort to increase the capacity of hydro-electric generation?  I have noted that the Minister told us that some of the prime sites have been taken up but the ESB should make a greater effort to generate electricity from hydro-electric schemes. They should not depend on oil and coal burning stations.  Will the Minister agree that it is desirable, from the environmental point of view, that the board should adopt such a policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it would be desirable to achieve the construction of some additional hydro-electric stations. We submitted proposals for EC grant aid under the Valoren Programme for ten such schemes.  On the environmental aspect, I should like to tell the Deputy that ironically it has proved to be an obstacle in that it has been impossible in a number of cases to obtain planning permission for hydro-electric proposals. There were serious objections on amenity grounds to the construction of hydro-electric stations in the proposed locations.  Those proposals have had to be dropped.  Given that the best sites <Col N="1836" /> have been developed further development in this regard will have to concentrate on small or very small units, micro hydros.</P>
      <P>The current relatively low level of energy prices, coupled with high capital costs will make many of those sites unacceptably costly to develop at this time. Most of the sites have already been logged and assessed in the Department's study carried out in 1985.  Their possible development will be kept under review but the planning obstacle has brought to an end planning on a substantial number of them.  The possibility of a grant allocation from the EC has been changed because of those difficulties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that the nub of the problem for private hydro and other alternative energy uses has been the buy-back policy operated by the ESB under which they only give fuel replacement pricing?  Will the Minister agree that in order to encourage the development of these renewable sources there has to be a change in that policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The buy-back policy is a matter which the owners of the private hydro-electric stations have been raising with the Department.  They have referred to the contracts they have with the ESB and I am having that matter examined very carefully.  I hope to be able to make some decisions in the near future.  The best proposal is for the owners to renogotiate their contracts on a one-to-one basis.  In some cases there may be a justification for an increase in the price but in other cases there may not.  I am anxious to have an increase in the volume of electricity produced by various renewable energy schemes and a hydro-electric scheme is one of them.  However, the number of suitable sites is limited and the cost factor is a major deterrent.  One has to bear in mind that at present the ESB are, happily, in a position to produce electricity at a low cost.  That may not always be the case but the price structure at present operates against the economics of hydro-electric stations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The services available to me are carrying out a full examination of the points raised in the report.  Initial consultations indicate that a lot of this damage arose from planting that took place in the twenties, thirties and forties.  Generally speaking, the Office of Public Works are satisfied that planting undertaken since the seventies has been satisfactory.  I am having the items of archaeological importance mentioned in the report examined.  I would be very happy at a later stage to identify, if possible, when the planting took place in each case.  I would be shocked to think that there was any major damage or vandalism to any archaeological site, areas of historical culture or national value, arising from the activities of the Department of Forestry, Coillte Teoranta or any of the private planting firms in operation. I am gravely concerned about this matter, not just in relation to archaeological areas of importance but also to the environment.A whole series of new guidelines is being laid down and will, I hope, be in place for the next planting season in the autumn to ensure that modern maximum environmental controls are applied in relation to any planting scheme, because it is not the wish of the Department of Energy in their forestry development programme &mdash; which is very extensive &mdash; to detract from the environment in any <Col N="1840" /> way.  They seek to improve the environment and it is essential for this country &mdash; and the world &mdash; to plant more trees to clear up the CO² problem which affects atmospheric warming.  We need to play a much greater role in this regard in this country; about 5 per cent or 6 per cent of our land area is planted, whereas in Europe the figure is 20 per cent or 25 per cent.  We are so far behind in forestry that it is a matter of extreme importance to get into place an extensive planting programme without damaging anything of value.  Therefore, any planting which will take place, which will have grant or Coillte Teoranta approval, will have gone through the most rigorous system of examination before permission to plant is granted.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Energy</askee>
      <Quest>the improvements which have occurred in Irish energy efficiency as measured in terms of energy units per unit of GDP over the past three years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The measure of energy <Col N="1841" /> efficiency referred to by the Deputy is usually referred to as the &ldquo;energy intensity&rdquo; of an economy.  This is defined as the ratio of total primary energy requirement (TPER) to gross domestic product (GDP) at constant prices and is measured in tonnes of oil equivalent per £1,000 of GDP.  Based on data for 1986 to 1988 and estimates for 1989, this ratio has improved by 6.3 per cent over the past three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that this rate of progress is a considerable slowing down on what was achieved in the past?  Will he also agree that there is a need &mdash; not only for reasons of efficiency but also in relation to the environment &mdash; to dramatically improve our energy intensity?  Will he further agree that the Government should introduce a special conservation programme to achieve that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The improvement of 6.3 per cent is a decrease in the energy intensity and it means that we are generating the same level of gross domestic product with less energy, which contributes to improving the environment and the problems related to it.  I agree that it is important to continue to improve in this area. Any improvement is welcome but it is not appropriate to look at movement in energy intensity on an annual basis because it could disimprove in some years, which was the case in 1988 and 1989.  During those years, although the GDP is estimated to have grown by 5 per cent, the total energy consumption grew by over 7 per cent.  Clearly, the ratio of energy consumption to GDP rose in that period and this phenomenon was clearly illustrated in the mid-eighties when energy prices fell dramatically.  For example, between 1984 and 1986 energy intensity increased &mdash; that is, disimproved &mdash; by over 8 per cent and during this period energy consumption grew at an average annual rate of almost 5 per cent.  At the same time economic growth was sluggish at only 0.5 per cent per annum.  Clearly, GDP growth is not the <Col N="1842" /> only factor which influences energy consumption and the general fall in energy prices in the mid-eighties induced increased energy consumption, with the result that energy intensity increased. The underlying trend in Irish energy intensity is, however, downwards and is, therefore, welcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister missed the point of my supplementary which was in relation to a new conservation programme.Will he agree that, compared to Europe, we are still high in terms of energy intensity?  Will he further agree that we have a very poorly developed combined heat and power sector, that house insulation is very poor compared to Europe and that a very high proportion of people use open fires as their main heating system?  In the light of that, will the Minister agree that there is a need for a Government conservation programme as a matter of urgency for environmental and efficiency reasons?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The level of consumption domestically in relation to open fires reflects a small percentage of overall energy consumption.  Measures are being taken &mdash; I think they are the subject of another question &mdash; in relation to conservation measures and conserving heat in houses has been listed as a matter which needs attention.  It is included in the short conservation programme which we are undertaking at present.  There is, of course, need for a very positive conservation programme to be implemented at national level.  The Government committed £500,000 this year to enable us to make a start in that area, which is the correct way to tackle the problem.  It grieves me to hear so many informed and concerned people talking about the effect on our environment and the consequential global warming which threatens us arising from the consumption of fossil fuels while at the same time they do not speak of the need to conserve energy and to strive for greater efficiency in energy usage.  That area needs attention and some kind of programme will have to be established to <Col N="1843" /> bring home to the public the need for each individual to see his or her responsibility in this area to reducing the dangers arising from global warming resulting from excessive and inefficient use of fuels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not true to say that the action taken by the EC against Greece is the same as the action that was taken against Whitegate in 1983.  The European Court considered the Whitegate regime and in 1984 ruled that the system of mandatory purchases from Whitegate was justified on the grounds of public policy and public security.  Furthermore, Whitegate is the sole refinery in Ireland. The situation in Greece is completely <Col N="1845" /> different.  In Greece there is a mix of state owned and privately owned refineries, in other words there are a number of refineries, not just one, and they are in the public and private ownership.  Whitegate is not in competition with other refineries but is run on a full cost recovery basis.  The Commission's complaints with the Greek authorities deal with competition related to refineries and distribution and are far more fundamental and far reaching than the issues raised in the European Court relating to Whitegate in 1984.</P>

Increased planting programmes in 1987 and 1988 resulted in the creation of some 570 jobs in those two years which was well in excess of the target.

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>We were dealing with amendments to section 11 which is the most controversial and, from the point of view of the trade union movement, the most important section of the Bill.  It proposes to regulate picketing policy and <Col N="1958" /> to impose restrictions on picketers that were not there before this Bill was brought before the House.  It is all very well to say picketers have the right to place pickets and that workers have the right to withdraw their labour, but if one so restricts the ability to place pickets one effectively undermines the right to withdraw labour and the workers' right to strike.  I am afraid the measures now proposed by the Minister go so far that they will effectively deprive a great many trade unionists of this ultimate sanction.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to accept that we are operating in a world of holding companies, subsidiary companies, associate companies, multiple stores, chains of companies and contractors.  In that situation it is simply not feasible to practically prosecute a trade dispute effectively unless the workers who have withdrawn their labour may place pickets on associate companies, subsidiary companies or whatever where they have an honest belief that that associate employer, subsidiary employer or whoever is acting to undermine, damage or frustrate a strike. That is the structure of the workforce out there at the moment, and the Minister must accept that it is now possible to transfer production, as Deputy Bell explained on the last occasion, from one plant to another plant owned by the same holding company in such a manner as to leave the workers outside high and dry because their dispute is not effective.  If that is the case in production, it is most certainly the case in other forms of service industry, the retail trade for example, where one store can take up the slack and can argue they are doing no more than exploiting a niche in the market and that they are not assisting the primary employer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider what he is doing to contract labour, a growing feature of the economy and employing a great many workers.  The Minister no doubt will say he is not taking away the right to strike, that these workers may picket their own employer.  That is true but why would they want to picket their own employer where that employer has been undercut in the marketplace and <Col N="1959" /> has lost the contract to a competitor?  In that case it makes no sense for them to picket the headquarters of their own contractor.  They picket the place where they worked in pursuit of employment with the new contractor.  They may do that as the law stands but they cannot do so when this Bill is passed.  It is regrettable that those in the most vulnerable sections of the workforce are effectively being deprived of that right.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage at column 757 of the Official Report on 30 May the Minister said at a late hour of the night that: &ldquo;At present people do not have the right to picket in order to get themselves a job.&rdquo;  That is not actually the case. Under the Trade Disputes Act, 1906, workers have the right to prosecute for employment.  We dealt with registered agreements where, for example, building workers frequently picket an employer on the site.  The way the trade union movement have tried to combat the contract phenomenon is that they acknowledge they cannot prevent one competitor from undercutting a rival company, but they can give sanction to their members who are employed in providing that service in that employment for a number of years to take industrial action, to picket the new employer for the right to work.  If a new company wins the contract that is fine but they must employ the workers who were providing the service.  Under this proposition the trade unions cannot prosecute such a dispute for employment and that has a severe, adverse impact on the most vulnerable workers in the economy.  I had hoped the Minister would have responded to that point.</P>
    <P>We are seeking to take case law as established in Ellis and Wright which, in a nutshell, said that there must be a clearly discernible connection where workers decide to picket a secondary employer. The Minister has said that is too broad, too vague, and that there is a need for a statutory statement to tighten it.  The statutory statement the Minister is making here is far too restrictive and will make the prosecution of a trade dispute <Col N="1960" /> by a trade union in many cases virtually impossible.  In addition, it rules out the rights of a large section of the workforce employed at the most vulnerable end of the market.  I ask the Minister to reconsider his position on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte covered the points I wished to make and I just support the view expressed by him.  Both Deputy Rabbitte and I worked at senior level in the largest trade union here and we have experience of this type of activity.</P>
      <P>One would get the impression that the FIE, the employer organisation have won the day over the ICTU.  It appears this section was virtually written by the FIE and I would like reassurance on that from the Minister.  At the moment it is difficult for workers to strike, as evidenced by the figures, due to pressures arising from people waiting outside the gate to get their jobs if they strike, without having this pressure on them as well.  I understand the employers' submission on this section was put very forcibly to the Minister and from that one would get the impression that members of trade unions were running around willy-nilly putting pickets everywhere.  Although not in legislation, there are clearly set out procedures to be followed in responsible trades unions before a strike is sanctioned.  People like myself and Deputy Rabbitte would have to be convinced beyond reasonable doubt that a strike was properly conducted in accordance with union rules.  Employer organisations making representations to the Minister for Labour would give the impression that all trade unionists have horns and that they go galloping around putting pickets everywhere they can. That is not true at all.  Under this Bill where a company takes over the manufacturing of the product in the course of a dispute, the trade union would be acting illegally in striking and they would be totally hamstrung.  This section is giving a licence to employers to abuse industrial relations procedures and that is regrettable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two clauses in the section we dealt <Col N="1961" /> with before lunch and this one will change the course of industrial relations for the worse.  We will regret these two sections. It would have been better not to have introduced any legislation to update the law than to do this because we are effectively turning the clock back to the last century.</P>

      <P>There have been a great number of points on this section.  I do not want to go back into a Committee Stage debate but, as briefly as possible, I will answer a few points.  I assure Deputy Bell this is a balanced package; otherwise we would not debate it in the House.  I acknowledge there are some pluses and minuses.  The Deputy mentioned his involvement with a very big union.  I accept that some unions have rules but only 70 per cent of employees are covered by ballot provisions and I ask the Deputy to remember that.  I accept that most employees abide by good industrial relations practices. Here we are widening good industrial relations practices and that is all.  The fact is that there are unions, other than the one of which the Deputy is a member, who are not so good and ignore everything, including their own rule books.  I have refrained in this debate, and I am not going to do so now, from spelling out who I am talking about but I could have answered many of the points made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me respond to a point made by Deputy Rabbitte before lunch in relation to stores.  There is nothing to prevent an employee in a dispute with a store from picketing the store which has taken up <Col N="1962" /> the business, if the same employer is involved.  I acknowledged on Second Stage and Committee Stage that employers seek a way around this but there is nothing to prevent an employee in disupute with their store which is shifting the work to another store from picketing that store.  One of the things employers requested, which neither Deputy Quinn nor I granted, is that employees be confined to picketing their place of employment.In relation to contract labour&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation as it is phrased positively invites the employer to have recourse to the courts.  There would then be an onus on the union to prove to the court that that store has taken up the slack.  That will be a very difficult thing to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>If an employee in dispute with a store reasonably believes that another store is taking up the slack they may picket that store.  This does not only happen in cases involving stores.  It also happens in cases involving bus companies who switch customers and in the construction industry as Deputy Bell indicated.Later I will explain why I removed the word &ldquo;calculated&rdquo; around which the debate centred the other day.</P>
      <P>In relation to contract labour, employees may picket their own employer, their employer's headquarters or the employer who has been given the contract.  Deputy Rabbitte argued the last day, and I must say I did not agree with him, that where an employer loses a contract his employees should be able to picket the employer who has been given the contract.  I cannot agree with him on that point because if one follows this argument through to its logical conclusion, as I did on Committee Stage, we would end up with people putting up pickets all over the place.  If an employer loses a contract because of price or inefficiency it is not reasonable to argue that the employees should be allowed to take off after the employer who has won the contract fair and square to picket him.</P>

      <P>The amendments the Government are accepting are amendments Nos. 10 and 13.  The present test, provided for in subsection (2), is whether it is reasonable for those picketing to believe that the second employer has acted in a way calculated to frustrate the strike or other industrial action by directly assisting their employer.  The last day I argued that in the case of most disputes it is not difficult to show reasonable grounds.  Both the employees and the trade union movement know the normal routine in the workplace.  Indeed, they may have worked there far longer than the management and will quickly realise if an employer is acting in a way calculated to frustrate the strike.  Deputies argued on Committee Stage that picketers would find it difficult to meet this test and would be required to establish that a second employer had acted in a way calculated to frustrate the strike by providing direct assistance.  There was a long debate on secondary picketing on Committee Stage when I made it clear I was not in a position to move away from the objective test of reasonable belief or the concept of direct assistance which is central to the balanced regulations on secondary picketing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument on Committee Stage centred around the word &ldquo;calculated&rdquo; which was considered to be too strong, inflexible and ambiguous and I indicated I would look at the matter to see if we <Col N="1964" /> could come up with an alternative.  The wording we have come up with, with which both the trade unions and the Labour Party agree, is that it is reasonable for those so attending to believe that the employer &ldquo;has directly assisted their employer who is a party to the trade dispute for the purpose of frustrating the strike or other industrial action&rdquo;.  In formulating the provisions on secondary picketing my approach to employers who have deliberately involved themselves in the dispute by providing direct assistance to the first employer with the aim of frustrating the strike is that they can be picketed.  Deputy Rabbitte's amendment would widen the principle unduly.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 13 is consequential on amendment No. 10.  We have been advised that the wording is not too restrictive.The objective test is whether employees have reasonable grounds for believing that an employer is acting in a way calculated to frustrate a strike.  It would be pointless including the words &ldquo;honestly believe&rdquo; as one could honestly believe in anything at all.  If someone has to show reasonable grounds to meet an objective test that would get over the first part of the matter.</P>
    <P>In order to get over the second part we have removed the word &ldquo;calculated&rdquo; around which the debate centred the last day.  I am sorry some Deputies believe I am not going far enough but I do not believe that employees will find it difficult to prove their case if they do have to go to court.  A trade union cited the example in the construction industry of two lorries delivering materials each day and all of a sudden the number increases to 20.  It would be clear to any layman that the second employer was acting in a way calculated to frustrate the strike.  In time we will see that the trade union movement and individual shop stewards will have no difficulty in showing what the position was prior to and during the dispute. That is all I have to say on the matter other than that these amendments will improve the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief because I am conscious of the time and the other <Col N="1965" /> amendments in the names of Deputies. I would like to thank the Minister for accepting the thrust of most of the arguments on Committee Stage in relation to the word &ldquo;calculated&rdquo;.  Whatever about the onus on somebody in court to prove the existence of a reasonable belief, proving that there was a calculated intent by an employer to frustrate an industrial action would be far more difficult.  I will not try to get philosophical at this point. It is clear that the Minister is trying to maintain a balance between the social partners and in that respect the task is not easy and has not been easy for some time.  It should be noted, however, that a fear is expressed professionally by both Deputy Rabbitte and Deputy Bell that in their experience some employers &mdash; all that is needed is a small minority &mdash; may well use this law to establish a new culture, so to speak, in relation to the restrictions on picketing.  My view is that we will have to wait and see.  We need to get on with the law and we need to get on with its reform.  I hope that the other components of this legislation, including the labour relations commission and codes of practice that might evolve from that, will resolve some of these problems. Since we are on Report Stage and the Minister has accepted in part some of the thrust of the argument expressed on Committee Stage, I welcome it and formally support amendment No. 10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's riposte to the effect that contract workers may prosecute a strike against their own employer is of no practical value to contract workers in the situation I postulated.If the headquarters of their contract company is in Merrion Square, the contract is in Coolock and the market place has given the contract at Coolock over to a competitor, there is no point in the workers, normally employed at Coolock, picketing Merrion Square, picketing their own employer who has lost the contract and can do nothing for them.  Up to now the situation has obtained that they could picket their place of employment at Coolock and could do so up to a point where they <Col N="1966" /> could force negotiations with the new contractor with a view to their being employed.</P>
      <P>The Minister challenges the substance of this argument.  I would like him to listen to this point.  He does not accept that an employer merely filling a gap in the market is a legitimate case to prosecute a trade dispute against.  The facts are &mdash; I am sorry Deputy Bell is not here at present but he will bear this out &mdash; that we have a myriad of examples where the trade union movement accepts &mdash; this is the point I was rising on earlier to clarify &mdash; that they cannot do anything about one contractor under-cutting another in the market place but what they can do is seek to employ a convention or set of rules that if that successful contractor takes over the contract he also takes over the workers or offers to the workers the prospect of being taken over.</P>
      <P>There are so many employments in this city alone where you have the same contract, the same workers but different contractors.  There are contract cleaners, contract security people that have been providing that service to the major employment or plant for the last 15 years but the contractor for whom they are working may have changed three times in those 15 years.  It was accepted that, when he bought the contract for providing the catering service to Jacobs, he bought with it the workers in Jacobs who were providing that service.  He may well have sat down and renegotiated the terms with them or he may have asked them to work an hour longer here, an hour less there or paid them 10p an hour more here or 10p an hour less there, but he gave them the prospect of being employed.  If he did not do so the trade union movement, up to now, was free to prosecute a trade dispute to achieve that end.  They may not now do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the distinction I am drawing between what I am saying and what the Minister is saying.  It is important at least that we are <i>ad idem</i> on the facts.  I am not trying to prevent the flow of one contractor winning a contract from another in the market place; the trade <Col N="1967" /> union movement cannot do that.  I am trying to protect the workers who have very little security.  They have no permanent employment in many cases, all they have got is their trade union entitlement or their trade union ability to enforce that entitlement for them.  A great many of them will lose out as a result of this measure.</P>

      <P>There has been resort to the court and a settlement has been secured in the interim.  Only last week we had the revelation by one of the major unions involved in the <i>Irish Press</i> dispute of correspondence that came into the possession of the union that set out in great detail an elaborate plan by the new ownership of the <i>Irish Press</i> to circumvent a trade dispute and to publish the titles during the course of a trade dispute.  It is all very well for the Minister to say to me here: &ldquo;Well, workers know the situation, workers have a good instinct on this and so on and they will know who is undermining the dispute and who is frustrating it&rdquo;.  That is all very well; they may indeed know it but being able to establish it is a different matter.</P>

It would be too fantastic. Because they happen to have it in writing everybody says: &ldquo;Would you believe that they would get up to something like that.&rdquo;  I would believe it.  I have seen it happen before.  That is one of the reasons I regret the additional restrictions on secondary picketing.  If Mr. O'Reilly, for example, for his own reasons, decided that he wanted to facilitate Mr. Ingersoll in publishing the titles with some subsequent arrangement in mind, what could one&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is possible &mdash; where it is as easily discernible as that &mdash; to circumvent the new restriction here, but in a world of holding companies, associate companies, new titles and so on, there are many cases in which it would be very difficult to establish that that employer was doing anything but taking up the slack in the marketplace, that he was merely availing of the fact that he now had a whole lot of clients he did not have before; to try and establish that he was doing it for the purpose &mdash; as the section requires &mdash; of frustrating the strike would be impossible.He is not doing it for the purpose of frustrating the strike.  He is doing it for the purpose of exploiting the market and making profit out of a set of circumstances that have coincided.  One would not be able to establish that it was for the purpose of frustrating the strike which is what is required here.  That is regrettable.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 25, after &ldquo;life-preserving services&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or any necessary action by an employer in other essential services covered by regulations made by the Minister after consultation with bodies representative of employers and trade unions.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the Minister have reserved power to take action in relation to crucial services other than the life-preserving services within the health service.For example, the section as at <Col N="1972" /> present drafted, does not cover the fire brigade &mdash; because the fire brigade does not come within the ambit of the health service &mdash; but yet it can be a life-preserving service.  Likewise the section does not cover services such as electricity which could be crucial to life, to industry or in the national interest at any given time.  Of course, there are other services such as sewerage and water which are perhaps less crucial.  I am not proposing in these two amendments that we insert absolute cover for all of these areas.</P>
    <P>What we are seeking is to give the Minister power to bring in regulations to extend the exemption here to other life-preserving services, or other essential services, after he has had consultations with the trade unions and employers. Then he must get the agreement of the House in advance of making any such regulation.  This is a reasonable proposal. I welcome the provisions of the section as far as they go.  Obviously it makes sense that the health services should be exempt in so far as they are life-preserving services, and should be exempt from actions which would otherwise be deemed to frustrate a strike.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that it would be imprudent of the House to enact legislation without having at least the contingent power to extend a similar exemption to other essential services.  I realise it would be most unwise to extend this exemption too far.  I know also that it would be unwise to endeavour to enshrine in direct legislation every set of circumstances in which such exemption might be deemed to be necessary.  That is why I propose that the exemption be extended by the Minister by regulation provided he has the advance approval of the House and only after consultation with both sides of industry.</P>
    <P>Of course the section, as drafted, is the result of a balancing act following prolonged discussions between both sides of industry.  I contend that the right balance has not been achieved.  I did not intervene in the last discussion because Deputy Rabbitte had adequately covered the amendments.  There is a great danger <Col N="1973" /> that we have not reached the right balance in relation to secondary picketing either, especially in relation to contract workers, consultants or part-time workers.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage we raised extensively the question of contract workers, sometimes called consultants, people who are regarded as part-time workers, many of whom are deployed as a ruse to avoid the provisions of social legislation. This is a case in which the Minister at least can take onto himself the contingent power by way of regulation so that, in given circumstances, he can extend the exemption.  I would urge him to accept my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 11(3) was included to make it clear that any action taken by the health services to maintain life-preserving services would not be regarded as action taken to frustrate a strike.  It is most unlikely that any court would hold that such action was taken for the purposes of frustrating a strike rather than for the purpose of preserving life. That subsection is designed to put the matter beyond doubt.  I am sure Deputies would agree that the health services represent a special case and that any doubt in that regard should be removed.</P>
      <P>On the Second Stage discussion Deputy Moynihan gave a long explanation of his views on this issue and certainly posed a number of questions resulting from his long experience of what might happen if one extended that exemption. The question of disputes in essential services in general is a much broader issue, one which is not amenable to the making of regulations in the way proposed by Deputy J. Mitchell.  To even begin to arrive at any agreed definition of what constitutes an essential service would be a daunting task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have consistently taken the view that the best way to cater for the very wide range of issues which arise in the context of disputes in essential services is by means of codes of practice.  The drawing up of codes of practice to cover all aspects of such disputes, including the critical issue of adequate levels of emergency <Col N="1974" /> cover, is something to which I intend to ask the proposed new labour relations commission to give priority attention.</P>
    <P>The amendments proposed would be strongly opposed by the trade union movement as being counter-productive. What we have done in section 42 (1) under codes of practice is to provide that the commission shall prepare draft codes of practice concerning industrial relations for submission to the Minister either on their own initiative or at the request of the Minister.  What would happen, in effect is that if the commission or the Minister of the day required a code of practice on a particular area or on essential services &mdash; not all essential services but on any particular one &mdash; they could bring forward a code of practice and that would carry weight as part of the Act as it is in section 42 (1), but putting it in legislation would create great difficulties and would be opposed by the trade union movement.  Section 42 (1) goes a long way towards what Deputy Mitchell is trying to achieve.</P>

      <P>I am surprised the Minister thinks it would be opposed by the trade union movement because any regulation drafted under this could only be introduced after consultation with them.  If any opposition arose it would be at the time the regulation was proposed. It seems that the Minister is being overcautious here and he or his successors may eventually regret it.  It is not so many years since we had electricity strikes, for instance, and these can impinge on the services of hospitals.  I remember the last time we had an electricity strike there were black outs in the middle of operations.</P>

My line consistently has been to try, as far as possible, to take out of the law courts any action in relation to industrial relations, as far as it is constitutionally possible, and I am absolutely opposed to the use of injunctions in the case of picketing for that reason.</P>
      <P>That is not what is in question here. There are very few services which can be considered absolutely crucial.  Dublin Fire Brigade, for instance, must be as crucial as hospitals in the preservation of life, and yet this section does not cover fire brigades or actions taken by fire brigades as preservers of life.  It does not allow the Minister, even in consultation with the trade unions, to extend by regulation the exemptions of this section to other areas.  For instance, if there was a strike in the oil companies, would it be breaking the strike to give petrol to fire brigades, ambulances and Garda cars? It seems an absurdity that we are not prepared to take the rare opportunity we have in a period of calm for industrial relations to take even contingent powers &mdash; and contingent powers which would be exercised only in consultation with the social partners &mdash; to cover other crucial life preserving areas.</P>
      <P>I very much regret that the Minister is not prepared to take this amendment on board.  This amendment is dealing with crucial and essential services in a very restrictive way.

      <P>The principle underlying the picketing arrangements provided for in the Bill is that employees should picket at their own employer's place of business and that a trade union official should be permitted to accompany such picketing.  It is not envisaged that picketing should be permitted at the premises of an employer who is not involved in a dispute with his own employees except where secondary picketing is permissible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms of employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements are legally binding and there is an enforcement mechanism available to the general inspectorate of my Department to ensure that these are complied with. I feel this is the proper way to ensure compliance with EROs and REAs rather than through picketing.  The system is a statutory system and recently we have extended the number of officials in this area as a result of requests from the trade union movement to ensure that the <Col N="1978" /> EROs are complied with.  Using the powers already available to my Department under the Industrial Relations Act is the most satisfactory way of dealing with the problem of non-compliance where it arises.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 9, line 10, to delete &ldquo;or other industrial action&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Nobody in the House is objecting to the inclusion in the rule books of the unions of the requirement for a secret ballot in the case of a strike.  The problem is the Minister is making it a prerequisite for any form of industrial action.  My belief is that this will turn minor disputes into major ones.  It will magnify the extent of an otherwise trivial dispute and will encourage the trade union leadership and officials to turn a blind eye to unofficial actions.  Perhaps the Minister was unable to come up with more precise wording than &ldquo;or other industrial action&rdquo;.  Deputy Mitchell tried to insert &ldquo;major industrial action&rdquo;.  We are now on Report Stage and we have not improved this provision.</P>
      <P>Whereas any kind of minor, localised, trivial dispute, would normally be capable of being resolved after a five minute stoppage by a small number of the workforce, the workers are now seriously being requested to contact the headquarters of their union and set in train the procedures for a secret ballot, but that will not happen because it is not practical.  If it happens and the trade union leadership accedes to it, they will feel that as they have gone so far and gone through so many procedures, they might as well have a serious dispute.  It is more probable there will be more cases of unofficial action and the trade union leadership will turn a blind eye.  They will decide that it is simply not practical to engage the entire workforce in a minor grievance and will encourage a major dispute.  That is regrettable.  The whole purpose of the trade union movement and of official action is to get some kind of control over the direction of any grievance or dispute.  Under this legislation the official trade union movement will be left without control.  Control will devolve to the shop floor where unofficial action is invited by this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I completely agree with Deputy Rabbitte in this respect. <Col N="1980" /> This is one of the loosest provisions of the Bill and could render it unworkable.It could bring into disrepute the whole balloting requirement.  It is not reasonable that trade unions should be asked to have ballots for minor localised disputes.  On the other hand, if we delete &ldquo;or other industrial action&rdquo;, we are confining the need for ballots to premises where a picket is placed, whereas a sit-in would have as much impact as if the workers were on strike.</P>
      <P>I regret very much the Minister did not accept my amendment which proposed to insert &ldquo;other major industrial action&rdquo;. In the definition section on Committee Stage we tried to define &ldquo;other major industrial action&rdquo;.  It was made clear that the legislation does not require a ballot in the case of every localised skirmish, or maybe at 6.30 a.m. when people have sore heads after the weekend.  In this case the matter could be sorted out in half an hour with a bit of commonsense or maybe later in the morning when senior management and trade union officials arrive. I urge the Minister not to leave the provision as loose as it is because it could render industrial relations on the shop floor impossible.  We have to allow for a certain amount of discretion and tact and depend on the good sense of local managers and shop stewards.  They should be allowed a certain flexibility in sorting out disputes.  Anybody with shop steward experience will know it is madness to require a ballot for every little skirmish. I plead with the Minister to see the sense in these amendments.</P>

      <P>I simply want to put on record our inability to provide a definition of industrial action, an adequate legal definition that could be discerned in <Col N="1981" /> law and that would satisfy the Minister's advisers.  This is at the root of these series of proposed deletions.  I share the concerns of other Deputies in relation to how this might affect the Irish industrial relations scene.  The arguments and concerns have been already expressed sufficiently and I will not delay the House by repeating them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with this issue at very great length on amendment No. 3. Like the Deputies, I will not repeat all the arguments other than to say that the principle which underlies the secret ballot provisions in the Bill is that workers have an entitlement to a democratic say in any decision as to whether they should become involved in a strike or other form of industrial action.  I do not think anyone would disagree with that principle or seriously argue that secret ballots should be confined to strikes.  Other forms of industrial action can be equally seriously disruptive.  At the request of the Deputies in the House, I spent a considerable amount of time in debate with employers, trade unions, legal advisers and draftsmen in the Attorney General's office, endeavouring to find something that would distinguish between major and minor but that has not been possible.  If you go one way it may be too loose and if you go the other way it may be too tight.  There will have to be an understanding in this regard at Congress level.  The intention certainly is not that, when there are little pinches of tails, as Deputy Rabbitte colourfully described it on Second Stage, there would be a ballot.  I am sure there will be a workable solution.  I certainly intend to do what I can to get an understanding at an early date rather than just leave the matter to be argued out.  It has not been possible to come up with a definition other than this one.  I set out the reasons earlier today and I will not be repetitive.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1982" /> In page 9, lines 17 to 21, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;votes&rdquo; in line 17, down to and including &ldquo;voting;&rdquo; in line 21 and substitute &ldquo;may do so;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is an important one. Maybe it is the trade unionist in me that finds the phrasing offensive.  The Minister has required not just the major trade unionists, for whom this is custom and practice, but every union to enshrine in their rule books the obligation to have a secret ballot.  No one is quibbling with that, but he has gone further here and required the union to take all reasonable steps to ensure that everyone who wishes to ballot may do so.  He then goes on to say &ldquo;without interference from, or constraint imposed by, the union or any of its members, officials or employees...&rdquo;.The Minister has found it necessary to impose restrictions and obligations on the trade union concerned and on its members, employees and officials which I find offensive.  There is no corresponding obligation on the employer. The inference is that trade unionists may indeed manipulate or interfere with the conduct of the ballot but employers would never do that.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister and his advisers to focus on the section as a whole.  It requires the trade union to publish as soon as is practicable the number of ballot papers issued, the number of votes cast, the number of votes in favour of the proposal, the number of votes against the proposal and the number of spoilt votes.  Can it really be that the professionals advising the Minister are unaware of what goes on on the factory floor in such a situation?  It is the employer who will seek to manipulate the outcome, naturally to his own advantage. The requirement to publish the outcome means that the result will be with the employer immediately, before workers have time to leave the factory.  If the outcome is close the employer will immediately set about trying to overturn the narrow majority.  There will always be a segment of the workforce who will be more open than the rest to arguments <Col N="1983" /> insinuated by the employer to the effect that if they go too far it could have appalling consequences and so on.  In other words, the employer will use this information to manipulate the outcome. There is no corresponding restraint imposed on him.  It is to be inferred that the trade union side, employees, officials and members, will interfere.</P>
    <P>My amendment is eminently reasonable, since it would provide that the union shall take reasonable steps to ensure that every member entitled to vote in the ballot may do so.  What could be more straightforward and reasonable than that?  The obligation is clearly on the union to take all reasonable steps to provide that facility to its members.  If left as it is, it is inevitable &mdash; apart from the employer role to which I have referred &mdash; that some sore head on the union side will quibble with the outcome.  There is always a minority, on either side of the argument.  That sore head will advance the argument that somehow his right to vote was interfered with.  He will make allegations about pressure put on him and so on, throwing the whole thing open to question and putting additional pressure on the trade union.</P>
    <P>I thought the Minister might have accepted this amendment and I still plead with him to do so.  I cannot see why this is central to the legislation.  Why should doubt be cast on the integrity of the trade union, its members and employees?  They should have the full right to canvass in favour of a recommendation, to argue for it and influence the outcome of the ballot. That is the democratic way of doing things and it should not in any way be impaired.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no difficulty whatsoever.  There is nothing to prohibit a trade union official making whatever speech he likes in whatever form.  If he wants to put forward his views in an electioneering way he is quite entitled to do so.  All we are providing is that the union shall not organise, participate in, sanction or support a strike or other industrial action without a secret ballot.  It is also <Col N="1984" /> provided that members should have a reasonable time to ballot and have a say in the matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell asked earlier in this debate why we do not provide for the right of an employer to take action against decisions and against various clauses in the Bill.  I refuse to give that right to the employer.</P>
      <P>Section 14(3) provides that the rights conferred by a provision referred to in subsection (2) are conferred on the members of the trade union concerned and on no other person.  No outside person can take action against a union in breach of this legislation.  This right is conferred only on a member of that union.  One has to protect the individual member and ensure that his rights are covered in the trade union rule book. Section 14(2)(f) provides that the trade union shall take reasonable steps to make known to its members the result of the ballot.  They do not make it known to the employer.</P>

      <P>When I moved the adjournment I had been saying that on current trends it might be possible to bring our debt-GNP ratio to acceptable proportions in the foreseeable future.  Let us recall that the National Development Plan stated and I quote</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Though the evolution of debt is influenced by factors other than the <Col N="1987" /> level of borrowing, a realistic expectation would be that by the end of 1993 the national debt might be reduced to about 120 per cent of GNP from 133 per cent.</P>
    <P>However, such a success story is still relative.Ireland is still very much at the top of the international debtors league.  The fact that we are managing to stabilise the debt cannot lull us into a false sense of complacency or permit a relaxation of a very vigilant fiscal policy.  Whether we like it or not, the nation is still in hock. Technically, in any man's terms and particularly in layman's terms we are broke and if we were a private enterprise we would be insolvent and the doors of the banking institutions would be slammed permanently and very firmly in our face.  The reason we are broke is that a large slice of public funds has gone into paying for the past election promises of successive Governments, particularly for the election promises of a previous Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>While we all remember that budget deficit borrowing started in the mid-seventies, the infamous manifesto of 1977 was the launching pad for the Dutch auction-style economics.  It was amusing to hear Deputy Dick Roche preach from the high altar of fiscal rectitude and lecture the Opposition on their responsibilities but he was rightly reminded, I think by Deputy Rabbitte, that he was an adviser to the one and only Minister for Economic Planning and Development, Dr. Martin O'Donoghue the chief architect and man mainly responsible for the infamous 1977 manifesto.  Thanks be to God, that was a short-lived trend but unfortunately it has left an indelible imprint on the economic history of this country.</P>
    <P>Despite the measures that have been taken, Ireland's foreign debt profile is still not good by comparison with other countries and it has to be acknowledged that when foreign debt is adjusted per head of population Ireland emerges as one of the most indebted nations of the world.  When allowance is made for the <Col N="1988" /> fact that Irish gross national product is higher than that of most developing countries, Ireland remains among the top ten foreign debtors when compared with other nations in the developed world.</P>
    <P>Ireland is cast internationally as being developed in terms of having a good industrial market economy, but the justification of such a classification has never been made entirely clear and it seems anomalous in view of the fact that Ireland's gross national product per person is below that of developing countries such as Trinidad, Tobago, Hong Kong and Singapore.  No matter what has been achieved today, in sheer absolute terms, Ireland's foreign debt is not as some people would have us believe a mere drop in the ocean of international liquidity.  Indeed, Ireland's debt liability has attracted a fair amount of international attention, and unfavourable attention at that.  We are sandwiched in somewhere between Pakistan and Colombia.  This makes a fallacy of the traditional argument that Ireland is so small and our borrowing requirement is so limited we could raise what we like on the international capital markets.</P>
    <P>While there is no doubt that the country's ability to raise borrowings remains unimpaired, the accumulated debt of the past is still attracting a fair amount of international attention, and in some cases international criticism.  One of the biggest problems arises from the fact that despite our cutbacks and various restrictions and the general consciousness we have to maintain a continuous consistent line of economic stringency, we are still running hard to stand still.  That is the hard reality facing us in the future.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that at budget time it becomes very much an open season, and indeed a festival for special pleadings.The Government &mdash; no matter what Government are in power &mdash; are besieged by demands and petitions from all sides from various pressure groups and interest groups representing a wide range of interests in the community, each of whom is meritorious in their own right and each having a particular significance in terms of how people see their own <Col N="1989" /> priorities.  The purpose behind their representations is an attempt to win a tax concession here, a grant there or a spending increase in some area.  While the interests are diverse and many and are often hostile to each other, they have one unifying characteristic and that is such of the demands, if met, will inevitably lead to a deterioration of the Government's financial position.  Each interest group are necessarily concerned about the impact of the budget on their group but not on the economy as a whole.  It is interesting that on budget night each group see the budget in terms of their own perspective or through their own tinted glasses.  Each group assess the exercise in terms of the effects on their members.  If the Minister for Finance accedes to their demands it is regarded as a good budget but if the Minister does not accede to their demands it is regarded as a bad budget, the budget of a hardhearted Minister who is impervious to the criticisms of logical arguments being put forward.  If the Minister accedes to their requests he is regarded as a man of wisdom, a most far seeing individual who is sensitive to the needs of a group who have an argument which makes a great deal of sense.</P>
    <P>The problem is that everybody sees the budget in terms of their set of needs. Very often we see things through our own blinkered perspective and if the Minister does not accede to our demands, then invariably we accuse him, rightly or wrongly, of leading our group and the country as a whole to their eventual perdition.If the Government placate the various interest groups by spending money which they do not have or by foregoing revenue they would otherwise have raised, they will be accorded due praise by each group but if, on the other hand, they frustrate the demands of such groups and set about correcting the financial position then condemnation, fire and brimstone will be the order of the day.  The essential function of Government is to defend the interests of the community as a whole and to frustrate, if necessary, the demands of sectional groups.  The Government have to <Col N="1990" /> look at the community's future as a whole when fashioning their policies.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the country is not poor, it is just broke.  This distinction between being poor on the one hand and being broke on the other was, I think, first formulated by the economist, Colm McCarthy.  It is an important distinction in that it points to the genesis of the economy's difficulties.  A household can be quite rich in terms of the income it commands, but if it overspends by aspiring to living standards it cannot finance or afford, then it will soon become broke.  Therefore, it is possible for a household to be relatively rich and broke simultaneously.</P>
    <P>This essentially is what has happened to the Irish economy over the past 15 years or so.  We are relatively rich as a country but we have become broke attempting to keep up with our neighbours, the Jones's in Britian.  The amount of income created by producing goods and services was insufficient to cover our expenditure and to make up the difference the country had to borrow on a massive scale.  High interest rates on the accummulated borrowing added still further to the country's bills.  As a result of the continuing attempts to artificially keep our living standards to an unsustainable high level, our national debt now stands at £25 billion.  We are broke because we overspent in the past and the interest payments on those debts are now so large that, even when the Government are trying to economise on current spending to finance the profligacy of the past, they are strangled by the burden of past borrowing.  In the past the drive to overspend was powered by demands from the interest and pressure groups which were alluded to in the debate two weeks ago and again today.</P>
    <P>The figures which emerged yesterday are disquieting on the one hand and encouraging on the other.  While Government borrowing, despite the sluggish first three months of the year in terms of revenue, is being brought within controllable levels, one has only to look at the whole situation, to see that we are borrowing way beyond our means.  For <Col N="1991" /> the first half of the year Government borrowing was £507 million, somewhat ahead of market expectations but below last year's level.  The Minister for Finance has said this is satisfactory, that budget targets are being met and that the pickup in terms of revenue from taxation, etc. will become more visible and obvious as we move into the third and final quarters of the year.  However, one has to temper this expectation with the realisation that the tax concessions which were given in the budget will begin to impinge more from this time onwards.</P>
    <P>The Government's finances are in a reasonable shape at present but I wonder whether they will manage to maintain the degree of progress which has been achieved in the relatively recent past as the effects of 1992 begin to impinge and the demands and erosion of tax harmonisation begin to take place.  We seem to be fair set for meeting short-term targets but at the same time we are running relatively hard just to keep steady.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, one must have anxieties, our economic achievements have been the result of the good advice which has been handed out by the officials in the Department of Finance and thankfully taken on board by the Minister for Finance.One wonders if it is absolutely necessary, given the relatively recent recovery in economic terms of the public finances, for the Minister to still push ahead, irrespective of the reservations which have been expressed by Members from all sides of the House about setting up a debt control agency.  Is there a need for such an elite corps?  Does the Minister not acknowledge that the economic achievements have been largely brought about as a result of the solid advice given by his Department?  One can understand the reluctance on the part of the officials in the Department of Finance to see their power eroded by a new elite corps &mdash; who will undoubtedly do the same work they have been doing and are doing today &mdash; who will get salaries above the norm and who will apply for the posts within the Department which have been held by <Col N="1992" /> the officials who have been giving good advice to the Minister over the years.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House do not see a need for such a elite corps.  If there was a deterioration or slippage in economic performance there might be a need for such a grouping, but in the light of recent experience where things have been improving, thanks to the good advice meted out by the officials of the Department, we cannot concur with the Minister's dogged insistence to put in place a new super-structure to manage the national debt.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh aidhm an Bhille seo, which is further to restrict the national debt, but we, on this side of the House, do not believe we need a new elite grouping to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the aims and objectives of the Bill but I question whether it is really necessary.  I am extremely concerned at the inferences which may be drawn from its introduction.What are the civil servants, particularly those in the Department of Finance, thinking about these days?  Do they think they are being accused of having failed to manage the debt or that they are inadequate?  That is the type of message they will get from the introduction of this Bill.</P>

      <P>It is a convention of this House that we do not reflect on officials; the Minister is responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not referring to the role of the civil servants; I was simply referring to how they might be feeling at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the introduction of this Bill will further damage morale in the Civil Service, something we can ill afford at this time and this view is shared by many other people.  The level of morale in the Civil Service is not good at present and some Departments find it very difficult to deal with their day to day business because their staff numbers are inadequate.  The Department of Agriculture and Food have gone through a very difficult period since last autumn.  It <Col N="1993" /> is surprising the Minister for Agriculture and Food has not taken any action to assist them and put things right.</P>
    <P>In the course of his introductory remarks the Minister for Finance said the private sector was encouraging the best people from his Department.  I have no doubt the reason is that the private sector is able to reward effort better than the Minister.  The private sector has always been able to counter the heavy taxation here by making payments to employees which are not subject to taxation or offering incentives of one kind or another. The problems that have encouraged the Minister to introduce the Bill will not go away when the Bill passes through both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>During the course of the debate last week Government backbenchers discussed who was responsible for our huge national debt.  Many of them levelled the blame for that debt squarely on this side of the House.  They maintained that the Coalition Government of 1983-87, led by Dr. FitzGerald, were responsible for the debt.  Because of that it is important to set the record straight.  The figures show that the national debt in that period doubled but the figures also show that the debt increased by 300 per cent in the period of the Fianna Fáil Government who took office in 1977.  One Government Deputy accused the Coalition Government led by Dr. FitzGerald of being Thatcherite in their approach.  He used words like &ldquo;monetarist&rdquo; to describe the approach of that Government.  It was obvious he got carried away by the propaganda of the time.  He was unable to see the illogical connection between the increase in the national debt and the description of the Government as Thatcherite or monetarist.</P>
    <P>The rate of increase in the national debt during the terms of office of the Coalition Government under Dr. FitzGerald slowed down.  Obviously, the borrowing requirement of a Government is built into the economy and that was the case when Dr. FitzGerald took over in 1983.  One of the reasons for the huge borrowing requirement was the need to pay the 30,000 civil servants taken on in <Col N="1994" /> the previous four years by Fianna Fáil, particularly between 1978 and 1979.  That was one of the problems with which the FitzGerald Government had to deal.</P>
    <P>Many of us can recall the huge pay rises awarded in the 1980-81 period, particularly leading up to the election in 1981.  I was a teacher at that time and I recall the findings of the independent commission on the salaries of teachers. The commission recommended an increase of between 12 and 13 per cent. When the findings of the commission were presented to the unions representing the teachers they rejected them but did not create a great furore.  The response of the Government was remarkable.They went against the findings of the independent commission and made their own award which was almost double that recommended by the commission. In some cases the award was doubled. That was an amazing decision and it was similar to many decisions of that Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>At that time inflation was out of control.Indeed, it was so bad that the Estimates presented by the Government for the running of the affairs of the State were adequate for six months only.  They were known as the infamous Estimates. Inflation was running at such a high level it was impossible to project what might happen the next week, let alone in the next year.  The business sector during 1980-81 told us it was impossible to plan for more than one week ahead.  Those who purchased products that might lie in stock for more than a week experienced great difficulty in trying to put a price on them particularly if they had to be replaced.  The manufacturing sector was in chaos.  Forward planning was impossible and stocks were allowed run down because the money received for the sale of products was inadequate to replace them.  Government planning in 1981 was askew.</P>
    <P>When the Coalition took over they were forced to introduce a mini budget and to set about, in the face of opposition in the House and outside, trying to reduce inflation and the rate of increase in the national debt.  The rate of inflation was <Col N="1995" /> reduced dramatically in the following four years and when the election was called in 1987 the rate of inflation was close to 4 per cent.  The Coalition Government managed to reduce the rate of increase in the national debt, something that Governments since have managed to do.  No Government have managed to eliminate the national debt but it has been reduced.  The Coalition Government dragged the semi-State sector back to solvency.  Prior to that semi-State bodies were in serious financial trouble.  I accept that their difficulties were tied in with the inflationary problems.</P>
    <P>The Coalition Government led by Dr. FitzGerald made those advances against the most vicious opposition imaginable. The opposition in the House, and outside, was vicious.  It was easy to understand how people outside the House felt because the seventies had been a period of growth and stability and people had become accustomed to big pay rises and a fairly high standard of living.  Dr. FitzGerald, and his colleagues, had to tell the people that their expectations would have to drop.  His Government were brave in adopting that stance but the people, naturally, said they would not accept the Government's proposals. What was totally inexcusable was that the Opposition of the day joined with the outside pressure groups &mdash; in some cases they incited them &mdash; against the Government.That was an awful period in Irish history.  The contradictions were unbelievable; day after day in the newspapers there were front page reports of cuts in various services.  At the time the Opposition Party decried the cuts and said there was no need for them, and this continued throughout the period of that Government.</P>
    <P>It was shameful that the Fianna Fáil Party tried to prevent progress during that period and since then they have been tarring the Government to try to achieve power.  Thankfully, it is not working very well as their Thatcherist and monetarist policies at that time still echo in <Col N="1996" /> people's minds.  To say that the Government made no effort to tackle the great national problem of the day is ludicrous and anyone who checks the Official Report or the newspapers at the time will have no difficulty in seeing what the Government were trying to do and what they achieved.</P>
    <P>It is amazing that the party who originally sent the debt spiralling out of control should have been intent on obstructing at every turn the necessary readjustments which the Government had to take.  During the 1987 election campaign, I was canvassing in my constituency and many people showed me a letter claiming that our party were out of touch with reality.  A few days later, I received a copy of the same letter and as far as I could ascertain, everybody on the electoral register also received a copy.  It was from the leader of the Opposition of the day &mdash; who is now the Taoiseach &mdash; and said that there was no need for cuts in health, education and social welfare.  It said that we should not dismantle what had taken generations to build, referring, of course, to services which the Government supply to the public.</P>
    <P>During that election campaign we saw the posters displayed all over the country proclaiming that health cuts hurt the old, the sick and the handicapped, which is true.  However, when the election was over the new minority Government assessed the situation and decided that there was a need for cuts in health, education and social welfare.  They said it was necessary to make all sorts of other cuts in every possible aspect of Government business.  They wondered how they would do this, particularly as they were a minority Government.</P>
    <P>The public assumed that a minority Government could not get legislation through the Dáil to make the necessary cuts, that they were handcuffed.  Everybody knew they could not achieve any of their aims or objectives because, historically, the public knew that Fianna Fáil could not behave in any other way except the way they behaved between 1983 and 1987.  There was a problem for the Fianna <Col N="1997" /> Fáil minority Government and for the country.  As we are aware, the problem was solved because Deputy Dukes, his Front Bench and the Fine Gael Party decided it was right and necessary that the policies they had pursued up to 1987 should continue.  They decided &mdash; whether it was politically right or wrong &mdash; to support the Government.  At the time it was acclaimed as something new; the Minister for Finance stands up in this House proudly proclaiming that he has achieved this, that and the other but you will never hear him allude to the fact that he could not have done it without the support of Deputy Dukes and the Opposition parties who supported that strategy. However, it is nice to hear certain commentators alluding to the fact that the Fine Gael Party had a hand in what happened after 1987 and that, without their support, the Government would not have been able to do anything.  It is good to know that some members of the public are also aware of this.</P>
    <P>It is heartening to realise that the electorate have not been gulled by the tactics during the period from 1983 to 1987 and that they have taken note of the &ldquo;turncoatism&rdquo; of the Fianna Fáil Party in the period 1977 to 1987.  It is also heartening that the electorate have used their good judgment when called upon to elect new Members to the House and to note that they are not willing to give Fianna Fáil power without ensuring that it is controlled.I hope that will be the case in the future because in the past ten or 12 years what I referred to as &ldquo;turncoatism&rdquo; has been accepted as a kind of Fianna Fáil ideology.  For much of that period truth was replaced by expediency.  They paid the price because the Taoiseach is still waiting for an overall majority. However, people with long memories will ensure that the overall majority he seeks will not be made available to him in the near future and he might think twice about going to the country.</P>
    <P>The net effect of the Fine Gael action in 1987 was that the rate of increase in the national debt continued to decrease, and at this time we can look to the future with some confidence.  We do not have <Col N="1998" /> the problem under control; I think there is agreement on all sides about that.  The cost of servicing the debt is enormous and the debt is still increasing.  However, the news in the last few years has been generally good for the economy and we are all happy about that.</P>
    <P>With regard to the details of this National Treasury Management Agency Bill, as well as setting up a chief executive with a staff of five or six to manage the national debt, it is also proposed to set up an advisory committee.  As I said, I wonder if any of this is necessary.  The Minister might be better off looking at the Civil Service and the way civil servants are paid and organised and not go rushing into this business which is most definitely going to set up a new hierarchy and create unrest in the Civil Service.  I cannot see how the members of the service who have been dealing with the national treasury to date, or who have ambition to deal with it in future, are going to be happy in these circumstances. I assume they can apply for the positions which will be on offer, but those who will not get one of the limited number of positions will be dissatisfied with their conditions of work.  My estimation is that this is a waste of time; worse, it will create problems down the road for the Minister.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Minister is setting up an advisory committee.  He is putting in place a chief executive who will be qualified in the area of high finance and he is going to recruit some very good staff highly qualified in that field.  No doubt the Minister has advisers who are capable and well qualified to advise him and discuss with the civil servants all necessary aspects of national treasury management, yet he is going to set up a new advisory committee with a chairman and certain number of members.  Surely it is not necessary to do that.  I wonder if he has decided that a few of his pals need to be paid off in one way or another.  I hope that is not the case, but history would suggest it probably is.  Therefore, while it is necessary to manage the national debt properly and in the best possible way, this in not the way to go about it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1999" /> Occasionally I table questions to the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the economy in general and the fact that the Irish economy is very competitive compared to our nearest neighbour.My research in that area indicates that we are about 19 per cent out of line, before tax, with regard to prices.  I have made a few attempts in the House to bring this to the attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and he always tells me he has no control over that at the moment because the prices commission are no longer in existence.This means I have no opportunity to discuss with him why this is the case and what remedial action he might take to reduce that 19 per cent difference as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>There are people in the Government who will say, &ldquo;You are wrong, that is not the case.  Our prices are quite competitive.The work we have done since 1987 will ensure that&rdquo;, but it is very easy to contradict that.  The EC made a decision recently with regard to the 48 hour rule.  The Government decided in the interest of the Irish economy that there was no way they were going to allow people to move freely between the Republic and Northern Ireland for shopping purposes because that would result in a huge outflow of money from this economy.  The Government still believe that, yet we cannot get a proper opportunity in this House to come to grips with that problem and try to get some view on how it might be combated.  This is a particularly sensitive matter for me as a Deputy from a Border constituency.  The 48 hour rule achieved a certain amount for the economy as a whole and prevented large amounts of money from flowing across the Border, but I am afraid, because it was not a success in the Border counties, the towns along the Border are still whimpering.  They are tired of this, and are not making as much noise as they used to but they are still in a very difficult position.  If you mention that matter to the Government they will say there have been massive improvements since 1987.  If there have been and if the <Col N="2000" /> improvements were adequate, why do they want to keep the 48 hour rule or replace it by some other rule which will have the same restrictive effect?</P>
    <P>These are things the Minister for Finance should be looking at.  He should try to make life easier for his Department and to release some of his staff from certain duties to deal with the national treasury instead of wasting time putting this Bill in front of us.  He should be talking to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the two of them should try to work out for this House how they are going to prepare the Irish economy for 1992 and how they are going to prevent further damage being done to my constituency and to other Border constituencies.Many of us would be more satisfied if they would do that rather than trying to obstruct us when we ask a question, dodging and being ambivalent, telling one story to the people living on the Border areas and another story to everybody else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Government have decided to establish a national debt management agency.  I suppose it is ironic that as politicians we have to establish an agency to manage the national debt.  Whether we wish to believe it or not, the general public and the politicians have been responsible &mdash; and irresponsible &mdash; in regard to the many interest and lobby groups over the years who have brought about our enormous national debt.  This has developed the core thinking of the civil servants in seeking to establish a mechanism that will control to a great extent the savings that can be made in the proper management of our national debt.  The Minister outlined in his Second Stage speech that he anticipated a substantial saving of £35 million this year because of the proper management of our debt.  I hope the Minister will achieve that target and greater savings in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the opportunity to refute some of the suggestions made by a number of speakers, particularly my good friend Deputy Dick Roche.  Deputy Roche has a very fertile imagination in relation to <Col N="2001" /> the facts of economic life.  His attitude is nauseating.  I regret to have to say that, because he played a substantial role as economic adviser to the Fianna Fáil Party when they developed and published their infamous 1977 manifesto.  Deputy Roche must share some of the responsibility for debt mismanagement because of his reckless proposals for economic overdrive in the late seventies under the stewardship of his then mentor Martin O'Donoghue. Ironically, members of the same Cabinet at the time included Deputies O'Malley and Molloy who have developed a whiter than white brand of pure economic ideology since then.  These modern great patriots stood idly by at that time and contributed to the greatest borrowing and spending spree in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>Controlling the national debt is crucial to the financial targets of Government in view of the fact that it takes £2 billion annually to service the debt.  The media in recent times have attempted to rewrite the economic history of the eighties in a thwarted way.  Various articles seem to imply that all economic recovery started in February 1987.  I want the House to consider some pertinent facts. Indeed, Deputy Roche has been a very wily contributor to this economic history debate in recent times.</P>
    <P>Low inflation is the cornerstone of economic health.  It is worth pondering on the fact that it was the Fine Gael-Labour Government who brought inflation down to 3 per cent in 1986 from the 21 per cent they inherited from Fianna Fáil in December 1982 and it has remained low ever since.  The trade balance had reached a record deficit of £1.8 million in 1981 following the four years of Fianna Fáil Government and it was brought to a surplus of £315 million by Fine Gael-Labour in 1985 &mdash; the first trade surplus in 40 years.  We have had a trade surplus every year since then and the surplus is increasing.</P>
    <P>The balance of payments went into surplus in 1986 for the first time in decades and there has been a surplus ever since.  The top rate of income tax was brought from 68 per cent. to 65 per cent. and is still too high at 52 per cent. <Col N="2002" /> Fine Gael-Labour brought the top rate of VAT from 35 per cent. to 25 per cent. in spite of the fact that the Government incurred an Exchequer borrowing requirement of 16.3 per cent. of GNP in 1981.  This was brought down to just under 10 per cent. in 1987.  These are major economic indicators in relation to the type of progress that was made between 1983 and 1987.  That is worth putting on the record for further students of economic history.</P>
    <P>A major ingredient of economic and financial solvency relates to the semi-State sector.  Much of the borrowing requirement of the State was partially or totally hidden by the enormous borrowing of the semi-State sector.  Companies such as An Post, Telecom Éireann, Aer Rianta, the Sugar Company and even RTE were running up enormous deficits.  A circular in 1983 issued by the Government brought discipline and good business sense to State investment while clearly setting out the criteria required to justify State investment.This move played a significant part in reducing the borrowing requirement of the semi-State sector.  I compliment Deputy Mitchell who was Minister at that time in charge of semi-State bodies.  He contributed enormously to bringing semi-State bodies to a state of financial surplus, reducing their borrowing requirements, and thus reducing the overall borrowing requirement of the State.</P>
    <P>A lot of money was spent at that time in managing the housing waiting lists which are increasing again because of Government inaction in introducing enlightened policies in housing.  Local authority housing was provided for people in the greatest need through direct capital expenditure by the Department of the Environment, in giving money to local authorities to build houses and by various incentives such as home improvement grants and the £5,000 grant for people to vacate houses thus making them available for people in greatest need.  These measures saved tens of millions of pounds per year while serving a very important social need in housing.</P>
    <P>It does not give joy to any politician <Col N="2003" /> to tell the general public that we must continue to pay high taxation and disincentive to work built into our system because we have a huge national debt. It will take years for this management agency to bring about the necessary savings and reductions in the national debt so as to bring any meaningful reductions in personal taxation.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald had several major economic achievements during his time in Government.  He strove manfully to lay the foundations of economic recovery.All this was achieved against a continued background of reckless opposition by Fianna Fáil who told us we were monetarists, Thatcherites and book-keepers and that the expenditure plans of the day were too restrictive.  On the night of the 1977 election, Deputy Garrett FitzGerald laid down plans for public expenditure control to be accepted as a precondition for Fine Gael support of the incoming minority Fianna Fáil Government.Deputy Alan Dukes, as the successor to Deputy FitzGerald as Leader of Fine Gael, took the extraordinarily brave step of enunicating the Tallaght strategy which guaranteed political stability so long as correct economic control was pursued by the Government.  Would the present Leader of the Government have taken such an initiative if the shoe had been on the other foot?</P>

      <P>I have indicated to the other side of the House as well that walking down memory lane is quite in order as long as we do not appear to be wearing out the cobblestones unnecessarily.  Could we address ourselves to the legislation before the House?</P>

      <P>In talking about the way in which the national debt is being managed it is important that we take a trip down memory lane to highlight what happened in the past and ensure we do not see a repeat in the future.  I asked a very pertinent question and I know you will be very interested in my rhetorical answer <Col N="2004" /> to it.  It would have been very easy for Deputy Dukes to have stuck to old style Opposition politics, opposition for the sake of opposition but he spurned the opportunity in favour of doing what was right for the country.  Even the dogs in the street knew that the country was in a financial mess and that there would have to be bold expenditure cuts and harsh decisions if the country was to be put back on the road to economic recovery and if workers' personal taxation was to be reduced.  I am proud to be a member of a party who have always put the country first.</P>
      <P>The political and State systems have contributed to this huge problem.  It now appears that the State deems it necessary to go outside the political system and the Civil Service to find people with new ideas in undertaking this major task. In 1977, the national debt stood at £3.6 billion.  Shortly after this, the incoming Taoiseach, former Deputy Jack Lynch, thanked the Coalition Government under the leadership of Mr. Liam Cosgrave for handing the economy over to him in good shape.  I have been prompted to go down memory lane by what I have heard from the Government benches. Various speakers from that side of the House chose to ignore the fact that they acted irresponsibly during the period 1982 to 1987.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned some of the notable achievements and suggestions made at that time which have led to the proposal that we establish a National Treasury Management Agency.  At the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis in 1986 Deputy Ray Burke, now Minister for Justice and Communications, said that Fianna Fáil would increase expenditure under the Public Capital Programme by <Col N="2005" /> £200 million.  He also stated that Fianna Fáil would reduce the rate of VAT to five per cent for the construction industry, at a cost of £54 million in a full year.  Not to be outdone, the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on agriculture, Deputy Michael Noonan, stated at the same Ard-Fheis that he would be prepared to spend £190 million, made up of £50 million in extra headage payments and £140 million in VAT refunds.  This is the man who said the super-levy agreement negotiated by Deputy Deasy when Minister for Agriculture was the worst treaty ever signed since the Treaty of 1922.  That says much for his credibility as a politician.</P>

      <P>On 10 October, at the same Ard-Fheis in Cork, the present Taoiseach got a rush of blood to the head and announced that he would abolish DIRT which in 1986 yielded £80 million. In 1987, £60 million had to be refunded. He also stated at that time that the would be prepared to put two-thirds of income tax payers on the standard rate of tax, which was then 35 per cent, at a cost of £64 million in a full year.  It was proposed in April, 1986 that we establish the <Col N="2006" /> nucleus of an Irish merchant fleet at a cost of approximately £25 million to £30 million.  Unfortunately, those people, whom the Minister of State knows well, still have to march up and down Kildare Street to try to get the Government meet their promise of April 1986.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister of State will not mind if I say he was one of those who promised that the position would be very different under a new Government.  The resolution of the teachers' dispute will probably go down in folklore.  The sum of £75 million as announced by their spokesperson on education, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, now Minister for Education, has still not been paid and will never be paid.  That is yet another example of the way in which the Government when in Opposition sought to indicate to interest groups that whenever they found themselves in need of help Fianna Fáil would try to assist them regardless of cost and the damage it might do to the country.</P>
      <P>It would have cost £200 million to pay off the debts of Verolme Dockyard, Irish Shipping and Clover Meats, all of which have collapsed and £90 million to have no agricultural land tax, to abolish water rates about which we will hear more in the very near future and provide greater resources to eradicate bovine tuberculosis.I could go on until 6.25 p.m. outlining more of the promises made but this will give the House some indication of the reckless policies pursued at that time. I am ashamed as a politician that we have to resort to a debt management agency to rectify some of these past mistakes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that the facts are on the record I hope future generations will not have to suffer the consequences of the appalling mistakes made in the past and pay high taxes so that the national debt can be serviced.  It is important that this agency be successful.  Will it be an autonomous body or merely another advisory body to the Government who will either accept or reject their recommendations? <Col N="2007" /> The fact that the Government have to resort to an agency such as this is an indication of their inability to manage the national debt and clearly indicates that there is malaise and unease in the Civil Service.  It is also clear that reforms are needed in the public service.</P>
    <P>I hope the agency will be successful. We will be keeping a very close eye on it to ensure it is fulfilling the functions delegated to it under the legislation.  I would have thought, however, that in managing the national debt the Government would not have to call on anyone other than the financial wizards, held in high esteem in the financial world, advising them since 1987.  It seems that the proposal to establish yet another agency represents a vote of no confidence in their ability to do the job properly, or at the end of the day will they be calling the shots?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a brief contribution to this Bill.  When it was announced in the Budget Statement that a debt management agency was to be established there was a perception among the public that this represented some magical solution to our appalling national debt, that we would get out of our debt and the interest due on it by using some new formula similar to those applied to Third World countries.  We now know that is not the reality.  Up to now most of the debate on this Bill has been about civil servants and the need to create a special agency to reward those of special talent and skill, many of whom were poached away in the past to the private sector from that sector of the Department of Finance which needs people of special talent, insight and ability to deal with our financial problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate has also been about who created the debt in the first place.  We have heard a barrage of accusations and counter-accusations backwards and forwards across the floor.  We know borrowing began in the seventies, that in 1976 the current budget deficit had reached 4.4 per cent. of GNP but no one could at that time have visualised the monster that <Col N="2008" /> national debt could become.  It seems there was a blissful ignorance of the effects of the debt crisis, such as we saw in the years following and such as we have endured since.  Those of us who are in politics know at first hand the hardships of the past 15 years, the distress of seeing poverty take hold in every sector, after the comparative prosperity of the seventies, as unemployment increased, as businesses closed down but, further, we saw emigration soar and the inability of us in politics and outside, to acquire the funds to develop and invest in essential services needed to meet the needs of an economy in the eighties.</P>
    <P>No matter how we take a party view of the era, the Fianna Fáil Government of 1977-81 consolidated our problems with the crazy rates of motor tax commitments in the election of 1977 and their mismanagement after that election.  That Fianna Fáil Government trebled the national debt.  When Deputy Garret FitzGerald took office as Taoiseach he found a disastrous economic state: inflation was sky high at approximately 18 per cent. and bank interest rates were high.  He fought a valiant battle in his time to reduce inflation and bring this country back to competitiveness.  Compare what happened in Opposition at that time. Every reasonable proposal was opposed not only in the economy, which was serious, but also on other equally important matters, for example, the AngloIrish Agreement and the Single European Act.  No one opposite should try to deny their role in this House in the years 1977 to 1987.  Their motivation was entirely party-centred.  The view was: how could they be popular; how could they take action that would create a better climate at election time &mdash; not the public interest &mdash; no matter how grimly the opposite was pointed out to them. Let them not, therefore, whitewash those years because history will tell the true story.</P>
    <P>The honourable course pursued by Deputy Dukes in recent Opposition years, inherited from Deputy Garret FitzGerald, is in stark contrast to the Fianna Fáil ethos.  Our economy today <Col N="2009" /> and the hope and signs for the future are a result, in the main, of the public interest demonstrated by this party.  However, all of that is in the past &mdash; mistakes from which I hope we have learned on all sides. I give credit to my party and to our role over those years but I also give credit to the party opposite for by and large, keeping on a course that was set in previous years.  There have been positive results in those years.  People who previously understood only basic economics and probably kept an eye only on their tax and on their annual increase, at the beginning of the eighties became familiar with macro-economics and took a keen interest in what exactly was happening because of our huge debt and our massive repayments of interest.  Figures quoted are that £2,000 per year is paid by those working to meet the interest repayments and that the debt represents £23,000 per head of those working in Ireland.</P>
    <P>If this agency was a genuine attempt to regulate our borrowing and debt management to ensure that it is paid off sufficiently and as easily as possible I would welcome it and say: well done, so too would every parent.  Above all the scandal of our time is emigration which is running at 46,000 per annum.  Most of these are beautiful young Irish men and women.  Those of us who have young adults in our family are very familiar with what is happening to those young adults and their friends.  Emigration is affecting every community in the country.  Unhappy emigrants go away and unhappy parents, friends, grandparents, neighbours, grieve for them. Most say they will come back, that Ireland is the best place in the world to live but in their hearts they know it is unlikely because at present and according to indications this country is a wilderness, a desert for young job seekers.  All the incentives and perks abroad can never compensate for being in your own land, among your own relatives, building your children's future.  In no other developed country, of which I am aware has there been such a haemorrhage of young people nor has there been the level of dire poverty, which is so apparent even <Col N="2010" /> when walking in our city centre, let alone in those communities far removed from the centre.  There are many people who believe that poverty is something that one does not tackle as a social problem and that poverty will always be with us.</P>
    <P>None of us in politics can be proud of the Ireland we have governed or that we have in part created.  We did not have the vision in the past nor the political co-operation, nor the courage as a political unit to attack our problems in a realistic way.</P>
    <P>In passing I would refer to the debates, or the débâcles, of the past two weeks in the context of the lack of co-operation and ability to concentrate all our resources on the fundamental problems.It is very depressing.  Many people have said to me in the last two weeks: &ldquo;I do not know what is happening in there. Why are you wasting time, why are you arguing, why are you nit picking on issues?  Do you not know the very grave problems that are the reality of life, the day-to-day business, for people out here? We do not really care what you are fighting over, because, unfortunately, in the context of unemployment and emigration what happens there is becoming more and more irrelevant&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The nature of parliamentary action and even political successes is about party strokes, it is about opposing and taking party advantage but it is a very poor vehicle for co-operation to deal with the very real problems which will not go away and which look to this Chamber for a solution.</P>
    <P>I would like to think that we are on course to develop those areas of life in Ireland which can create jobs and can enable our young people to stay at home and those who wish to come back.  I speak specifically of developments in agriculture, tourism and manufacturing.  In tourism do we realise that in many instances we are doing the right things. When I was in Montreal a couple of weeks ago I listened in to a late night radio show and I heard a phone-in to a travel writer, Steve Burbaum, who has written a book about Ireland in the nineties.The number of phone calls that came <Col N="2011" /> in from all over the States about his book on Ireland amazed me.  Every third call was from an American who had been here and was waxing lyrical about Doyle's Seafood Restaurant or about our different golf courses.  I wondered whether we are developing our tourism industry as much as we could in order to create jobs and build for the future.</P>
    <P>I would hope that in the long run this agency would be a positive one not merely in the context of the sentiments expressed about civil servants and the facility it will offer for their retention, but for paying them appropriately so that they will not be poached.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a sincere word of thanks to all Members for their contributions to this debate.  Many of the questions raised will be dealt with in detail on Committee Stage.  I might start by dealing with the order in which the points were raised.  Deputy Noonan made some points about the organisational structure of the agency.  He noted that we are not using the classical semi-State structure complete with board of directors.That is correct; we are not using that structure.  The management of the national debt is too central a function of the Minister for Finance to be transferred outside the Minister's immediate sphere of operations.  That is why the chief executive must report directly to the Minister.The organisational format we have devised is based on very detailed consideration of the issues involved and reflects a balance between the need for ministerial control and a degree of operational flexibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>General policy responsibility for the national debt must remain with the Minister.The Deputy asked would there be a group of people in the Department of Finance duplicating the agency's work. The answer is no.  The reorganisation of the Department following the agency's establishment will be a matter for me as Minister but the intention is not to have any parallel operation.  That would be <Col N="2012" /> wasteful and probably counterproductive.What will happen, however, will reflect the fact that overall policy in relation to the national debt will remain with me as Minister.  The officers in the Department who will have the role of advising me as Minister on this will, of course, interact with the agency.  The necessary lines of communication, formal or otherwise, will be laid down to ensure the kind of close relationship which will provide good flows of information as well as operational freedom.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan suggested there would be unusual freedom in regard to pay, conditions and numbers employed in the agency.  The total size of expenses of the agency will be decided by the Minister. It is only within that figure that the agency can determine pay and numbers.  The pay of the chief executive is also decided by the Minister.</P>
    <P>As to the basis of the £35 million saving, several leading international banks have been consulted as to the feasibility of savings as a result of an active debt management policy which the agency will be required to pursue.  The £35 million figure is well within the range of what is considered feasible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan asked about the Acts in the Schedule.  The Acts referred to in the Schedule can be dealt with on Committee Stage, but the key functions are at (g) of the Schedule.  The remaining references are, in the main, relevant to statutory authority for post office savings certificates and other similar small savings instruments.  A summary of the legislation is as follows&mdash; First Schedule: (a) Section 19, Finance Act, 1930, provides for appropriation by the Minister for Finance for general Exchequer purposes of whole or part of excess interest accruing on the Post Office Savings Bank Fund; (b) section 30 (4).  Finance Act, 1940, grants the Minister for Finance power to make rules in relation to the issue of savings certificates; (c) section 22 &mdash; as amended by the Finance Act, 1989 &mdash; and section 23 of the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1956, grants the Minister for Finance authority to create and issue prize bonds and set such <Col N="2013" /> terms and conditions as he thinks fit; (d) section 4, Appropriation Act, 1965, authorises the Minister for Finance to borrow in a currency other than the currency of the State; (e) sections 464 and 466 (1) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, allow for exemption from taxation of securities issued by the Minister for Finance; (f) section 9 (1) of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1968, grants the Minister authority to prescribe by regulation the rate of interest on deposits; (g) section 54 of the Finance Act, 1970, provides for the creation and issuance of securities by the Minister for Finance, bearing interest at such rate as he thinks fit and subject to such other conditions as he thinks fit; section 118 of the Finance Act, 1983, grants the Minister for Finance authority to engage in such transactions of a normal banking nature as he considers appropriate for the purposes of the better management of the debt; section 49 of the Finance Act, 1978, provides for the repurchase from the Post Office Savings Bank Fund and cancellation of securities created and issued by the Minister; section 6 of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1970, allows for the charge on the Central Fund of expenses incurred by the Minister in relation to borrowing; section 68 of the Finance Act, 1988, authorises the Minister to do such things and take such steps as he considers necessary or expedient for the purposes of the better management of the debt; (h) sections 103, 104 and 109 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, relate to regulations governing the control and operation of the Post Office Savings Bank; (i) section 119 of the Finance Act, 1983, grants the Minister for Finance authority to cause to be paid out of the Central Fund during any year any deficit between interest accrued by the Post Office Savings Bank Fund and interest paid to depositors and any other expenses incurred; (j) section 32 of the Trustee Savings Bank Act, 1989, grants the Minister for Finance power to make regulations in relation to payments into and withdrawals from a special account by the trustees of a Trustee Savings Bank and to decide, after consultation with the Central Bank, the <Col N="2014" /> interest rate paid on Trustee Savings Bank deposits; (k) section 67 (8) of the Finance Act, 1988, provides for application of payments received into the capital services redemption account towards defraying the interest and expenses arising on the public debt; and (l) section 134 of the Finance Act, 1990, grants the Minister for Finance authority to make offers of conversion of existing Government loans into other existing Government loans or new loans.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor says it is hazardous to try to forecast interest and exchange rates.  This is true, but the savings come about not by speculation, as he suggested, but by adopting a risk-averse strategy in shifting between currencies and altering the interest rate mix.  He mentioned the advisory committee.  I would emphasise that they are advisory and any remuneration they receive will be small.  They will not be making executive decisions.  The chief executive reporting to the Minister will make the decisions.</P>
    <P>Members of the committee will be carefully chosen, based on their knowledge and financial expertise.  Conflicts of interest will be avoided.  There are excellent people, for example, working in international organisations dealing with the financial sector, such as the World Bank and the European Investment Bank.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa asked why are borrowing and debt management no longer appropriate to the Department of Finance?The Department is basically a policy Department.  The function of borrowing money by the Department in the name of the Minister for Finance began with the issue of national loans in the early days of the State.  In those days it was a relatively straightforward function. Despite the huge growth in borrowing by the Exchequer, including the breaking of new ground in the international capital markets, the Department continued to adapt and coped very well with these increased responsibilities.</P>
    <P>But we cannot ignore what has been happening in the past five or six years, in particular, the loss of financial expertise from the Department.  There has been a <Col N="2015" /> spurt of growth in new debt management instruments and in the demand for specialists to manage them.  Exchange controls have been all but removed. Cross-Border capital flows have increased.  Deregulation has grown and markets have become more complex.  As I said, the function of borrowing money in the nineties and of managing debt, particularly active management, is increasingly specialised.  Financial specialists cost money.  Structures must be found to accommodate these realities within the State sector.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa is concerned about confidentiality.  Deputy O'Shea suggested that the fine for unauthorised disclosure of information is too low.  In fact, that is not the only penalty.  The reason for the limit of £1,000 on the fine is to allow access to the District Court for summary trial.  The District Court trial enables the agency to dismiss the perpetrator if found guilty.  Otherwise the agency would have to submit the matter to a higher court as an indictable offence which could involve a jury trial and some long delays.</P>
    <P>Other more severe deterrents to unauthorised disclosure will be (1) the contracts of employment will include a non-disclosure clause a breach of which can be pursued under the civil law for damages commensurate with any unwarranted financial gain made as a result; (2) the Official Secrets Act which carried penalties of up to seven years in prison if a person in charge of official documents or knowledge is found guilty of unauthorised disclosure.  This would apply to officials in the agency.</P>
    <P>Deputy Seán Barrett asked why should the Minister make the appointment of chief executive?  Should it not be arranged through an independent body? The selection of chief executives of State agencies is not normally arranged through an independent commission.  In this instance the Minister will have the responsibility.  I can assure the House that he will make his choice on the best advice available.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett also questioned the <Col N="2016" /> need for an advisory committee.  The purpose of the committee is to bring together the best experience and skills in financial services to advise and I emphasise again the world &ldquo;advise&rdquo;&mdash; on how the debt should be managed.  What is wrong with having the best brains available from at home or abroad to help out in this task?</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett asked about Civil Service reform.  There has been an on-going process of reform in the Civil Service over the last few years.  Apart from normal day-to-day improvements in administration, there have been major pushes in two main areas.  The use of information technology has greatly increased and has now penetrated beyond the old &ldquo;number crunching&rdquo; operations into general office administration with considerable benefits in terms of speedier and better quality administration; £35 million is being spent this year on information technology.  The recent launch of the Government telecommunications network is a further example of the Government's progressive policy in this area.</P>
    <P>On the general management front, we are implementing a system of delegated administrative budgets for Departments. This will enable Departments to allocate administrative resources, such as staff, training, computers, etc., in a much more flexible manner to fit the actual work situation.  I am convinced that this major innovation will act as a powerful incentive for managers to use their new freedoms to provide a more efficient and better quality service to the public and greater job satisfaction and job &ldquo;ownership&rdquo; for themselves and their staff.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte suggested that this Bill is a vote of no confidence in the Civil Service.  It is not.  It is a recognition of the reality of the marketplace from which Department of Finance debt management staff can be readily poached.</P>
    <P>He asked about the responsibility of the chief executive to the Minister and says that the handling of the debt is to be given to an outside agency.  This is not the case.  The proposed agency will be directly under the control of the Minister for Finance.If the agency are not doing their <Col N="2017" /> job for any reason, the Department will become aware of it quickly and advise the Minister.  Deputy Carey also referred to this matter.  The reality is that this Bill has been carefully prepared to reflect in the clearest possible way that the agency must operate under the control and superintendence of the Minister and be always subject to his directions and guidelines.The necessary structures will be put in place to ensure this.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne asked how the members of the agency are to be appointed. The sequence will be as follows.  The advisory committee will be appointed by the Minister, initially perhaps on a nonstatutory basis.  Their first function will be to advise the Minister on the terms and conditions of appointments of the chief executive.  When the chief executive has been appointed by the Minister, the chief executive will then begin appointing the staff of the agency.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ferris said that the agency will have no responsibility to report back to the Dáil.  The agency's reports and accounts, as audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, will be published and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Accountability to the Dáil for the financial affairs of the agency and for debt management expenditure is being definitively provided for in this legislation.  The Minister for Finance will still be responsible to the Dáil for debt management policies.  I, therefore, foresee additional information coming before the Dáil, not less as the Deputy implies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell would like to see the Bill incorporating annual debt/GNP targets for the agency to achieve.  This is unrealistic.  The primary function of the agency will be to obtain the funds necessary to finance the Exchequer borrowing requirement, to refinance existing debt and to obtain savings on interests costs which can be reflected in the budget.  The debt/GNP ratio depends too much on happenings which would be entirely outside the agency's control: the rate of GNP growth, the rate of Government borrowing and entirely unpredictable movements <Col N="2018" /> in international exchange rates. As Minister, I will be setting realistic targets for the agency and monitoring their performance.  I will not be setting targets which are not within their powers of attainment.</P>
    <P>Let me conclude as follows.  One of the big success stories here in the past few years has been the growth in the financial services industry.  The International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) has, of course, made a very significant contribution in terms of employment potential and an awakened international confidence in Ireland as a sophisticated financial base.  Alongside the growth in the IFSC there has been something of a quiet revolution in Irish financial services anyway.  New technology means that Ireland's geographical position is not a disadvantage, new financial instruments have come on stream and demarcation lines between various financial institutions are disappearing.  All this has led to a tremendous boost for the industry and a sure pointer to strong growth.</P>
    <P>A side effect of all this has been the increased demand for people with skills and experience in the financial markets. Banks and other financial institutions found, as they grew, that they were short of key people at middle management level, people who had valuable experience, who, in turn, could train young entrants to the industry.  Financial institutions are willing to pay for this valuable expertise and one of the logical places to look for it is in the Department of Finance.It is well known in the industry that the Department give a very good training in financial skills and a wide and varied experience.  The proof of that is readily seen in the number of former Department of Finance staff who have done extemely well in the financial private sector.  The result has been a continual drain from the Finance Division of the Department with people leaving, being replaced, and the replacements leaving in their turn.  As I mentioned at the outset of this debate, we tried to recruit people into the Department of Finance to replace some of those who had left.  This was not a success.  The most suitable <Col N="2019" /> people did not want to leave their jobs in the private sector to work in a Civil Service environment.</P>
    <P>A more fundamental solution is required and that is why we are establishing <Col N="2020" /> this agency.  The debt is very large, is varied and complex but I am satisfied that a dedicated and well motivated team can manage it prudently and effectively and still produce significant savings.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 1 in the name of Deputy Gilmore.  I note that amendments Nos. 2 and 3 are alternatives and amendment No. 41 is related.  I suggest that we discuss together amendments Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 41, by agreement.  Agreed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, to delete lines 7 to 16 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  the repeal of subsection (3), and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We had a lengthy debate on this issue during two days of the Committee Stage. On the last occasion the Opposition made the case that the regional fisheries boards were unhappy about the extension of the defence clause to the 1959 Act, which hitherto did not have such a clause.  Since the 1959 Act is the legislation used most by the fisheries boards in pursuing prosecutions against water polluters, they felt it would greatly hinder their effectiveness if the defence clause were extended to the 1959 Act.  The Minister responded positively to our request, that she should not pursue her own amendment on that occasion but should consult with the regional fisheries boards.  I am pleased that she has tabled an amendment today to delete the section which would have extended the defence clause to the 1959 Act.  I refer to amendment No. 41, which is very welcome.</P>
      <P>The issue which arises in relation to amendment No. 1 is whether a defence clause should be included in either the 1977 Act or the new Bill.  On Committee Stage the Minister made the point that she was anxious that the 1977 Act, this legislation and the 1959 Act should be harmonised as regards the defence provision.Our main unhappiness on that occasion was the direction in which the Minister was going in harmonising it.  It seemed she was making the 1959 Act less effective than it had been.  There is a case for harmonising the three pieces of legislation to the extent of not including what is known as the &ldquo;good defence&rdquo; clause.  That would not mean that a polluter who was prosecuted and taken to court would not be in a position to enter a defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the regional fisheries boards <Col N="2023" /> will have explained to the Minister that in the normal course of pursuing a prosecution under the 1959 Act people who are accused of polluting enter defences which are very often accepted by the courts.  The absence of a defence clause does not deny the right of the accused to enter a defence.  The difficulty in the 1977 Act and in this Bill is that the defence clause which was put into the 1977 Act, in my opinion and in the opinion of those in local authorities who have had the responsibility of enforcing the Act, has rendered that Act ineffective.  A polluter can go into court and rely on section 3 of the 1977 Act in order to avoid presecution.There is a very strong case for deleting the &ldquo;good defence&rdquo; clause from the 1977 Act.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to establish an Enterprise Fund for the Arigna area, which would be used to develop alternative employment for those involved in coal mining and power generation at Arigna, and that the date for termination of coal purchases by the ESB be extended to give an opportunity for these alternatives to become established.</P>
      <P>It is important to view this motion in the context of the very serious job losses that would occur in the area should the decision of the ESB to close at the end of this month go ahead as planned.  There are 57 people involved directly in the power burning station and an additional 180 to 200 workers in the coal mines. Very many of those workers are under 45 years of age and have a very high dependency and have a long number of useful working years stretching out before them.</P>

      <P>As I have said, most of the workers involved are particularly vulnerable and are living in an area where there are scarcely any alternative employment opportunities.  The Minister has already recognised the very serious plight of people in this region.  The only alternative that many of these workers will face is either migration or sole dependence on social welfare.  It will deal a further devastating blow to a region where emigration is already at haemorrhage proportions.</P>
      <P>The case has been made that Arigna mines are no longer able to supply the ESB with a competitive energy source. While this may now be the case, it must be recalled that at the height of the oil crisis in 1979-80, Arigna provided an invaluable source of indigenous energy and it can be seen from the ESB annual reports that it produced electricity which was competitive with the predominantly oil-fired generating capacity at that time. It was an indigenous resource while we faced the prospect of continuing escalating oil prices.  At that time and indeed shortly afterwards the present party in Government, Fianna Fáil, promised that a second power station would be built in order to exploit the attractive indigenous resources of the area, a fuel that offered great hope at that time.  That promise was never fulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The years of service given by Arigna impose an obligation on Government to give this region a realistic opportunity to develop alternative employment. Throughout Europe at present the Government of every single country which had a significant indigenous solid fuel industry are funding on a very large <Col N="2025" /> scale schemes to assist the establishment of alternative industries in those coal regions: Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom are involved in heavy programmes of subsidisation of the fuel industries in order to keep them going and allow a phased adjustment of employment in those areas.  Every one of those regions have suffered from the impact of a sharp fall in energy prices in recent years and are facing competition from very cheap energy imports.  Those Governments are facing up to the problems in their areas and are directly subsidising the fuels and schemes for alternative employment; they are lucky enough to be able to avail of EC funds to help them support the revitalisation programmes for the coal regions in Europe.  Tragically, the present Government allowed regulations under the Rechar programme at EC level which excluded Arigna from the terms of the programme and deliberately left out regions like Arigna simply on the grounds they were not employing more than 1,000 people.  Anyone knows that there is no possibility of a coal region in Ireland employing that number of people but the effects of a decline on a region like Arigna will be every bit as great as the decline which will be experienced in Germany, Belgium, Spain, France and indeed the United Kingdom from the impact of cheaper coal coming on to the world market.  The blunder by this Government in not ensuring that the Rechar programme accommodated Arigna puts an even greater onus on them to allow Arigna develop employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the Minister, when he spoke to the Seanad and decided there would be six months stay of execution by the ESB, established a task force and showed some concern for the very real problems of the area.  The task force have not yet reported and at the end of this month we are facing the imminent decision by the ESB to cease all further purchases.  The mines will close in four weeks time and redundancy notices have issued.  In effect, the hour glass for Arigna is coming close to the end.  If the mines close without other projects in the <Col N="2026" /> pipeline, workers will be forced to emigrate and the prospects of then getting alternative activity on the ground will be slim.  I am worried that the Government are hoping that with the closure the political pressure will dissipate and fade away and it will be permissible for the Government to continue to hope that the task force will come up with something but, in effect, nothing will happen.</P>
    <P>This slow strangulation of the region is totally unacceptable.  It is for that reason that we in Fine Gael have put forward a proposal that there should be an enterprise fund which would provide venture capital for new businesses in this region. This is a vital element that has been missing from the task force's efforts to date. The task force have simply been looking at alternatives and possibilities but have not had the essential ingredient of money to spend on bringing forward viable projects.The vital element is money which is needed if we are to expect enterprise and projects to come to fruition by the end of this month, mark you, to meet the needs of the numbers of people who will be thrown on to social welfare.  The onus is now on the Government and on this Minister to do as he did back in February and recognise that the work of the task force is far from complete, that there is a need once again to put off the imminent decision by the ESB to stop further purchases and phase out the continued operation of the plant when stocks are all gone.</P>
    <P>It is crucial that the task force should not continue as they have been going along to date but they key element is that there must be an enterprise fund with explicit funding from both Government and from the ESB to back alternative employment.  The ESB have already acknowledged their willingness to put such money into a fund and have shown some evidence or that goodwill in funding leaflets and promotional material for the region.  That money they have put in to date is only buttons compared to what is needed to bring forward viable projects for the area.</P>
    <P>That is why we feel it is vital that the Government commit themselves tonight <Col N="2027" /> to an enterprise fund that would be the focus for concerted effort not only by the agencies that the Minister has included in the task force but by the local community, local businesses and the workers, so that they can support a fund with a clear mandate to develop business ideas to the take-off position.  That is a simple proposal we are putting to the Minister tonight.  I hope he will recognise the sense of urgency felt on this side of the House. I am convinced the Minister will recognise his responsibilities in this area.  We face a situation where falling energy prices have caught most indigenous energy producers off guard.  We cannot ignore industries like these which have served the country well just because energy prices have fallen and it is no longer strictly economically viable for them to continue in operation.  We need to have a much more responsible attitude to these industries, in particular, to Arigna which has served us so well.  It is for that reason I ask the Minister to give consideration to this proposal.  As I said, there is strong international precedent for doing this and it in no way breaches the rules the Government have sought to impose financial rectitude, etc. Such a project is very acceptable.  The Germans, who have led the field in running their economy efficiently and sensibly, have gone down this road.  I ask the Minister to recognise that this is the way forward for this area.</P>
    <P>If there is no fund for viable projects in place before the mines close those people will never have an opportunity to be re-employed.  There is an urgent need for the Minister to put in place a project which will provide employment opportunities in this area.  By doing this we can preserve this region intact.  Not only will it give employment to members of the 260 families involved, but there will be money and activity in that area.  The alternative is that the State will have to face a bill for those families who will have to go on social welfare.  This could run to millions of pounds, probably about £3 million or £4 million per annum.  It would be far better to put this money into an <Col N="2028" /> enterprise fund which can provide realistic and alternative employment for these people who have developed very valuable skills and who have served this country very well through the various energy crises during the seventies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Bruton for giving me some of his time. Last autumn the communities in the Arigna catchment area were plunged into a mood of darkness by the announcement of the closure of the ESB coal burning station and the consequent impending closure of the coalmines.  Since then the Minister has set up a task force and redundancy notices have been given to the mine workers.  This is a repetition of previous announcements by the ESB to close the power station at Arigna and to abandon the use of coal for the purpose of generating electricity there.</P>
      <P>During the eighties a similar proposal was formulated which agitated the mine proprietors and workers and the ESB workers in the Arigna area to the extent that several deputations were sent to different Ministers and promises were given. As a result the ESB withdrew their threat of closure and mining and electricity generation continued.  Recently the same threat has been posed and people in the mining area are being laid off.</P>
      <P>Mining in Arigna was established in the 19th century.  It was carried on during this century by one mining proprietor and subsequently by at least two others.  The Arigna miners played a crucial role in the national economy during the war years when some 350,000 tonnes of coal were taken annually to many of the ESB and other State company operations.  In 1958 the power station at Arigna was commissioned and has since performed at a very high efficiency level within planned parameters.  In 1989 it was the fifth most efficient power station in the ESB network, well above the efficiency level of even the Moneypoint power station.  It has produced electricity for over 30 years at a very economic price and at a technically efficient level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1989 the works costs were almost £4 million, almost £1 million less than they <Col N="2029" /> were in 1988, 45.8 million units were generated and 42.3 million units were sent out into the system.  What, therefore, was initially established primarily for social consideration has become an efficient user of a national resource in the area. We have, therefore, reached the point where a natural resource in the Arigna area has been produced and used efficiently providing 300 well paid jobs that are now to be taken from the area. The employees have a considerable fear of the problems ahead with respect to their future and alternative opportunities.Three hundred jobs in an area such as Arigna has the same impact, relatively speaking, as the loss of a major multinational enterprise employing thousands of people in a major industrial zone.  However, the major difference in this case is that these people who will have to go on the dole queue do not have alternative employment within the State, will be forced to either emigrate or move to larger centres thus depriving the businesses in the area of their spending power.  This will have knock-on effects in the loss of more jobs in the retail and services areas.</P>
    <P>Since the oil crisis of the seventies EC member states have sought to reduce external dependence on energy supplies through greater efficiency, the diversification of sources, increased use of solid fuels and the development of renewable energy.  Coal is still one of the major sources of energy throughout the world. A recommendation has been made in other Community countries, for example, France, Germany and Spain, to concentrate on the construction of new environmentally-friendly small coal fire power stations able to generate sufficient electricity for a region rather than feeding the national grid.  This development should be considered for Arigna.</P>
    <P>Over the years promises were made to provide a larger generating station for Arigna and tests were carried out on the availability of suitable coal and the use of same through a fluidised bed system for the generation of electricity in that larger power station's generating unit. However, it was considered at the time <Col N="2030" /> that the capital outlay was considerable and no other reasons were given for not proceeding with this larger station.  As the Minister is aware these promises were given in the early eighties when general election promises were being bandied around with considerable aplomb.  Unfortunately they had no intention of meeting these promises once the election was over.  This has left a very bitter feeling in that part of the country and the politicians, who are now trying to do something worthwhile to help the people in the area, are not believed.  Because some politicians acted irresponsibly at that time, we are all paying the price now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I am being taped at the moment.  The people in the Arigna area believe that this proposal should be developed in order to save these jobs.  I know the Minister has already set up a task force to report from time to time to Roscommon County Council, Leitrim County Council and Sligo County Council.  I welcomed the setting up of this task force but I prefaced my remarks by saying a task force should have been set up years earlier as this part of the country has suffered greatly over the years.  Special incentives should be given to this area where jobs are badly needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In quoting from an article in the <i>Leitrim Observer</i> of 10 February last I am not attempting to score a political point but to indicate that most politicians in the area, regardless of their political affiliations, believe in our motion.  It is their view that not alone should a task force be set up but that the Government should establish an enterprise fund.  In the course of that article it was made clear that while a task force would create employment opportunities, unless they were given monetary assistance it would be like a guard dog without teeth.  The article, <Col N="2031" /> under the heading, &ldquo;Arigna Task Forces brief slammed as fantasy&rdquo;, stated:</P>
    <P>The high-powered Task Force set up to find alternative jobs for Arigna has run into a storm of protest with two local politicians raising serious questions about its usefulness in its present form.</P>
    <P>The Task Force which include high-powered Civil Servants, County Managers, the IDA and a number of other bodies was set up following a suggestion from Trade and Marketing Minister, Terry Leyden.</P>
    <P>But last night (Tuesday), both SligoLeitrim T.D. John Ellis and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, Senator Séan Doherty, expressed their deep dissatisfaction with the Task Force's brief, considering the urgency of the Arigna situation.</P>
    <P>Senator Doherty is quoted as saying:</P>
    <P>It is fine to set up a task force if it is going to examine proposals for employment and jobs are going to be brought about in a certain period of time.  But in the immediacy of the Arigna situation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>&ldquo;Other Task Forces have been set up and what have they achieved out of the ordinary &mdash; nothing.  As far as I am concerned its just further bureaucracy being added that isn't, going to do anything&rdquo;, declared Deputy Ellis.</P>

      <P>I do not disagree with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Ellis and it is important to stress that all politicians in the area agree that, unless we receive adequate monetary assistance, we will not get any tangible results.</P>
      <P>The catchment area of Arigna is quite expansive in that it includes places like Drumshanbo, Drumkeerin, Ballinamore and extends as far as Dowra in County Cavan and westward to southern Sligo and north Roscommon where Arigna is located.  This then is a serious issue concerning the retention of jobs in those already deprived areas.  There will be big losses for the mine workers who have to bear the worry, fear and concern about their prospects without any jobs in sight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the study which the Minister commissioned with regard to the availability of suitable coal for future use indicates that there is a sufficient quantity there to keep the existing power station in operation, then he should keep it open.  If that quantity is adequate to provide a 45 MW power station, a second station, then that development should proceed.  Failing that, the Minister, and the Government, should accept that any person who has had to forego his job involuntarily should be able to get an alternative job in another enterprise with an opportunity to earn the equivalent amount of disposable income.  This calls for the filling of the vacant advance factories in towns like Drumshanbo, Carrick-on-Shannon and Ballinamore.  Those factories have been vacant for some time.  The IDA should establish manufacturing industry in the <Col N="2033" /> area to absorb some of the unemployment being created.  They should do everything possible to ensure that workers, their wives and families maintain the lifestyles to which they have become accustomed.  That can be done if alternative enterprises suitable to their needs and aspirations are established.</P>
    <P>In this case the ESB should not be let off the hook.  They will have savings arising from the closure of the Arigna power station and the Minister ought to direct them to set up an enterprise fund for the area to finance projects which will create jobs over the next five to ten years. The Minister should direct them to put back into the community something approaching what they are now taking away.  I would like to see action in regard to the development of other industries, particularly in relation to the creation of jobs in farming, alternative farming enterprises, tourism enterprises and other developments that would be beneficial to the area.  The House recently debated a site for a wood processing industry and the north-west was suggested.The Government should give a commitment to establish this industry in the north-west and, bearing in mind the problems being experienced in Arigna, a good case can be made for siting it there.</P>
    <P>The Minister should return to the EC to pressurise them into applying the RECHAR Programme to Arigna.  It is invidious that an area so deprived by the loss of the jobs does not fulfil the requirements of the EC which are that job losses must exceed 1,000 or more.  Obviously, the EC are thinking bigger than it is possible to do with regard to mining here and there should be persistent pressure on the Commission to support any area that has been deprived. The Government, in allowing the EC adopt such policies, did not take into consideration the problems faced by areas like Arigna.</P>
    <P>There are solid social and economic reasons for not proceeding with the closure of the power station and the mines. There are good grounds for calling on <Col N="2034" /> the Government to take urgent action to prevent further emigration and unemployment there.  There is a dependence, and this will continue, on imported fuel. The business picture for the communities I have mentioned is disastrous.  It is imperative, therefore, that the Arigna mines and the power station be allowed continue operating until such time as alternative employment is provided.  I accept that the task force have directed their attention to those issues but, unless there is a solid commitment from the Government, and the ESB, to put back into the community what has been taken from it, the population of Arigna, and its hinterland, will disappear.  For as long as I am a public representative for the area I will use every option open to me to try to prevent that happening.</P>

      <P>It is ironic that Dáil Éireann is today discussing the deliberate killing off of coalmining in Arigna and the resultant social and economic devastation of the area while tomorrow the House will be discussing the very positive move for County Leitrim of the reopening of the Ballinamore and Ballyconnell Canal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will be interested to know that coalmining and the canal were linked together in parliamentary debates in the House of Commons some 150 years ago.  Arigna coal mining, and the distribution of the coal, was an important consideration in authorising the Commissioners of Public Works to build the BallinamoreBallyconnell Canal linking the Shannon and Erne waterways.  Of course, mining in Arigna goes back much further than that.  The iron deposits in Sliabh an Iarainn were mined as early as the 15th century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael, in tabling this motion, are seeking to avoid the end of that activity, the end of a way of life, the break-up of the mining-based community and the very survival of the area.  To put it in that way is not an exaggeration.  If the ESB <Col N="2035" /> power station at Arigna is permitted to close, as planned, and with it the mines, without first putting in place alternative industries with equal employment, then we are talking about cutting a broad swathe of destruction through six parishes, Ballinaglera, Drumkeerin, Drumshanbo, Geevagh, Kilronan and northern Ardcarne.  That area has, unfortunately, been devastated by unemployment and successive waves of emigration.  In the study carried out by Deputy Garret FitzGerald of the pattern of emigration and depopulation in the fifties, based on an electoral division, the area I have referred to emerged as one of the worst hit in the country.  Another area highlighted was my native parish of Kilmactague, Tubbercurry, Gurteen and Ballymote.</P>
    <P>If we allow the power station and the mines to go without creating alternative jobs, then the damage done to the community may be irreversible.  Certainly, it will take at least half a century to repair. That is an idea of the extent of the problem we have to deal with and of the size of the challenge facing the Government. We are not just talking about people employed in the mines and the power stations because everybody in that area is involved in one way or another.  Certainly, they will be if the closures, without alternative employment, come about, as the Government seem to be willing to tolerate.</P>
    <P>Arigna ESB power station was set up by the Government of the day in the fifties for social reasons.  Equally strong, if not even more compelling, social reasons exist today for keeping it open. Will our present Government close it without any definite, concrete plans for job replacement?  Is that a measure of their conscience?  Is that a measure of the advances we have made since the fifties? Already 28 per cent of the people in the area generally are affected or draw social welfare of one kind or another.  Will we now deliberately put another 250 people on the dole or &mdash; more precisely &mdash; a proportion of the 250 or 300 people who will remain at home?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2036" /> They do not want the dole or to go to the departure lounge at Knock or Sligo Airports.  They want work and their leaders in that area &mdash; as Deputy Leyden, the Minister of State, knows &mdash; have not been sitting around waiting for it all to happen for them.  They have drawn up some very imaginative development plans but they cannot do it on their own and time is of the essence.</P>
    <P>It was never considered that the ESB power station would be financially viable. As I said, it was set up for social reasons but since it was commissioned in 1958 it performed at a very high level of efficiency.  It was the fifth most efficient power station in the ESB network last year.  Moneypoint, with all their modern developments, only came eighth.  Last year &mdash; this is very important &mdash; it was just as efficient and the coal available to it was just as good as that available to it over the years in operation.  The cost of the total operation at Arigna, including the fuel, was £4.9 million or 1.4 per cent of the total ESB operation.  The total ESB fuel bill was £225 million which puts the £3.8 million for Arigna in context. It is of enormous importance to the six parishes from which the employees come, to the north-west region and County Leitrim in particular.  We are not asking for major sacrifices from anyone but for justice for that area.</P>
    <P>In the average year 45,000 tonnes of coal are delivered.  Leydon's Arigna Colliers supply 30,000 tonnes on contract. The rest come from Flynn and Lehany and from Wynne's without contract.  The top priority now is to get recognition for the small suppliers Flynn and Lehany, P. J. Wynne and Greene's, who have been seeking to supply the station for a number of years.  It is imperative that these suppliers are given a contract now as a first step in the overall plan in maintaining the power station over the required period needed to get the alternatives in place. Indeed, alternatives can be found if the political will is there.  The Minister will tell us that he has set up a task force; this is an impressive body doing good work and I am sure it will be helpful but it is not an alternative to Government action.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2037" /> I am delighted the Minister for Energy will reply to this motion.  What is he doing about deciding that a new pulpwood industry, which the country will certainly get within the next three to five years, will be located there?  If there had never been a crisis in Arigna this is the kind of area where the industry should be located because there are forests and the requirements of a modern pulpwood plant are 150,000 to 200,000 cubic metres a year. Counties Leitrim, Sligo, Roscommon, Mayo and Donegal have raw materials well in excess of that from thinnings and clear fallings.  Indeed, because of the young age structure of the forests in that area, up to 30 per cent. of the raw material available nationally is located in this region and the supply will have doubled by 1997.  The Minister is aware of these figures.  The Leitrim area also has fresh water in the huge volume required for such an enterprise.  It also has the required strength of kilowatt power lines coming as far as Carrick-on-Shannon.It would not be an impossible task to bring them further up, especially because of the obligations &mdash; moral and otherwise &mdash; which the ESB have to the Arigna area.</P>
    <P>At present we appear to lack a coherent national strategy for forestry and the timber industry and an essential part of any strategy must be the location of the planned pulpwood mill.  The obvious location is as a replacement industry for Arigna.  However, I am not too confident that this is in the Government's plan.  I will be very interested to hear the Minister's comments in this regard.</P>
    <P>When I mentioned this possible development at the Arigna protest meeting in Drumshanbo, a very distinguished Member of the Upper House holding a high position, from County Roscommon, tried to say that my whole idea was rubbish on the grounds that it would not be a major employer and would create a problem in regard to pollution.  As I understand it, he was wrong on both counts.  The Minister may have something to say about that but it indicates a very negative approach by Fianna Fáil.  I hope the Progressive Democrats Minister <Col N="2038" /> who has expressed positive signals about locating it in County Leitrim will confirm this during the course of the debate.</P>
    <P>Arigna people are not just sitting around waiting for something to happen. They have produced their plans; they want to keep Arigna power station and mines in the region open for a ten year period to allow for the possibility of creating alternative employment.  They want to re-examine the possibility of building a crow coal power station, to encourage the production of smokeless fuel and other coal-based products for the domestic market, to co-operate with the IDA in finding reliable industries for the empty factory on the Dowra Road and mart units in Drumshanbo and to seek a major tourism plan for the Lough Allen region, including the reopening of the Lough Allen Canal.  I am glad to announce that Fine Gael will be tabling an amendment tomorrow to the Shannon Navigation Bill with a view to having the Lough Allen Canal reopened.  People in the area have proposals for structures and funding, all soundly based, very well researched and worked out.</P>
    <P>We are seeking to avert a tragedy for six parishes.  Oddly enough, those six parishes spread into four counties and three dioceses.  I am sure that in the final analysis Deputies on all sides of the House will agree with the general objective.  The motion in the name of our spokesman, Deputy Richard Bruton, outlines the necessity for a enterprise fund and for extra time.  We await to hear from the Minister that he will accept our motion or, if not, that he will outline a better way forward for Arigna.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only a short time since I spoke on an Adjournment debate in the Seanad on the subject of Arigna mines. I will outline progress since then in a moment.</P>
      <P>I am conscious that there is very strong support for the mining tradition in the Arigna area.  People are obviously very concerned that closure of the ESB power station will devastate the economy of the region.  Before turning to recent developments I think it is important to establish the background to this whole issue.</P>
      <P>Mining started in the Arigna area in the 1800s.  The coal was originally used for iron production.  Subsequently it was used in steam trains and by the sugar company.  Demand for Arigna coal was probably at its peak during the war years when other imported fuels were in short supply.</P>
      <P>After the Second World War demand for Arigna coal declined and the Government of the day decided that the best way to protect employment in the mines and to maintain a viable local community was for the ESB to construct a power station. The Arigna power station was commissioned in 1958.  Even at that stage it was clear that the project would not produce competitively priced electricity &mdash; its main purpose was a social one. Indeed, it was probably the only prospect for substantial employment in the area. The fact that it provided an opportunity to use another native fuel must also have been a factor as well as it represented about a 2 per cent increase in the ESB's overall generating capacity.  The power station has now been operating for about 32 years during which time it has made a major contribution to the local economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In their 1989 accounts the ESB show that the cost of electricity from Arigna was 9.32 pence per unit &mdash; in other words <Col N="2040" /> it is being sold at a loss even before you take account of transmission and distribution costs.  For comparison, the cost of power from Moneypoint was about 1.5 pence and the most expensive milled peat power station produced power at 5.7 pence per unit.</P>
    <P>The total cost of the diseconomy in 1989 amounted to about £2.8 million or almost £12,000 per annum for each job in the mine and power station.  This is paid for by the electricity consumer at a time when everyone is anxious for the ESB to keep their prices as low as possible in an effort to assist with industrial competitiveness and the general strengthening of the economy.  Originally the ESB proposed to close the station in 1985 so it has, in fact, had a six year extension already.</P>
    <P>Since 1958 the ESB's generating capacity has grown by over 3200 MW from about 700 MW to 3900 MW.  As a result the Arigna power station now accounts for less than half of one per cent of the ESB's capacity.</P>
    <P>Technically the power station was designed to burn what is known as main seam coal.  Most coal fired power stations are designed to burn coal which matches a fairly narrow specification.  I do not mean to infer that all of the coal being burned in the world is the same &mdash; far from it.  It is possible to design boilers for many different types of coal.  Once design decisions have been made, however, the type of coal fed into the boiler must be regulated carefully, otherwise there is always a risk of serious accidents.</P>
    <P>In recent years, the ESB have been experiencing continuous difficulty in getting coal of the quality which is the minimum acceptable to them.  This is consistent with the situation when the best seams have been mined and less useful seams are being resorted to.  The tests carried out by the ESB on coal deliveries show a consistent tendency towards just hitting the minimum percentage required, and indeed falling below this, that is in the range of 68 per cent to 70 per cent coal in the sample, with the slate, stone and excessive ash content contingent on a situation of this kind. <Col N="2041" /> This seriously affects the economics of working and the practical and technical aspects of burning this coal, as well as environmental aspects in the huge ash deposits to be removed and stacked.</P>
    <P>I mention these things in passing because I believe it is vitally important that everyone realises the enormous contribution which has already been made in support of the Arigna area over the last 32 years.</P>
    <P>Let me now turn to the present situation.Back in 1983 in their strategic plan the ESB proposed to close the Arigna power station in 1985.  Later on, in revised proposals accepted by the Government in May 1984, the ESB decided to keep the station operating until suitable local coal supplies were exhausted.  At that time this was expected to happen by 1986 or 1987.  In October last year the ESB announced that they proposed to operate the station for about two more years and that they would stop taking coal deliveries in April of this year. The power stations would be needed for the remaining time to burn off the large stock of coal which had accumulated there.  The decision to stop taking coal was reached between the ESB and Arigna Collieries who were the main suppliers of coal, and representated a mutually satisfactory arrangement in the context in which the main coal seam was virtually exhausted and the cost of extracting the remaining coal would rise sharply.</P>
    <P>Indeed, it is clear that this is a situation which was recognised by the employers, the mining companies themselves.  It was because their situation was foreseen that extensive studies were undertaken and consideration given to the possibility of using fluidised bed burner technology and a totally new station, expected at that time to cost close on £100 million was considered by various Ministers for Energy and their advisers in 1980 and thereabouts.  That, of course, was against an expected rising oil price scenario and the possibility of a continued squeeze on oil supplies, both of which did not, happily, materialize.</P>
    <P>The motion proposed by Fine Gael <Col N="2042" /> in my opinion, is a meaningless gesture put before this House for blatant political, opportunistic reasons.  Its intention is to convey a message of the need for this action as the saviour of the community affected by the decisions to close the mine by a mine owner and consequent inevitable closure of the power station by the ESB due to the non-availability of coal following the closure of the mine.  The reality, however, is that an enterprise fund is not needed because the Government have indicated quite clearly on a number of occasions &mdash; I have done so in the other House and here &mdash; that we will be most generous in supporting any identified viable proposal to supply alternative employment in this region.</P>
    <P>The second part of this motion proposes that the ESB continue to purchase coal.  How can they do that if the mine is closed?  Mine owners say there is no coal there.  I heard Mr. Leyden say recently on television that the Minister was wasting money in having carried out the study I will refer to later, that he knew the mine better than anybody else.</P>
    <P>If, as Minister for Energy, I was to do only what is suggested by Fine Gael in this motion I would, in my opinion, be making a pathetic response to a major crisis for the people of Leitrim, north Roscommon and south Sligo.  I know these areas.  I have travelled them.  I have been in the people's homes and in the power station there.  I am as conscious as anybody in this House that closure of the mines and the power station would mean the end of the long mining tradition in Arigna and would cause hardship to very many people. For that reason I have taken a much more positive and worthwhile step than the one urged by Fine Gael in this motion.</P>
    <P>I announced last February in the Seanad that a task force had been established under the chairmanship of the Roscommon County Manager to facilitate the identification of suitable alternative employment in order to explore to the utmost any possibility of mining and generation on any even half reasonable basis.  I also asked the Geological Survey <Col N="2043" /> office to undertake further work to ascertain the quality and quantities of reserves of coal that might be available in other seams.  I did that against the advice that was available to me from the mine owners and from previous surveys which showed that there were no such coal reserves there.  I still insisted, as I announced in the Seanad, that an extensive, comprehensive survey would be carried out to determine and settle this matter once and for all.  At that time, at my request, the ESB agreed to continue to take coal until the end of this month, July, to give the task force time to complete their work.  I have now received the Geological Survey office's report.  I expect to receive the task force report before the end of July.</P>
    <P>From the preliminary findings of the Geological Survey Office it has now been established that there are substantial additional reserves of coal in the Arigna area.  However, the important matter to be determined is the suitability of the coal for use in the Arigna power station.  I have, therefore, asked the ESB and the Geological Survey Office to advise me on the feasibility and cost of mining and using these substantial additional reserves.  I expect to have that report within a month.  I must warn, however, that as things stand now, first indications from tests carried out on samples of the coal from the sources now believed to exist in reasonable quantity, are that this coal will be at a low quality level and this is not an encouraging sign.  It could, on the other hand, simply mean a continuation, and at even increased cost and with the certainty of the need for quite extensive capital costs by the ESB, of the totally unsatisfactory situation that has persisted there since the early eighties.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the drift of the motion put down by the Opposition implicitly recognises this and that the preferable course, unless we receive far more fortunate indications than are now thought probable, is to look for viable alternatives of good, durable employment and to extricate ourselves from this heavy loss situation which, as the earlier figure shows, <Col N="2044" /> means a cost to the economy of around £2 million to £3 million a year for a continuation of this electricity generation.</P>
    <P>I am, however, anxious to take decisions in the light of all known facts and it is for this reason that I have ordered the studies to which I have adverted, and it is for this reason that I wish to wait until the full results of the analysis and advice are available to me.  I will then make recommendations to the Government.While I will keep an open mind on the matter until I receive the final report, it would be wrong of me to hold out false hopes of continued mine operations given the diseconomies which surround the present operation and indications that things may get substantially worse.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that closure of the mines and power station will disrupt the lives of everybody closely involved.  The main unemployment impact will fall on about 130 mine workers in the 20-40 year age bracket.  However, I do not think if that situation were to come about that the prospects are nearly as bleak as they were in the 1950s.  The whole approach to job creation has changed.  There is much greater awareness of the important contribution which is made by thousands of very small businesses.  There is also a greatly more sophisticated economy and infrastructure to support regional and local development.  The achievements of the IDA over many years in attracting high-tech industry to Ireland have created many opportunities for supporting industries.They have also created awareness among both customers in Ireland and abroad and among people creating new businesses of the existence of a much wider range of business opportunities.</P>
    <P>The Arigna Task Force which I set up have been considering a number of initiatives which might provide alternative employment opportunities.  They have consulted a subsidiary of the British Steel Corporation, which have extensive experience of helping areas to adjust after the closure of steel making plants in the UK.</P>
    <P>Because the people directly affected in the first instance, would be mineworkers, the task force arranged with <Col N="2045" /> FÁS and the Irish Productivity Centre to conduct a skills audit and counselling service among the workforce in the mines to establish their skills, ambitions and aptitudes for alternative employment.  I understand that there was an excellent response to this initiative.</P>
    <P>The IDA have prepared a brochure specifically aimed at promoting industrial development in the area.  There is already an IDA advance factory in Drumshanbo and the IDA are hoping to have an industry established there shortly.</P>
    <P>It would be hard to find a better example to illustrate the wide range of opportunities which should be considered than a boat building project which is already under way with financial assistance from the ESB and the IDA.  Kennedy boats will be constructing steel hulled cruisers from the Shannon with a view to supplying a more durable product than the glass fibre hulled boats which are currently in use.</P>
    <P>Other possible developments which the task force are aware of include precision engineering, mushroom growing, coal briquetting and tyre remoulding.  It is also planned to establish enterprise centres at Arigna, Drumshanbo, Drumkeerin and Ballinamore to facillitate small business development in these areas.</P>
    <P>Deputy Nealon referred to the wood pulp project which is under consideration now.  It would seem at this stage that such an industry, wherever located &mdash; and it is the Government's preference that it would be located in the north-western region &mdash; would require a marine outfall because of the type of polluting effluent which will be discharged from such a plant even with modern day treatment.  I just want to correct some of the things the Deputy said in support of the difficulties mentioned by the other spokesperson, Deputy Jim Mitchell, at some other meeting.</P>
    <P>The ESB are, naturally very conscious of their social responsibilities arising from the closure of the mines and power station.They have been contributing to the cost of these initiatives and also plan to <Col N="2046" /> contribute to the establishment of projects under the auspices of the Leitrim and Sligo enterprise funds which have been established by the International Fund for Ireland.</P>
    <P>The general feeling among the task force is that there are good prospects for establishing many new employment opportunities in the area.  Because these will involve many diverse businesses the area will no longer be so critically dependent on the success of any one of them. In addition, because these businesses will be trading on a normal commercial basis, the general prospects for long-term prosperity in the region will be much enhanced compared to the present situation when everything depends on the subsidy implicitly provided by the ESB's customers.</P>
    <P>To sum up, what I am saying is that the surveys I have undertaken are not completed and when I have all the facts I will bring the matter to Government for decision.  I hope to do that in about four weeks' time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>This is probably a very emotional debate for many of us who are directly involved in the area.  The situation is uncertain with regard to the possibility of continued mining.  At this stage I compliment the Minister for Energy and the Government on their decision to undertake a full survey against the advice of many senior civil servants and people in the area who tried to say that the coal seams were totally exhausted, with the exception of crow coal.  The report to the Minister shows that there are reasonable reserves of coal, as we said on numerous occasions.  It has been pointed out that the reserves of coal in the Arigna area are much higher than was thought by the Department of Energy and the ESB.  We have to wait to see the quality of the coal but it is obvious from the Minister's statement that the coal found is not crow coal.  I hope that the seams which have been found will be found to be economical and that the future of the area will be looked after by the mining industry and the power station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2047" /> We must consider the social problems that will be caused by an overnight close down of the entire operations.  We are all aware that redundancy notices have been issued by one firm.  In view of what has come to light here, that might be reconsidered and perhaps the mine owners should be asked to continue until we get the result of the tests being carried out on the recent deposits.  The ESB have a social commitment in this area and have intimated to us that they are prepared to make a considerable contribution towards the development of industry in the area.  Only this week the chief executive of the ESB outlined in a letter to me that they are prepared to make substantive contributions under a number of headings and that they have already started to make contributions in the area.</P>
    <P>We must look at both sides of this coin. We must look at coal and hope that mining can continue and we must look at the possibility of introducing alternative industry to the region.  This is probably the only region of the country that has had such a decline in population.  The population of Leitrim is now in the region of 24,000, a drop of 4,000 in the last three to four years.  The same drop in population has been experienced in the North Roscommon area and in South Sligo where they join Arigna.</P>
    <P>The ESB, who are prepared to make a contribution according to the figures before us, are losing approximately £2.8 million per annum at Arigna or almost £12,000 for each job in the mine and power station.  They should declare publicly that they are prepared to make available a sizeable contribution to develop industries in this area.  We are all aware that brochures which promote this area as a suitable location are being prepared and I am strongly of the view that these brochures should state that the ESB are prepared to pay extra grants and take equity in companies which establish in the area.</P>
    <P>The ESB have stated that if there is a major breakdown at the power station at Arigna it may not be possible to have it repaired but I do not believe this.  If it is <Col N="2048" /> properly maintained there is little or no chance of a major breakdown in the near future.  It seems the aim of the ESB in floating this idea is the closure of the power station.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the wood processing industry.  We are all aware that the Government are committed to locating such an industry in the north west.  Even my colleagues on the opposite benches would welcome the setting up of an industry anywhere in that region which, as the Minister has stated, is Government policy.  Timber is being produced in this area where much marginal agricultural land has been lost because of increased investment in timber production by private planters, multinationals or lending institutions, with the result that many people have been forced out of farming.</P>
    <P>We must also bear in mind the inconvenience that would be caused to ESB workers who have set down roots in the area.  Like the miners, they would face major problems if the power station were to close.  The ESB should declare in public that they would be prepared to invest a specified sum of money in the area over a period of five years.  They have stated to various deputations that they would be willing to do this and it is now time for them to declare publicly that they would be prepared to invest in that community the amount of money they would save, going by their own figures.</P>
    <P>I do not think the figure quoted by the ESB &mdash; that the cost of electricity from Arigna was 9.32 pence per unit &mdash; is true. I believe the figure may be as low as 6 pence per unit.  However, we have to accept this figure as we are not in a position to query it given that we do not have access to the information from which it is compiled.  It was stated that the cost of power from the coal burning station at Moneypoint was 1.49 pence per unit but the fact is that the money spent on coal leaves the economy.  At least in the case of Arigna we receive taxes.  I do not think any of the people concerned wish to receive social welfare payments; rather they wish to see employment <Col N="2049" /> maintained and that they be given the opportunity to continue to work in the area.</P>
    <P>It has been said that I criticised the task force.  I did nothing wrong in doing this.  Indeed, as a result of being criticised they have become much more active and are now doing a much better job than they did during the first two to three months of their existence.</P>

      <P>They should be given access to money only once projects have been identified.  Indeed, money is available. The ESB have invested in one project in Carrick-on-Shannon and have stated they are willing to pay the rent for another project in an IDA factory in Carrick-on-Shannon for two years.  This should ensure employment is provided in an area which stretches from Ballinamore to Geevagh to Boyle and Drumkeeran on the northern side.  It should be borne in mind that the miners and workers are not the only people dependent on the power station for their livelihoods.  Traders and suppliers are also dependent upon it.</P>
      <P>We should be realistic and should not set out to score political points because we are playing with people's livelihoods and future.  We should reach a consensus on what should be done and should not come into the House to score political points.  I have no intention of trying to score political points.  I have no doubt that certain people on the Opposition benches have no intention of doing so either.</P>

      <P>Should the power station close because of the quality of the coal, it is important the ESB give the same commitment given by other companies who have moved out of other areas to reinvest in those areas in order to maintain employment.  I have no doubt that the ESB and the Government will give such a commitment.  The Government are also committed to ensuring that the <Col N="2050" /> remaining resources at Arigna are exploited before the power station is closed.</P>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that it will be another three to four weeks before the position becomes clear as regards the quality of the coal now available.  It is a pity we will not be in a position to discuss the matter then when we will have a much better idea of what the future holds for the area.  Regardless of the result, I have no doubt the Government's commitment to maintain employment in the area which is a black spot will be met.  Should the mines and power station close, the problems encountered by the people concerned should be dealt with in a fair and objective manner.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party amendment to the motion reads as follows:</P>
      <P>That annual contracts be made by the ESB, with the small Arigna mine owners, to supply the power stations at Mount Allen with coal, pending the development of alternative sources of employment; that no decision about the future of the power station be taken until the findings of the GSI are published and the implications fully assessed and that all interested bodies, including the Lough Allen Community Development Association, the Arigna Miners, the Power Station Workers and task force, be fully consulted.</P>
      <P>The amendment is self-explanatory.  I would like to respond to a number of the points made by the Minister in his contribution this evening.  Listening to him I could not help thinking he was making a very good case for keeping the power station open and was expressing a very optimistic view.  I hope he will continue to approach the matter in that way.  Rather than this being a coal problem it could be considered a coalition problem because a political decision will have to be made.  The Minister and his colleagues will have to decide on what the future holds for this community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not help but reflect on Arthur Scargill's battle during the famous coal strike in the UK.  Many of the things <Col N="2051" /> he had said and fought for during that campaign could be said about this problem.His main concern &mdash; it has now proved to be correct &mdash; was that what people were talking about was the killing off of a community.  The question begs itself: what price does one put on a community?What is the value of the human resources involved?  It is a good deal more than coal-mining, it is a question of the whole community in that area.  From my experience of dealing indirectly with that subject, it is a scenario that has been sadly neglected over many years by successive Governments.  I suppose the reason was that everybody was prepared to accept the fact that the main employer in the area was coalmining with all the downstream activities that flowed from it and the money it generated in the area.</P>
    <P>Like all other closures we have heard about and dealt with over many years, and particularly in later years, it is so easy to make a professional judgment and to give professional reasons a business or an enterprise should be closed down.  It is always much more difficult for us to advance positive reasons for keeping it open.  There is no argument against the continuation, at least for a period, of this operation.  It may take an Arthur Scargill to give it a push where it is needed because, as the Minister is aware, the deadline is fast approaching; the initial problem will commence on 20 July.</P>
    <P>The ESB claim that the Arigna power station is not a financially sound business as determined by the best international commercial criteria.  They claim they can produce electricity much cheaper if they close down Arigna and produce its quota of electricity at Moneypoint using coal imported from the USA.  It is also claimed that local supplies of mainseam coal are running out, especially at Arigna Collieries developed by the Leydon family.  Accordingly, it is proposed to close down the Arigna power station in about two-and-a-half years from now.  It is reported that supplies of coal are to cease after the next six months but the power station has 90,000 tonnes of coal <Col N="2052" /> in reserve to carry it over the next two years.</P>
    <P>This approach by the ESB is a very simplistic one to the economics of the situation.  There are external factors over which the ESB have no control.  Some of the external factors are as follows: price of coal in US dollar terms, foreign exchange must be used and that involves drawing on the nation's foreign exchange reserves; exchange rates &mdash; Irish pound against US dollar &mdash; nobody can foretell the position of our pound against the US dollar on the exchange market: if our pound goes down or the dollar goes up in value the entire operation changes. There is also the question of our pound against various foreign currencies in relation to interest rates which must be taken into account for interest and loan repayment purposes on investments and materials; and interest rates fixed by international markets over which we have no control can be paralysing.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party see the relevance of these points when we realise that the ESB's overall dependence on imported fuels, priced in US dollars, is projected to increase from 58 per cent in 1988 to 68 per cent in 1992.  This situation will only worsen in future years.  Our power supply then becomes very vulnerable to outside influences.  This is apart altogether from the fact that a major political upheaval might make it practically impossible to get fuel supplies sufficient to meet our needs.  It also looks like an attempt at national suicide.  Furthermore, the level of ESB debt has increased steadily every year to the present level of £1,303 million.  The total fuel cost for the ESB in 1988 was £225 million.  Total fuel costs for the Arigna power station for 1988 were £3.6 million; thus the cost of buying Irish coal from Arigna Collieries was 2 per cent of the total fuel cost.</P>
    <P>ESB operations for 1988 amounted to £354 million on generation; ESB operations for Arigna power station for 1988 amounted to £4.9 million &mdash; 1.4 per cent of total operations.  This was made up as follows: payroll expenditure £1.1 million, <Col N="2053" /> material and other expenditure £0.2 million, fuel £3.6 million, total expenditure at Arigna £4.9 million.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the Arigna power station one will find that capital expenditure was nil, new borrowings were nil, outstanding borrowings were nil, in other words, total capital expenditure at Arigna power station was nil.  Against that there were 27 other power stations where the capital expenditure was £74 million, net borrowings were £104 million, outstanding borrowings were £1,205 million &mdash; that was for Moneypoint &mdash; total cost £1,383 million.</P>
    <P>The average price per unit produced in Arigna was 8.99p &mdash; works cost &mdash; in 1988.  This compares very favourably with oil powered stations or peat powered stations.  Moneypoint produces units at an average price of 1.473p, but this power station is on stream all the time: that is not comparing like with like.  If the Arigna power station were to be closed down and its share of power were produced at Moneypoint, it would reduce the price per unit to the householder by less than a tenth of a penny.  If this line of thinking were pursued to its logical conclusion, then all peat and oil powered stations would close as well because the price of electricity from them is almost the same as from Arigna.  Then, of course, all power would depend on American coal and we would be at the mercy of forces outside the State.  We would, in effect, have lost our independence for a tenth of a penny per unit.  Is that all the country is worth?  Is Arigna to be the next cog in the wheel?</P>
    <P>The most important physical assets of the ESB are their power stations.  The replacement cost of these assets is estimated to be in excess of £6,000 million. The ESB had total net assets of £1,596 million in 1988, funded by borrowings of £1,139 million.  This gives a debt to net assets ratio of 71 per cent.  Moneypoint alone costs over £1,000 million.  It was built partly as an alternative to the promised crow coal powered station at Arigna.  There is sufficient crow coal in Sliabh Iarainn and Arigna to keep a major power station in operation for well <Col N="2054" /> into the 21st century.  This would be home-produced and could be mechanically excavated because the seams are of a sufficient depth.  This crow coal could have been excavated as cheaply as coal from the USA and would have led to upwards of 1,000 jobs in the region.  Also there would be a major tax clawback to the State.  Plans were at an advanced stage but were scrapped for political expediency.  We were told it would be too costly, something in the region of £200 million.  We were told that the process had not been perfected, that it was all just a window-dressing exercise in order to justify the switch.</P>
    <P>The dropping of the crow coal power station constitutes a change of direction in ESB and State policy.  Ireland's peat and native coal reserves were developed for strategic and social purposes to generate electricity for the nation.  It resulted in a more diffused electricity generation pattern than would otherwise have been the case.  The people of this region, and the nation in general, must now depend on outside goodwill and market forces and may suffer as a result.  The dole or emigration will be the only alternatives open to them.  We want to have our resources developed to create employment, allowing the people to live and work in the region.</P>
    <P>The combustible quality of the coal being supplied, taken from a random sample during the months of September, October and December 1989 was as follows: Arigna Colleries &mdash; 64.0 combustibles; Flynn and Lehany &mdash; 66.1 combustibles and Wynne's &mdash; 69.1 combustibles.If we take an average combustibles content, taking into account that Arigna Collieries supply two-thirds of the coal, we find it is 65.8.  The power station needs a combustibles return of 65 per cent to operate at maximum efficiency.  The coal being supplied is sufficiently combustible to ensure that the ESB have verified that the Arigna power station is the fifth most efficient station of their 28 operating power plants.  The coal being supplied to date is as good as the power station needs and is as good a quality as that station has ever used or <Col N="2055" /> needed.  These figures give no indication of a lessening of the quality of coal being supplied within the region.  Also they give no indication that supplies of the local coal are at a crisis point.</P>
    <P>Since the closure announcement on 31 October there was one statement on the part of the Government.  When the Taoiseach was asked about the situation that had arisen he replied that the affair was entirely a matter for the ESB.  We fail to understand how it could be so summarily dismissed in this region.  We can point out very conclusively that it is very much a political matter and that the ultimate fate of the region will be determined by a political decision.</P>
    <P>For social reasons the Government of the day directed the ESB to harness the nation's peat reserves.  The resultant Bord na Móna operations did fulfil this social need very well indeed.  The price of milled peat fired generation ranges from 50 per cent to 150 per cent above the cost of oil-fired generation and is even more substantially above the cost of coalfired generation.  But nobody would doubt its value to the nation and to the regions in which these peat-powered generation stations are located.  They will close only if supplies definitely run out. Even then there are elaborate plans afoot to replace them with equal, or near equal, employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>The Arigna power station also was initiated by the Government of the day for social reasons.  Now it is proposed to close down those mines without any concrete plans to replace them with near equal employment opportunities.  We ask the Minister and the Government if they have forsaken the social policies and aims of the past.  We call on them to address this issue urgently.  I was glad to note from the Minister's remarks that it would appear he is heading in that direction.  I hope it will not be too late.  If they close the Arigna power station they must endeavour to provide the region with alternative employment for some 250 people.  It is difficult to envisage how people &mdash; whose families and grandfathers &mdash; have spent their lives in these <Col N="2056" /> mines could adapt so quickly to the electronic, engineering or plastic industries when one takes into account the level of training and retraining that would be required and the length of time involved.</P>
    <P>This question will require much planning and effort on the part of the Government, the State and semi-State interests in the region.  It is a great pity, when all of this was known, when the closure of the station had been on the cards for so long, that these plans were not put into operation many years ago.  My union, the Irish Transport and General Workers Union, have represented the people of this area well over many years.  On many occasions I remember reports emanating from local district officials about the difficulties these mines were encountering at that time, that is 15 years ago, since when many Governments have come and gone. Yet the position appears to remain almost the same as it was 15 years ago.  Of course, the reason has been that, at the last minutes, some Minister came up with a political plan prior to whatever general or local election was pending, giving them another lease of life.</P>

      <P>I hope they will succeed.  I am sure all Members on both sides of the House, including the Minister, would be only too pleased to be able to report to this House and the constituencies involved in the area of these mines from the next political platform: I was the Minister, or we were the public representatives who saved the jobs of 250 people <Col N="2057" /> in the Arigna mines thereby saving the overall community within that region. The Labour Party will give the Minister and Government every support in their efforts.  In conjunction with the trade unions involved we wish them well. However, I might add that we will watch and question every development.  We will want to know what alternatives will be provided and how they will be funded. We will argue consistenetly that this is a viable proposition taking into account the otherwise financial loss to the region, its effect on small farmers and business people, on downstream suppliers, people indirectly involved in employment in the region who depend on the moneys made from these mines to fund a whole community.</P>
      <P>I will conclude by saying, in the words of Arthur Scargill, &ldquo;how much is a community worth?&rdquo; What value can be put on human resources?  The ESB can put whatever value it wants on the cost of generating electricity, but what value does Dáil Éireann or the Minister or the Government of the day put on the people of that area, the people of Ireland who want to stay at home and work in those mines and in the small busnesses and farms in the area?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to conclude <Col N="2058" /> my remarks on this amendment before the change of business.  There are just a few other comments I want to make in support of it.  The first is that when the Water Pollution Bill was first mooted one of the areas where it was felt that the 1977 Act was deficient was the good defence clause in section 3 of that Act.  In the explanatory memorandum, which was initially circulated with the Bill, it was stated that one of the purposes of the Bill was to provide an amendment to the good defence provision to put a greater onus on the person charged to prove that he could not reasonably have foreseen that his act or omission would have caused pollution.  That change was to alter the wording of the 1977 Act which provided that the person charged took all reasonable care.  The Bill that went through the Seanad, therefore, changed it to &ldquo;could not reasonably have foreseen&rdquo;.  Unfortunately, as this Bill has passed through the Committee Stage of the Dáil, it has reverted virtually to the same set of words that applied in the 1977 Act which were repeatedly found to be unworkable. As far as the good defence clause is concerned, we are back to square one with virtually the same wording as was in the 1977 Act which was found to be unworkable.It was found to be unworkable by the regional fisheries boards to the extent that they did not use it at all and tended to rely mainly on the 1959 Act.  It was found by the local authorities to be unworkable.  We had a debate on Committee Stage about the extension of the good defence provision to the 1959 Act. I have a letter here from one of the fisheries boards which states that if the amendment suggested by the Minister was included it would be impossible to get convictions in a wide range of cases, including cases involving local authorities and farmers, and they give specific instances of these cases and outline how the amendment could make the section ineffective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fairness, the Minister accepted that line of argument as far as the 1959 Act was concerned, and agreed to delete the good defence provision from the 1959 Act.  It seems inconsistent then to leave <Col N="2059" /> the good defence provision in the Water Pollution Bill.  If it has made it difficult for local authorities or regional fisheries boards to be effective in dealing with polluters, then it should be omitted.  My amendment is to repeal the good defence clause that made the 1977 Act ineffective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>We spent a lot of time dealing with this issue on Committee Stage.  I am conscious that there are a number of amendments on the Order Paper to be dealt with within a fairly limited time, so I have no intention of talking at any great length.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter I want the Minister to give us some explanation about relates to the selection of the section relating to fishery Acts.  This was discussed the last day and, as Deputy Gilmore correctly said, it gave rise to some concern on the part of fisheries boards.  I do not want to be unduly technical on this but it deals directly with section 171 of the Fisheries Consolidation Act of 1959 which lays down a particular offence.  At subsection (1) it says that any person who steeps in any waters any flax or hemp &mdash; which has no great relevance any more &mdash; or throws, empties, permits or causes to fall into any waters any deleterious matter shall, unless such act is done under and in accordance with a licence issued by the Minister, be guilty of an offence.  The fisheries boards expressed concern about the defence that would be available expressly under subsection (2) of the Fisheries Acts, or an amended version of that, and the defence available under the Water Pollution Act.  I have a concern about this that I want to put on the record of the House.  On this side of the House we have made two points very clearly all along.  The first is that the legislation we enact must be effective in preventing the problems arising from water pollution.  It must act as a deterrent against people polluting.  It is better that pollution does not happen, but we have to prosecute after the event.  So the offences must be there and the penalties we impose must be severe.  Equally, we have made the point that we do not want to <Col N="2060" /> find that someone can be convicted of conduct that is no fault of theirs.</P>
    <P>I very much take into account the concerns of the fisheries boards.  The IFA and ICSMA have also expressed concern that people may be wrongly convicted.  I do not think there is any substantial evidence of people being wrongly convicted under the Fisheries Act of 1959.  I do not think the Minister has a duty to explain to the House the difference between the offence that will arise and the defence of that alleged offence as it pertains under section 3 of the 1977 Act, as amended by this Bill, and the offence that arises under section 171 of the Fisheries Act, 1959 and the defence that is available there. Deputy Gilmore has said that there is an inconsistency between having an express defence and not having an express defence.  On the other side of the coin there will be a concern that the difference between the two may in fact give rise to some of the concerns that were raised by the IFA and ICMSA being proved valid.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to put on the record of the House the specific differences between the sections.  I do not want to detain the House by giving my own analysis of those differences.  We should be assured that the Department and the Minister are clear as to what the differences are.  Are there specific circumstances in which prosecutions could be brought under the Water Pollution Act, 1977, as amended by this Bill, where prosecutions cannot currently be brought, and will not be able to be brought under the 1959 Fisheries Act?  I want to know how the different provisions with regard to providing a defence in a prosecution will actually apply.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage we asked the Minister to reconsider this matter and she has done so.  We welcome the fact that she has responded to the concerns expressed, but I am anxious that problems are not created on the other side of the coin and that we do not bring about a position where increased fines under the Fisheries Acts could be imposed on people who are not at fault.  I would like an assurance from the Minister that, by deleting in its entirety section 25 (2) and <Col N="2061" /> by not proceeding with the amended version as proposed by the Minister and discussed on Committee Stage, people who are not at fault will not be convicted and have large fines or possible terms of imprisonment imposed on them.  It is important that the matter is clarified and put on the record of the House.</P>

      <P>It is true that under this Bill the good defence <Col N="2062" /> clause in the 1977 Water Pollution Act is being amended rather than dropped entirely, while the good defence clause is being dropped from the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959.  However, the two situations are not identical.</P>
      <P>There has always been a good defence provision in the 1977 Act while there is no such provision in the 1959 fisheries legislation.  The concept of a good defence in the context of the 1977 Act has not been seriously questioned until tonight.  In fact, both Fine Gael &mdash; Deputy Shatter on Committee Stage &mdash; and the Workers' Party &mdash; Deputy Gilmore &mdash; put down amendments on Committee Stage proposing different forms of wording.  This indicates that they, too, support the principle of such a defence under the Water Pollution Act.  It is clear Deputy Garland also supports this principle, as he has proposed an amendment for the defence provision, which he has now withdrawn.  In the circumstances, I am somewhat surprised at Deputy Gilmore's latest amendment which seeks to remove the good defence provision entirely.</P>
      <P>My amendment No. 3 is designed to improve the good defence provision accepted on Committee Stage in respect of the Water Pollution Act, following concerns expressed by some Deputies about aspects of the wording already agreed.  Deputy Gilmore in particular referred to the phrase in that amendment on Committee Stage, &ldquo;having regard to all the circumstances&rdquo;.  He felt it was too wide and could lead to an abuse of the defence provision.  On reflection, I agree with him and that is why I have decided to put down an amendment to remove it.</P>
      <P>There is no evidence that the existence of the good defence clause under the 1977 Act has impeded the implementation of the legislation by local authorities.  The authorities prosecuted in 156 cases in 1987 when fish kills reached their highest ever level &mdash; 122 and in 102 cases in 1988, the latest year for which complete statistics are available &mdash; dropped to 50 that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities, unlike fisheries <Col N="2063" /> boards, have an extensive range of pollution prevention powers available to them and so are not as reliant on prosecutions to deter potential polluters. Almost 1,000 notices were issued by authorities under section 12 of the 1977 Act in 1988.  These require specified measures to be taken to prevent pollution.In addition, advice or warnings were issued in over 12,000 cases following investigations carried out by local authorities.Accordingly, I consider it appropriate to retain a good defence provision in the Water Pollution Act and cannot accept Deputy Gilmore's amendment.</P>
    <P>In relation to the query raised by Deputy Shatter as to what the difference may be, effectively what we are doing in relation to the fisheries legislation is reverting to the <i>status quo.</i> Farmers will be no worse off now in relation to the good defence provisions or lack of them than they were prior to this Bill.  We are leaving the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act intact as far as that is concerned.  The only difference is that penalties in the form of fines and prison sentences are being substantially increased.  The other main difference is that under the Fisheries Act local authorities can be prosecuted.The last day we discussed this matter Deputies brought to my attention the concerns of the fisheries boards &mdash; the first time they had been brought to my attention.  A letter from the fisheries boards arrived some time after that debate.  My officials met with members of the fisheries boards and, on reflection and from listening to their arguments, I felt their case was a reasonable one.  The legislation, as far as they are concerned, has been effective and I see no reason to change it.  The Minister for the Marine suggested that it be changed but following the views expressed by the fisheries boards' officers, the people who implement the legislation, he has agreed to drop the good defence provision from the Fisheries Act.</P>

      <P>In the course of an earlier debate Deputy Bell quoted Arthur Scargill.  Perhaps I will be permitted to <Col N="2064" /> quote Len Murray who had a saying: &ldquo;little fish are sweet.&rdquo; I suppose the Minister's amendment proposing to drop the phrase &ldquo;having regard to all the circumstances&rdquo; is welcome.  The Minister is not correct in stating that I accept there should be a good defence clause in the legislation.  On Committee Stage I specifically stated that there should not be a good defence clause in the legislation but, having regard to the debate that had taken place on Second Stage, I felt an amendment to delete the good defence clause from the 1977 Act would be unlikely to have the support of the House.  I thought an amendment which would at least restore the form of words that was in the Bill as it went through the Seanad might be more likely to succeed, but I regret very much that did not succeed either.</P>
      <P>Hairs are being split here as between the 1959 Act and the 1977 Act in order to justify why there should not be a good defence clause in the 1959 Act but there should continue to remain virtually the same good defence clause in the present legislation as was in the 1977 Act and which was found to be defective.  The deletion of the good defence clause does not in any way diminish the right of people who are prosecuted for polluting from entering a defence in court.  We are either serious about tackling water pollution or we are not.  I am slowly coming to the conclusion, that the more this Bill is amended or watered down and, particularly in this case, the more it goes back to the unsatisfactory state of the 1977 legislation, will not effectively tackle the problem of water pollution. Therefore, I wish the Chair to put my amendment.</P>

      <P>`(5)  The Minister may, after consultation with any other Minister who, having regard to his function, he considers ought to be consulted, by regulation make exemptions from subsection (1) and attach conditions to and restrict such exemptions.</P>
      <P>(6) Where it is proposed to make regulations under subsection (5), a draft of each such regulation shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, and the regulations shall not be made until a motion approving of the draft has been passed by each House.'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I expressed some satisfaction earlier that the Minister had taken on board a suggestion made on Committee Stage.  I have to express some regret on this occasion. While she gave an indication on Committee Stage that she would consider the question of exemptions, she has not given any concession on the issue.  I have put down the same amendment that I withdrew on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 of the 1977 Act lists pieces of legislation which are exempt from the provisions of that Act regarding water pollution.  We dealt with this in some detail on the last occasion and instanced section 27 of the Turf Development Act, 1946, which a number of people have referred to.  I have here a letter from the Ballina and Cloghans Anglers Association concerning the problem that section 27 has given rise to in Lough Conn, an <Col N="2066" /> area in which the Minister for the Environment would have an interest.  The latter states:</P>
    <P>We have already been in communication with the North Western Fishery Board and we understand that they are in discussion with Bord na Móna.  As the level of the lake falls the silt is becoming more obvious and our members find the amount carried down into Lough Conn by the winter floods to be very much greater than anticipated.In addition to causing damage by polluting the lake itself, the silt is recognised to be extremely harmful to salmon and trout spawning redds.  We are told that the North Western Fishery Boards have proved, to the satisfaction of all concerned including Bord na Móna, that extensive losses of spawn and eyed ova have already occurred.  Although, as we are aware, discussions are taking place, there appears to be no progress and Bord na Móna continue to harvest peat on their property, draining into the Deel system without taking any steps to prevent the silt getting into the river and ultimately to Lough Conn.</P>
    <P>The letter goes on to explain that the problem in dealing with this matter is largely due to the exemption provided in section 27 of the Turf Development Act.</P>
    <P>The same problem is identified in the Environment Action Programme, which I have great interest in reading.  On page 5 peat silt is identified as a problem and it states that silt run-off from intensive peat development is having adverse effects on inland and coastal waters in a number of areas.  It goes on to say that the Water Pollution Bill will enable the Minister for the Environment to introduce a package of controls over such development.  Nevertheless the 1977 Act as it stands exempts section 27 of the Turf Development Act from the ambit of the legislation.</P>
    <P>The same problem arises in relation to section 6 of the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949 which enables local authorities to deal with emergencies such as storm damage.  If there is a heavy flood <Col N="2067" /> the local authority could be exempted under section 6 of that Act from the provisions of the Fisheries Acts.  I have correspondence from one of the regional fisheries boards which states that more and more local authorities are using the defence provided by section 6 of the 1949 Act in order to avoid prosecution or in the course of prosecution.  A growing number of local authorities are being prosecuted by regional boards for pollution and the defence they offer is that the works are of such an emergency nature that they came under the 1949 Act.  The same kind of argument applies to the other pieces of legislation.  The Foreshore Act, for example, would enable infill of any kind of material to be used; even ashes are identified in the Act as a material which is appropriate for infill and is exempt from the terms of the Fisheries Acts and the 1977 Water Pollution Act.</P>
    <P>I felt that the Minister was reasonably sympathetic on Committee Stage to the possibility of removing at least some of the exemptions.  I am disappointed that she has not made any concession in that area.  My amendment would allow the Minister to introduce exemptions by way of regulation if they were found to be necessary in an emergency and these regulations would be passed by the Oireachtas.  Therefore it would still be possible to allow for exemptions if a case could be made.  In enacting modern legislation it is not appropriate to take on board the baggage we have inherited from the 1977 Act, which exempts sections of legislation going back to the early years of this State when the degree of awareness, knowledge and scientific evidence about the extent of water pollution did not exist.  Indeed the problems that give rise to water pollution were not there in 1925 when the electricity legislation was passed.  It is not appropriate in 1990, when dealing with modern pollution problems, that we should be saddled with exemptions which come from an age when current problems were not seen or anticipated.  I am proposing that the exemptions be deleted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated by Deputy Gilmore, he is seeking to achieve a situation where all exemptions to the offence of causing water pollution would be terminated while provision would be made for the Minister to prescribe certain exemptions under regulations which would incorporate controls to protect the environment.  Essentially the amendment would reverse the position provided for in the 1977 Water Pollution Act and in this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Deputy had an identical amendment on Committee Stage which was debated at some length.  As I stated then, the amendment, if adopted, would lead to a number of undesirable consequences.First, it would render all licensed trade effluents subject to prosecution under section 3 thus removing any incentive for industry to comply with the licensing provisions of the Act. Second, it would extend the ambit of the Act to waters outside the functional area of local authorities and to discharges which are already adequately catered for and controlled by the various Acts referred to in section 3.  I believe that the approach adopted in the amendment is incorrect in that it would take the axe to exemptions that have not given rise to problems generally and indeed are necessary for the orderly operation of an effective régime of water pollution control.</P>
      <P>I think it is important to recognise the distinction that exists between the exemptions allowed under subsection (5) and those catered for under subsection (6) of section 3 of the 1977 Act.  The activities covered by the former are either caught by the controls under other sections of the 1977 Water Pollution Act &mdash; as, for example, is the case in relation to trade effluent discharges which are required to be licensed under section 4 &mdash; or under other legislation, such as the Fisheries Acts and the Harbour Act, 1946, or the activities take place in areas such as the foreshore which are outside the functional area of local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2069" /> The pollution of tidal waters by any matter discharged from, or dumped by, vessels is also listed among the exemptions allowed under subsection (5).  Such activities are subject to control by the Minister for the Marine, under legislation such as the Oil Pollution of the Sea Acts and the Dumping at Sea Act.  The control regime in this area will be improved under the Minister for the Marine's proposed Sea Pollution Bill to be discussed in this House later this week.  The exemptions in respect of vessels, the foreshore and harbours are essentially intended to avoid duplication of controls under the specific legislation dealing with each of these matters and under the more general Water Pollution Act.  The various exemptions allowed under subsection (6) restate exemptions provided under earlier legislation in respect of the Fisheries Acts. These exemptions follow a similar pattern in that the Minister for the Marine may require the particular body concerned to take such precautions as he considers adequate to protect fisheries when executing certain works.  The works may include the execution of schemes by the Electricity Supply Board, or drainage schemes by the Office of Public Works, the production of peat by Bord na Móna or a range of activities by local authorities, including the making of drains, the removal of obstructions in water courses, the widening or deepening of water courses, the diversion of water and the construction or repair of walls or embankments.</P>
    <P>Clearly these works may be carried out on an extensive scale and in view of their nature it would not be practical to expect that they could be executed always without some material entering waters which could have adverse effects on quality, fish life or other users.  Similarly, they would not, in all cases, be amenable to the kind of control regime available under the licensing system for fixed point effluent discharges as operated under section 4 of the Water Pollution Act.</P>
    <P>After this legislation is passed I will be conducting an in-depth review of all exemptions to see to what extent, if any, they could be repealed and, in particular, <Col N="2070" /> how a higher level of environmental protection could be achieved by the imposition of restrictions or conditions appropriate to the particular works and activities.  Priority will be given to the review of the situation in relation to Bord na Móna developments which are a cause of great concern in a number of areas. Account will be taken of the findings of a special study currently under way for the environmental research unit of my Department on a possible link between organic substances originating from developed bogs and nutrients which give rise to eutrophication problems in fresh waters.  I believe that exemptions should remain only where they are absolutely essential for the provision of public utilities and, where such exemptions exist, the works should be carried out under the direction and guidance of the proposed environmental protection agency.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point made by Deputy Gilmore, there is only one case to my knowledge where the fisheries board have prosecuted for works carried out under the Local Authorities Works Act, 1949, and in that case they were not successful.They took a case in relation to works that were being carried out on a reservoir at the Dodder River, but the court found that the works were essential in the interest of safety and that they had to be carried out on an emergency basis and in the manner in which they were carried out.  It was not possible to secure a conviction in that case.  We have to ensure that we do not restrict either local authorities or other State agencies from providing essential public utilities in the interest of the common good but at the same time, when those works have to be carried out under exemption, they should be done in a specified manner and in accordance with the highest possible environmental protection standards.</P>
    <P>Following the implementation of this Act, which will give me power to review these exemptions, I propose to review them all and to repeal or limit them where it is found necessary and where they remain to ensure that works be carried <Col N="2071" /> out in accordance with the highest standards as laid down, perhaps, by the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, let me refer to the Government's bible on the environment, <i>An Environmental Action Programme</i> which states on page 2:</P>
      <P>..... the principle of precautionary action even where there is no definitive scientific evidence to link emissions or discharges with detrimental environmental effects;</P>
      <P>is to be one of the three guiding principles of the Government in relation to the environment.</P>
      <P>As I understand the precautionary principle, it would certainly mean that this fairly lengthy list of exemptions would be excluded and that the problems the Minister referred to would be tackled in the way I have suggested in my amendment &mdash; in other words, the case for exemption would have to be made in the first place rather than the other way round.  It would appear to me that, as far as the legislation is concerned, at the first test the precautionary principle is far from the mind of the Government.</P>
      <P>Second, I was not referring to an individual case or group of cases which were taken against local authorities under the Public Works Act, 1949, but I was saying that when regional fisheries boards in the normal course of their functions prosecute a local authority, increasingly the local authority are entering the defence that they were carrying out works under the 1949 Act and, therefore, are exempt from the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Third, I find it strange that the Minister on the one hand seems to be accepting the principle that it is not appropriate to have a long list of exemptions from the 1977 Act and from this new legislation and that she will review them to see which have to be repealed.  However, the repeal of an exemption, if they are left in legislation, will require another Bill to be brought before this House.  I see the Minister shaking her head but if it is to be done by way of regulation we have an <Col N="2072" /> unhappy experience that regulations that are intended to be introduced after the passage of legislation take a very long time to come into effect.  It has taken this legislation the best part of 18 months to get this far and it will be longer before it is enacted.  Then, we will have to wait a further long period before regulations are brought in.  We have the problem whether the exemptions should remain but my argument is that exemptions should go and, it there is a case for exemption, the Minister can bring in a regulation and put it before the House to justify that case; otherwise we will end up with seven or eight very serious exemptions to the water pollution legislation &mdash; exemptions which have demonstrably shown they have caused difficulty in the enforcement of water pollution legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 46 and 47, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4.&mdash;Subsection (3) of section 4 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the substitution for paragraph (b) of the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>`(b) In considering whether or not to grant a licence under this section and in considering the terms of any such licence a local authority shall have regard to the objectives contained in any relevant plan under section 15.  It shall also base its assimilative capacity estimates on a seven day sustained low flow criterion.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reintroducing this amendment on Report Stage I want to comment further on the response I received from the Minister on Committee Stage.  She seemed concerned that my amendment would impose obligations on local authorities, <Col N="2073" /> when EC Directive SI 293 of 1988, EC Standards, already imposes such an obligation.All local authorities and An Bord Pleanála seem to accept the 95 per cent flow criterion which the Green Party finds unacceptable due to our experience in dealing with pollution problems &mdash; for example, the pollution caused by Kerry Co-op to the River Feale over a period of 15 years.  The 95 per cent flow criterion takes no account of the fact that drought periods have been known to last for months and that rivers are particularly sensitive at the lowest flows during these drought periods.</P>
    <P>If the Minister's words &mdash; and I quote &ldquo;I share the Deputy's concern&rdquo;&mdash; are to be meaningful, she would impose a seven day flow criterion in the Bill as a substitute for the present informal rule of 95 per cent.  Such a change would be supported by environmentalists, fishery officers and many authorities.  I believe some authorities in the United Kingdom have switched to this criterion, and since we follow the UK in using the 95 per cent flow, we should once again follow the leader, sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister complained that this amendment would impose the uniform approach and could cause difficulties with dangerous substances.I see nothing in the current legal framework which is any better.  All we hear about are fish kills and PCBs, so much for our Green Presidency.  As it is, EC Directive SI 293 and the 95 per cent flow criterion are the <i>de facto</i> uniform criteria and we should improve on them. There is nothing to prevent anyone dissatisfied with the outcome appealing to An Bord Pleanála but we must also ensure that rivers are protected at all times.</P>
    <P>My understanding of the word &ldquo;waters&rdquo; as defined in the 1977 Act, does not include the sea, which the Minister included in arguments against my amendment on Committee Stage.  I cannot think of any inland water where this criterion should not apply since we must protect all waters.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the seven day low flow criterion is not amenable to <Col N="2074" /> legislative solution but suggested that a new legal body &mdash; the much awaited EPA &mdash; could take care of it.  We heard all sorts of promises about this Bill, now hollow in the light of the Government's amendments and we will have to wait for the EPA.  I am advised that this Bill could perfectly well set this standard without waiting for the EPA.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 4 (3) (b) of the 1977 Act already requires a local authority to have regard to the objectives contained in any relevant water quality management plan made under section 15 when considering whether to grant an effluent discharge licence.  As the attachment of conditions to a licence is an integral part of the process of granting a licence, I consider that Deputy Garland's point in this regard is already adequately catered for.</P>
      <P>The amendment also seeks to impose an absolute obligation on local authorities to set licence conditions based on the receiving water's assimilative capacity as determined on a seven day sustained low flow.  Such an obligation would interfere with the basic powers extended under the 1977 Act to local authorities to determine the conditions attached to discharge licences.  These decisions should be based on all circumstances relevant to the particular licence application and the conditions imposed should seek to safeguard water quality and the legitimate uses of the waters concerned.  Should any party consider that the conditions are inadequate they may appeal them to An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The adoption of the uniform approach put forward in this amendment would be most inappropriate where particularly dangerous substances are contained in an effluent discharge.  Licence conditions in such situations should seek to reduce and, as far as possible, eliminate such substances from the effluent &mdash; the concept of tackling pollution at source &mdash; rather than limit discharges based on the assimilative capacity approach.  The latter would provide a much poorer level of environmental protection.  There would <Col N="2075" /> also be situations in which the seven day low flow criteria would not apply, for example, where discharges are made to estuaries or to the sea.</P>
    <P>I would refer Deputy Garland to the definition of &ldquo;waters&rdquo; in the 1977 Act which does include estuarial and tidal waters.  Section 1 of that Act states &ldquo;tidal waters' includes the sea and any estuary up to high water mark medium tide and any enclosed dock adjoining tidal waters&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the issue which the Deputy seeks to address is amenable to a legislative solution involving a rigid, uniform approach.  Local authorities must continue to be allowed to determine licence conditions taking account of all circumstances relevant to the particular licence application.  I regret I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the Minister, I believe in tackling pollution at source. This amendment is not about tackling pollution at source; it is about measuring and determining the condition of rivers at all times which will show if there have been any serious effluent discharges.  I cannot accept the Minister's facile dismissal of my proposal for the seven day sustained flow system.  This would give a much better measure of the condition of a river than the usual criterion, the 95 per cent flow.  For that reason, I am pressing my amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment relates to section 6 of the Principal Act which deals with regulations for the purpose of sections 4 and 8 of that Act.  Section 4 of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, deals with licences for the discharge of trade or sewage effluent into waters and section 8 provides for appeals against <Col N="2076" /> these licences.  Amendment No. 6 proposes the substitution of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in section 4 (2A) of the Bill so that it would read &ldquo;Regulations under this section shall make provision for...&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister showed some acceptance of this amendment and said she would consider it between then and Report Stage.  The Labour Party believe section 4 needs to be strengthened because it deals with the payment to a local authority of a fee of such amount as may be specified in respect of an application to them for a licence under section 4 and the payment to An Bord Pleanála of a fee of such amount as may be specified in respect of an appeal to them under section 8.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's comments on this amendment.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage I indicated that I would have the proposal examined in advance of Report Stage.  This has been done in the interim.  I am advised that this amendment would be inappropriate as the new subsection in question will be governed by the provisions of section 6 (1) of the 1977 Act which indicates that the Minister may make regulations for certain purposes.  In view of the range of matters which may be the subject of regulations as already provided for in the Principal Act, I am satisfied that the proper course to adopt is to retain the general enabling powers set out in section 6 (1) at present.  In these circumstances it would not make sense to specify an obligation to make regulations by using the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in a later subsection of the same section.  I intend, accordingly, to retain the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies may be assured that it is my intention to avail of the new powers to prescribe fees for licence applications to <Col N="2077" /> discharge effluents and so enable local authorities offset at least some of their costs in processing such applications.  Section 4 of the Bill, which is the subject of this amendment, also restates existing powers to charge fees for appeals to An Bord Pleanála against the decisions of local authorities on licence applications. Again, I intend to use these powers to review and, as appropriate, revise the fees which are payable at present for such appeals.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(iii)  in case an appeal or appeals is or are brought against it and the appeal or appeals is or are withdrawn&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(I)  if the period referred to in paragraph (a) has expired, upon such withdrawal, and</P>
      <P>(II)  if the period aforesaid has not expired, upon its expiry.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a minor drafting change which is intended to clarify exactly when the decision of a local authority on an application for an effluent discharge licence under section 4 of the 1977 Act will take effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present text of the Bill is unsatisfactory.It makes provision for situations in which appeals are withdrawn and the one month period allowed for appeals <Col N="2078" /> has expired.  However, there is no provision for the situation which could arise where appeals are withdrawn before the expiry of the one month period with the possibility of further appeals being lodged within the permitted deadline. The amendment will correct this obvious oversight in the drafting of the Bill.</P>

      <P>We now move to amendment No. 8 in the names of Deputies Quinn and O'Shea.  I note that amendments Nos. 8, 18, 22, 25, 28, 30, 33, 34, 36, 38 and 40 form a composite proposal and it is proposed therefore, with the agreement of the House; to take those amendments together for discussion purposes.  Agreed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 9, line 36, after &ldquo;fine&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;exceeding £250 but&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There is a basic principle underlying those amendments, that the concept of a minimum fine would be introduced on the basis that, on summary conviction, 25 per cent of the maximum fine would be the minimum fine implemented and, on conviction on an indictment, that the amount of the fine would be 10 per cent of the maximum fine.  The problem I want to see solved is that created by the imposition of trival fines by the courts for serious pollution offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage I instanced three court cases in my constituency.  In one case there was a prosecution for the discharge of toxic effluent into a bay which turned out to be as high as one thousand times the permitted discharge.  There were two separate convictions by the court and the paltry fines of £50 and £100 were imposed.  Subsequently, animal blood was discharged into the Clodagh River which supplies the east Waterford water scheme which in turn supplies water to Waterford city and a number of large towns in the eastern part of Waterford.Animal blood contains virus and, therefore, the treatment which the water <Col N="2079" /> would receive at the east Waterford treatment plant would not have any effect on the virus.  If that virus had got into the water system it could have had horrendous effects on public health.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go off on a tangent and give too many details about those cases but I must point out that, on conviction in that case, a fine of £100 was imposed by the court.  When environmental officers of local authorities succeed in obtaining convictions in court &mdash; in this regard I welcome the provision for the payment of compensation to local authorities &mdash; they must feel vindicated by the amount of the fine imposed by the court.  The fines imposed in the cases I have referred to were insulting to the public and those who brought the prosecutions.I realise that there are problems as outlined by the Minister on Committee Stage, in regard to the legality of minimum fines.  The courts should impose fines appropriate to the offences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of these amendments is to make provision in the Bill for minimum fines.  Since the last debate I have consulted with the Attorney General who has strongly advised against a provision for minimum fines.  He has emphasised that such a provision would result in an unwarranted interference with the discretion of the Judiciary to deal with each case on its merits.  He has expressed the view that such a provision could prove counter-productive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that Deputies O'Shea and Quinn are seeking to give more teeth to the legislation and that their objective is to ensure that the new penalties being provided for in the Bill act as a real deterrent to pollution.  While I sympathise with their objectives I am concerned that their suggested approach could have the opposite effect to that intended.  Apart from the interference aspect I have already mentioned, I believe that justices would be more reluctant to convict defendants when faced with the prospect of having to impose a certain mandatory <Col N="2080" /> level of fine where the special circumstances of the case or the efforts of the defendant to prevent pollution merit some recognition.</P>
    <P>In the event of an individual being charged with a similar offence on another occasion, in the absence of a conviction in respect of the earlier offence, it would be dealt with by the courts as a first offence.  The willingness of the court to convict given the obligation to impose a minimum fine would once again arise. Even if the decision was to convict there is every likelihood that the minimum fine would be imposed.</P>
    <P>On the other hand if the courts did not feel constrained by the existence of a minimum fine there would be a greater prospect of a guilty verdict on the initial prosecution.  Should a similar offence be committed a second time the courts would be inclined to take a more serious view of the situation and would be likely to impose a heavy penalty in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>In the case of successful prosecutions the Bill also provides for the payment by the guilty party of the costs and expenses incurred by the local authority in taking the case, including the costs of water sampling, analysis and the remuneration of employees, consultants and advisers. There is also explicit provision for measures to be taken to mitigate or remedy the effects of pollution, again at the expense of the guilty party.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that these provisions constitute a real deterrent and, when taken together, will involve a greater financial burden on polluters than would be achieved simply by providing for a minimum level of fine.  I also believe that the increase in environmental concern and awareness in the country will reflect in the decisions of the Judiciary.  From now on there will be an inclination on their part to impose higher fines than was the case in the examples given by Deputy O'Shea.  It is because of the advice of the Attorney General that I cannot accept the amendments.</P>

Obviously, legal <Col N="2081" /> advice is against these amendments but I hope it will go out loud and clear from the Department of the Environment that trivial fines are no longer acceptable and that fines appropriate to the offence will be implemented.  On the basis of the Minister's remarks, I withdraw the amendment.</P>

I suggest, therefore, that we discuss them together, by agreement, although a separate decision will be required in regard to each.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 9, line 36, to delete &ldquo;£1,000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£2,500&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are coming to the end of the debate on the Water Pollution Bill, as I understand it will conclude at 10 p.m.  This is probably as good a time as any to take stock of its provisions because there are claims being made in respect of this Bill which it does not warrant.  For example, in all the public relations hype about this Bill, we were told that there will be very big fines imposed on water polluters of up to £25,000.  However, the reality is very different.  A fine of £25,000 will apply only to cases taken on indictment.  To the best of my knowledge since the 1977 Bill became law in 1978 there has not been a case taken on indictment.  The reason is that cases which were referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions were returned on the grounds of the defence provisions of the Water Pollution Act, 1977.  Much to my regret, it has now just been decided by the House that those defence provisions will fundamentally remain in the present legislation.  Consequently, the fears of potential polluters that every time they break the law they could be fined £25,000 are groundless. Therefore, this legislation will be relying <Col N="2082" /> on the normal prosecutions pursued by local authorities or fisheries boards.  Given the kind of damage that water pollution causes &mdash; and everything that has been said in this House about water pollution &mdash; the maximum fine of £1,000 is unacceptably low and should be increased to £2,500.</P>
    <P>The kind of situation to which Deputy O'Shea referred in his earlier amendment where derisory fines were imposed, is because the signal to the courts is that, while the maximum fine is £1,000, the courts are free to impose a much lower fine and do in practice.  The very least this House can do is to increase the minimum fine to £2,500.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should also like that to be the case.  Deputy Gilmore is seeking to increase the maximum fine on summary conviction from £1,000 to £2,500.  I recall that Deputy Shatter speculated that such a maximum might be in order during Committee Stage debate.  Since then I have consulted the Attorney General on the matter.  He has advised that it is the policy of his office from time to time to fix a &ldquo;maximum&rdquo; level of fines for summary offences which, based on certain Supreme Court judgments, it is possible to say with safety do not infringe the constitutional requirement that only minor offences be tried summarily.  The sum is calculated on the basis that there are judicial decisions that a penalty of £100 in 1960 did not take an offence out of the minor category.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General has drawn a distinction between the level of fines on summary conviction and awards made in civil cases.  He advises that in civil cases the Constitution permits the District Court to be conferred with &ldquo;local and limited&rdquo; jurisdiction, which need not necessarily be of a minor nature.  In criminal cases, however, only &ldquo;minor&rdquo; offences may be tried summarily.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General concludes that there is clear legal authority to support the view that a penalty of £1,000 constitutes an offence as minor, but once one goes above that figures one enters the realms of speculation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2083" /> In the circumstances I am satisfied that the proper course to adopt is to leave the maximum penalty on summary conviction at £1,000 as provided for in the Bill and I must reject Deputy Gilmore's amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I suspected &mdash; and expected &mdash; that the Minister would come back with that reply from the Attorney General's Office.  I am always a little sceptical of some of the advice given by the Attorney General's Office in these matters but I appreciate that the Minister is bound by it.</P>
      <P>As I said in support of Deputy Gilmore on Committee Stage, a fine of £2,500 would come within the area of the &ldquo;minor offence&rdquo; provisions as they apply to the District Court.  Nevertheless, I am as anxious as the Attorney General to err on the side of caution.  We do not want to create a situation where the section is constitutionally challenged and, as a result, a number of sections are inoperable.If this amendment cannot be accepted I urge the Minister to take whatever action is necessary and to advise fisheries boards and local authorities that, where there are serious incidents of pollution, they should not, for ease of application, resort to the District Court in cases which would more appropriately be dealt with on indictment.</P>
      <P>This Bill will only work as an Act with regard to serious incidents of pollution if it is seen that the agencies acting on behalf of the State are willing to bring prosecutions on indictment to bring about an imposition, where appropriate, of the maximum penalties which can be imposed.  The trend up to now has been that normally these cases are dealt with in the District Court but this should be changed.  I suggest to the Minister that prosecutions in the District Court should only be brought in extremely minor cases. It should be the practice that, normally, prosecutions are brought on indictment and that it is the exception to bring them to the District Court as minor offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Minister to enshrine this in any guidelines sent to local authorities or <Col N="2084" /> fisheries boards.  I hope that, if a serious incident of pollution takes place when the Bill becomes operative, prosecutions on indictment will be successfully brought. On this side of the House we will be watching very closely to see what prosecutions are brought on indictment. We will be tabling Dáil questions on an annual basis to the Minister seeking information as to the number of prosecutions brought on indictment, the number brought by way of summary procedure, the results of those prosecutions and the sentences or penalties imposed when they are successful.</P>

      <P>I fully accept Deputy Shatter's good suggestion and I will put it into practice.  I reiterate that I regret we cannot increase the fine.  It was my wish to do so and my officials consulted very widely and wisely with the Attorney General but it just was not possible and I am bound to accept his advice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two points.  The first is that the agency who are charged with the responsibility of enforcing this legislation will themselves wish to take cases on indictment.  The difficulty that arises is that the legislation such as it is will not enable them to do so for the reasons I mentioned.  I very much fear that the defence clause which remains in the Bill will render it as impossible for the agencies to take cases on indictment as the 1977 Act did.</P>
      <P>Secondly, like Deputy Shatter, I am not surprised at the Minister's reply to the amendment.  We got a similar reply to a similar amendment during the course of the debate on the Derelict Sites Bill.  I have not available to me the kind of legal advice that is available to the Minister.  If she says it is not possible to do this legally, then I take her word for it and I withdraw the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>We now proceed to deal with amendment No. 12 in the name of the same Deputy, Eamon Gilmore.I observe that amendments Nos. 13, 14 and 15 are related.  I am suggesting, therefore, that we discuss amendments Nos. 12, 13, 14 and 15 together.  Is that satisfactory.  It is agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 13, between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  by the substitution of the following subsection for subsection (1):</P>
      <P>`(1)  Each local authority shall make a water quality management plan for any waters situated in its functional area or which adjoin that area.',&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Again we had a debate on this issue on Committee Stage and I do not wish to repeat chapter and verse the entire debate.  This centres on whether each local authority should be obliged to make a water quality management plan or whether it should be left largely to the discretion of the local authority as to whether they do so and the only circumstances in which they would be required to do so would be where they would be directed by the Minister to make a water quality management plan. I know we differed on Committee Stage as to the exact number of water quality management plans that had been made. If my recollection is correct it was five, but it is certainly very few in the 13 years since the enactment of the 1977 Act.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have a multitude of functions.  They operate under a very large number of pieces of legislation.  The things they are required to do by law by and large they make every effort to do although, given the constraints on local authorities with regard to staffing and finances in recent years, they are finding it increasingly difficult to comply and to do the things they are required to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2086" /> That means in practice that functions which are given to local authorities and which they may or may not do tend to fall by the board.  My fear is that unless local authorities are required to make water quality management plans they will not do so and the evidence is that they do not do so.  It is 13 years now since the enactment of the 1977 legislation where local authorities had the discretion as to whether to make water quality management plans.  They have not done so. The time has come to change that to ensure that local authorities make water quality management plans, that they are required to do so, that the question of water quality is taken seriously by local authorities and is given priority.</P>
    <P>Given that the legislation we are now enacting is weak and feeble the very least that can be done at this late stage is to put a requirement on local authorities to make water quality management plans so that at least we get within the next few years local authorities making those plans.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak about amendment No. 15 in my name which provides that the local authority shall prepare plans within one year of being directed so to do by the Minister.  When this was dealt with on Committee Stage the Minister stated that there were only seven plans available.  That was in March. It would be interesting if she could let us know this evening whether, three and a half months later, any further plans have emerged.  She stated that further plans were in the course of preparation, some at an advanced stage.  I would appreciate if she could tell us whether any progress is being made in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It strikes me that if the best part of my amendment and the best part of Deputy Gilmore's amendment No. 12 were put together we would have a very good amendment.  I support Deputy Gilmore totally in that the local authorities should be required to produce a water quality management plan.  The difficulty is that he does not put a time limit on it.  I suggest even at this late stage that the Minister <Col N="2087" /> could accept Deputy Gilmore's amendment which is very simple and very carefully worked out, with the addition of the words &ldquo; within one year of the enactment of this Bill&rdquo;.  It is ridiculous that these things drag on for years.  One year or maybe 18 months would be a reasonable period.  Some reasonable period must be imposed.  These water quality management plans must be produced mandatorily by the local authorities.  There has been too much lead-swinging over the years and too much water has run under the bridge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments in the names of Deputies Garland and Gilmore are similar in nature.  They would in my view impose impossible demands on local authorities and result in the preparation of unnecessary water quality management plans.</P>
      <P>The preparation of a water quality management plan is a complex process involving the consultation of numerous organisations and the carrying out of extensive and detailed research over long periods so that variations in flows, inputs and conditions generally are fully observed.  Were local authorities obliged to prepare plans within one year of being directed to do so by the Minister, as Deputy Garland's amendment would require, such plans would inevitably be based on inadequate research and consultation.In many cases the plans produced would be worse than no plans at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments also seek to commit local authorities to preparing management plans for all the waters in their functional areas.  This would commit local authorities to preparing plans in respect of waters which are in no way threatened by pollution or likely in the foreseeable future to be the subject of development.  It is essential that the resources of local authorities be targeted at problems of the highest priority.  Time spent on preparing a water quality management plan for low risk waters may entail time lost in tackling serious pollution problems in other waters in the <Col N="2088" /> authority's area.  Deputies must realise that we have 12,000 kilometres of water in the country.  It is for the same reason that I cannot accept another of Deputy Gilmore's amendments which seeks to place an obligation on local authorities to revise their water quality management plans at least once every five years.  Such a rigid approach would lead to much time being spent by local authority personnel on unnecessary work in revising plans which are not in need of revision.  Section 15 (8) (b) of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, empowers the Minister to require a local authority to revise a plan in relation to matters and in a manner specified by him and at such intervals as he may direct.  This provision enables the Minister to ensure that plans are revised where revision is clearly necessary and the local authority has failed to do so.  This to my mind is a far more sensible arrangement than the institution of an inflexible and potentially wasteful obligatory revision period.</P>
    <P>Deputies asked about the current situation in relation to water quality management plans.  The situation has not changed much since March.  We still have seven plans in place in relation to the Barrow, the Nore, the Suir, the Moy, Bantry Bay, the Munster Blackwater and the Cavan catchments.  The situation in relation to the Shannon has advanced a lot since March.  The plans for the upper Shannon and for the Shannon Estuary are currently on display and a plan in relation to the point between the Estuary and the upper Shannon will shortly be put on display.</P>
    <P>It is important that local authority resources are effectively spent.  It is neither feasible not desirable to waste local authority resources on preparing water quality management plans for water which will not be the subject of pollution or development in the foreseeable future. I would add that the proposed environmental protection agency will take over the role of co-ordination between the various authorities for the preparation and arranging of water quality management plans, which will ensure that the <Col N="2089" /> resources are targeted to the areas where the greatest priority lies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be a bit unrealistic to expect that water quality management plans could be prepared within a year of the enactment of the legislation.  I say this from my own experience of the slow pace at which local authorities often do their business, for example, their slow pace in making and reviewing development plans with regard to land use.</P>
      <P>I am fascinated by the Minister's reply to the amendments because her logic suggests that there is no point in having a provision in the legislation that local authorities can make water quality management plans.  The Minister effectively says that the making of a water quality management plan is too time-consuming for local authorities to engage in, that it is not a priority for local authorities, and that the only time local authorities should make a water quality management plan is when a water course is threatened by pollution.  Indeed, in the cases of the rivers and lakes the Minister has identified where water quality management plans have been made, it has been a case of the plan being made after the problem has arisen.  Taking the Cavan catchment area, it is a bit late in the day to make water quality management plans after some of the lakes and rivers in Cavan have been badly polluted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time to make a water quality management plan is before rivers have been polluted.  The guiding principle of the Government in relation to the environment should be a precautionary principle, a principle which says that one takes actions and makes plans before the pollution occurs.  One should make a plan to prevent pollution occurring rather than wait until there is an immediate threat and a storm of public outrage after a major spill or discharge into a waterway, and after a hue and cry that something must be done, the Minister announces to a great fanfare that she is directing the local authority to make a water quality management plan.  That is shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted.  The time to make such a plan <Col N="2090" /> is before the pollution occurs so that the local authority can, for example, know how to respond to applications for licences and so on.  What I am proposing for water is similar to what exists for land use &mdash; the making of a plan and its revision hopefully every five years.  That is the very least that is required.  The logic of the Minister's position suggests that there is no point in local authorities making these plans, but if that is the case why is there provision in the legislation for water quality management plans?</P>
    <P>What the Minister has said is a very interesting giveaway of the Government's thinking in relation to water pollution.  I am coming to the conclusion that the legislation we are debating here is nothing more than rhetoric, a pretence at dealing with the problems of water pollution.  If anything, this Bill may make the situation worse.  We have the abolition of the water pollution advisory council and the reimposition of the 1977 wording of the good defence clause, and now a situation where the making of water quality management plans is left to the discretion of local authorities.  In the 13 years since the 1977 Act only seven water quality management plans have been made and there is no sign of any further plans.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I express my gratitude to you at the outset for your courtesy in allowing me to raise on the Adjournment this very important matter of the failure of the Minister for Social Welfare to provide adequately for dental treatment for insured workers and their spouses, particularly in my constituency of Wexford.</P>
      <P>My initial interest in this matter arose when a constituent contacted me regarding his frustration in not being able to receive full dental treatment, as promised, due to the dispute between the Minister for Social Welfare and the Irish Dental Association.  He was gravely concerned that as he had become unemployed, his entitlement from PRSI contributions would have been exhausted before the dental treatment he required was made available to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I contacted the Department of Social Welfare initially on this matter in September last.  At that time I was assured that only a few dentists had withdrawn from the social welfare scheme.  Armed with that information I advised my constituent to contact another panel dentist in County Wexford in order to get the attention he needed from him.  Indeed I supplied him with a list of panel dentists I had received from the Department.  My constituent contacted each of the listed dentists and received a variety of replies; he was very assiduous in going from one to another.  The first dentist he contacted was very forthcoming in his comments, <Col N="2095" /> indicating that most dentists do curtail treatment, including the provision of dentures, for PRSI patients.  He went to a second dentist who examined my constituent, recomended fillings and informed him that the supply of dentures was excluded from the treatment afforded to PRSI patients.  My constituent also told me that there was a sign in that panel dentist's waiting room indicating that there were exclusions in respect of the treatment provided for insured workers. Off went my constituent to yet a third dentist.  The third dentist stated that he would treat my constituent for fillings but would not provide dentures under the PRSI scheme.  My constituent arrived back to me.</P>
    <P>I tabled a parliamentary question in March of this year asking the Minister for Social Welfare &mdash; in relation to a person in County Wexford &mdash; who ceased insurable employment in August 1988 and was unable during all of 1989 to obtain assistance towards the cost of dentures under the social welfare dental benefit scheme owing to the dispute between dentists and the Minister's Department, if he would ensure that the person concerned was given an opportunity to obtain the required dental benefits when the dispute with the dentists ceases.  At that stage I assumed that the end of the dispute was in sight.  I received a reply by letter, signed by an executive officer of the Minister's Department, stating that my constituent qualified for dental benefit on the basis of his present insurance contributions, that the Department would pay the relevant portion of the cost of dentures.  An enclosure accompanied that letter listing the dentists operating the scheme in the Wexford area.  Again, my constituent toddled off to the dentists listed and found none in Wexford to provide the treatment he required.</P>
    <P>I tabled a further parliamentary question to the Minister for Social Welfare on 12 June last as follows:</P>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Social Welfare if he will outline the number and identity of dentists in the Wexford area <Col N="2096" /> who are providing the full range of dental treatment entitlements to insured workers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    <P>In reply to that parliamentary question I received a long reply from the Minister, indicating that there was an ongoing dispute between his Department and the Irish Dental Association, that he was upset about it and, as a result, a number of dentists were improperly charging patients for extractions, root canal treatment and dentures.  The Minister told me in the course of his reply that a number of complaints had been received from patients regarding inappropriate charges by some dentists, including some in County Wexford.  The Minister said that those complaints had been investigated by his Department, that it had been confirmed that a number of the dentists were adhering to the Irish Dental Association's policy on this matter.  He went on to say he was very concerned at all these facts. The final paragraph of that reply read:</P>
    <P>The names and addresses of dentists in the Wexford area who are participating in the extended dental benefit scheme are made available on request at local Social Welfare offices or by telephone to the Department's head office.  It is considered that the publication of names and addresses of participating dentists would not be in the interests of claimants or of the dentists concerned.</P>
    <P>So I telephoned the Minister's Department asking for the name of any dentist who would provide my constituent with the services he required and to which he was legally entitled.  An official of the Minister's Department told me on the telephone that he was unable to provide me with the name of any dentist who would provide dentures for insured workers in Wexford.  In fact, the official admitted that the Department do not actually know which dentists provide which treatment under the scheme in County Wexford.</P>
    <P>I have exhausted all avenues open to me on this matter.  I have communicated with the Minister twice by way of <Col N="2097" /> parliamentary question.  I have contacted him in writing.  I have received numerous responses to my queries on behalf of my constituent, but my constituent is no further down the road and is now moving out of insurability.</P>
    <P>In exasperation I raise this matter this evening in the expectation that the Minister will give a clear, unambiguous answer to me for the sake of this constituent, more especially for the scores of others in the same position in County Wexford and elsewhere.  This dispute has been highlighted on occasions in the past and has now faded into the backwaters, seeming to receive no attention.  I hope the Minister will clarify the matter once and for all and tell me how my constitutent is to get the benefits to which he is clearly entitled.</P>

      <P>At the outset I should say that Deputy Howlin is mistaken in his understanding of the system as it operates.  If the person about whom he speaks &mdash; and I would have to know the person in order to look up the matter for the Deputy &mdash; was eligible when he became unemployed he retains his eligibility while unemployed.Therefore, he need have no fears about that aspect.  Once he was eligible at the time he became unemployed he retains eligibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy talked about the general problem obtaining in Wexford.It is true that a number of dentists in Wexford have been charging.  I should say we depend on complaints made in order to learn of instances of individual dentists doing so; that is why a departmental official might be unable to inform a Deputy immediately.  A number of dentists are charging and, in that area in which there are 20 dentists, there are nine <Col N="2098" /> charging for extractions and, presumably, other services.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of workers continue to benefit under the social insurance dental benefit scheme.  Over 300,000 persons benefit every year.  I am determined that insured persons and their dependent spouses, who became eligible when the scheme was extended in October 1987, will continue to benefit.</P>
      <P>This extension to include dependent spouses was opposed by the Irish Dental Association which advised its members not to sign the contract to operate the extended scheme.  However, despite the opposition of their association some 240 dentists have entered into an agreement to operate the extended scheme.  To date, over 68,000 claims for dental benefit have been received from dependent spouses of insured workers.  This is a substantial improvement in treating this group who previously had no cover at all.</P>
      <P>In certain areas, dependent spouses may have difficulty finding a participating dentist in their immediate locality.  To help these claimants, I arranged, from the outset, to have details of dentists who have signed agreements covering dependent spouses made available at local offices of my Department.  Any person who requires dental treatment can obtain details of their nearest participating dentists from these offices or by telephoning my Department.</P>
      <P>In March 1989 I implemented a substantial package of practical improvements to the dental benefit scheme in line with discussions which had taken place with the association's represenatives. This was worth an extra £1.8 million per annum to dentists.  However, the association, in pursuance of their campaign for fundamental changes in the scheme, called on their members to discontinue certain treatments for all eligible persons. As a result, a number of dentists are improperly charging patients for extractions, root canal treatment and dentures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a further effort to resolve these difficulties I met the association again in January this year and there have been subsequent contacts at offical level. Within the last month a meeting was held <Col N="2099" /> with officials of my Department to clarify certain details regarding dental costs supplied to me by the association.  Since then my Department have been corresponding with the association and a further meeting at official level is anticipated.In the light of these discussions I intend to meet the association shortly to discuss what further changes in the fee structure may now be justified.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputies are aware that the root cause of the current dispute is the dissatisfaction of the Irish Dental Association with what they consider are inadequate fees payable under the scheme.  I am anxious to explore any avenue for settling this matter on an agreed basis and I have indicated to the association that I am prepared to consider ways in which the scheme can be improved as resources permit.</P>
    <P>A number of complaints have been received from patients regarding inappropriate charges by some dentists. These have been investigated by my Department and it has been confirmed that a number of the dentists are making charges in contravention of their contracts.Any person who is asked to pay such charges which are not due should refuse to do so and report the matter to my Department.  There is, however, no provision within the scheme whereby patients who proceed with treatment and pay such charges can be reimbursed.</P>
    <P>Those dentists who are improperly charging patients for treatments covered under the scheme are in breach of their agreements with me.  Under the terms of the contract, I am empowered to take specific actions against such dentists. Deputies will appreciate that while discussions continue with the Irish Dental Association, I am reluctant to exercise these powers.  However, I cannot indefinitely permit the situation to continue in which patients are being refused benefit to which they are entitled.  If this matter cannot be resolved now through the current discussions with the association I will be left with no option but to take action against the dentists concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2100" /> There is one point I would like to make.  The constituent of the Deputy mentioned that a dentist had said that most dentists curtail the supply of dentures.That is not true.  A number do but definitely not most.  It is a problem. Somebody was trying to give the impression that the practice is widespread but it is not.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gay Mitchell gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the failure of Capital Airlines to transport Irish passengers and the whole situation of Capital Airlines.  Deputy Mitchell understands the procedure.  The matter is in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter in the second half of extra time, so to speak.  I am pleased to have this opportunity to put this matter on the record of the House.</P>
      <P>It appears now that some hundreds of Irish air travellers have lost money through the failure of Capital Airlines.  If the airline does not resume services the money spent on tickets purchased will be lost forever. Initial reports indicated that the problem was created by the parent company, Browne Group International.  This now appears not to be the case.  In fact, the reverse may well be the case.  It now seems that losses on Irish services caused or heavily contributed to the group's problems.  It appears that Capital Airlines have underestimated the competitiveness of the Dublin-London market of which they could only capture a 5 per cent share.  I understand they increased their passenger numbers by about 2,000 in the previous year, despite increasing their capacity from 40,000 to 80,000 on that route since taking over the Virgin Atlantic service in 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2101" /> Capital Airlines made losses of approximately £7 million in 1989 and this was contributed to heavily by the Irish services.Was this airline undercutting other airlines simply to obtain a niche in the market?  If so, is the public interest best served by this approach?  Surely it cannot be if ticket purchasers are not aware that such policy puts their money in jeopardy. At £60, a return ticket Dublin, Luton Capital Airlines was aiming at the lower socio-economic group, the very people who cannot afford such losses.  They would not have money in their pockets to purchase a replacement air ticket and many of them would be stranded at the last moment.</P>
    <P>The Transport Tour Operators and Travel Agent Act, 1982 requires all tour operators and retail agents to be licensed by the Department of Tourism and Transport and to provide bonds sufficient to protect all members of the public booked with them in the event of closure. It is anomalous that this legislation does not extend to airlines and I am asking the Minister to amend it to cover airlines. The day may come when a major or not so major airline may default, and not all the airlines flying in and out of Dublin and in and out of this country are making a profit.  It happens that some of those that are not making a profit have at their back persons who are in a position to put their hands on capital.  If it should happen, however, that an airline in a lossmaking situation follows Capital Airlines' example it would not be hundreds of people who would be out of pocket but thousands.  They probably believe they are covered by the 1982 Act but they are not covered by that Act.  That measure should be extended to cover airlines so that they are required to be bonded in the same way as tour operators to ensure that the travelling public are properly and adequately covered.</P>
    <P>There have been reports of travellers taken off airplanes, such was the suddenness of the discontinuance of service in the case of Capital Airlines.  I call on the Minister to tell the House the precise number affected, how he intends to ensure that they are compensated and <Col N="2102" /> how he intends to protect future travellers on airlines from similar situations so that they are protected and compensated and not simply treated as a creditor like the person who supplies the fuel for the airlines.  A person paying for a service is a purchasing customer and should be protected in the same way as people are protected under the legislation dealing with tour operators.</P>
    <P>Many travellers believe themselves to be covered by legislation but this is simply not the case.  This matter must be addressed by this House and by the Minister.I urge the Minister to ensure that the full extent of the effect on Irish travellers is fully disclosed.  I have already had complaints from front bench spokesmen from my own party and from a number of Deputies around the country about this and how their constituents were left high and dry at the last minute.  The Minister should disclose to this House precisely how many Irish travellers were affected, what it cost them, what steps are being taken to ensure that they are being compensated and what steps he is taking to ensure that, if there is a further problem with any other airlines, the travellers are adequately covered and are compensated for any losses they may incur.</P>
    <P>Again, Sir, thank you for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. S. Brennan) Seamus Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that the Deputy has a Dáil question tomorrow on this subject at which time I will also deal with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Capital Airlines is a UK airline which was designated by the UK authorities to operate scheduled air services on the Luton-Dublin, Belfast-Dublin and Leeds-Bradford-Dublin routes under the terms of the Ireland-UK transport agreement.As a UK-based airline its operating licence is issued by the UK Civil Aviation Authority who are obliged under UK law to satisfy themselves in relation to the financial fitness of airlines both when a licence is being issued and periodically thereafter, depending on the size of the airline and a whole range of other <Col N="2103" /> criteria.  This is obviously done in the interests of keeping in touch with and ensuring that the operators in the air transport industry are financially sound. I should point out that this is also done in the interests of providing continuity of service to the public and a reasonable degree of protection, not complete protection, I accept.</P>
    <P>Capital Airlines suspended operations between the UK and Ireland on 28 June last as a result of its parent company, the Browne International Group, being put into receivership.  I understand from the UK authorities that the receiver to the company is not in a position to indicate at this stage whether the airline will be sold as a going concern or will resume trading in the near future.</P>
    <P>Since the suspension of operations by Capital Airlines I have been in touch with Aer Lingus and Ryanair about passengers affected by the suspension of operations.I can inform the House tonight that tickets issued by Capital Airlines for travel on Aer Lingus services are being honoured by Aer Lingus while Ryanair, which also operates on the Luton-Dublin route, has also made special arrangements for the transport of affected passengers. Such passengers were offered a special one way fare of £40 by Ryanair to allow them to return home.  Furthermore, Ryanair mounted a special Luton-Dublin flight on Saturday 30 June to accommodate passengers anxious to return home last weekend.  About 80 passengers <Col N="2104" /> travelled on that flight.  A similar number of passengers holding Capital Airlines tickets have availed of Ryanair's oneway fare from Ireland to the UK.  I share the Deputy's concern and I have every sympathy for those affected by this development.  I must emphasise that Capital Airlines are a UK airline and responsibility for their licensing rests solely with the UK authorities.  I will examine carefully the suggestion the Deputy made in regard to amending the Act.  There is, of course, a thin line between under-cutting and competitiveness.However, I will examine the suggestion the Deputy has made.</P>
    <P>I am conscious, of course, of the difference between the travel charter-type business and the day-in day-out scheduled business.  The Deputy is quite right in that there is a bonding system, by legislation, in the package holiday business. This is because people pay substantial deposits and book their holidays a long time in advance.  There is generally much family involvement in that area and there is a much longer term and deeper investment for the travelling public than the week-in, week-out, day-in day-out scheduled traveller.  I am not sure the system is easily transferable from the travel chartered side to the scheduled side but I will certainly consider the matter.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.45 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 4 July 1990.</P>

      <P>From 1 January, 1988 to 1 January, 1990 the numbers of staff in my Department, excluding the Forest Service, fell from <Col N="1850" /> 209 to 173 and in the Forest Service of my Department from 928 to 53.  However most of the fall in numbers in the Forest Sevice was due to the transfer of certain of its functiong to the State body, Coillte Teoranta which was established on 1 January 1989, so that it is not possible to make a direct comparison between the numbers now in forestry and those two years ago.  I can add, however, that the effect of the embargo on staffing in my Department has been to rationalise its activities, phase out certain schemes and redeploy and retain staff to meet ongoing requirements.</P>

      <P>The ESB will continue to have a gas burning requirement into the foreseeable future.

      <P>The study by Professor Gardner in the UK is a source of grave concern and appears to have serious implications for the workers at Sellafield and their children.  The report indicates a possible link between levels of radiation to which Sellafield workers can be exposed and leukaemia. It also states that no link between increased leukaemia and environmental radioactivity was found.  The Irish public would, of course, be exposed to radioactivity from Sellafield through the environment.I understand that the Gardner report will be followed up by further research in the UK and any additional findings will be scrutinised by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) &mdash; an independent group of experts in the field of radiological protection &mdash; are at present drawing up revised limits for exposure to ionising radiation, based on recent research.  It is likely that the limits will be lowered considerably.  It is expected that the EC will revise the Directive on Basic Safety Standards &mdash; Council Directive 80/836/Euratom as amended by Council Directive 34/467/Euratom &mdash; in line with the <Col N="1852" /> ICRP's recommendations.  The Commission have already commenced work on such a revision and are currently consulting the group of experts established under Article 31 of the Euratom Treaty.</P>
    <P>The Nuclear Energy Board have for a number of years applied lower dose limits than those in the present directive by keeping standards as exacting as reasonably achieveable.  Workers in Ireland are, therefore, afforded, through the NEB's licensing system, a very high standard of radiation protection.</P>

      <P>The environment action programme introduced earlier this year by the Government identified the need for action to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide which account for a significant proportion of greenhouse gases.  In this context energy conservation is considered to be the most effective short-term contribution the developed world can make towards reducing carbon dioxide emissions.  Additional resources this year amounting to £500,000 were allocated to launch a major energy conservation programme in addition to the activities which are currently under way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measures which will be undertaken in the expanded conservation programme, and which I announced recently, include the installation of energy management systems in two hospitals with a view to demonstrating that such systems can result in substantial energy savings; a project to trace more precisely the location and route of groundwater as a source of renewable <Col N="1855" /> energy in the city centre area of Dublin; a grant to a charitable group which has been engaged for some years in draught-proofing the houses of the needy and elderly; the establishment as soon as possible of a conservation advisory group on energy conservation matters; and the undertaking of some studies in the conservation area, the results of which will prove useful in determining conservation policy in the future.</P>

      <P>It is estimated that most of the bogs at present being worked by Bord na Móna will be exhausted by the year 2020.  It is expected that 1,500-2,000 acres of cut-away will become available in the next ten years in the south Tipperary area.</P>
      <P>I am determined that the valuable emerging resource of Bord na Móna cut-away bog should be utilised in the best possible way for the benefit of this country and have as yet taken no final decision on the eventual use of the cut-away.For this reason I have set up an independent expert committee to examine the allocation of Bord na Móna cutaway between the competing demands of forestry, agriculture/ horticulture and amenity uses.  The committee will make recommendations as appropriate on the optimum division of the cutaway as it becomes available.  I would expect the committee to report to me before the end of this year.  The terms of reference of the committee together with details of their membership are available from the Dáil Library.  The terms of reference do not limit the consideration of the committee to solely commercial criteria.</P>
      <P>I expect that the report of the committee will be available to me before the question of any further disposal of cut-away bogs by Bord na Móna will arise.</P>

      <P>The research vessel <i>Valdivia</i> has carried out seismic surveys in September 1988 and again in May of this year as part of the so-called RAPIDS project &mdash; the title denoting Rockall and Porcupine Deep <Col N="1861" /> Seismic.  This project is first and foremost a marine scientific research undertaking in the sphere of geology.  Its overall purpose is to investigate the nature of the earth's crust off our west coast and to establish the limit of our Continental Shelf.  It is a joint undertaking involving the University of Hamburg, the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies and University College Dublin and has been assisted by the office of science and technology of the Department of Industry and Commerce, to which, as a scientific research project, it has most direct relevance.I am happy to say that my own Department were in a position to provide some limited financial assistance to project costs during 1988.  I understand that it may be some considerable time &mdash; perhaps a year or more &mdash; before the final, detailed results of the overall RAPIDS project would be available.</P>
      <P>The project has no direct or short-term relevance to exploration for oil and gas nor has it been carried out with this in mind.  To the extent that the eventual project findings should add to our understanding of the factors which controlled the formation of basins off our west coast they may, as an indirect result, enhance the attractions of the area from the point of view of hydrocarbons exploration.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that the current price paid by the ESB for electricity purchased from private producers is fair and reasonable.  The principle of &ldquo;avoided cost&rdquo; is generally applied in determining the price paid by an electrical utility for bought-in power, that is, the price paid by a utility for a unit of electricity is the saving which the utility makes by not generating such a <Col N="1862" /> unit itself.  The current price paid to private producers, which is about 3p per unit, was settled some years ago and has not been reduced even though the ESB's own fuel costs have decreased substantially in recent years.  I am, however, keeping the position under review.</P>
      <P>The second part of the Deputy's question relates to the stand-by charges applied by the ESB to those involved in what is usually referred to as combined heat and power (CHP).

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 77 together.</P>
      <P>In reply to a previous question from Deputy Barnes on 28 April 1988, the then Minister for Energy indicated that the most recent estimate of the potential for combined heat and power was 100-150 megawatts of electricity.  There is no reason this indicative range of potential for combined heat and power should be reassessed at present.</P>
      <P>The successful application of combined heat and power depends very much on the particular electricity and heat requirements at each site and it is a matter for potential investors to satisfy themselves as to the viability of investing in such systems.</P>
      <P>However, experience to date of various CHP schemes has been, on the whole, disappointing.  My Department have endeavoured in the past to encourage various energy saving techniques, including CHP.  Direct support was provided for two projects.

      <P>Experience at Paris Commission meetings over the last few years has shown <Col N="1864" /> that, although there is widespread sympathy for Ireland's position in relation to Sellafield, very few countries will support a specific recommendation for its closure. However, the Irish delegation to the recent Paris Commission meeting in Iceland reiterated Ireland's concern about Sellafield and nuclear reprocessing in general.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that considerable progress as regards radioactive discharges has been made at recent Paris Commission meetings, and this will, of course affect the operation of Sellafield.  Since 1988 the contracting parties to the Paris Convention must apply best available technology to reduce and eliminate radioactive discharges from nuclear installations.  Based on an Irish recommendation, this year's meeting agreed that the contracting parties would report to the 1991 Commission meeting and regularly every four years thereafter on progress in applying their undertakings on radioactive discharges.</P>
      <P>Another significant achievement at the meeting was agreement on a process of consultation on new projects between participating states.  In future where two states share a body of water, they must co-operate to prevent new projects having significant adverse effects.  This would affect plans to build any type of project including nuclear installations and reprocessing plants which had an environmental effect on the waters in question.</P>

All I can say at this stage is that no application has been submitted to my Department for a mining lease for this deposit and, as a consequence, the question of settling terms on which royalties will be assessed has not arisen.</P>

The increased transport of spent and reprocessed fuel and waste through the Irish Sea, if that is the route to be used for transportation, with the attendant risk of accidents, is of particular concern.  I have not discussed this matter directly with the Japanese Government.  Responsibility for Sellafield lies with the UK and I raised Ireland's objections to the increased movement of radioactive materials to and from Sellafield when I met the UK Secretary of State for Energy, Mr. John Wakeham, on 18 May.  It was also raised at the Council of EC Energy Ministers which I chaired on 21 May.

      <P>I am not aware of the specific source of the information referred to in the Deputy's question.</P>
      <P>A number of indicators would suggest, <i>prima facie,</i> that Ireland's energy use, in terms of gross domestic product, is higher than other EC countries.  Certain factors which are unique to Ireland contribute to this.  In particular, we have the only stand-alone grids for gas and electricity with consequent higher and, therefore, more costly reserve requirements.  The basis on which most calculations of energy intensity are carried out involves direct comparison of GDPs of member states as indicators of the volume of economic activity and there are shortcomings in this method of measurement which would tend to distort inter-country comparisons.The extent of any such distortion is very difficult to quantify.</P>
      <P>Ireland's energy intensity has been improving steadily and, with continuing improvements in the efficiency of energy use together with sustained strong economic growth, it is expected that our energy use, in terms of GDP, will continue to fall in the coming years.</P>

      <P>In 1989 the cost of producing a unit of electricity at Moneypoint (coal) was 1.494 pence and 2.025 pence at Aghada (gas).</P>
      <P>Use of natural gas for a substantial part of their generation would be a cheaper option for the ESB than fitting emission control equipment to Moneypoint power station in the context of limiting overall emissions from existing plant.  It is not possible to calculate a precise cost of the impact on the environment, from the use of coal for electricity generation in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The comparative costs of new gas or coal fired plant have not yet been examined in detail as the ESB will not need to construct new generating plant for some time yet.

      <P>The question of the routing and the policing of parades is of particular sensitivity and importance and has been the subject of discussions at meetings of <Col N="1876" /> the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference and in the Anglo-Irish Secretariat in Belfast.</P>
      <P>In the case of the Portadown parade, the Deputy will wish to be aware that it is no longer routed through Obins Street. It has, however, in recent years used an alternative route through the nationalist Garvaghy Road which is also unsatisfactory.The Government have conveyed in forceful terms their objection to the continued use of this route and have made it clear to the British authorities that they would wish to see it changed. They have underlined the overriding principle that parades should not take place in an area or along a route where they are not welcome.  The Government will continue to press the British authorities on this issue and will also be closely monitoring the parade situation generally in Northern Ireland in the coming weeks.</P>

      <P>I did not meet the two Cambodian visitors mentioned by the Deputy. I arranged that they be met by officials of my Department.</P>
      <P>During the course of the meeting my officials were provided with a briefing on the current situation in Cambodia from the viewpoint of the Hun Sen administration in Phnom Penh.  They were informed that Cambodia needed humanitarian and development aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In turn the Cambodians were fully informed of the policy of the Irish Government and of the European Community in regard to the tragic conflict in Cambodia.  The strong wish of the Irish Government and of their partners in the Twelve to see a peace settlement which would exclude the possibility of a return to power of the Pol Pot Khmer Rouge and provide for the formation of a democratic <Col N="1877" /> government through a genuine act of self-determination by the Cambodian people, in free, fair and internationally supervised elections was emphasised.  It was pointed out that such a government would have the benefit of international recognition, including access to development funds needed to assist in the rebuilding of the country.  In the meantime, humanitarian assistance was being provided for Cambodia through nongovernmental organisations by various countries, including Ireland.</P>

      <P>The station at Ballygirreen does not provide &ldquo;high frequency air traffic control facilities&rdquo; and it is assumed that the Deputy is referring to the two-way high frequency radio link, between aircraft operating on the North Atlantic and Prestwick Air Traffic Control Centre in Scotland, provided by the Shannon Aer-radio station at Ballygirreen. <Col N="1899" /> Ballygirreen also provides a continuous aeronautical weather report and forecasting service.</P>
      <P>The agreement under which high frequency communications services are provided at Ballygirreen is the exchange of notes between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom relating to the oceanic control centres at Shannon and Prestwick (Treaty Series 1966 No. 5) which is available for consultation in the Library of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make provision in the 1991 Estimates to restore the administration grant to HEDCO, which he removed in 1990, as the organisation is having to put more of its energies into competing for international projects thus lessening its role in Irish initiatives.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following a review in 1986, the basis on which HEDCO is paid for their services to the bilateral aid programme was changed over the period 1986-1989 from an administration grant to a management fee in respect of projects managed by HEDCO for the Department. The changeover coincided with a period of budgetary cuts which reduced bilateral aid activities generally and also the scale of HEDCO's income from the bilateral aid programme &mdash; see table below.  The <Col N="1900" /> new system, under which the management fee is based on a percentage of project funding handled by HEDCO, is simpler and operates satisfactorily and it is not proposed to revert to the old method for 1991.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main recommendation of the National Pensions Board in this area was that the present figure of 15 per cent, as the amount of net relevant earnings contributed to a retirement annuity scheme on which self-employed taxpayers can obtain income tax relief, should be increased.  While the board did not recommend any specific increased limit, it felt that 20 per cent would be appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board explicitly recognised that this recommendation would have cost implications for the Exchequer and in fact the increased limit mentioned could cost up to £7 million per annum in tax foregone.  The provision of pensions for the self-employed must also be seen in the context of the introduction of social insurance for them in 1988, at a rate &mdash; introduced on a phased basis &mdash; less than <Col N="1902" /> that recommended by the majority of the National Pensions Board for the benefits for which the self-employed became insured.  In addition, rather than narrowing the tax base by the extension of reliefs, the focus of income tax policy in recent years has been on reducing tax rates, and some reliefs have in fact been restricted in order to meet a small part of the cost of funding these reductions.  In the circumstances, I have no plans to implement the recommendation.</P>

      <P>With the limited exceptions set out below, the Irish coinage is minted in the Currency Centre, Sandyford, Co. Dublin by the Central Bank.</P>
      <P>At present, the 50p coin is minted in the UK.  However, the Government recently announced that the 50p is to be redesigned and will be minted in Ireland in future.</P>
      <P>Because of the limited capacity of the facilities at the Currency Centre, 20 million of the 50 million £1 coins which are being issued this year were minted in the UK.  The ECU commemorative coins were also minted abroad for similiar reasons.</P>
      <P>The average annual cost of producing the coinage for the past ten years is £1.86 million per annum.</P>
      <P>At the costs of the coinage are borne by the Central Bank, savings from the introduction of the £1 coin will not accrue to the Exchequer.  It is currently estimated that there will be a net saving of about £300,000 per year after 5-7 years of issue.</P>

      <P>Trim Castle is the centrepiece of one of the most interesting groupings of medieval monuments anywhere in Ireland.  It is a large &ldquo;D-shaped&rdquo; structure, with its straight wall running parallel to the River Boyne.</P>
      <P>It was built in approximately 1212 on the site of a previous, less substantial fortification and had many owners, most notably the King of England.</P>
      <P>The grant of 60,000 ECU's (approximately £47,000) from the Commission of the European Communities will fund, in part only, a programme of conservation work at Trim Castle.  The balance of the funding will be provided by the Exchequer.  A contract for the supply of scaffolding for the project has been placed.  When erected, this will then enable conservation of the stonework of the keep to be undertaken.  It is expected that the work will take approximately 18 months to complete.</P>

      <P>Assuming that the reference to nuts means compound feedingstuffs in pelleted form, it is difficult to make a precise comparison between the feeding value of hay &mdash; which is subject to considerable variation &mdash; and that of pelleted feedingstuffs.  However, in general it would be expected that hay would have between 40 per cent and 70 per cent of the feeding value of pelleted feedingstuffs.</P>

      <P>The delay in payment arose because of his failure to produce documentary evidence of lands he had rented in 1988 to my Department's local office.  This information has now been received.</P>

      <P>I should explain that as the insurance supervisory authority, my primary responsibility is to ensure that insurance companies maintain their statutory reserves and solvency requirements and, therefore, I must respect the right of insurers to accept or reject risks in the light of their underwriting experience.No obligation can be placed on an insurer to quote in respect of a particular risk or to quote at any particular premium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there is an arrangement with the Irish Insurance Federation to assist in cases where difficulties are experienced in obtaining liability and fire insurance.  Before any case can be referred to the federation, it is necessary that at least half the market &mdash; approximately 12 companies including Lloyds &mdash;<Col N="1918" /> be approached without success.  Evidence of these approaches, e.g. a letter from a broker, together with a brief synopsis of the risk should be forwarded to the insurance section of my Department who will refer the matter to the federation for consideration.  I must emphasise that, while this arrangement is reasonably successful, no guarantee can be given that cover will be forthcoming in every case.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Industry and Commerce</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that as of 1 June 1990 most motor insurance companies are refusing to quote to persons under 25 years of age, who are without no claim bonuses, and that other companies who are quoting are doing so at grossly exorbitant figures; and if he will take action to alleviate this situation.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, as the insurance supervisory authority, my primary and statutory duty is to ensure that insurance companies maintain their statutory reserves and solvency requirements.  In this regard I must respect the right of insurers to accept or reject risks in the light of their underwriting experience.  There is no legal obligation on any insurer to quote in respect of any risk or to quote in any manner or at any particular premium.</P>
      <P>I understand that in order to maintain their viability some motor insurance companies are tending to be more selective in the type of risk for which they are prepared to quote.  This more selective approach tends to apply to new business rather than to existing policyholders.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding this, my information is that a number of companies are continuing to offer insurance cover to persons under 25 years of age who are without no claim bonuses.  Indeed the Irish Insurance Federation has indicated to me that this is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any event, cases of inability to get motor insurance cover can be dealt with under the declined cases agreement.  This is an agreement between the authorised motor insurers and the Minister for <Col N="1919" /> Industry and Commerce.  The declined cases committee, established under the agreement, examines cases referred to it by my Department where motorists have been declined cover by five or more insurance companies, and nominates a company to quote for the risk involved. Before a case can be submitted to this committee for consideration it is necessary for my Department to have copies of written refusals from five insurance companies together with details of any previous insurance held in the last three years.</P>
    <P>With regard to the level of premia charged to young drivers I feel it is only right to point out again that the fundamental cause of high motor insurance prices for all motorists in Ireland is the high claims rate which, regrettably, is on the increase, allied to the high cost of individual claims which is also rising. These factors bear on the level of insurance premia quoted to young drivers as well as those quoted to more mature motorists.  One cannot reasonably expect the price of motor insurance to reduce, or even stabilise, when the claims rate and the cost of claims is increasing.</P>
    <P>The cost of motor insurance for young drivers tends to reflect the higher claims experience of motor insurers in this area. While I sympathise with the situation in which young drivers find themselves, statistical evidence has shown that they are more likely to be involved in accidents, and, therefore, to cause claims. The cost of these claims can only be met by insurers if a realistic premium is forthcoming to cover the risk involved.</P>

      <P>The Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1979, provide for the granting of mineral prospecting licences which authorise the holders to enter upon the lands specified and there to carry out surveys or other investigations to ascertain whether mineral deposits of commercial interest exist there.</P>

    <P>A condition attached to all licences is that the licensees must obtain planning <Col N="1922" /> permission in advance under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts, 1963 and 1976 for any work contemplated under the licences which would require such permission.</P>
    <P>Prospecting licences holders are also required to carry out their operations in conformity with good prospecting practices and not to interfere unnecessarily with the amenities of the locality in which the licence area is situated.</P>
    <P>In cases where my Department are aware of an environmentally sensitive site e.g. an historic monument, detailed instructions are given to the licensee regarding their operations.  Otherwise they are required to consult the Office of Public Works or other relevant bodies.</P>
    <P>There are at present 15 prospecting licences granted to five companies in Counties Sligo and Leitrim (Appendix A).  The licences were issued for an initial term of two years subject to payment of the appropriate fee, and to the conditions generally applicable to the grant of prospecting licences.  Some of these licences are at present being renewed for further periods, my Department being satisfied that sufficient prospecting work had been carried out and that acceptable work programmes would be undertaken.</P>
    <P>There are a large number of townlands in the licensed areas and the Deputy will appreciate that due to time constraints and staffing resources it is not possible to give a detailed list of the townlands in the reply.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that temporary executive engineers employed by local authorities are paid at the lower scale of assistant engineer.  The normal practice with temporary appointments in local authorities is that appointees are paid the minimum of the salary scale of the office to which they are appointed.  All temporary officers of local authorities pay PRSI at the Class A rate.  The position whereby local authority staff becoming pensionable must pay for earlier temporary service is a feature common to public sector schemes generally.  Since the service counts in full for superannuation purposes the requirement that contributions be paid based on the pay which was received during the period of temporary service and not on current rates of pay is considered to be fair and equitable.</P>

Subsequently, the local authority sought approval for the use of internal capital receipts from the sale of houses to finance the work.

      <P>The management and maintenance, including repairs, of their dwellings are matters for the local authority and do not require ministerial approval.  Such works would be funded by the authority from its own resources, which include their rental income and the revenue portion, 40 per cent, of the proceeds of tenant purchase schemes.  Projects under the remedial works scheme, under which a housing authority may carry out major refurbishment of certain estates, come within the Public Capital Programme and are subject to ministerial approval.  It is a matter for the housing authority to formulate proposals for such projects and to indicate relative priorities when the proposals are being submitted to the Department.</P>
      <P>This year, a sum of £100,000 has been allocated to Sligo Corporation under the remedial works scheme; the apportionment of this allocation between its approved projects is a matter for the corporation. The Department has no record of the receipt of an application under the scheme from Sligo County Council.  Following recent discussions between officials of the Department and Leitrim County Council, a formal application under the scheme is awaited from the council.</P>

However, details of the percentage of total admissions which were emergency or elective for the three months in question were obtained from the hospitals and are given beneath.  These were also forwarded to the Deputy by letter of 24 April 1990 as promised in response to his parliamentary question No. 187 of 6 March 1990 in this connection.  The tabular statement also shows the maximum bed complement for each hospital during the period in question as compared to the bed complement for the same period in 1988/1989.  The Deputy will note that additional beds were available during part of the 1989/1990 period to meet the demands of the flu epidemic.</P>

      <P>The Department is closely monitoring progress being made in the current year to reduce the orthodontic waiting lists and will take further action if necessary. Four vacant posts of consultant orthodontist in the health board dental service, are being advertised with more attractive conditions of service.  A fifth post, in the Eastern Health Board has already been advertised.

      <P>I will take Questions Nos. 204 and 205 together.  Eligible children in the Portmarnock area are served by the dental clinics at Malahide and Baldoyle.  Normally ten three hour sessions are carried out each week in the dental clinic at Malahide.  Due to a dental surgeon post becoming vacant, these sessions ceased for an eight-week period recently. However, they have now resumed with the filling of the vacant post.  Five three hour sessions are carried out each week in the dental clinic at Baldoyle.  In addition, the principal dental surgeon provides one session of orthodontic treatment each week in Malahide and one session each week in Baldoyle.</P>
      <P>The average waiting time for a course of routine dental treatment is three months but emergency treatment is available to persons who are in pain.</P>
      <P>There are 94 persons in Portmarnock and 444 persons in Malahide on the orthodontic waiting list at present.  This list is currently being reviewed by the Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>Since November 1989, the Government have made special allocations of £1 million to the health boards to provide additional orthodontic treatment for top priority cases.  This amount supplements the moneys already allocated by the health boards for orthodontic services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1949" /> The Department are closely monitoring progress being made in the current year to reduce the orthodontic waiting lists and will take further action if necessary.Four vacant posts of consultant orthodontist in the health board dental service, are being advertised with more attractive conditions of service.  A fifth post, in the Eastern Health Board, has already been advertised.  In addition arrangements are in place to train a number of health board dental surgeons from the Eastern Health Board in advanced orthodontic techniques.</P>

      <P>As I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, the admission of a patient to hospital is a matter for the clinical decision of the consultant concerned and the hospital authority.  Non-urgent (elective) cases may be put on a waiting list to ensure that emergency and urgent cases can be dealt with promptly.  A patient's position on the waiting list is therefore under constant review and is subject to change depending on the medical circumstances of the cases on the list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The waiting list or admission for ENT surgery at Temple Street has decreased from 1,228 in November 1989 to 801 at the end of May 1990 as a result of additional funding provided to increase the number of ENT procedures.  This is a significant <Col N="1951" /> decrease and I am confident that the numbers on the waiting list will continue to fall.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the authorities at Temple Street Hospital that the hospital anticipates that the patient in question, who was placed on the non-urgent waiting list on 18 May 1990, will be admitted in around six months time.  I would suggest to the Deputy that if the patient's condition has deteriorated, her parents should take her back to her family doctor who would be in the best position to assess and then, if necessary, to stress the urgency of the case to the consultant concerned.</P>

    <P>Phase 1, Stage 1, is nearing completion and is currently being equipped.  This section of the hospital is expected to open in early 1991.  The agreed tender figure for the current construction contract is £17.127 million.  As this figure is subject to fluctuation due to inflation and price variations it would be premature to give a final total cost figure for the project at this stage.</P>

      <P>Under my Department's scheme for the employment of caretakers <Col N="1957" /> in national schools the number of posts funded has been reduced by 70 due to successive public service staff embargoes. Certain issues have recently arisen in relation to the employment of persons on the social employment scheme on caretaking work in national schools.  Discussions are taking place with ICTU regarding the provision of caretaking assistance in national schools.  Pending the outcome of these talks it would not be appropriate for me to make any further comment on the matter.</P>
