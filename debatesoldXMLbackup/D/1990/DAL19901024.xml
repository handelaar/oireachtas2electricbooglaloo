      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of notices of motion under Standing Order 30.  I observe that the notices given by Deputy De Rossa and Deputy Spring relate to the same subject matter and I am calling the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.  I call, therefore, Deputy De Rossa to state the matter of which he has given notice to me.</P>

      <P>In accordance with Standing Order 30, I wish to raise the dispute which involves the secretaries <Col N="2" /> employed by Deputies in their parliamentary and constituency work and I seek leave to move the adjournment of the Dáil to discuss this matter because of the serious impact on the work of Dáil Deputies and consequently on the public at large.  It is clear that there is a major problem of understanding between the union representing the secretaries and the Department of Finance.  It is important that this House and the Houses generally should demonstrate that they are exemplary employers rather than adopting an intransigent attitude towards negotiations. I urge the Ceann Comhairle to agree to this discussion to enable the matter to be dealt with as expeditiously as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Before dealing with my request under Standing Order 30, we in <Col N="3" /> this House should unite today in expressing our abhorrence at the constant murders taking place in Northern Ireland.  A statement should come from this House today regarding these brutal murders.</P>
      <P>Under Standing Order 30 I gave notice that I wished to move a motion to the effect that this House deplores the failure of the Department of Finance to negotiate seriously regarding the legitimate grievances of Dáil secretaries and in particular the failure of the Department to make any serious effort to avert this unnecessary and damaging industrial dispute. This House calls on the Minister for Finance to take personal charge of the handling of the dispute forthwith.  In the event that you, a Cheann Comhairle, refuse my request, the Minister for Finance might meet with party Leaders to try to bring the dispute to a resolution as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>The House is probably aware that the question of the industrial action by the secretarial assistants is on the agenda for our meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges this afternoon.  It would be my ardent hope that some definite results would accrue from that and I feel it is appropriate at this stage that nothing should be said or done to aggravate what is already a very delicate situation.  Perhaps you would leave the matter with me and with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
      <P>Deputy Pat Rabbitte gave me notice that he wished also to raise a matter under Standing Order 30.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice that I sought to raise the following matter of urgent public interest, namely, the immediate and other causes of and the circumstances leading to the financial difficulties of the Goodman Group of companies and the appointment by the High Court of an examiner to a number of these companies, especially in view of the importance of the beef industry and the serious risk to the jobs and livelihoods of <Col N="4" /> thousands of workers and farmers.  Since the Dáil debated the Companies (Amendment) Bill, 1990, a number of new issues have emerged which the House should be allowed debate in full. Among these are the suggestions that money borrowed by the Goodman Group under section 84 lending for the specific expansion of the beef industry was used for other purposes, that promises were made by members of the Government to re-establish export credit insurance for beef exports to Iraq, the origins of a sum of approximately £20 million now on deposit in an account in the Bank of Cyprus and the purposes for which this money was raised, and a number of other matters which did not surface during the debate on 28 August.</P>

      <P>Having considered the matter fully I do not consider it is one contemplated by Standing Order 30 and I cannot, therefore, grant leave to move the motion.</P>
      <P>Deputy Spring and Deputy John Bruton gave notice under Standing Order 30 of their intention to raise a similar matter.  In the first instance I call Deputy Spring to raise the question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice that under Standing Order 30 I wish to raise a matter which I consider to be of extreme public importance.</P>
      <P>The motion reads as follows:</P>
      <P>This House deplores the decision to suppress the broadcasting of a television programme dealing with the Merchant Banking affair and that the House regards that decision as essentially a political one.  This House demands a full statement by the Taoiseach concerning any and all representations made to the programme or to the RTE Authority on his behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, I gave you notice under Standing Order 30 of my intention to move the adjournment of the Dáil on a specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent consideration. The matter in question is the failure of <Col N="5" /> RTE to go ahead with the screening of the programme &ldquo;Wednesday Report&rdquo; due to be screened tonight.  The programme is understood to contain allegations that Merchant Banking Limited, or a company associated therewith, made loans to a Fianna Fáil politician through a company linked with that politician's family.  This matter is urgent and of public interest in that (a) no action was taken on the liquidator's report on the Merchant Banking collapse and (b) the failure to screen the programme at the prearranged time was due to its political content and that the postponement is designed, and may have been sought by the Government in order to deny information to voters in advance of the Presidential election.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, the matter I wish to raise with you under Standing Order 30 is the emergence of independent evidence which corroborates statements to the effect that the Tánaiste, Deputy Brian Lenihan, attempted to put improper pressure on the President in 1982 to secure a transfer of power to Deputy Haughey without an election and, in so doing, committed a grossly improper act &mdash; that is an attempt to interfere with a power which is within the absolute discretion of the President &mdash; and in the fact that he has since denied that in the face of the evidence has cast a very real doubt over any credibility he may have had.</P>

      <P>In page 14, line 19, after &ldquo;this Act&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;save that the Minister may not make such an order without also tabling a statement before both Houses of the Oireachtas to the effect that the relevant state agencies have sufficient resources to enforce the provisions being brought into effect&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During Committee Stage discussion concern was expressed by a number of Deputies on all sides that we have frequently passed legislation which we were subsequently unable to enforce effectively. Indeed, if you look at Irish legislation on almost any subject you will find it is quite modern by international standards, but unfortunately the reality is that we do not seem to be able to provide sufficient personnel or resources and sufficient training for the personnel involved to adequately enforce at least some of the legislation we pass.  Legislation dealing with company fraud or what might be popularly described as white collar crime <Col N="28" /> is particularly difficult to enforce without adequate personnel and adequate training for those personnel.</P>
    <P>This Companies (No. 2) Bill makes a huge change in our company law.  It creates a number of new criminal offences, particularly the offence of reckless trading. Obviously, to prove that somebody traded recklessly at a given time will require a detailed investigation, not just of the affairs of the company at the time the investigation is taking place but of the affairs of the company at the time a director, who may be the subject of the prosecution, failed for example to move for the company to be liquidated; in other words, one requires to be able to get information about a particular point in time in the past in addition to simply getting information that may be available now.</P>
    <P>If the companies legislation is to be effectively enforced we must have a firm commitment from the Government that adequate resources will be provided.  We have a very clear example of the inadequacy of the present resources in this general area when we contemplate the Merchant Banking collapse.  In that case the institution had a branch &mdash; or associated companies at least &mdash; in Northern Ireland.  They also had a branch, or associated companies, and their head-quarters on this side of the Border.  Subsequent to the collapse, companies in the two jurisdictions were investigated.  In this jurisdiction, although a report was produced by the liquidator which contained very serious allegations no action was taken in the court on foot of the allegations, arguably because the resources did not exist on this side of the Border, in the Fraud Squad or elsewhere, to assemble the evidence in such a way that a judge might be persuaded to accept that wrongdoing had taken place.</P>
    <P>There has been no suggestion that the reason action was not taken on the report was that legislation here was inadequate. No explanation has been given for action not being taken.  However, in Northern Ireland in respect of the same company, in respect of basically the same facts, a prosecution was taken and brought to <Col N="29" /> finality in respect of a company whose major scene of operations was on this side of the Border.  That clearly indicates that unless there was some interference with the freedom of action of the Fraud Squad or of the Director of Public Prosecutions there clearly was an inadequacy in the evidence-gathering capacity of the people concerned with the enforcement of the then company law, Central Bank legislation and so on in respect of which breaches were alleged.</P>
    <P>This is one of the biggest Bills to go through the House in 20 years.  It has required a huge amount of work by successive Ministers concerned, their officials and Deputies.  However, all that work will be nothing more than an elaborate waste of time unless the resources exist to enforce it properly.  If there is in legislative terms what one might describe as an Irish disease it is passing high sounding legislation, putting it on the Statute Book and failing to enforce it.  Let us ensure in this House today that that will not happen in regard to the Companies Bill.</P>
    <P>The proposal which Deputy Barrett and I are making is to require an amendment to section 2 of the Bill which provides for an order to be made by the Minister to bring various parts of the Bill into operation.  He has discretion in this regard, he can bring some parts in at certain times and he can defer the introduction of parts of the Bill to a later date. We propose that the Minister may not make an order to bring this Bill into effect without also, at the same time, tabling a statement in his name before both Houses of the Oireachtas to the effect that the relevant State agencies, the Companies Office, the Fraud Squad, the DPP or whatever, have sufficient resources to enforce the provisions being brought into effect.  If accepted by the House, that will require the Minister before he puts his signature to that order to address specifically the issue of ensuring that adequate resources are available to enforce the legislation.</P>
    <P>It will force the Government to address <Col N="30" /> that issue and it will considerably strengthen the Minister's hand in his negotiations with the Minister for Finance who is responsible for the public service in obtaining whatever staff are necessary to ensure the legislation is effective.  If the Minister has to say he is putting his name to a formal statement lodged before the House that there are adequate resources, that solemn, statutory obligation placed on him will place a very significant weapon in his hand in any negotiations he has with the Minister for Finance with a view to getting whatever extra staff are necessary to enforce the legislation.</P>
    <P>Far from causing a delay the amendment will provide the Minister with additional strength to get the staff necessary to ensure that this very important legislation is effectively enforced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is in joint names.  I will not go over the ground already covered by Deputy Bruton but I want to make additional points.  We are all concerned at the lack of respect in some cases for certain institutions of the State.  One example is in relation to the Office of Director of Consumer Affairs; every time a problem is discussed in relation to sale of goods, etc. the matter is referred to the Director of Consumer Affairs.  Anyone who takes time to read the director's report will see in it an element of total frustration in so far as resources are just not available to that office to fully investigate the issues referred to the director.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Bruton said, very strong measures are incorporated in the legislation which the members of the special committee and I agreed are there in the interests of proper order in our company law to protect the ordinary member of the public and those engaged in day-to-day business.  There are measures which could have a serious effect on the reputations of some company directors.  We had a good deal of discussion about this <Col N="31" /> in the select committee.  We discussed the fact that recordings of various events could be taken and unless subsequent evidence is produced to vindicate the person in question, records which could cause serious damage to the reputation of the individual concerned, would be kept.  That is what Deputy Bruton and I are talking about here.  We support the general principle of the Bill, we were involved in the long debate on it and we consider that it would be foolish to introduce some parts of this Bill without being entirely satisfied that we have the resources to pursue the measures incorporated in the legislation.</P>
    <P>During the Committee Stage debate it became obvious that the Department of Industry and Commerce are totally understaffed both in trying to draft this legislation and, eventually, in terms of pursuing the provisions incorporated in it.  Democracy is an expensive system and it can be cumbersome but if we are to have democracy it must work properly. We want certain things but we are not prepared to pay for what is necessary.  In relation to the total review of the public service and to the various agencies under the control of the State we will have to make up our minds that if we are to have laws we will need people to assist us in preparing the legislation and in enforcing it.</P>
    <P>We can pass legislation incorporating massive penalties to deal with directors who behave in a fraudulent fashion but ultimately the public will look to us to see to it that the legislation is implemented. Many public representatives have to agree with constituents that certain matters are covered by the legislation but have to say that because of cutbacks, shortage of staff or of Garda resources the law cannot be implemented.  It is pointless to pass this legislation without having the relevant resources to pursue cases of obvious abuse.</P>
    <P>In the past an amendment like this would be dropped if the Government of the day decided it was a bit of nonsense. I am asking all Members of the House to use this amendment to debate the real <Col N="32" /> issues involved in all our legislation.  We should consider whether we are protecting the democracy that has been handed to us and whether we are going to do anything about making sure resources are there to implement legislation.  The evidence in relation to company legislation to date is that we do not have the necessary resources and that neither do we have an indication that the resources will be forthcoming in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>If we are going to ask ordinary people doing their business in a proper fashion to spend large sums of money complying with this legislation, we must satisfy them that those who break the law will be brought before the courts.  Without disrespect to the fraud squad, for instance, they do not at the moment have personnel in sufficient numbers nor people trained to investigate cases under this legislation.  It is grand to have the laws, but will we have the people to implement them?  It is fine to say that the courts will decide on various issues, as we do regularly in this legislation, but we have to get the people before the courts before the court can decide.  At present we do not have the resources to bring people before the courts to protect the genuine business people working in accordance with the law but who are tarnished with the same brush as those who are blatantly in breach of the law.  Can the Minister assure us that before parts of this legislation are passed he will be satisfied that he will have the necessary personnel in his Department, particularly in a specialised area like company law, to do this sort of work?</P>
    <P>We spent many hours in the select committee working on this legislation and I now take the opportunity to compliment the officials who were beside whatever Minister was present throughout that debate.  We were conscious that at times, in frustration, Members of the Opposition may have said things they should not have said at those times in that they could reflect on the two gentlemen who continued to be present, but we recognised that they were operating in intolerable circumstances.  If my colleague, <Col N="33" /> Deputy Rabbitte, was their trade union representative things might have been different.  I doubt very much if anybody else would have put up with the abuse these people had to put up with without any prospect of change in the future.  I use this opportunity to say that, and also to say that we should not have a Director of Consumer Affairs if he will not have the resources to do the things that are necessary to comply with the law.</P>
    <P>I and others will continue to call for further changes through legislation under the control of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the interests of the public.  Those changes, if made, will give more work to the office of the Director of Consumer Affairs.  This may appear to be an insignificant amendment to some but it is the kernel of the whole Bill.  We want an assurance that before the Bill is passed we will be able to enforce its provisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Deputy's motives in tabling this amendment are very laudable, I cannot accept it for a number of reasons which I will instance now.  To begin with, who is to say what &ldquo;sufficient resources&rdquo; are for the purposes outlined in the amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Commonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I or my successor could easily make a statement to the effect that sufficient resources will be devoted to enforcement, but what benefit will that be to anyone?  Who will prove the Minister right or wrong in his statement?  To be frank, a Minister will not say that the resources to be made available for a specific area will not be sufficient, regardless of whether they will be sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second reason I oppose the amendment arises from its reference to &ldquo;the relevant State agencies&rdquo;.  While there is no such thing as a &ldquo;State agency&rdquo; we normally refer to State companies or boards as agencies but, of course, none of these is really relevant to this Bill. What other &ldquo;State agencies&rdquo; could the amendment be referring to &mdash; in other <Col N="34" /> words, what aspects of the State's machinery will have an enforcement role under the Bill?  The posibilities are very wide.  To begin with there is my Department, of course, and the Companies Registration Office.  However, there is also the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Chief State Solicitor and the Department of Justice, not to mention the Garda Síochána, the Judiciary and court officials, the Central Bank and perhaps several others as well.  Frankly, I think it is unrealistic and indeed unreasonable to expect any Minister to make a statement as sweeping in width as the amendment implies.</P>
    <P>The amendment also fails to take into account the fact that, under some Parts of the Bill, the State has a relatively minor role from the point of view of enforcement, or no role at all.  For example, under Part V, Insider Dealing, it will be the Stock Exchange that has the major role and, of course, that is not a State agency.  To take another example, under Part X the Minister may require a recognised accountancy body to enforce a code of standards for their members. Yet, the amendment would prohibit the Minister from bringing the provisions into effect since he would not be in a position to say that &ldquo;the relevant State agencies have sufficient resources to enforce the provisions&rdquo; involved.</P>
    <P>An even more fundamental problem arises with the concept of enforcement itself.  I have concentrated in my remarks so far only on the enforcement of provisions the breach of which is a criminal offence, but what of the host of provisions in the Bill which are totally civil in character? Take one provision totally at random &mdash; civil liability for fraudulent or reckless trading under section 136.  What enforcement role does the State have there? The answer is none.  However, if this amendment were passed, section 136 and many many more like it, simply could not be brought into effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this would be an absurd position to leave ourselves in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="35" /> Having said all this, and recording my opposition to the amendment, let me make a few general remarks to the House.  First of all, it is, of course, certainly true that we are in the Bill creating many new offences of various linds.  My general attitude is, however, that the law is there to be obeyed and we should expect the general population, including the general population of companies, to obey it &mdash; not for fear of being punished but because the Oireachtas has decided that the common good requires it.  Thus, I would not expect the State to have to employ a cast of thousands to look over the shoulders of every company in the country to ensure that they are complying with this requirement or that requirement. At the same time, the penalties set out in the Bill are intended to act as a deterrent to contraventions and I, for one, will not hesitate to prosecute in proper circumstances.  I am happy to give that assurance here and now.</P>
    <P>The second general comment I want to make is that wherever possible in the Bill I have tried to provide civil remedies for parties who may be aggrieved by wrongdoing, including potential personal liability for a company's debts.  This is in keeping with the philosophy that company law should, wherever possible, be self-enforcing to the greatest extent possible. In other words, the ideal would be to provide as many mechanisms as possible to allow the business community, in its widest sense, to sort out its own problems with a minimum of State interference.</P>
    <P>Returning to the question of State enforcement of the Bill's provisions, however, no one can be in any doubt about my policy, intentions or bona fides in this area.  I am extremely anxious &mdash; indeed some would say obsessed &mdash; with getting this Bill on the Statute Book and I am determined to see that it works.  Let no one be in any doubt about that.</P>
    <P>I suppose I should say at this stage in general terms, because it is the first amendment, that it is my anxiety and I am sure the anxiety of thousands of people that this Bill would be enacted at <Col N="36" /> the earliest possible moment.  I certainly hope we do not go into the Christmas recess without this final Stage having gone through this House and my being able to go to the Seanad with the amendments and asking it to accept them.</P>
    <P>Some recent events to which reference has been made by the two Deputies who have spoken have highlighted the necessity for the speedy passage of this Bill.  If there are imperfections in it &mdash; unquestionably in a Bill a long as this, 284 sections, there must be some imperfections &mdash; it is better that the Bill as a whole is enacted, even if it has some imperfections and falls short of the ideal in some respects, rather than let it go into what will be shortly its fifth year in the Oireachtas.  I hope we can avoid that situation.</P>
    <P>Without wishing to cause the debate to be too quick or too short or without wishing to cause amendments not to be fully debated, I hope that Members, especially the handful who will be involved, will share with me and many people anxiety to see this Bill enacted. For every day that it is not enacted there are all kinds of things going on that are not a breach of the law as it is at present. They should not be going on &mdash; I think we are all agreed on that &mdash; and we should make the law such that they can no longer go on.  If we have to amend this Bill next year we will amend it but I ask the House to let it be enacted by the end of this year and we will make the amendments next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a good deal of sympathy with the substance of this amendment for the reason that it is manifestly the case that we are grossly ineffectual in prosecuting white collar crime. It is also obvious that what is intended by the term &ldquo;State agencies&rdquo; in the amendment are completely under-resourced. For example, the origins of a great many actions which may now be contemplated under the new Bill spring from one's ability to establish certain information from the Companies Office.  I raised this point with the Minister during the course of the special committee's deliberations and my <Col N="37" /> memory is that he assured me things had certainly improved in the Companies Office.  I am equally assured by trade union colleagues who have occasion to resort on a frequent basis to the Companies Office that some improvements have been put in train but the day is still a long way off when the kind of up-to-date information which is essential if, for example, the new measure is to function as intended will be available, that records are hopelessly out-of-date and simple and essential information is not available to anybody pursuing it.</P>
      <P>Secondly, similar remarks may be made about the Fraud Squad.  Without in any way seeking to reflect on the members of the Fraud Squad, there seem to be definite questions about their technical capacity and their general expertise to deal with some of the matters we have dealt with on Committee Stage of this Bill.</P>
      <P>However, having said all that I must say I agree with the Minister that the absolute priority must be to enact this legislation as speedily as possible.  Anything that might be construed as in any way delaying the bringing into effect of the provisions of Parts of the Bill would be regrettable.  It seems the very vagueness the Minister spoke about in terms of adequate resources works to his benefit in the sense that he is free to make a judgment on that at any given time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overriding consideration must be that we have to admit that company law is hopelessly out of date.  I doubt if there are many Members of this House who have the required expertise which would enable them to say that this Bill is perfect or is deficient in a major way; it is extraordinarily complex legislation and one requires multi-disciplinary skills which very few of us have before one can comment on it authoritatively.  But what we do know is that the law is hopelessly out of date and as a former trade union official I have very frequently been left to pick up the pieces in situations where abuses and malpractices that ought to be illegal are not illegal at present and the trade union movement has been left grasping at straws sending deputations <Col N="38" /> to the Minister and going through the motions in circumstances where there has been evident wrongdoing but it is not possible under the law as it stands to bring the wrongdoers to justice.  Therefore this Bill is a major advance on that situation. It creates new offences and takes many of the practices that both Deputy Bell and I have personal experience of as trade union negotiators and makes them henceforth illegal.  There may indeed be a couple of other areas that could be added to that list but the fact remains that major progress is being made in this Bill, that some of the outrageous conduct in the corporate area will now be made amenable and that owners and officers of companies will be or rather can be made accountable.  I think that is major progress.</P>
    <P>Instances have been given already of the kind of thing we all have in mind.  A number of other outstanding examples could be given in support of the necessity for this legislation being enacted as speedily as possible&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I ask the Deputy to bear with me but on Report Stage we do as far as possible confine ourselves to the amendment and obviously to the section to which it refers.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your strictures, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, not to give the examples I intended giving but let me say this that in the electronic era the entire business we are dealing with is so complex, as evidenced for example, and I am not here imputing any illegal doing, by the case of the Goodman affair, that to follow the labyrinthine transactions requires a great deal of the resources which are available at present.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister any view on the latest submission from the accountancy bodies on the bringing into operation of this Bill?  Their view is that, if possible, the totality of the Bill should be brought into operation at the same time or at the very minimum the totality of a particular Part of the Bill should be brought into force at the one time rather than in a disjointed fashion having regard to the fact that many sections of the Bill interact with others.</P>
      <P>I agree that the amendment properly highlights our inability to adequately monitor, enforce and police the new powers under the Bill, and I have given two examples of this.  However, it is imperative that the Bill be enacted as speedily as possible and for that reason I will not be voting for the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>First, lest my badge be misunderstood, it is an ONE badge &mdash; the Organisation of National Ex-servicemen. It is green, white and yellow.  I do not know whether that has any significance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have some reservations about this amendment.  I share the Minister's view that we should be moving speedily through this Bill because possibly more hours have been spent on it already than any other legislation.  I should say that <Col N="42" /> the credit for most of the amendments which were passed on Committee Stage should go to Deputy Bruton who made the major contribution on Committee Stage.  By putting down amendments at this stage for the sake of it will only slow up the legislation and ensure that it will not be passed in this session and that it might never see the Statute Book.  If this amendment is accepted it would mean that the Department would actually have to prove they had the resources in every section to deal with a specific situation. If that were to be incorporated into all legislation which is put before the Houses of the Oireachtas we might have no Social Welfare Bill, no local government Bill and, indeed, we might have very little legislation because of the fact that voluntary redundancy and early retirement schemes have been introduced into the public service.  As a result of that and of the public service embargo it is well known that every section is under-staffed not alone in the Civil Service &mdash; the Departments of State &mdash; but in the semi-State sector.  That has been corrected here and there but in virtually every section of the public service if that type of amendment were in operation we would get nothing done.</P>
    <P>The main purpose should be to get this Bill enacted.  The list of amendments which were passed on Committee Stage has been circulated.  If this amendment is passed it will be virtually impossible to do anything under the terms of the Bill itself.  The all-party committee dealt with this type of situation very effectively by employing on an advisory basis professional people who had the necessary qualifications to bring forward preliminary reports, in other words, to do the ground work for the committee.  I do not see why that type of approach could not be adopted to deal initially with the type of investigation which might be required under the provisions of the Bill, investigate the collapse of a company or any fraud that may be alleged following the collapse of a company.  I do not think the Fraud Squad will have the resources now, or in the immediate <Col N="43" /> future, to be able to deal with this very comprehensive legislation.  In my opinion they do not have the necessary staffing but that is a matter for the Minister for Justice and probably a number of other Departments.  Equally, there are other agencies who will be involved and who will not have the resources initially to deal with it.</P>
    <P>The amendment is very useful from the point of view that it allows us to highlight this situation which was generally known professionally, as well as politically, within the country.  I respectfully suggest, that rather than delay further the enactment of this legislation, Deputy Bruton would consider withdrawing the amendment on the basis that we support the principal behind it but the practical enactment of that amendment would make the Bill or, indeed, any other legislation impossible to operate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Opposition speakers who have said there is not much point in having legislation on the Statute Book unless there are sufficient resources to ensure that that legislation is enforced.  On balance I think the amendment is unnecessary and I would be opposed to it.  Reference has been made to the Committee Stage of the Bill which was debated by a special committee of which I had the honour to be a member.  Generally speaking, that committee worked well together.  There were, of course, as is inevitable in any multi-party committee, differences of opinion, heated exchanges, allegations and accusations from time to time but despite that there was one thing which nobody on that committee from any side of the House sought to allege &mdash; nobody sought to allege that the present Minister is less than 100 per cent determined to have this legislation on the Statute Book and to see it enforced effectively.  The Minister must be complimented on that. He has brought this legislation further than any of the three, four or five Ministers who have had the legislation on their desk.  If we need further evidence of his determination in this regard we find it in the fact that the Report Stage of this <Col N="44" /> Bill is the first item we have to deal with on the day the Dáil resumes.</P>
      <P>Many of the changes mentioned by Deputy Rabbitte and Deputy Bell &mdash; welcome though they were &mdash; are changes which give people the right to take civil actions against certain other people arising out of the liquidation or collapse of companies.  We all know that one of the main defects in Irish company law as it exists at present arises from the fact that people can set up companies, can incur debts and can walk away from their liabilities without any fear of being pursued. The Bill makes radical changes in that regard.  It allows people who are blame-worthy to some extent not only to be prosecuted but to be sued civilly.  The under-funding or otherwise of State agencies is totally irrelevant to that.  It is a welcome and a necessary change and one that has been welcomed right across the board and right across the political spectrum.</P>
      <P>The question of white collar crime &mdash; which Deputy Rabbitte and Deputy Bruton touched on &mdash; is a major problem that has to be taken on as a matter of urgency.  As has been mentioned, it will need a specialised squad within the Garda and it will also need several other legal changes, such as changes in the laws of evidence.  I am availing of this opportunity to impress upon the Government that this is an area that needs to be tackled urgently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the amendment is accepted it will impose on the Minister for Industry and Commerce &mdash; whoever that Minister may be &mdash; an obligation to come before the House and make a statement that he now had adequate resources to ensure that whatever part of the Bill he was enacting would be enforceable.  As the Minister has said, that is an entirely subjective matter.  A Minister can come to the House and state, with the utmost good faith, that he now has adequate resources and subsequently, for one reason or another, than may not turn out to be the case.  No Minister wants to be caught in that position.  Because of that I fear if this amendment is written into the Bill it would delay unduly the implementation <Col N="45" /> of certain necessary reforms which everybody wants to see on the Statute Book. Writing in an amendment such as this into the legislation is unprecedented.  That is not necessarily a fatal argument against it, but because of the context in which the Bill was introduced it is inappropriate in this case.</P>
    <P>I have every confidence in the bona fides of the Minister in this regard.  I understand what the Opposition are saying.  I have some sympathy with their case but ultimately the amendment in this context is inappropriate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is designed to require the Minister to take formal responsibility in his own name for a statement that there are adequate resources available to enforce the legislation. There is common cause in this House that there is no point in enacting legislation if it is not enforced.  Both Deputy Bell and Deputy Rabbitte have said that, as of this moment, the resources to enforce this legislation are not adequate.  I am very surprised to hear two former trade union officials, Deputies Rabbitte and Bell, pass an opportunity of putting pressure on a Minister to ensure the adequacy of staffing.  If this amendment is passed it places a lever in the hands of the trade unions representing officials in the Fraud Squad, the Companies Registration Office, the staff of the offices of the DPP and the Chief State Solicitor.  All of them would be given by this amendment a lever whereby they would be able to say to the Minister that he must take political responsibility, before bringing the legislation into effect, to ensure that they have adequate staff to enforce it.  I am surprised that two Deputies, who have such renowned practical experience &mdash; and I use those words advisedly and justly &mdash; of the problem of understaffing in the public service and of the phenomenon of passing empty legislation which cannot be enforced due to lack of staff, should fail to take an opportunity, not of stopping the legislation from being brought in since clearly the Minister, if he is determined, will give the certificate that there are adequate <Col N="46" /> staff available, but of making him take political responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>He must do that anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has no political responsibility currently for the DPP's Office or the Chief State Solicitor's office, for example.  This amendment would require him before bringing this legislation into effect to get an assurance from other Ministers who are responsible for staffing the bodies charged with enforcing the legislation that the staff will be there to enforce it.  It would give the Minister a lever to ensure that all resources were marshalled where required within the Governmental system to ensure that this legislation is effective.</P>
      <P>The Minister asked who is to say whether the resources are adequate.  The answer is that the Minister is to say the resources are adequate.  How is he to know?  By exercising his political judgment &mdash; that is why he is a Minister. He has been conferred with an office of responsibility requiring judgment.  His judgment, and his political reputation, will be put on the line to ensure there are adeqate resources to enforce this legislation. I see nothing wrong with making the Minister take political responsibility for the adequacy of enforcement.  That is why I am surprised that this amendment has not received more support from other Opposition parties.  In a year or two we will hear from those parties that this or that fraud was not investigated adequately or that this or that prosecution was not being taken under this legislation.  If they come forward with those arguments I will remind them that they had the opportunity of placing firm responsibility on the Minister to ensure before bringing the legislation into effect that the staff were there to obviate the possibility of any such failures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister advanced a number of arguments against this proposal.  He referred to the fact that other bodies which are not State agencies are responsible for the enforcement of some of the <Col N="47" /> legislation.  That is not a problem.  The Minister's certificate only relates to the adequacy of resources in State agencies. The Minister is not required by any possible construction of this amendment to make a certificate about the adequacy of arrangements for enforcement in those bodies which are not State agencies.  The amendment relates only to State agencies.  The Minister's argument is spurious.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that part of this legislation relates to civil proceedings that would have to be taken by individuals to enforce rights under the legislation.  In so far as civil proceedings were being financed by private individuals the Minister would not be required under the amendment to make any certificate as to the adequacy of personal resources of any person who might at some stage take proceedings under this legislation.  Such persons are not State agencies.  The amendment does not refer to private individuals.  There is no question of the Minister being required under this amendment to make any certificate in regard to civil proceedings taken by private individuals with their own resources.  However, there is one area in which the Minister might have to make a certificate before the legislation could come into force.  That is in regard to the availability of civil legal aid to private individuals who may have been wronged by the activities of a particular company and may as a result be impoverished or bankrupt, unable to afford to take civil actions themselves.</P>
    <P>This House and this State stand condemned by the European Court of Human Rights for the inadequacy of our civil legal aid provisions.  This Bill, in regard to civil actions to enforce its provisions, is a rich man's Bill.  People without financial resources will not have the means to take advantage of any of the remedies contained in the Bill because we <Col N="48" /> do not have civil legal aid on an adequate scale.  The Civil Legal Aid Board are a State agency within the meaning of this amendment.  The House is being given an opportunity in the amendment to say to the Minister that he must ensure before bringing the legislation into effect that adequate arrangements exist so that poor people who do not have sufficient resources of their own to finance expensive legal proceedings can get remedies under this Bill by virtue of having an adequate system of civil legal aid.  This is something we have already been told in this House by the European Court in the Airey case.  This amendment would put further pressure on the Government to bring in an adequate system of civil legal aid so that the civil remedies would be available not just to the rich but also to the poor who cannot afford the services of a lawyer.  I would hope that on those arguments the amendment would be supported.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea spoke rightly, and the Minister spoke self-praisingly, of the Minister's commitment to this legislation. I have not questioned it but I do question the Minister's rather occasional involvement with this legislation and his tendency when he involved himself on Committee Stage to come in, preach a sermon about the delays of other Members in dealing with the legislation and then leave.  That is a matter for himself.</P>
    <P>This amendment is crucially important because there is a disease in this body politic of enacting legislation which we do not enforce.  This amendment will not delay the legislation since I have no doubt the Minister will give the certificate, in view of his self-proclaimed commitment. The amendment would clearly place political responsibility on the Minister to ensure that resources exist adequately to enforce the legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 15, lines 9 to 13, and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  (a)  A recognised stock exchange for the purposes of any <Col N="51" /> provision of the Companies Acts is an exchange prescribed by the Minister for the purposes of that section.</P>
    <P>(b)  The definition of &lsquo;recognised stock exchange&rsquo; in paragraph (a) is in substitution for the definition in section 2 (1) of the Principal Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The reason for this amendment is somewhat technical.  In section 2 of the 1963 Act what is called a recognised stock exchange is defined as a &ldquo;stock exchange prescribed by the Minister for the purposes of each provision in which those words appear&rdquo;.  This meant that every time a Companies Bill containing references to a stock exchange was enacted, including the 1963 Act itself, the Minister had to make a new order prescribing which exchanges were recognised stock exchanges for the purpose of those provisions, and such orders were made in 1964 and 1975.</P>
    <P>Under section 3 (2) of the present Bill, once the Minister prescribed the stock exchange it would no longer be necessary for him to make a further specific recognition order each time a new Companies Act containing a reference to a stock exchange was enacted.  When this section was originally drafted, however, the only existing exchange in the State was the Irish Stock Exchange.  Since then, of course, we have seen the establishment of the Irish Futures and Options Exchange (IFOE) which is entirely separate from the Irish Stock Exchange and other exchanges may emerge in future. In these circumstances I am satisfied that it will be necessary to retain the type of flexibility which the Minister had under the Principal Act so that different exchanges can be recognised for different provisions, and these proposed amendments will restore such flexibility.</P>
    <P>The second subsection will ensure that nothing done up to now by a recognised stock exchange can be called into question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the actual recognition of a stock exchange is <Col N="52" /> a matter for the Minister for Finance, not the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and that what we are talking about here is the recognition of that stock exchange secondarily, so to speak, for the purpose of the companies legislation.  It is not the principal act of recognition, is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is not correct. The only recognising authority for the stock exchange is the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is grand.  Let me avail of the opportunity first to welcome the amendment for the flexibility it gives to the recognition of new stock exchanges.  Can the Minister give any indication whether there are other exchanges in the process of establishment which might be recognised in the future under these provisions?  I am thinking particularly of the proposed European Market type exchange or futures exchange which it was hoped would be established initially in the Ambassador Cinema building and subsequently in the Dublin Financial Services Centre.  Will the Minister in reply indicate the present position in regard to the European Market type exchange?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Mercantile Exchange is a body which I was very concerned as Minister for Finance to have established here.  If it is established, it will give somewhere in the region of 1,000 jobs in Dublin in full operation.  Futures trading has become increasingly important in the world at large.  It is important that Ireland, being in the time zone that it is in, should establish itself as a centre for futures trading.  Some of the people involved in the proposed establishment of the European Mercantile Exchange are already heavily involved in the Chicago Futures Exchange and I know that they had discussions with various Ministers with a view to having this very substantial employer brought to Dublin. The Minister should give some indication about the state of play in regard to this proposal and, indeed, in regard to any <Col N="53" /> other proposals which might be recognised under this section.</P>

It has been under consideration for some time but I am not aware that it is imminent.  I assume there will be further dealings in futures and in commodities.  There is also the possibility that the Irish Stock Exchange might consider the possibility of dealing in traded options.</P>

      <P>In page 15, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  The Minister may make regulations in relation to any matter referred to in this Act as prescribed or to be prescribed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Provision is made for the Minister to prescribe certain matters and in section 3 &ldquo;prescribe&rdquo; is defined to mean prescribed by regulation.  I am advised, however, that technically speaking this is not enough and that it is necessary to give the Minister the power to make the regulations involved.  This is what this amendment will do.  It is self-evident that it would be advisable to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="54" /> I will deal with whatever Deputy Bruton has to say about amendment No. 3 (a).  I feel I should make the point, although it is really a matter for the Chair, that amendment No. 3 (a) was put down at 12.05 p.m. today.  At least that is when my Department got it.  I do not mind, but if we are to have huge numbers of amendments put down on each day the House sits for the purposes of a Report Stage &mdash; I say this as gently as I can knowing the incredible sensitivities of Deputy Bruton &mdash; we will be heading into the dim and distant future when this Bill is passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it very difficult to do business with Deputy O'Malley because he becomes very arrogant in his approach to people who happen to serve on the Opposition.  It is totally contrary to the image he tried to portray of a new open government when he was leading the Progressive Democrats and touring the country telling us that we were going to have a new style of politics.  Deputy O'Malley is well aware of the fact that this Bill finished last July and that he, and his Department, had three-and-a-half months to table amendments to this Bill but he chose to table amendments on Friday last.  He may say he has no resources available to him but he should see what we have.  I find his arrogance quite disturbing, to say the least of it.  It is nothing short of arrogance.  We get lectures from him on a regular basis.  One has only to look at the record of the Committee Stage debate on the Bill to see that the same Minister only appeared twice or three times and sent in his Minister of State to deal with most other amendments.  The sooner he gives up this <Col N="55" /> personal abuse of members of the Opposition the better for everybody concerned. It did not take him too long to become as arrogant as he used be once he got back into the bed he came from.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is quite simple.  Deputy O'Malley should not need his officials to hold him by the hand on each occasion.  All he has to do is read.  It is quite simple.  It provides that if the Minister wants to take this power to make regulations in relation to any matter referred to in this Act, copies of such regulations should be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and should not come into effect until a resolution approving them has been passed by each House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see what sort of advice the Minister needs to get from his Department on that or why it matters what time this amendment was put down.  It simply asks that the Minister respect the Houses of the Oireachtas, whose Members were elected, when he is taking this extraordinary power to make regulations on anything connected with this legislation.  I do not think a politician needs a lot of advice to understand the reasons behind that.  It is quite simple.  There is no basic objection to the Minister having this power but if he is taking such wide powers he should come before both Houses with his regulations to have them approved.  I see nothing extraordinary about that and I ask my colleagues to support this amendment. We are elected representatives and if we are to stand over regulations made on our behalf by the Minister we should at least have the opportunity to look at them and, if necessary, debate them.  If there is nothing extraordinary about any of the regulations then the wisdom of the House will prevail and they will pass through, on the nod if necessary.  There <Col N="56" /> may, however, be occasions when the House may wish to debate some of the regulations that the Minister will be making in relation to this legislation.  I would therefore appeal to our colleagues on this side of the House to support the amendment in the names of Deputy John Bruton and myself.</P>

      <P>I am sorry I missed the exchange during the few minutes I was absent.  I do not know if it was relevant. I am entirely in sympathy with the amendment in the names of Deputies Barrett and J. Bruton.  It is the kind of amendment with which you will be familiar and which my party put down regularly on major legislation.  Otherwise we would be handing over entirely to the Minister concerned the power to bring in regulations that are of major moment without an opportunity being given to either House to comment on them.  I am prepared to accept the bona fides of the amendment in the terms expressed.  I do not see it as intending to slow down the making of regulations in respect of this legislation; it is merely that the House would have the opportunity to consider whatever regulation the Minister wishes to introduce.</P>
      <P>Let us recall that in the context of this enormous piece of legislation some regulations that can be contemplated under the Bill are very wide in their scope and very far-reaching in their effect.  It is eminently reasonable to ask that they ought to be placed before the House and that the Members would have an opportunity to comment, not for any purpose of delaying the implementation or bringing into effect of any particular aspect of the Bill but that we would have the opportunity as elected Members of this House to comment on it.  I certainly will be supporting the Fine Gael amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Here again I do not disagree with the sentiments expressed in the resolution but there is a number of matters that would have to be clarified in relation to the actual wording of the amendment. I agree with my colleague in relation to the desire for this type of mechanism <Col N="57" /> because there are quite a number of regulations being introduced.  For example, we do not know what regulations are being introduced under social welfare legislation until somebody comes to our clinic to make a complaint about some new regulation that has been issued to managers in employment exchanges. That is just one example and I could give a number of others.  This is a very important Bill and the regulations could have very wide ranging effects on how the legislation is implemented.</P>
      <P>I have a certain amount of sympathy with the amendment.  What does the Oireachtas do when a regulation is introduced in the House?  It is tabled and circulated.  Do we have anything other than the right to debate it?  Does this amendment mean that every regulation that is enacted under any Bill would have to come before the House for formal debate and formal vote?  What concerns me is the practical side, how it could possibly operate.  We certainly would not want to be absent from the House for 14 weeks if that mechanism was in place. We would want to spend a fair portion of that 14 weeks discussing the dozens, maybe hundreds of regulations that are issued under various legislation.</P>
      <P>While I agree with the sentiments expressed in the amendment and the desirability of having some form of input into the regulations, I do not see what we can do with those regulations under existing procedures other than talk about them.  Under this amendment, if passed, we would have the right to put down a formal amendment to the regulations issued under the legislation.  I would like a clear definition of that aspect.</P>

      <P>First, to answer Deputy Bell's point, the amendments proposed by Deputy Barrett are part of a long established form of order making.  It requires an affirmative resolution to be introduced to approve the regulation and when that resolution has been passed the regulation comes into effect.  There is no possibility of amendments to the regulations under that procedure; it is simply <Col N="58" /> a case of approving or disapproving the regulations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulation is not made and the Minister has to come back and make a different regulation, or make no regulation at all, but it has to be approved.  Deputy Barrett and I are concerned that the Minister could make substantive changes of policy that are not accountable to this House.  Requiring that the regulation be approved here means the Minister has to come in and explain what he is doing and why.  The other procedure which the Minister is providing in his amendment is simply that a regulation be lodged in the Library and as long as it is there for 21 sitting days, irrespective of whether it is discussed, whether anybody reads it, whether it is good, bad or indifferent, it becomes law. I recognise that if every regulation that is introduced has to be put to the floor of this House there would be some problems but there should be some system of political overseeing of regulations of this kind.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael proposals to amend the procedures of this House suggest that we establish three grand committees &mdash; an economic affairs committee, a social affairs committee and a general affairs committee.  If there were to be discussions on particular regulations it would probably be more appropriate to do so in the normal course at a committee meeting of that kind without debate here. Pending the establishment of such committees the only way of having any political overseeing of the regulations the Minister might make is through the mechanism proposed by Deputy Barrett.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the Minister could have circulated these amendments earlier.  He is wrong to criticise the Opposition for responding.  At least we put down this amendment to his amendment within three days of seeing his amendment.  He had the entire summer to table his ministerial amendments but did not do so until four days, including a weekend, <Col N="59" /> before the Bill was to be debated in this House.  It is not just the Opposition who are inconvenienced by this.  All the various professional bodies who were anxious to make submissions about improvements in the legislation were inconvenienced because they could not make their submissions until they saw the Minister's amendments.  The position now is that we may well put through bad legislation.  It is not as if the Minister did not have time; he had the entire summer to lodge these amendments if he so wished.</P>
    <P>It is not a question of my &mdash; to use the Minister's term &mdash; legendary sensitivity in this matter.  All I am sensitive about is giving this House an opportunity to do its job.  I know when the Minister is in government he has a perspective of this House which may be different from that when he is in Opposition.  When he is in Opposition he can see very clearly the need for parliamentary accountability; when in government however he can see administrative convenience as his guiding principle.  If there is a balance to be struck, it is important that it be in favour of accountability.  That is the purpose, and would be the consequence, of Deputy Barrett's amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer Deputies to paragraph 5.7 of the report of the New Ireland Forum, which was endorsed by all the parties participating in it, who, of course, had full regard to the relevant parts of the Constitution.  The paragraph states:</P>
      <P>The particular structure of political unity which the Forum would wish to see established is a unitary state, achieved by agreement and consent, embracing the whole island of Ireland and providing irrevocable guarantees for the protection and preservation of both the Nationalist and Unionist identities&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As I have said before it is not possible, at Question Time, to attempt to set out any exhaustive set of steps towards achievement of the Forum objectives, except to say that such measures would in my view have to meet the requirements set out in Chapter 5 of the Forum report.</P>
      <P>These requirements would, among others, include a total cessation of violence which can have no place in the building of the Ireland of the future that we all desire; constructive dialogue with Unionists in Northern Ireland; accommodation of the two traditions, their aspirations and their loyalties and an all-round constitutional conference to formulate new structures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have made it clear that I categorically reject any idea of achieving unity by force or imposing the jurisdiction of this State on the six counties of Northern Ireland. The Supreme Court judgment of last March confirmed that the enactment of laws for that area by the Oireachtas is expressly prohibited in Article 3.  Nor can our Constitution ever be invoked by anyone to justify the use of force to achieve the purposes of Articles 2 and 3, <Col N="61" /> because the means by which unity might be achieved are clearly set out in Article 29 which affirms Ireland's devotion to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation among nations and its adherence to the principle of the peaceful settlement of international disputes.</P>
    <P>I have made clear on a number of occasions my conviction that new arrangements or structures which might be agreed for Ireland as a whole would clearly require an entirely new Constitution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure we all echo the remarks of the Taoiseach in relation to the non-use of force or violence in terms of any aspirations on this island.  They are also glaringly obvious in relation to what is happening at the moment, which was referred to in the House earlier.  Does the Taoiseach consider that the constitutional imperatives contained in Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution &mdash; and referred to in the Supreme Court case he mentioned of last year &mdash; are compatible with the realities of life in Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear on the implications of the question.  My view of the Constitution is as I have set out and the important thing from that point of view is the part of my answer which says that the Supreme Court has confirmed that the enactment of laws for that area by the Oireachtas is expressly prohibited in Article 3 and that the use of force can never be justified by Articles 2 and 3 because the means by which unity might be achieved are clearly set out in Article 29.  That is the important one from the point of view of these two questions. Article 29 affirms Ireland's devotion to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation among nations and its adherence to the principle of the peaceful settlement of international disputes.</P>

They regard this claim on their territory as unjustified and it is not acceptable to them.  In order to have a realistic relationship with the people of Northern Ireland it is necessary to address that concern and, therefore, it is not adequate to say that in the context of a united Ireland or an all-Ireland constitutional convention &mdash; or some such procedure &mdash; we will address their fears because, clearly, they do not want to be part of a united Ireland.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>

      <Quest>the total cost of his new suite of offices in the College of Science building, Merrion Street, Dublin 2.</Quest>
      <QRef>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The College of Science complex contains some of the most historic and important public buildings in Dublin city.</P>
      <P>The college itself was completed in 1911.  By 1922, when British rule had ended, the complex had been extended to Merrion Street to incorporate Government Buildings which became the seat of the Executive Council of the new State.</P>
      <P>For many years subsequently the college housed the School of Engineering attached to University College, Dublin, while the surrounding buildings were used by Government Departments, including the Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance and Agriculture, and the Attorney General's Office.</P>
      <P>When the Engineering School transferred to the Belfield campus, the Government decided to have the College of Science refurbished as part of their programme of restoring major public buildings such as Dublin Castle, the Custom House and the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The entire series of interlinking buildings are of great national and historic importance and this project is the first major refurbishment of the complex since the foundation of the State.  The work involves re-equipping the buildings to modern standards, in keeping with their role as the centre of Government. The Government decided also, as part of this scheme, to provide substantial additional accommodation for Members and staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In <Col N="65" /> March of this year, following consideration of tenders from a number of contractors, the Office of Public Works placed a contract with McInerney Contracting Ltd., who put in the lowest bid, for the total refurbishment of the former college premises, including the engineering block building at the rear of the college.</P>
    <P>The value of the contract is £13.2 million, excluding VAT and professional fees of which approximately £6.5 million will be paid out in wages.  It would not be possible to isolate the exact cost of the Department of the Taoiseach's accommodation from the overall project costs. There will be some savings in rents and a significant portion of the total cost of the refurbishment work will be recouped through the sale of older Government properties in Merrion Street.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Taoiseach will take possession of part of the refurbished building at the end of this year.  They will have the same number of offices as before with the addition of some extra conference and press briefing rooms.  As a consequence of that move, the Attorney General's Office will take over extra rooms in the north block of Government Buildings to accommodate additional legal staff currently being recruited.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance will be allocated most of the offices currently occupied by the Department of the Taoiseach in Government Buildings and will, in exchange, release other premises at present occupied by them mainly to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>As a consequence of the project, the Dáil will gain much-needed space in the refurbished engineering block building as well as more accommodation in Kildare House and accommodation at present occupied by them in Merrion Square &mdash; and by the Department of Finance in Upper Merrion Street &mdash; will also be released.</P>
    <P>In summary, the project involves a major reorganisation and modernisation of the seat of Government and Dáil accommodation arrangements.  The Houses of the Oireachtas, the Departments of the Taoiseach and Finance and <Col N="66" /> the Attorney General's Office will all benefit from the project.  In addition, the State will be in a position to release accommodation in other areas as a consequence of the refurbishment works.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fascinating piece of history, but it does not answer the question.  I would like to know the extra cost of moving the Taoiseach's office from its present location to the proposed new location and I would like to know how much less extra accommodation will be made available for the Houses of the Oireachtas than was provided for in the original plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand the latter part of the Deputy's question, but the net gain to the Houses of the Oireachtas will be 11,780 square feet and it will mean a major improvement in the accommodation of the Deputies and Senators.  It is not possible to isolate the exact cost involved in the new accommodation for the Taoiseach's Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that if the Taoiseach's suite of offices were to remain where it is now and not occupy a proportion of that building under the central dome, there would then be more room available for the Houses of the Oireachtas and Deputies for the first time would have adequate working accommodation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>I would demur with the suggestion that the accommodation we had was inadequate; only someone with a sense of grandiosity would want to move from it, but that is by the way.  Will the Taoiseach say what proportion of the additional space made available by the departure of the engineering faculty has been made available to the Houses?  The Taoiseach will recall that plans I had prepared involved all the additional space going to the House which badly needs it. How much accommodation that would have come to the House under those plans has the House been deprived of by the Taoiseach's decision to use it for other purposes?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 8, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will recall that as early as last January I said that while continuing to work the Anglo-Irish Agreement fully, the Irish Government would be prepared to contemplate, in agreement with the British Government, a new and better structure, agreement or arrangement to transcend the existing one.  That has remained the position of the Irish Government.  It is also our position that as co-signatories of the agreement, the Irish Government must be directly involved in discussions about any new arrangement to transcend it.</P>
      <P>I should like to emphasise again that it is our wish that a sound basis should be agreed as soon as possible on which talks offering a prospect for progress can take place.  Obviously, because of the extremely sensitive nature of the subject I do not wish to recite the details of the discussions that have taken place or say anything that would impede the process. However, the Deputies can take it that the Government's position on the talks has been clear and consistent throughout and that we have been doing everything possible to enhance the prospects for progress. The whole process is the subject of continuing discussions between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>I seek clarification from the Taoiseach in regard to Question No. 8 and his answer.  Does the Taoiseach not consider that the direct intervention by the Minister for Foreign Affairs before the statement by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in the House of Commons last July has led to the perception that this Government intend to pursue a policy of vetoing the progress of talks on the future administration of Northern Ireland?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no hesitation in saying that that is a total and complete misrepresentation of the position.  I fail to see why Deputy Spring should take that attitude when this Government, probably of all the parties concerned, are pursuing the most constructive role in regard to these talks.  We are a bit inhibited because we do not wish to rush to the newspapers every day giving our side of the affair: we think the process is more important than defending our role in the negotiations.  I can assure the Deputy that what he said is a travesty of what happened.  Naturally the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland sought agreement all round on his statement, and not just from the Irish Government. There were very good reasons why there were a number of objections to the statement of the Secretary of State.  One of our criticisms was that the Secretary of State unfortunately put a deadline on himself.  That has not interfered at all with the process and in spite of the <i>contretemps</i> which happened at that time in regard to that statement which was not vetoed by us in any way &mdash; neither did we attempt to stop the Secretary of State from making it &mdash; we and, to be fair to him, the Secretary of State have made <Col N="77" /> every effort and have been successful in keeping the process going.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach began by recalling a statement of his last January and I would like to take the liberty of drawing his attention again to a statement I made in this House in October last year which I think was a part of the beginning of that process.  May I ask the Taoiseach if it is the case that the main difficulty facing those involved in the talks now is the question as to at what point the Irish Government will become involved in a particular segment of those talks?  If that is the case has the Taoiseach given any consideration to the following proposition, which is, as I understand it, accepted by all the parties involved in the talks; nothing can be agreed unless everybody agrees to it?  If that is the case, has the Taoiseach given any consideration to what the implications of that might be for the point at which any particular party gets involved?</P>

      <P>It is widely believed, as Deputy Dukes has outlined, that the difficulty from the point of view of the Taoiseach and the Government is the point at which our Government would get involved in the talks.  As we have not been afforded the courtesy of a briefing in recent months by the Taoiseach, despite requests, we can only take the information we require from the newspapers. In New York recently the Taoiseach seemed to indicate to journalists that he was prepared to change his position, and that of the Government, on the so-called timetable for talks in Northern Ireland. Will the Taoiseach clarify, as reported by journalists at that press briefing, if he is prepared to change his position as outlined by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the Secretary of State in July?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 9 to 17, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I was informed on 18 August 1990 by the Investment Bank of Ireland in their capacity as financial advisers to Goodman International that the financial situation at Goodman International was so serious that, in the absence of support from the State in a tangible form, it was very likely that the company's operations would have to be liquidated.  They explained that, as a result of the Middle East crisis, bankers to the company had threatened to withdraw or refused to renew facilities available to the company; that some banks had advised that they would start proceedings for recovery of loans on the following Monday, and that there were no other available facilities to meet these demands.</P>
      <P>The liquidation of Goodman International, particularly approaching the peak beef processing season, would have caused very serious losses in jobs, farm incomes and exports and would have gravely damaged the economy as a whole. I, therefore, immediately summoned a meeting of available relevant Ministers and senior officials to consider these grave implications for workers, farmers and the economy generally and whether there was any action the Government could properly and prudently take to alleviate the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="82" /> This group evaluated the situation as being one with wider implications for the beef industry than the problems of Goodman International.  The high cyclical point being reached in Irish beef production, at a time when market outlets were affected by the Middle East crisis and the fall in consumption due to consumer concerns arising from the BSE problem in the UK, combined to create difficulties for all beef processors and seriously threatened employment in the industry and the incomes of farmers already faced with weak cattle prices.</P>
    <P>It was decided that as a matter of principle the State should not provide any financial support or guarantee to Goodman International as had been asked for by the company's financial advisers.</P>
    <P>The group also decided that the Government should increase their efforts to persuade the European Commission to improve the various market support measures, including intervention, in order to help overcome these temporary difficulties.  Chief among these measures was the operation of the safety net intervention system which the Minister for Agriculture and Food had already negotiated with the Commission whereby, where certain market conditions apply in at least three regions, intervention offers for steer beef are automatically accepted in these regions.  This automatic intervention system was applied to Ireland and has been extremely helpful in maintaining demand for cattle in the current difficult trading conditions.  It was also noted that the efforts already in train by the Minister for Agriculture and Food to re-open the Iranian and Libyan markets could, if successful, also help in the current trading situation.  As the House is aware, the Minister has since visited Iran and Libya and is confident that these markets will be re-opened to our trade.</P>
    <P>The group also decided that additional resources be provided in the Department of Agriculture and Food to ensure that no bottlenecks existed in the release of securities in respect of intervention and export sales and that close liaison was maintained with all the firms concerned to ensure that documentation is <Col N="83" /> presented in a way that facilitates the earliest possible release of securities. These measures have been of benefit to all major meat processors.</P>
    <P>The group further decided that, in the current acute trading circumstances, it would be prudent and proper for the Government to seek to have the provisions of Part IX of the Companies Bill, which was at Report Stage in the Dáil, having been passed by the Seanad, enacted urgently as a separate piece of legislation in order to provide an alternative to liquidation or receivership in accordance with modern company law throughout the world.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the only measures and actions taken by the Government which relate to the difficulties of Goodman International and to the trading difficulties generally in the beef industry.  I should also mention that full details of the information available to the Government on the situation pertaining to the Goodman Group were given to the House by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the special session of 28 August 1990, when the legislation was passed with the support of the entire House.</P>
    <P>I believe the House can be satisfied that the enactment of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990 has enabled the beef processing jobs and the farm incomes dependent on Goodman International to be maintained pending the evaluation being made by the examiner appointed by the High Court as to whether the enterprise can be restored to viability.  The House will also wish to note that two other companies have since applied to the High Court for the appointment of an examiner.</P>
    <P>The actions taken by the Government were, therefore, of a nature to be of assistance to firms generally.  No special aid or assistance was given to Goodman International.  This contrasts with the fact that we have seen in this House very radical and specific State measures and actions taken by the Fine Gael/Labour Government to rescue important private sector companies.  I refer to the PMPA and the ICI.  I would like to remind the <Col N="84" /> House that my party in Opposition facilitated the speedy passage of the necessary legislation in the national interest, and did not seek to turn those matters into party political issues.  I may also point out that there is hardly a Deputy who has not, at some time or another, urged in this House, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Labour, the Minister for Industry and Commerce or other relevant Ministers to intervene, including the provision of financial support, to prevent enterprises in difficulties from closing down with serious loss of jobs and grave consequences for the national and local economies.</P>
    <P>In my view the decision of this House to enact the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990 has helped, temporarily at least, to maintain in operation a company which is of such importance for a large segment of our beef industry.  In a report prepared for the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> it is made clear that our beef industry is a £1.2 billion a year industry, representing 36 per cent of gross agricultural output, and directly employing nearly 4,500 persons in slaughtering and processing.  It is an industry that has been developed in the past 20 years from a situation in which live cattle exports represented nearly half our exports to today's representation of only 11 per cent. Goodman International and other meat processors have been responsible for that profound economic and social transformation. We are uniquely dependent on our beef exports in that we export about 85 per cent of our production compared to about 10 to 15 per cent for the Community as a whole.  These figures should bring home to everyone in this House, if they are not already familiar with them, how responsible and concerned we have to be to ensure that the developed state to which this industry has been brought is maintained and expanded.</P>
    <P>As regards communications with Commissioner MacSharry in regard to the problems of the beef sector, I have explained that representations were made to him and his officials to ensure <Col N="85" /> that the intervention mechanism already in place was made fully operational.  I am glad to say that the Commission has been most helpful and efficient in operating that mechanism.  Any other action that Commissioner MacSharry felt it beneficial to take because of his deep concern for the welfare, not just of Irish farmers but of all the farmers of the Community, and his responsibilities in relation to the EC beef sector in particular, was taken by him solely on the basis of the information available to him and his assessment of the critical situation that obtained.  But I will say that, if any action of his resulted in Goodman International not being liquidated, he deserves the warmest congratulations from every responsible Deputy in this House and from the workers and farmers whose livelihoods and incomes were bound up with the viability of Goodman International.  I would say further that any action taken by the Dutch Minister for Agriculture which was beneficial to our national interests is something for which we should be grateful.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would commend to the House the statements made by the ICTU, the CII, the IFA and ICMSA expressing their grave concern at the difficulties facing Goodman International and their hope that with the co-operation of the financial institutions involved it would be possible to maintain the close to 2,000 jobs in the Goodman processing plants and to retain the market outlets for the thousands of farmers who supply these plants.  The Government agree fully with these views of the social partners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has taken nine questions together and he has barely touched on the matters raised in any single one of those questions and not on anything else.  I find that is total obfuscation, that is not answering questions.  I would like to point out also, a Cheann Comhairle, because the Taoiseach brought this in as a new red herring in this affair, that the action that was taken in relation to the PMPA, ICI and other companies that he has mentioned, bears no comparison whatever with what was <Col N="86" /> done in this particular case because there was no hint, trace or smell of political involvement of the Government of the day with the companies in question.  It was done purely and simply in the public interest in each one of those cases, and the Taoiseach and his party do not deserve any particular credit for having gone along with it.  The Taoiseach mentioned a committee of Ministers that was set up to look at the difficulties in the period, apparently, between 18 August &mdash; when the Taoiseach says he was first informed of this &mdash; and 23 August, which was the date, as far as I can remember, he first informed the leaders of other parties in the House that it was his intention to recall the Dáil.  Could we be told who the members of that committee were?  Could we be told specifically whether Commissioner MacSharry was at any one of the meetings of that group and whether that group asked Commissioner MacSharry to take any steps in relation to banks which had money on loan to the Goodman group of companies? Could we also be told&mdash;&mdash;</P>

May I ask the Taoiseach in relation to those questions which he did not touch on if he had meetings with Mr. Goodman the week prior to the Dáil being recalled? Second, may I ask the Taoiseach whether he visited the office of the Department of Agriculture and Food and, if so, can he explain to us why he visited the office of that Department?  Lastly, is the Taoiseach aware of allegations that Goodman International had an oil for beef arrangement with Iran so that as oil prices fluctuated the published rate for beef exports for intervention was raised in favour of Goodman and one other company in order to compensate for the loss in oil price fluctuations and that the net effect is that £19 million was transferred to these two companies by the EC in respect of this arrangement?  Was he aware of that and the scale of the money involved and will he outline the role played by members of his Government in that arrangement?</P>

At that meeting Mr. Goodman informed me that his company was in serious critical difficulties and that his banker &mdash; Investment Bank of Ireland &mdash; would be communicating with me immediately about the matter.  I certainly never visited the Department of Agriculture offices.  The last time I was there was when I was Minister for Agriculture myself.  I know nothing about the sort of deal the Deputy is talking about, about oil, beef or anything of that kind.  It did not appear at any of our discussions.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Taoiseach partially answering Question No. 9, may I ask him on how many occasions he met Mr. Goodman in the three months period lead-in to that special Dáil sitting? When the Taoiseach met Mr. Goodman two days before 18 August did Mr. Goodman advise him that in the preceding two weeks members of Goodman International had been assuring bankers across Europe that Goodman International was financially sound and only had minor difficulties arising out of the Iraqi crisis?  Finally, may I ask the Taoiseach, during that meeting with Mr. Goodman, did Mr. Goodman indicate to the Taoiseach that large sums of money borrowed for agricultural purposes, subject to section 84 tax reliefs, were being diverted through the Cork group of companies and other companies to purchase shares on the English stockmarket?</P>

He has given Deputy Shatter an answer concerning his meetings with Mr. Goodman for the specified period of three months in advance of the reconvening of the Dáil.  I have asked the Taoiseach if he will say on how many occasions since June 1987 he met with Mr. Goodman. What specific request did the Taoiseach reject from the financial advisers to the Goodman Group of companies?  He said he rejected their request for direct financial assistance.  What specific package did they put on behalf of the Goodman Group?  Was the Taoiseach at any stage since 1987 the subject of representations from Mr. Goodman, or any person acting on behalf of Mr. Goodman or the Goodman Group of companies, to make an intervention in the affairs of the beef sector, the effect of which would be to put a competitor company at a disadvantage or specifically to disentitle a rival company from a benefit or facility or sharing in the availability of lines of credit that were available to Mr. Goodman but disentitling any other company? Did the Taoiseach or any Minister in Government act on such representations and to what effect?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, there were no such representations.  From the period after 1986-87 as far as the Goodman organisation were concerned the boot was on the other foot.  I and the Minister for Agriculture and the junior Minister, the <Col N="90" /> Minister for Food, were continually pressing the IDA and other persons to get on with the major beef expansion programme which we had been promised. There were no representations to me of any other kind from the Goodman organisation or anybody connected with the Goodman organisation about the matters Deputy Rabbitte has mentioned.  I would recall for Deputy Rabbitte that it was Deputy Ray Burke as Minister for Industry and Commerce who cancelled the export credit guarantee scheme in regard to Iraq.  That was subsequently confirmed further by Deputy O'Malley as Minister for Industry and Commerce when he not only retained the cancellation but voided the previous export guarantees that had existed.</P>

      <P>Could we return to the committee to which the Taoiseach referred?  What steps did that committee take to convey information to Commissioner MacSharry and what advice, if any, did that committee give to Commissioner MacSharry about what he might do in response to the situation?  It is totally irrelevant to speak of the safety net system which the Taoiseach said in his original reply had already been put in place before any of these matters were brought to his attention.  It is curious that the name &ldquo;Corke&rdquo; keeps coming into this affair.  Is the Taoiseach aware that Professor Corke, who has nothing to do with the companies but is a world respected figure in the company law area, has made the point, as did my colleague Deputy Barrett in this House when we discussed the legislation, that Part IX of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, has utterly failed to deal with the problem in that company and that it has not been the examiner or the banks who have resolved the problem but simply that the banks have found themselves in a hole that they cannot get out of any other way?</P>

      <P>Regarding the meeting between the Taoiseach and Mr. Goodman, did Mr. Goodman make the Taoiseach aware of the difficulties which were being caused by the action of the Government in cancelling export credit insurance and did he put a proposition to him regarding the restoration of export credit insurance?  Is the Taoiseach aware that as a result of the action taken by him and by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce the taxpayer is still exposed to a possible liability of £74 million as a result of claims that could be pursued if the court case which is being taken by Mr. Goodman is successful?  Did Mr. Goodman, in the course of the meeting, remind the Taoiseach of the undertaking which I understand he gave to him when the Taoiseach and the Minister undertook to restore export credit insurance that he would only be covered in respect of meat sourced in this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied the taxpayer is not exposed to any liability with regard to export credit insurance. My advice is that the action taken by both Ministers stands up perfectly.  There has been no loss under the export credit guarantee scheme under any heading.  I might be wrong in detail but by and large that is the position.  The financial adviser, the Investment Bank of Ireland, certainly majored on that question of restoring the export credit guarantees, but we made it specifically clear through the committee and otherwise to any bankers who were in touch that there was no question of that situation being changed.</P>

Do I understand the Taoiseach to say that he had no knowledge of the difficulties in the Goodman Group of companies prior to the meeting of 16 August?  Will he tell us the dimensions of the financial package recommended by the financial advisers to the Goodman Group of companies?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are getting a bit repetitive but we will go over it again. Regarding the last matter mentioned, the main thrust of the financial adviser's letter to me was to the effect that the banks were meeting and that unless there was some evidence of tangible support from the Government he could not see the bankers agreeing not to liquidate.  On that matter we made it perfectly clear to the financial adviser that there was no financial assistance, nothing of any tangible support and no question of the export insurance being reinstated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree, in retrospect, that the elevation by the Government of Goodman International as being the main body responsible for the massive expansion of the beef industry in the 1987 period assisted Goodman International to borrow right across Europe, to over-extend themselves and laid the foundations for the crisis that arose in the beef industry this summer, and furthermore laid the foundations of the débacle we have now?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not accept that at all.  The basis of this crisis is very clear. As I interpret it, it is entirely a matter between the Goodman organisation and their bankers.  The bankers advanced enormous sums of money to the Goodman organisation when the times were good.  Then the crisis came &mdash; the major problem in Iraq and the two disastrous investments by Goodman International in Britain.  These three things came <Col N="94" /> together and caused the whole crisis. Then our bankers, all 33 of them &mdash; well, perhaps not all 33 of them &mdash; having loaned the money with great goodwill, wanted to pull the whole load down, but that is the way with bankers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many ways it could be done if it was decided it was a good idea.  At present I am not in favour of the proposal for a number of reasons of which the Deputy will be aware.  First, it would entail substantial duplication of effort, given that Dublin Airport is already in existence.  There is a massive investment of taxpayers' funds going into Dublin Airport &mdash; something in the region of £80 million &mdash; over the next four years to provide additional facilities there which will raise the capacity of Dublin Airport substantially, rendering that airport well able to meet the projected growth in demand in the future; that is apart from the security aspect altogether. The Deputy must remember also that we are talking about a travelling distance between these two airports of perhaps half an hour when the new motorway is operative.  Therefore one must give very serious consideration to the question of whether it is a good idea before deciding how it could be done.  At present I am not convinced it is a good idea.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the catchment area of North Kildare, Clondalkin, Tallaght, Newcastle and Saggart, that region generally, is a much higher one than those serviced by Waterford, Sligo, Galway or Kerry regional airports?  Would the Minister consider that the possible development of Baldonnel in turn would facilitate the development of tourism infrastructure in the area &mdash; for instance the Straffan Hotel, the Lyons and Carton Estates, in addition to the three racecourses in the area?  Would the Minister agree that the development of Baldonnel Aerodrome would enhance the development of tourism infrastructure in the area and might assist in attracting to the area a badly needed rapid rail system at present being <Col N="96" /> considered by Aer Rianta on the other side of the city in conjunction with CIE?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>One does not designate an airport in order to bring on a rapid rail system.  If one needs a rapid rail system one deals with that issue.  Most regions in the country can advance arguments for an airport to be located there. On my desk at present I have representations from eleven locations countrywide to the effect that they would like to proceed with airport development. I will study the Deputy's ideas on this but, as of today, I am unconvinced there is merit in proceeding with a second airport in Dublin.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41, 48 and 71 together.</P>
      <P>I am in the course of completing my consideration of the level of liberalisation of bus services to be provided for in a new Bus Competition Bill which, with Government approval, I hope to present to the Oireachtas early next year.  While details of the new legislation cannot be published until after they have been approved by the Government, I can assure the House that the Bill will provide for and facilitate a considerable greater degree of competition than is possible under existing legislative provisions. More specifically I am confident that the new provisions will give rise to significant improvements in the quality and range of bus services available to the general public.</P>
      <P>It would be premature at this stage to elaborate on the possibility of private bus operators being subsidised.  All I can say is that this is one option which was implemented successfully in Britain in the case of services provided by private bus operators on loss-making routes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed and, to some degree, disturbed by the nature of the Minister's reply.  On at least two previous occasions from Government <Col N="99" /> benches it was intimated that this Bill would be published, first in the session ending in July last and, at a later stage, in the autumn.  Is the Minister aware that there is considerable anxiety and concern among workers in both the rail and road sections of CIE in relation to this proposed complex Bill which may present some difficulties?  Workers allege that the publication of this Bill may well be delayed until a new national wage agreement has been completed.  In the light of that serious concern felt by workers and unions would the Minister not agree that he should have arranged a meeting with the unions in order to specifically outline the nature of the proposed legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The delay is because I wanted to have further consultation with all parties involved and I will, of course, be meeting with the trade union movement, as is our understanding with them in regard to such a major measure.  The Deputy will be aware that the last legislation governing bus competition to this extent was in 1932 and that a fairly substantial overhaul is now required, which is what I propose to undertake.  Let me reassure the workers in the company concerned that they have my fullest confidence and admiration for the work they have put in. I will seek to ensure that when we talk to the union movement about this legislation every facility is given to them.</P>

      <P>I am not following that deadline.  I am trying to overhaul transport legislation.  I am working as quickly as I can to do that because I want to ensure we have an effective Bill that will give better quality of service in the years ahead to the public, considering the last Bill was in 1932.  If I can have that achieved before the agreement is finalised I will certainly do so, but I cannot give that guarantee.  I will do my best.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42, 45, 53, 60 and 67 together.</P>
      <P>During the passage through the Oireachtas of the B &amp; I Line Act, 1990 last March, I announced my intention to carry out a review of the future options for B &amp; I with the main objective of determining how soon the company's dependence on Exchequer financial support can be ended.  Last May I received a report from the Board of B &amp; I on the future prospects for the company under various scenarios.  I subsequently decided to commission SKC Corporate Finance Ltd. to advise me on the options for the future of B &amp; I and, in that context, to recommend the best and most economic means of terminating Exchequer support for the B &amp; I Line at the earliest possible time.  I also asked the consultants, in carrying out their assignment, to have regard to the need for adequate capacity and competition in the provision of passenger and freight shipping services.</P>
      <P>The consultants examined the principal options for the future of B &amp; I.  Having assessed the feasibility and financial implications of a number of options, the consultants were strongly in favour of a disposal of B &amp; I as the best option. Following consideration of the consultants' report last September, the Government decided to request SKC Corporate Finance Ltd. to carry out the additional assignment of exploring the level of interest which exists among potential purchasers of B &amp; I.  This work is still in progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Contrary to some media reports, the Government have not yet taken a final decision on the future of B &amp; I.  Nevertheless, it is clear that the <i>status quo</i> cannot be allowed to continue in view of the substantial future needs of the company for Exchequer support, both in <Col N="102" /> terms of trading requirements and fleet replacement.</P>
    <P>On 8 October last, I met with a delegation representative of the trade unions in B &amp; I and led by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to discuss the problems facing the company and the options for their future.  I explained to the delegation that, while options for the future of B &amp; I were being explored, no final decisions had yet been taken by the Government.  At the suggestion of the delegation, I agreed to nominate a representative from my Department to liaise with representatives of ICTU and B &amp; I unions in this matter.  A subsequent meeting between my Department and members of the delegation took place on 11 October, at which the future prospects of B &amp; I were discussed further.</P>
    <P>The report prepared by SKC Corporate Finance Ltd on B &amp; I will not be published because it contains commercially sensitive information.</P>
    <P>The consultants' fees for the two assignments will be in the region of £175,000 excluding VAT.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputies to my replies of 16 May and 27 June 1990, in which I pointed out, <i>inter alia,</i> that an accounting investigation into the reported discrepancies at Aer Lingus Holidays Limited had been carried out by a major chartered accountancy firm, Craig Gardner, who furnished their report both to me and to the Board of Aer Lingus.  I also pointed out that the report had been referred by me to the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána for investigation.</P>
      <P>All the appropriate measures to ensure that this matter is thoroughly investigated have already been taken by me.  Craig Gardner have fully investigated the matter; their report has been referred to the Garda Commissioner and I have instructed the Board of Aer Lingus to take disciplinary and legal action where necessary.  As I have already made clear in my reply of 27 June, it would be unnecessary duplication to have departmental officials carry out a further investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For legal reasons, I do not wish to <Col N="104" /> comment on the report to which Deputy Allen has referred.</P>
    <P>The Chairman of Aer Lingus has confirmed to me that a comprehensive action programme has been implemented to strengthen financial controls within the Aer Lingus group.  The finance function at head office and in the subsidiaries has been re-organised in a manner appropriate to a multinational, diversified group.  Seven new senior finance appointments have been made, a number of which involve people externally recruited.  There have also been changes in the information systems, including appropriate redesign of the content and timing of management information.  In parallel, steps have been taken to strengthen substantially the group's corporate legal function.</P>
    <P>Negotiations are at an advanced stage for the sale of a number of different businesses in which Aer Lingus Holidays were engaged.  Until all contractual matters relating to these sales are completed, it is not possible to be definitive as to what numbers of existing Aer Lingus Holidays employees will be re-employed by the new owners of those businesses.  There are, however, indications that some of the new owners will offer employment to a number of the existing staff.  In other cases I understand that redundancy terms have been negotiated and accepted by the staff concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister three questions?  First, what is the position of the former auditors of Aer Lingus Holidays Limited and are they being sued by the parent company? Second, are criminal charges pending against any persons arising from this fiasco?  Third, have any further management changes come about resulting from these disclosures?  Last, will the Minister arrange to ensure, in the interests of parliamentary accountability, that either the Committee of Public Accounts or the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies or the chairmen of both those committees are briefed on the precise situation pertaining here?  This question will not go <Col N="105" /> away until Parliament has been given the answers to the relevant questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food if, in view of the serious implications for Irish agriculture and especially for our food exports, he will outline the investigation which his Department have conducted into allegations contained in the recently leaked interim report of the EC Court of Auditors; the reason his Department have not yet responded to the report although it is reported to have been submitted five months ago; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food when his Department received the allegations from the EC Court of Auditors concerning malpractice on the part of Irish <Col N="106" /> dairy product exporters; if such allegations were made known officially to Bórd Bainne or to the dairy processors named in the allegations; the reason the allegations were not answered before now and if the Minister will acknowledge that the media statement made by the Court of Auditors is the normal procedure in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy) Michael O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to take the questions from Deputy Sherlock and Deputy Connaughton together.</P>
      <P>The report in question contains the preliminary observations of the European Court of Auditors following a series of visits to Ireland in the period January to June 1990 in relation to export refund transactions involving firms in the Irish dairy sector.  These visits were part of the Court's continuing inquiry into export refunds involving a programme of audits of export transactions in eight member states.</P>
      <P>In accordance with established procedures, to enable the Court to prepare a formal report, preliminary observations were conveyed to my Department in two letters received in the normal way through the Comptroller and Auditor General in early June and early July.</P>
      <P>The letters indicated various issues which the Courts of Auditors asked to be looked at and accordingly asked the Irish authorities to carry out a further in depth investigation.  The investigation was put in hand without delay by my Department and by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners who have primary responsibility for verifying the eligibility of products for export refunds.  The Irish authorities furnished some information to the court in early August and informed the court that while the investigation of the various issues was progressing the nature of the investigation was such that it would take some considerable time to bring it to a conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the House that every effort has been made to ensure that there is no undue delay.  The investigation which is extensive and wideranging is nearing <Col N="107" /> completion and a full and comprehensive response will be sought and furnished to the courts.  The investigative work involved the scrutiny of the commercial and other documentation supporting the declarations made by the claimant for export refunds.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, the observations of the court are of a preliminary nature and, in accordance with the procedure of my Department and of the Court, were not divulged to any party until the Department and the Revenue Commissioners had an opportunity to investigate the issues and assess whether and to what extent they were well founded.  In this we are complying with the request of the Court which, in its communications with the Comptroller and Auditor General had asked that these preliminary findings be treated as confidential and that they be not divulged to anyone.  The authorities have strictly adhered to this requirement.  I therefore regret the disclosures which appeared in the media in recent days, since they put a number of private firms in the dock in respect of adverse comments against which they were not in a position to defend themselves and which, following full investigation, may not be found to be correct or significant.</P>
    <P>I would just mention that during the course of most of my reply the sound facilities seem to have been off.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have apologised to the House already for the defects in controlling the system.  I would hope that these matters will be corrected very quickly.  We do have teething troubles with this apparatus.  We must have a little patience.</P>

      <P>Arising from the Minister's reply may I ask if the Minister could be more specific as to when a <Col N="108" /> response will be produced by the Department and if there is any question that an interim preliminary response will be provided?  Let me further ask the Minister what steps he is taking to reassure customers at home and abroad about the quality of Irish dairy products at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already indicated in my reply, we have in fact furnished interim preliminary replies.  I have also indicated in my reply that a full and comprehensive report, which involves collating information from both the Revenue Commissioners and my Department, will be sent very shortly.  I do not propose to comment further on the basis of reactions to a report which was leaked outside of the established and proper procedure existing between my Department, the Revenue Commissioners, the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Court of Auditors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister's version is right because it is certainly at variance with that of the official from the Court of Auditors who gave the interview.  He clearly signalled that they got no official report even though they had been looking for it for five months from the Department.  I want the Minister to put what he has said on record. There must be something very wrong when it is five months since the Department got the official query on the allegations which are extremely serious.</P>
      <P>Why is it that An Bord Bainne, who have overall responsibility, were not informed long before now about the seriousness of those allegations?  They are the people at the coal face, yet I understand they were not told officially about this.  Somehow or other only 14 days ago unofficial contact was made with them.  I would like the Minister to clear that up because it is extremely important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already indicated, the procedures of the Court of Auditors require that all preliminary information and observations be kept entirely confidential.  This was confirmed in letters which they addressed to the <Col N="109" /> counterpart authority here, namely, the Comptroller and Auditor General who, in turn, conveys those queries to the departments or authorities directly concerned, in this instance, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Agriculture and Food.  Accordingly, it is not open to the Department of Agriculture and Food nor to the Revenue Commissioners to disclose the nature or content of these preliminary observations which are simply preparatory to enabling the court to prepare its report.  We have in this, as in all other things, adhered diligently and properly to those procedures.</P>
      <P>I regret the fact that, because there have been adverse comments made publicly in respect of some enterprises and of Bord Bainne, Bord Bainne have been called on to reply to comments which they were not in a position to deal with adequately because the whole procedure is that a final report be presented.</P>
      <P>In regard to the implication that my Department or the Customs Authorities have been less than diligent in dealing with the matter, let me explain the timetable. We issued preliminary observations, the last of which was in August. We indicated then that the nature of the queries was such as to involve detailed study before issuing a final comprehensive reply.  Let me stress that we have not issued any final or comprehensive reply.  I wanted to clarify that matter in view of what Deputy Connaughton has said.  Let me also say at this point that it is recognised, in this as in other things, that the attitude of the Irish authorities in terms of co-operation compares very favourably to that of other member states.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister a brief supplementary?  Arising from the reply he has given and referring to the interim report of the EC Court of Auditors, which must give rise to concern about the various allegations that have been made, what steps is the Minister taking in the interest of his own Department and of Irish dairy produce?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me assure Deputy Sherlock that it is a matter of priority at all times that my Department would vindicate and advance the reputation of our dairy and beef sectors.  That is a continuing obligation and will remain so.  I also want to say to Deputy Sherlock that I do not see that it would be appropriate or right for me or for any member of the Government to respond to a leaked version of observations outside of the established procedures.  I do not intend to do that.  I have explained the procedures. It is not for me to comment on comment.</P>
      <P>If there has been comment in the press and on radio and so on, it is not my function to reply to those comments.  The only public observation I would make is that the House and all the authorities concerned can be assured that whatever action is required on the part of the Minister, the Revenue authorities or the Comptroller and Auditor General will be taken when the report is furnished.</P>

      <P>It will be very short. At the beginning I asked the Minister to inform the House as to when he was officially notified by the Court of Auditors but he did not give the exact date. He avoided that question.  Finally, does the Minister not think it is a bit much that, for what is literally a time bomb in so far as our exports are concerned, he would leave an item like this hanging around for five months without an answer?  How long would it have taken to answer it in the normal course of events?</P>

      <P>My question is to the Minister for Finance.  I also have one to the Minister for Labour which I understand is also being taken by the Minister <Col N="112" /> for Finance.  I would like to ask the Minister for Finance what steps he is taking to settle the claim by secretarial assistants employed under the scheme of secretarial assistance for non-office holders in the Oireachtas, which has led to a one day strike today, especially in view of the likely disruption to the work of the Oireachtas and the inconvenience for the general public if the claim is not settled; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
      <P>My question to the Minister for Labour is to ask him if he will consider intervening in the current dispute between secretarial assistants employed under the scheme of secretarial assistance for non-office holders in the Oireachtas in view of the disruption to the work of the Oireachtas and the inconvenience to the public that a prolonged strike could cause.</P>

      <P>I will take both questions.  As regards the question to myself, I would like to inform the Deputy and the House that the current position in regard to this dispute is that a prolonged conciliation meeting was held yesterday between officers of my Department and representatives of the secretarial assistants.  That meeting ended late last night without agreement being reached.  The parties have agreed that the conciliation process will be resumed on Friday morning next. In the meantime, I consider it inadvisable to engage in public discussion on issues involved in the dispute.  On behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Labour, I would like to tell the Deputy and the House that the Labour Court yesterday invited the parties to the dispute to a conciliation meeting which lasted several hours.  A further meeting has been arranged for Friday morning next.</P>

      <P>It is not my intention to enter into the issue in dispute but simply to have the matter raised on the Floor of the House because it affects every Deputy in this House.  It is a matter which has been attempted to be processed by representatives of the staff for <Col N="113" /> the past ten years.  These people were appointed in 1980.  It seems extraordinary that the day before the strike was due to take place a conciliation procedure was entered into by the Department of Finance. Could the Minister confirm that SIPTU have over a long period of time attempted to have the matter dealt with through the normal procedures but they have effectively met with a stone wall? The matter has been allowed to drift to the point that we are now in the middle of a strike and it may be extremely difficult to find a resolution.  As I am sure the Minister knows, once a strike starts it is extremely difficult to have it stopped. He and the Minister for Labour should make every effort to meet, at least part of the way, the requests of the staff for a regarding of their status and security of employment.</P>

      <P>I can only repeat, and I think the Deputies in the House will appreciate that it would be inadvisable for me to get into the details of any of the issues involved here.  I am surprised the strike is on today.  Negotiations were adjourned last night until Friday morning and in normal circumstances you would expect that the strike would at least be suspended until such time as the negotiations are concluded. I am not going into the issues here in relation to the matter.  There are certain misunderstandings in relation to the dispute and possibly today or, one would hope, tomorrow morning some of those misunderstandings will be cleared up and the real issues will be seen for what they are.</P>

      <P>As the Minister says, without getting into the specific issues concerned, the fact is that the conciliation talks that took place yesterday consisted of the Department presenting yet again to the staff the same formulae they presented months ago, which were clearly unacceptable.  That is not negotiation, that is stonewalling.  Will the Minister give the House an assurance that there will be no further stonewalling on this claim but that there will be genuine <Col N="114" /> negotiations and conciliation and that we can expect to have a resolution of this dispute by the time we return here next week?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 3 and 3a are being taken together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I described why amendment No. 3 was necessary and I have not heard anybody disagree.  It is for purely technical reasons so I am making the assumption that the House will accept amendment No. 3.  In so far as amendment No. 3a is concerned, where power is provided for the Minister to prescribe by regulation, the Oireachtas will already have approved the general principles involved in the matters where the Minister can make these regulations and the Minister effectively uses the power to prescribe to give effect within the parameters that are so laid down in the Act and in the section concerned.  In this Bill in particular, there are a whole range of examples of power to make regulations because, by the nature of the Bill, you cannot prescribe every last detail.  We have seen the difficulty in relation to this Bill which is now approaching its fifth year.  There are a whole range of examples in dozens of places throughout the Bill which are very technical.  Some of the examples are in sections 164, 271, 272 and many others.  It would be unreasonable not to have power to make regulations in the normal way.</P>
      <P>The second point is that any regulations made still have to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in the normal way and can be annulled within 21 sitting days.  Regulations can and do come before the Oireachtas in this manner.  If I were to agree to the amendment tabled by Deputies Bruton and Barrett, every regulation made by the Minister would, in future, have to be debated by both Houses which would, inevitably, result in long delays which would not be in anybody's interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously some of the regulations would be debated at some considerable length and it will certainly be necessary in the first year of operation of this Bill to make perhaps 20 sets of regulations in order to implement it and to allow the Bill to come into force.  If every one of <Col N="262" /> these has to be debated in full in both Houses after the incredibly long debate which has been taking place on this Bill since 1987, there will be further and further delays.  It would be like bringing in a number of Companies Bills each year. We all know that the difficulty which will arise in practice in trying to get Dáil time to do this is considerable.  I have had difficulty in getting Dáil time to do this Bill &mdash; even though it is obviously very urgent &mdash; because there are so many other competing Bills and other business which are regarded as equally urgent, perhaps quite validly.  If I were to go back to the Government Whip and say that I wanted time over the next year for ten debates in the Dáil and the same number in the Seanad on regulations I would be told that it simply would not be available or that the delay in ordering such debates on them would be considerable.</P>
    <P>In this Bill I am proposing what is done in the regulations made under every Act. I do not know if companies legislation is necessarily so much more important that a special arrangement should be made in relation to it.  In almost every other Bill it is possible to make the regulation which can potentially be annulled within 21 sitting days in either House.  That is reasonably satisfactory in every other field of legislation, so I do not think it should be completely unacceptable or totally unsatisfactory in this case.  For that reason I ask the Deputies opposite not to press amendment No. 3a because of the practical difficulties involved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton said that there might be substantive changes in the law &mdash; perhaps he used the word &ldquo;substantial&rdquo;&mdash; but, either way, there cannot be substantial changes because they cannot go outside the parameters laid down in this Bill.  An awful lot of the regulations relate to my prescribing forms in which to do these various things and my prescribing better ways of trying to prevent people evading the law.  I can envisage a situation arising where a particular abuse comes to mind which it would be possible to cure by way of regulation under the Bill.  If, let us say, this was discovered at the start of the summer or any other recess it <Col N="263" /> means you have to wait until the end of the recess to try to cure it and indeed well beyond that because it may not be possible to have the regulations discussed at that time.  In these circumstances it would be helpful if the amendment was not pushed.</P>

      <P>There can be a separate question in relation to amendment No. 3 although, in this case, if amendment No. 3 is carried you cannot move amendment No. 3a because we would have already agreed amendment No. 3.  If Deputy Barrett feels he wants to say something special, the Chair will make an exception although he refused to do so in the case of Deputy Bell.  The House should understand that that is the position in the matter of agreeing to take two or three amendments together on Report Stage.  One foregoes the right.</P>

It is not the intention of this side of the House to introduce anything into the legislation that would effectively prevent its proper application, but at the same <Col N="265" /> time we live in a democracy and this is the elected assembly of the people.  At times it might be inconvenient for a Minister to have to have a regulation debated. When I dealt with the Intoxicating Liquor Act and the Extradition (Amendment) Act, in both cases the Minister agreed to a similar amendment to that which I propose today as it was felt necessary. Let none of us fool ourselves that the present procedure whereby the regulations are laid in the Library and can be annulled within 21 days is a protection. It is a load of nonsense, because one just does not get the time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is an abuse of democracy.  I would remind the Minister that his party chairman, Mr. McDowell, talked of the need to reform this House when he was a Member of it.  It is absurd that we can use a mechanism which effectively gives the Minister <i>carte blanche</i> in relation to future regulations. Whilst there is a technical procedure in relation to annulling regulations the reality is that the regulation can never be discussed here.  The regulation would at least have to come in here if the Minister accepted my amendment.  It is grand to nod through regulations of a technical nature but at least the House will have the option of deciding whether or not a regulation ought to be debated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not our fault that this Bill has been dragging on for four years.  We offered to sit in September to deal with this in Committee and we offered to extend the period in July to deal with it.  A number of elections occurred since this Bill was first published and Deputy Des O'Malley is now the Minister.  I hope the Minister will follow through in another test of his sincerity in relation to his party's policy on different issues.  I hope the Minister <Col N="266" /> will follow through the commitment he has given to the electorate in relation to the opening up of the procedure of the Dáil and allow Members the opportunity to discuss regulations where necessary. There is no reason why regulations cannot be discussed on Friday.  Most of the time regulations could be passed on the Order of Business by agreement without debate but at least we would have the option, and that is the point I wished to make in my presentation this morning.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, to try to help the debate the substance of this amendment which Deputy Bruton has proposed relates to a matter which is dealt with substantively in Part VI of the Bill.  I am prepared to consider Deputy Bruton's points when we come to Part VI but I am not prepared to accept his point now.  This is an amendment of substance relating to a significant matter which was already debated on Committee Stage.  I undertook to look at this again and I am looking at it again in the context of Part VI.  I have not made up my mind yet in relation to Part VI but I cannot accept the amendment now as it is not appropriate for it to go in here.  The point in this amendment is dealt with in Part VI and the substantive debate should take place there.  I would ask the Deputy to leave this until Part VI when I will have had the opportunity of having a look at it.  I have not considered it yet and I therefore cannot accept his proposed change at this stage.  I may be able to accept it by the time we get to Part VI.</P>

      <P>I will outline why I cannot accept the Minister's gracious <Col N="267" /> suggestion.  I put down an amendment to Part VI in conjunction with my colleague in the Special Committee on 13 February. Regrettably that amendment was defeated by an alliance of Fianna Fáil and The Workers' Party in the absence of the Progressive Democrats or Labour representative.  I am therefore precluded from reintroducing my amendment to Part VI under the rules of the House.  The only way I can reintroduce the matter is in the form in which I am doing so now.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment if a company becomes insolvent there will be a large number of creditors.  There will be some voluntary creditors&mdash;people who freely lent money or supplied goods to the company on the basis that they would be paid a month <Col N="268" /> later, or something like that.  If the company becomes insolvent in the meantime they may not get all of their money. There are also involuntary creditors, people for example who were damaged by the company, in respect of whom the company broke a contract, who pursued the company, took the company to court and got a judgment against the company and whom the company have not yet paid.</P>
    <P>They are what are called involuntary creditors.  They did not choose to be injured by the company but they were injured and had a claim against the company in respect of the injury.  However, if the company are dissolved and there is only a certain amount of money left &mdash; say they have assets of £50,000 and debts of £100,000 &mdash; and it transpires that they owe the Revenue Commissioners £50,000, under our present law, the Revenue Commissioners, because they enjoy what is known as preference under section 285 (2) (a) of the Companies Act, 1963, will get all their money.  The involuntary creditors of the company, people who, perhaps, were run down and injured by a vehicle owned by the company and have a personal accident compensation claim against the company which has been granted by the court but not yet paid, will not get a penny but the Revenue Commissioners will get every penny they are owed.  That is not fair, and it is not only I who holds that view.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats in their five year programme for tax reform published in November 1988 under the byline <i>Get Ireland Working</i> called for, among other things, &ldquo;an ending of the preferred status of the Revenue on insolvencies&rdquo;. That is a statement of the policy of a party led at that time by the present Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He told us a few moments ago that he could not quite make up his mind as to whether or not there should be preferred status for the Revenue Commissioners but he laboured under no such hesitancy in 1988. Of course, he was in Opposition at that time but now he is in Government.  It is unfortunate that he is not so clear in his <Col N="269" /> mind about what should be done now as he was then.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it might help him, and the Government, to decide to implement the Progressive Democrats' policy if I were to remind him that the Progressive Democrats and Fine Gael &mdash; I put them in that order so as to win the Minister's heart &mdash; are not alone in holding the view that the preferred status of the Revenue Commissioners should be removed.  The most authoritative study on company law upon which much of the legislation in Ireland, Britain and elsewhere is based is the celebrated report of the Cork Committee which was chaired by Professor Cork.  As I understand it, that committee recommended the removal of the blanket Revenue Commissioner preference which had previously obtained in British law.  The Irish Commission on Taxation, a body who were extremely concerned to ensure that taxes be collected, also recommended in their major report on Irish taxation that the Revenue Commissioners no longer needed to enjoy this blanket preference of their debts over the debts of the ordinary creditors of the company trade creditors who failed to be paid or people who were injured by the company and had a claim for compensation. In the view of the Commission on Taxation all of those deserved not to have their claims set aside simply so that the Revenue Commissioners could be paid in full.</P>
    <P>The same view has been adopted by a number of professional bodies working in the area.  The Confederation of Irish Industry told Deputy Barrett and I no less than four days ago that their view was that combined with the enormous uncertainty about the collection of debts created by the Companies (Amendment) Bill, 1990, with its process of examinership, forced settlements and so forth, the existence of Revenue preference as well created a situation in which it was going to be extremely difficult to justify lending to Irish companies because the people lending the money could not be sure that they would get their money back.  Their view was that, either the Revenue Commissioners would grab all <Col N="270" /> that was in the pot or the company would seek the protection of the courts and be thus enabled not to pay back their full debts to those to whom they owed the money.  Of course, for a banker the enhancement of the risk of not being able to get money back is that he can charge a higher interest rate, a higher risk premium. One result of Revenue preference would be higher interest rates for businesses because of the greater uncertainty that the existence of Revenue preference creates as to the likelihood of repayment to ordinary creditors, whether they be secured or unsecured.</P>
    <P>I understand, of course, that in the past when the Revenue Commissioners did not have such wide powers or such ample information technology at their disposal to collect money owed to them, to identify how much was owed to them and whether someone was falling behind in their payments, they needed this special preference.  Of course, the money they collect is money owed to the general population whereas money owed to somebody who has been run down by a company vehicle and injured for life is still only money owed to an individual.  I suppose one could argue in some cases that the VAT man should get his money before somebody who has been personally injured and put in a wheelchair for life.  I have heard that case argued and it might be an arguable case if the two creditors had equal means of knowing whether or not the company were likely to go insolvent and for enforcing their claim against the company.  That may indeed have been the case in the past because when the Revenue Commissioners were operating in the era of the quill pen their means of information about companies were rudimentary to say the least but that is certainly no longer the case.</P>
    <P>In modern times the Revenue Commissioners receive from a company, confidentially and solely for their benefit, regular two-monthly returns of VAT and regular monthly returns of PRSI and PAYE.  If there is any possibility that the company are in difficulty that is likely to first show itself in either delays in making <Col N="271" /> these payments or in these payments not being made in full.  Under our present law and present Revenue practice invariably the first people to know that a company are in trouble and that efforts should be made to collect the money owing by that company to the creditor will be the Revenue Commissioners.  Therefore, far from being in the weakest position in terms of taking action to protect their interests at present, the Revenue Commissioners are with the monthly and bimonthly tax returns, away ahead of the game relative to other creditors in knowing whether or not a company are in difficulty and in being able to take action to protect their interests.  Not only are they in a position to do that but they have powers to for example, attach money owned by another creditor to the company in order to make sure that they are paid first out of that money.  They have sheriffs at their disposal who go out acting for the Revenue, only not for other creditors, to seize goods from the company to make sure they get their money.  The Revenue have a battery of powers available to them which ordinary creditors do not have to ensure that they get their money.  A worker who has been injured in an industrial accident in a company and who has a claim against the company does not have sheriffs available to him to collect money.  He does not have information about whether the company are running behind in their VAT payments or whether, perhaps, the time is right to go to court to claim the money.  He does not have any of those protections available to him, yet if the company become insolvent and if people have not pressed their claims in time it is the Revenue Commissioners who get preference, not the individual, the often impoverished individual, who has a claim against the company.  It is literally topsy-turvy.</P>
    <P>If there is any creditor who does not need preference in the present circumstances, given all the other powers they have, it is the Revenue Commissioners. If there is any creditor who would be most culpable for failing to take action in time to collect their money <Col N="272" /> before a company became insolvent it is the Revenue Commissioners because they have all this advance information about the State of a company which no other creditor has, yet they are the ones who are given preference.  Surely, this is wrong.</P>
    <P>It is most important that we establish, so far as company insolvencies are concerned, a level playing field between creditors.  A level playing field is a concept which has considerable merit for other members of the Government who are in other parts of this building at present, wide awake and listening to this debate.  I believe they support the idea that there should be equality of treatment between, for example, those in the commerical radio field and those in the State radio field.  What I am asking for in so far as insolvencies are concerned is the creation of a level playing field between private creditors and public creditors. This is a concept which should be well understood by the Government given that they were so anxious to establish a level playing field in the broadcasting field.</P>
    <P>Why not have a level playing field also in terms of who has the right to have their money collected in advance of others when a company become insolvent?  The deletion of section 285 (2) (a) would have that effect.  It would create a level playing field in the matter of the preference for debts.  As I am only proposing the removal of section 285 (2) (a) I hope I will have the support of my colleagues in other parties in the Opposition.  The provisions of subsections (b), (c) and (d) preserve the preference for wages owed to staff of a company, accrued holiday remuneration and so forth.  They would retain their preference under this amendment. The only preferences that would be removed are the preferences enjoyed by the Revenue Commissioners and county councils.  I contend that both of those are well able to look after their own interests, have their own money collected on time and get after a company without enjoying special status.</P>
    <P>The last point I want to make is that if this amendment is accepted either now <Col N="273" /> or when we come to Part VI &mdash; the Minister is probably right when he says that Part VI is the place to make the change from a procedural point of view &mdash; it will means the Revenue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Leyden was present as I recollect.  In any event the final point I want to make is that if the amendment is made in Part VI of the Bill it would have to be made in this Part of the Bill anyway because if section 285 (2) (a) is repealed subsequently on Report Stage we would have to come back and make a correcting amendment in this section as I understand it.  However, I believe the existence of Revenue preference makes the Revenue lazy in pursuing companies in difficulty.  The Revenue know that if they wait and the company eventually become insolvent they will get their money, so they are not in a particular hurry.  However, if the Revenue knew that they did not enjoy absolute preference they would act sooner.  It would have been much better for many companies and employees, when a company got into difficulties, if the Revenue acted quickly before the debts got completely out of control, forced the company to do whatever restructuring needed to be done and sell whatever assets had to be sold in order to get themselves back on the road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Early action by the Revenue Commissioners would lead to better company management and ultimately greater job security.  At present companies are allowed to roll up large debts and no one acts quickly.  We have seen examples of this all too recently, one of which was discussed today at Question Time.  That is not an example of the Revenue being owed money but that happens where the Revenue are owed money.  Eventually when action is taken the debts are so large that the company cannot be saved whereas if the Revenue, who have more information than anyone else, were forced to act quickly they might act before the company got beyond the point of no return in terms of compound interest accumulating on existing debts. I believe the removal of Revenue preference would lead to better tax collection as well as the better management of companies and better protection for the <Col N="275" /> ordinary individual be he an ordinary employee with a claim against the company who currently cannot be paid as the Revenue get in first, be he someone who has been injured by a vehicle owned by the company or an ordinary trade creditor who has supplied something to the company in good faith and did not have the information the Revenue have about the state of affairs of the company.  In this way both the individual and the public interest would be protected and overall we would have a more efficient system of company administration.</P>
    <P>The Minister has had considerable time to consider this matter and I am surprised that, having considered it as far back as February, he still has not made up his mind.  I hope that what I have said today and what is said in this debate in the House today will persuade the Minister to announce today a firm intention to introduce an amendment to this effect in Part VI of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I had some doubts about this amendment but having listened to Deputy Bruton I now have ten times as many.  Let me give my reasons very quickly.  First, one cannot have an even playing pitch when a company go into liquidation.  If there was an even playing pitch the company would not become insolvent in the first place.  Over a period of 25 years I have had more dealings involving company closures than any other Member of this House.  Frequently I had to go to the Revenue Commissioners and ask them not to put a company out of business, in the longterm interest of people in employment, and had to work out deals with them or to ask them to make deals with companies for payment of moneys outstanding over a period in order to retain the employment in that company.  That is happening every day of the week.  The Revenue should not have first claim for a number of very important reasons.  First, that money does not belong to creditors, it belongs to the workers in the company. It is money which the company has been charged with passing to the Revenue. <Col N="276" /> In the event of a company closure the position is that a worker, if the money is paid in, will at least, get back the tax rebate to which he or she is entitled.  If creditors were given the first choice there would be no repayment to the Revenue. The net result would be that all the other people who would be left at work in other companies &mdash; the PAYE workers &mdash; would have to pay the money that was distributed among creditors of liquidated companies.  They are paying enough PAYE as it is.  The third point with which I cannot agree relates to injuries.  I have dealt with the issue of injuries at work for over 30 years.  In the event of somebody being out of work as a result of an accident they can claim disablement benefit. In the event of someone being injured with a company vehicle it should be covered by the insurance cover on the vehicle or public liability if it happens to be on the premises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the explanations that are given.  As in the case of a number of other amendments they sound very simple.  We agree with the main thrust of what the Minister is trying to achieve, but I could not go along with the suggestion of trying to put creditors on a level playing pitch with Revenue.  On the basis of that explanation I would have to oppose that amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem about debating the points made by Deputy Bell is that it can appear that one is defensive of improper practices on the part of company directors who are fiddling around with moneys not belonging to them.  It is not a popular thing to say: why should not that money be paid over to the people to whom it was due to be paid to in the first place.  That is all very plausible and something about which one would be concerned.  However, there is one thing missing from Deputy Bell's argument. When you pay over the money that is due to the Revenue Commissioners and where creditors are left without, there are <Col N="277" /> many cases where other small companies employing people are forced into liquidation. The employees in those small companies, who were never involved, will suffer as a result of the continuation of preferential status.</P>
      <P>While I understand the point being made by Deputy Bruton to be that if money is collected by a company through VAT, PRSI or PAYE why should that money be lodged in the ordinary account of the company and be used for trading purposes?  I can quote an example from the Insurance Act which was recently enacted where there is an obligation on insurance brokers not to use clients' money for their own use but to have it in a separate account.  Regarding the issue raised by Deputy Bell why should not moneys collected from VAT, PRSI and PAYE be lodged in separate accounts from which the only people who could draw would be co-signatories, that is the Revenue Commissioners and the company itself.  We cannot have it both ways. We cannot allow a situation to continue where a small creditor who may not have the information available to him about the up-to-date position in a particular company can suddenly find that the Revenue Commissioners have pulled the plug and they are left without the money that is due to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must also consider the position of the employees in the smaller companies that will ultimately be left with no other option but liquidation.  It is time we looked at the situation in other countries where if one collects taxes on behalf of the State those moneys are lodged in separate accounts.  I do not see for one moment why, in any given situation I should pay 23 per cent VAT, which is due to the State and which is not being handed over.  I would like to think I am paying my taxes and that they will find their way into the appropriate coffers, but the manner in which we do our business does not bring about that situation. It allows, as Deputy Bruton has said, a situation to develop where the Revenue Commissioners having all the technology available to them, knowing that a company must be facing difficulties but not <Col N="278" /> doing anything about it, and suddenly the company is going into liquidation and the Revenue are first in to get their money. The Revenue Commissioners, like all of us have the advantage of hearing the warning bells early on, should use that information to try to correct the situation before it is too late.</P>
    <P>In Part IX of this Bill we still have the provision for the appointment of an examiner.  We introduced separate legislation because of the Goodman debacle to try to resolve that particular difficulty. The whole concept behind that legislation is to provide a mechanism whereby companies can be saved rather than allow them to get into a situation where they will ultimately face receivership or liquidation. We are making certain provisions here whereby no action can be taken for up to a period of four months where an examiner is appointed.  Why cannot the Revenue Commissioners play their part in seeing to it that if they have information available to them, through up-to-date technology, that they would move immediately and prevent a company from continuing to trade when they should not be trading because they are facing liquidation thus leaving exposed many small creditors, small businesses and many employees in those businesses without anything at a future date?</P>
    <P>As I see it, the main point being made in Deputy Bruton's argument is that the Revenue Commissioners are now in a position where they do not need the protection they got under the provision of the 1963 Act because of the introduction of modern technology and also because, despite the other powers given to the Revenue Commissioners, we have not changed in any way that it is obligatory for people collecting VAT or other forms of taxation on behalf of the State to have the use of that money as if it was their own.  I know people will argue that it is unrealistic to suggest that some small companies cannot do without the use of some of the taxpayers' money for a limited period to trade themselves out of a difficulty.  Any company that depends on taxes collected from somebody else, and who continues to trade should not be <Col N="279" /> trading.  They are in serious difficulties. If the Revenue Commissioners can put a company on the right road early on, whether it ultimately leads to the appointment of an examiner or not, surely that is in the best interest of everybody, including the creditors, who may lose out and subsequently affect the jobs of hundreds of thousands of people in other companies who would be affected by a company going into liquidation and the Revenue Commissioners taking everything.</P>

      <P>Given what I said at the outset and given what Deputies have said in the course of the debate on this amendment I think it is inappropriate for me to go into the merits or demerits of it now. I am prepared to consider it, as I said already, on Part VI.</P>
      <P>I said these very things in the Special Committee, as reported at column 634 of the Official Report, and said I would consider it for the Report Stage the appropriate part is Part VI.  I will not go into the arguments for or against it now. Presumably we will have further amendments. I do not know whether a similar amendment can be put down to Part VI if it has been put down to Part I and disposed of.  It has been pointed out that there are different rules relating to a Select Committee as opposed to a committee of the whole House.  I made it very clear in the Special Committee that I would consider it.</P>
      <P>There are many other matters that I shall have to consider.  It is a very long Bill and we are taking it Part by Part.  I am not dealing with Parts X and XI now. I will deal with them when we get to them.  It is better now to confine ourselves to things which are properly within the domain of Part I.  In these circumstances, without going into the merits or demerits of it, I would ask Deputies to allow us to consider the matter in Part VI and we will see what may or may not be done at that stage.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Bell, <Col N="280" /> a worker in a company who had a claim against the company for civil damages, apart from his rights under workmen's compensation legislation, does not enjoy a special preference under the present law.  If the company is not insured the worker has recourse only against the company.  A claim from that worker against the company which had been granted in court would not be paid if Revenue took all the money which was available.  That is my understanding.  It is unfair to workers and to all sorts of creditors.  If somebody has suffered a serious injury the normal rights under workmen's compensation to a disablement benefit do not represent sufficient recompense.  It would be profoundly unjust if the Revenue collected all their money and a person with a claim of that kind was left unpaid.  I do not agree with that and for this reason I put forward the amendment.</P>

      <P>I have grave doubts as to whether the Minister really intends to do anything about Revenue preference. I think he is saying that he does in order to defuse the case we are making.  If the <Col N="282" /> Minister really intended to do something about this, given that it is the only item of company law upon which there is a clearly published Progressive Democrat policy &mdash; the only area of the whole Bill on which the Progressive Democrats have pronounced themselves as a party is doing away with Revenue preference &mdash; given that the matter was discussed extensively in the Dáil in February, given that the Minister has had the spring, summer and half the autumn to consider this issue and given that there is an amendment before the House on the subject and that he still cannot make up his mind whether he wants to do something about Revenue preference, I do not believe the assurances he has given of his intentions.  I hope I am wrong.  I hope the Minister will show that he does intend to implement this element of Progressive Democrat policy but I will believe it when I see it.  I would have expected that the Minister would have pointed out in response to this amendment that he would be introducing an amendment to Part VI to deal with the matter.</P>

He gave us the same vague assurance of goodwill and the like which was vouchsafed on the previous occasion when the same matter was discussed many months ago.  It was not produced as part of the first list of amendments and I have the gravest doubts as to whether the Minister has the faintest intention of doing anything about this.  If the Minister does produce an amendment to deal with Revenue preference I will not need any condiments to enable me to swallow my words.  I will swallow them with pleasure but I do not expect that this eventuality will arise because if the Minister wanted to do something about it he could have done so.  He has not.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 16, to delete lines 1 to 3, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) The following provisions are also hereby repealed&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  Regulation 8 of the European Communities (Companies) Regulations, 1973,</P>
      <P>(b)  section 6 of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1977, and</P>
      <P>(c)  section 21 of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1986.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This group of amendments, the four of them, is on the lines of similar amendments which were tabled on Committee Stage but which, following debate, the then Minister of State, Deputy Brennan, withdrew with a view to clarifying the extent of application of the provisions concerned.</P>
      <P>The objective of these amendments is to rationalise and extend the application of certain Companies Acts provisions to unregistered companies.  I want to emphasise that I am not, through these amendments, bringing further companies within the scope of the Companies Acts. What I am doing is to apply certain further company law provisions to such unregistered companies as currently exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The background to this is as follows. Section 377 of the 1963 Act, and the Ninth Schedule to that Act, applied certain provisions of the Act to unregistered <Col N="287" /> companies.  Section 377 provides that an unregistered company is any corporate body other than first, a body incorporated under a public general statute, such as a registered company, a building society, an industrial and provident society, or a statutory board; secondly, a non-profit-making body, or thirdly, any body which is prohibited from distributing its income or property among its members.  What this leaves us with, essentially, is companies incorporated by a charter, by letters patent or by a private Act of Parliament.  From the researches I have had carried out, I am satisfied that there are very few of these still in existence, so that the actual scope of application of these amendments is very limited indeed.</P>
    <P>When these amendments were previously discussed in the House, concern was expressed that the effect would be to apply the provisions specified in the proposed Schedule to a large number of learned bodies such as the Royal Irish Academy, the Incorporated Law Society, King's Inns, the College of Surgeons and the like.</P>
    <P>On further examination and having taken legal advice in the matter, I am satisfied that the exemption contained in section 377 (2) (b) of the 1963 Act &mdash; which exempts non-profit making bodies &mdash; would ensure that such bodies would not be brought within the scope of application of the provisions to be applied to unregistered companies.  I am fortified in this view by virtue of the fact that such bodies have not seen it necessary to deliver a copy of their charter, statutes or other instruments/defining the constitution of the body under section 377 (5) of the 1963 Act, or regulation 7 of the European Communities (Companies) Regulations, 1973.</P>
    <P>The other main aspect raised in the previous debate related to the application of these provisions to certain State bodies.  However, State bodies which are incorporated as companies are obviously already subject to the Companies Acts, and they would not be affected by these amendments.  On the other hand, State boards are not unregistered companies <Col N="288" /> either, since they are established under Public General Statutes.  Consequently their position will not be changed under these proposals either.  It is a much wider question as to why some State bodies are established as companies under the Companies Acts while others are set up under their own Acts as boards, but I think that that is a matter to be addressed in relation to the individual Acts establishing such boards rather than in the context of general companies legislation.</P>
    <P>Turning to the amendments before the House, the major change from the amendments which were previously circulated and discussed is the provision in the proposed new section 273 of the Bill, subsections (2) and (3), which would enable the Minister by regulation to add to or subtract from the relevant sections of the Companies Acts to be applied. This would obviously be particularly important as further companies legislation is enacted in the future.</P>
    <P>The main amendments in the group are Nos. 72, which would amend section 377 of the Principal Act in the way I have just described, and No. 73, which would replace the Ninth Schedule to the 1963 Act with a modified, up-to-date version. Amendment No. 5 makes some necessary consequential repeals to existing provisions, while amendment No. 51 would delete section 49 of the present Bill, which would now, assuming that these are accepted, become unnecessary.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 16, line 7, after &ldquo;company&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in order to enquire into matters stated by the court&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are amendments dealing with Part II of the Bill which concerns investigations into companies.  The main change contained in Part II of this Bill as against the 1963 Act which also had provision for investigations of companies' affairs was that under the 1963 Act the investigations were conducted at the behest of the Minister.  Under the 1987 Bill investigations will in future be at the behest of the court or it will be a case of people having to apply to the court to have an investigation undertaken and the people who may apply to have an investigation undertaken are the members of <Col N="290" /> the company, the company itself, a creditor of the company or the Minister.  All of these, including the Minister, have to get the consent of the court to conduct an investigation.</P>
    <P>During the debate in the House on this Part of the Bill there was considerable argument about whether there was sufficient clarity as to what the purpose of these investigations were.  To simply have an investigation initiated by people who apply to the court looking for an investigation without having to say what it is they want found out seems illogical.  In a sense, one is sending an investigator in on a sort of fishing expedition, to see what he can find out, without any particular direction or purpose.  I do not think there is any point in that.  I do not think it is good legislation.  There should be a requirement to mandate the investigator appointed by the court to investigate particular stated matters and that is the purpose of these amendments.</P>
    <P>In section 7 of the Bill which relates to investigations initiated by the company itself or by members of the company or by creditors we would propose that if, on foot of these applications the court decides to appoint an inspector it should be in order to inquire into matters stated by the court; in other words, the inspector should be given instructions as to what he is to inquire into, which is not provided for at present.  That is quite flexible.  The court can state any range of matters it wishes.  It can give a very general or a very specific mandate as the case may be, but the court should be asked to give a mandate, which is not the case under the Bill as drafted at present.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 are basically designed to achieve the same purpose. Amendment No. 13 is the same except that it applies to an investigation initiated under section 8.  Under this section the Minister initiates the application to the court.  This amendment requires that the Minister should state in his application for the appointment of an inspector the purposes for which he wants the inspection to take place.  He will almost certainly do that anyway but it is no harm that he be asked to do so by law.  I do not <Col N="291" /> think it is reasonable to have a provision whereby either a Minister or an individual can seek that an inspector be appointed without him being required to state the purposes of the investigation or without the inspector, when appointed, being told either by the court or by the Minister in his application to the court precisely what he is to investigate.  It is for the sake of precision that these amendments are put forward and I hope they will be accepted in the context of improving the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless I misunderstand the reasoning behind those amendments, I am not convinced of their necessity for purposes of precision or otherwise. Deputy Bruton seeks that the court specify the matters into which the inquiry is sought.  On reading the section as it stands, it states that the court may appoint one or more competent inspectors to investigate the affairs of a company. The rest of that sentence reads: &ldquo;and to report thereon in such manner as the court directs&rdquo;.  I am unclear as to the reason it is necessary to insert &ldquo;in order to inquire into matters stated by the court&rdquo;.  I am not sure what distinction is being drawn, unless it is suggested that the process&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difference between manner and matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The process in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) &mdash; as I understand it the Minister proposes to insert a new provision there, adding a case in which such an investigation may take place &mdash; is carefully set out, the circumstances in which an investigation may be sought and inspectors may be appointed.  Therefore, it seems that if the court is satisfied to accede to that request it might be unwise to require the court to specify with precision the matter that the investigation should cover.  Presumably it is more prudent to allow the inspectors appointed by the court on the basis of paragraph (a), (b), (c), (d) or, if the <Col N="292" /> Minister's new provision is accepted paragraph (e) to uncover whatever they can rather than be restricted by the court <i>a priori</i> if the court was in a position to so do at the outset of the investigation.  At this stage, unless I misunderstand the reasoning behind the amendments, I do not understand the necessity for them.</P>

      <P>Deputy Rabbitte has covered the point I wanted to make.  Perhaps in reply Deputy Bruton might indicate the reason for these amendments.  They do not seem to be necessary.  It seems the section is adequate as it stands at present. It would be interesting to hear the specific reasons for inserting additional words in this section.</P>

      <P>It is not quite clear from the wording of Deputy Bruton's amendment whether he wishes the applicant in his initial application to the court to outline the matters which he wants to have investigated.  I have listened carefully to Deputy Bruton's argument and I would be inclined to advise the Minister to reject the amendment proposed by Deputy Bruton.  If an applicant applies to the court to appoint an investigator, the court can require such evidence in support of the application as it wishes. The applicant will be a person who has run into some problem with the company and will apply to the court to have the affairs of the company investigated.  The court will appoint an inspector to investigate the affairs of the company and will almost invariably, in deciding to appoint the inspector, outline the areas to be looked into.  During the course of his investigation the inspector may come across some related matters and it may be in the interest of the applicant or some other interested party that these matters be brought to light and reported on to the court.  Deputy Bruton said that if his amendment is incorporated into this section, the legislation will remain as flexible as it is now.  If that is so, there is no need for the amendment in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wording of Deputy Bruton's amendment may introduce inflexibility <Col N="293" /> into the section in that the court would be restricted to outlining certain areas the inspector is to investigate, and if he comes across something else that should be reported he might not be able to do so.  I can understand what Deputy Bruton is getting at but the difficulty he is trying to meet is more illusory than real and for that reason I would urge the Minister to reject the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister is making his case he might outline the circumstances in which he envisages this section being used.  If the application for an investigation is being made by a creditor, what will be investigated?  There must be a reason why the investigation is to be carried out.  In regard to the further sections about the requirement for the production of documents, evidence and so on, surely a court on hearing an application must know the reasons the investigation should take place and the circumstances that led to the calling for an investigation.  The difference between the lodgment of £500 and £200,000 security to cover the possible costs of an investigation is so great that a person must, at the outset, have some indication of what this investigation will cost.  A small creditor who may feel that there should be an investigation into the behaviour of directors or into what he might perceive as a fraudulent act may want to use this section but, in so doing, may find himself in a position where the court envisages a wider investigation than the applicant had in mind on the first day and could find that the cost of this investigation could be anything from £500 to £200,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very few creditors could afford £200,000.  They may want something investigated but could end up paying for production of evidence which would lead to the State ultimately making charges against the individuals involved in the company under investigation.  I can see what Deputy O'Dea was getting at as it is not clear from the section why the creditor &mdash; or whoever goes in to court as specified in section 7 looking for an investigation &mdash; wants it.  Therefore, the amendments proposed by Deputy Bruton <Col N="294" /> and myself merely ask that an investigation be carried out into the affairs of a company into matters stated by the court so that after the hearing the court may order an investigation into some aspects of the company's operations. That in itself will give some indication as to costs which would require the lodgment of £500, £1,000 or whatever the sum is.  Everybody would then know what it would cost.  However, where an application is made under subsection (3) of this section or under section 8, the court may require the applicant or applicants to give security to the amount not less than £500 and not exceeding £200,000 for payment of the costs of the investigation.  As I said, there is a big difference between £500 and £200,000 and very few people would be in a position to lodge security of £200,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  Who will decide the amount?  The court will decide the amount.  On what basis will the court decide?  Surely they will decide it on the basis of the extent of the investigation.  Is it a massive investigation involving many people and high costs or is it a minor investigation?  We are asking the Minister to consider our amendment which asks the court to specify what should be investigated by those who will be appointed to do so.  It is not our intention to restrict any investigation which should be carried out; we are not trying to prevent information being made available but we want clarity in relation to this section.  I cannot at present envisage when this section will be used because it involves enormous costs.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the point made by Deputy Bruton and the object of the exercise in putting down these amendments.  I sympathise with his objective but, on careful reading of the section, his concern is unnecessary. Under section 7 (2) the application has to be supported by such evidence as the <Col N="295" /> court may require.  It will not mean that there will be an investigation on demand. It will certainly not be a pure formality as I imagine that the courts will require a good deal of hard evidence and facts &mdash; not just supposition, vagaries or generalities &mdash; before they accede to the very serious step of allowing inspectors to go into a company to investigate it.</P>
      <P>The evidence which would have to be adduced before the court would be motivated to operate the section in the first place would obviously have to set out the parameters of the object of the investigation. The court would examine all that and would, in accordance with the directive in subsection (1), indicate that the inspectors were to report in such manner as the court directs.  That is a pretty wide constraint and I imagine that a court, looking at that section, would be unlikely to say that inspectors should just look here, there and everywhere.  I would think that a court would look at it and give the power to direct inspectors to report thereon in such manner as the court directs and that they would specify exactly what was to be done and the areas to be looked at, based on the evidence adduced.  I imagine that the courts would preclude the fishing expeditions into ancillary matters in the company which were not connected to the evidence adduced to trigger the mechanism of section 7.  The parameters laid down in subsection (1) are reasonably adequate and would ensure that a court would decide on what was to be done and how it would take place.  The description &ldquo;to report thereon in such manner as the court directs&rdquo; is wide enough to cover both manner and matter and I think the courts will do precisely that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see that the aim of amendment No. 6 is to require the court to set down terms of reference for the inspector or inspectors but that is what the court would do anyway, particularly in view of the requirement in section 7 (1) to report in such manner as the court directs.  For example, I cannot imagine the court simply directing an <Col N="296" /> inspector to &ldquo;investigate the affairs of company X&rdquo;.  It would be far too vague and sweeping and I do not think, in practice, that any court would do it anyway. Having said that, I am not opposed to the principle of the amendment so far as it goes and I am prepared to agree to do it provided that the word &ldquo;stated&rdquo; in the amendment is replaced by the word &ldquo;specified&rdquo;, which does not change the overall meaning to any great extent.</P>
      <P>However, I do not see the same benefit arising from amendment No. 7.  I am satisfied that once the court has clearly defined what the inspector is to inquire into, it is unnecessary then to say that its purpose is to achieve these particular purposes. Consequently, I am opposed to this amendment.  In fact the words could be misleading in that the inspector's task will be to carry out an investigation and to furnish his report in the matter; it would not be for him to achieve the objectives of the court.  Furthermore, if the amendment were made the second clause of the opening three lines of subsection (1) would then read as follows: &ldquo;The court may appoint one or more competent inspectors ... and to report thereon in such manner as the court directs ... in order to achieve the purposes of the investigation as stated by the court&rdquo;.  I honestly cannot make sense of this.  It implies that although the court will direct the manner in which the report is to be drawn up, the inspector could nevertheless, if the amendment is not made, somehow draw up his report to achieve some purpose other than &ldquo;the purposes of the investigation as stated by the court&rdquo;.  I do not see the necessity therefore for amendment No. 7.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 13, section 8 clearly defines the circumstances in which the court can appoint inspectors on the application of the Minister, and these are spelt out in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of subsection (1).  It is totally unnecessary, if not wholly inappropriate, to require the Minister to specify the purposes for which he has petitioned the court given the necessity for him to satisfy the court in accordance <Col N="297" /> with the paragraphs I have just mentioned. This amendment also suffers from the defect I have just mentioned in relation to amendment No. 7.  In these circumstances I cannot accept amendment No. 13 either.  I will be prepared to accept amendment No. 6 provided the world &ldquo;stated&rdquo; is replaced by the word &ldquo;specified&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's acceptance of amendment No. 6. I understand the Minister's views about amendment No. 7 and I accept them, but I am not quite so sure that I agree with his views on amendment No. 13.  Without delaying the House unnecessarily I will say why.  It is not quite clear to me why we need section 8 at all.  There are three circumstances specified in which a Minister might look for an inspector to be appointed, one being if the affairs of the company are being conducted with intent to defraud, another that the persons involved in the company have been guilty of fraud and another that the members of the company have not been given all the information which they might reasonably expect to get.</P>
      <P>If those three circumstances exist they do not require the appointment of an inspector.  If the creditors are being defrauded they should take civil action to get their money back.  If a criminal offence has been committed, the Minister, rather than looking for an inspector to be appointed, should send the file to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  If the members are not getting all the information they should reasonably expect from the directors, they should take civil action against the directors for breach of duty.  They should go direct to the source of the problem rather than go through this rigmarole of asking the Minister to apply to the judge to appoint an inspector to find out a lot of information and then eventually after huge costs, have to take civil action to recover the money or take a separate criminal proceeding for fraud. It is not clear why we need these inspections if the circumstances are as stated in section 8.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a Minister is applying for an inspector <Col N="298" /> to be appointed he should be required to say why.  I cannot conceive of any circumstances in which a Minister would want to appoint an inspector in these cases because there are other remedies available.  An inspection of the kind envisaged is an elaborate waste of time and money.  It was simply to force a little bit of mental rigour on any Minister who might consider a kind of cop out by appointing an inspector rather than taking criminal proceedings, that he would be forced to tell the court why he wanted an inspector rather than criminal proceedings.  In other words, the Minister would have to say what purpose he wanted to fulfil in the application.  That is why amendment No. 13 is sensible.  I could never understand what all this carry on about inspections was about, despite all the debate.  The existing procedures are more than sufficient to deal with the circumstances referred to in section 8, without all this waste of money and time.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 6, as amended, agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 16, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) in any case, on the application of a director of the company;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment arose from a suggestion made by Deputy McCreevy on Committee Stage that non-executive directors should be able to petition the courts for the appointment of an investigator.  The amendment does not, however, specify any particular category of director, since it would be wise to avoid making any distinction between different categories of directors, and there is not any way in law of distinguishing between executive and non-executive directors.  While any director could already apply to the Minister to use his powers under section 8, I <Col N="299" /> agree that in some circumstances it seems desirable that the director should be able to go direct to the court.  The safeguards of having to put up some security would also apply in this case and should prevent frivolous or vexatious applications.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very serious reservations about this amendment.  There could be a danger not so much of frivolous but of vexatious applications being made.  It frequently happens in companies big and small that one director disagrees or has a grievance.  This amendment would give such a person the opportunity to raise mayhem and cause company shareholders, taxpayers, and goodness knows who else a great deal of money and trouble.  Is it really a very good idea to place that very strong power to make such an application in the hands of one person?  It is not even as though a grouping of directors are involved where there would be some safeguard.  To say that any one director who may be an insignificant person in the company is to be given the power to raise mayhem in a company and possibly destroy the company is ridiculous.  If the thing went awry and such a person incurred massive costs he could destroy the company.</P>
      <P>The Minister says there is a safeguard, that being that the security for costs would act as a deterrent.  It might, but it might not.  The provision in section 7 (3) says that the court &ldquo;may&rdquo; require the applicant to give security for costs.  It does not say that the court &ldquo;shall&rdquo; require the applicant to give security for costs.  It is a discretionary matter for the court.  It is easy enough to envisage a situation where this notional director looking for trouble goes into a court asking for an order, as is his right if this amendment is adopted, and when the question for security of costs comes up, he pleads to the court that he is a person of little or no means and not in a position to give security for costs.  It is no secret that courts are slow to stifle litigation on the grounds that a person may not have the money to put up to provide security for costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="300" /> If that kind of plea is made it could very well be that a court may say, &ldquo;this man says he has a claim; I do not know whether he has but I am not going to stop him going ahead because he does not have the money to put up for security for costs&rdquo;.  It could be that some director who goes a bit peculiar in the head, with no control at all, and digs up material which on the trial of an action would not stand up, is empowered to go into court and given, as of right with this amendment, the power to disrupt a company, possibly cause the loss of jobs and the liquidation of the company because of the trauma involved without any balance or check whatsoever.  It is a very wide step to take and I must admit I was surprised to see this amendment without any provision for control or check or whatever.</P>
    <P>I suppose one could say that the application has to be supported by such evidence as the court may require &mdash; that is true &mdash; but that would be in the nature of <i>prima facie</i> evidence and there would not be a full hearing with evidence, counter-evidence and so on at that stage.  If <i>prima facie</i> evidence was adduced there I think the investigations would go on because that is what the purpose of the investigation would be.  I do not think a court is going to have a trial of the action; the court would be likely to say &ldquo;I think these are matters for the investigators to see too and, therefore, I am not going to make a decision on them.  Let the investigators investigate&rdquo;.  It requires the investigation to see that through and to come up with the results.</P>
    <P>As I have said, it seems a bit over the top and an excessively wide power to give to one director &mdash; it might be one director out of 20 &mdash; who gets a bee in his bonnet, trumps up a situation and comes into court.  The costs of an investigation could be astronomical.  The charges by members of Deputy McCreevy's profession who would carry out these investigations are very high by the hour or by the day and very substantial sums for costs could very easily be run up.  I wonder if it is prudent or wise to vest a power that strong and high in one director alone.  It certainly will make redundant <Col N="301" /> section 7 (i) (c) which says &ldquo;in any case, on the application of the company&rdquo;, which means all the directors.  I presume that is how the Bill was originally drafted &mdash; I was not on the Special Committee. On the one extreme, the position put forward is that the company as a generality will be required to make the application but at some far swing away from that &mdash; and there is some deep gulf between the two positions &mdash; it is possible that an investigation can be carried out on the application of one director only. Surely more than one director should make the application.  Perhaps two directors should make the application so that at least there will be some check or balance there.  Otherwise I must admit that it is a matter of some concern to me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Taylor has made the point very effectively how a vexatious claim could be brought forward by, as he put it, someone who is a bit peculiar in the head.  Certainly one can envisage that kind of claim being initiated.  Whether it would comply with section 7 (2) or pass the hurdle imposed by section 7 (2) I am not so sure.</P>
      <P>When the Minister is replying I would like him to address the corollary of that situation.  Sometimes a non-executive director is close enough to the action to believe that an investigation may be necessary or desirable in the interests of the company, its shareholders, its workers or whoever.  Very frequently members of a company do not get all the information they might reasonably expect.  For example, under section 8 one of the circumstances in which the Minister may cause an investigation to be held is in a situation as specified in paragraph (c) where its members have not been given all the information relating to its affairs that they might reasonably expect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my experience that is a fairly frequent occurrence and there does grow up on the board of many companies a kind of unwritten expectation that you toe the line so to speak.  If times are rough it may be necessary to dabble in doing things one would not do otherwise and in order <Col N="302" /> to trade ourselves out of a difficult temporary situation or whatever we may engage in decisions or actions which would certainly not come within the scope of what possibly have been made new offences under this Bill when it is enacted.  In other words, a non-executive director who is not part of the executive management of the company could be in a position to at least know enough about this to initiate this action and to pre-empt greater damage being done to the company at a later stage.</P>
    <P>I am not dismissing at all the possibility of a vexatious application as suggested by Deputy Taylor but I wonder whether on balance the right of a non-executive director, who may have his suspicions and who may not be part of the inner cabal, to trigger this mechanism which would pre-empt greater damage being done to the company might not mean that this is a good reason for allowing that facility to be included as an additional reason in section 7.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the debate on his amendment I suggest to the Minister that unless he can give us exceptionally good reasons as to why this amendment should be included it would be wiser to leave it out.  If a non-executive director is not happy with what is happening in a company, surely he can contact the Minister and ask him to use his powers under section 8 to have the company investigated.  That would get over the possible difficulties outlined by Deputy Taylor and Deputy Rabbitte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not understand why a director would want to have the company of which he is a director investigated.  If he thinks there is fraud going on, surely it is open to him to resign and ask for an investigation through the Minister's office, produce the evidence and so on.  In the light of the possible dangers or difficulties that could arise by giving one director this power, as outlined by Deputy Taylor in particular, I believe it would be better to leave out this provison, seeing that it was not originally included in the Bill.  If Deputy McCreevy had a particular problem, perhaps the <Col N="303" /> powers the Minister is taking under section 8 could be used to deal with those problems.  I cannot see a situation occurring on a reasonably regular basis where a director of a company would want the company of which he is a director investigated when, under section 8, he can petition the Minister to have this investigation carried out.</P>

      <P>Some Deputies seem to think it would be very strange if a director, in particular a non-executive director, were to apply to the court for an investigation.  I do not think that at all. In many respects this is something we should see more of.  A non-executive director in particular should be given that power.  I do not refer to him here as a non-executive director because there is not that distinction in the companies Acts but he should have that power because one of the weaknesses in Irish companies is that they do not have a supervisory type director as they do in other countries. They tend to be dominated by either executive directors working there full-time, and who have a vested interest, or by proprietor directors who have a lot <Col N="304" /> of money invested in the company and, effectively, own it.</P>
      <P>A valuable commodity, not made much use of in Ireland, is the non-executive director who can stand back, who does not have a vested interest, either through a proprietorship or full-time employment, who, perhaps, can say that that sort of thing should not be going on and can resist the pressure described by some Deputies as being necessary, that because things are tough now they will cut a few corners or do things they would not do when economic circumstances were better.  It would be good to have someone like that who could blow the whistle on them and say to them, &ldquo;hold on, you cannot go that route and you will have to stop&rdquo;.  If they persist he could say to them that he has power under section 7 of the 1990 Act to go to court, ask for an investigation and say that he thinks they should not pursue that route.</P>
      <P>The argument has been made that he is peripheral to the company but he is certainly no more peripheral than the person envisaged by paragraph (d) of subsection (1), the creditor, somebody who is utterly peripheral, who is owed £100, £1,000 or some negligible sum of money.  The likelihood of a frivolous or vexatious application being made by a creditor is far greater than it is by a director. In any event one will not be able to make an application just because one feels like it, one will have to comply with subsections (2) and (3), produce evidence which will satisfy the court and put up security.  One will not do so lightly.</P>

      <P>Usually the investigation would be into the chief executive rather than by him or at his instigation. <Col N="305" /> I note there is no enthusiasm for the amendment in the House but the point of the overdraft is good and it might do something to encourage greater use of effective non-executive directors, not just people appointed for the sake of decorating the note paper, expanding their own ego or something of that kind but people who can go on in a supervisory capacity to keep an eye on things as against the employees, employee directors and proprietory directors both of whom have vested interests which might cause them, perhaps, to be less objective than a non-executive director.  For this reason I suggest the amendment should be made.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 16, line 19, after &ldquo;may require&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or as may be specified by regulation under this Act&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is along the lines of similar amendments put down by us before. Under section 7 the court may appoint an inspector to investigate a company on the application of 100 members of a company, the company itself, one fifth of the members of the company or a creditor.  It is not stated what such an inspector should look for or what criteria the court should use in deciding whether an inspector should be appointed.  It simply states that 100 members, one fifth of the members, the company or a creditor can look for an inspector to be appointed for any reasons they like.</P>
      <P>It states that an application should be supported by such evidence as the court may require but how is someone to know what evidence the court is going to require until they appear in court?  Given the way the section is framed at present, it seems that somebody will have to go into court to say that they want to appoint an inspector.  The court will then say for that to happen it will have to be given evidence on a number of points, ask them to go away and come back with that evidence in a week's or a month's time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="306" /> To save the necessity for this sort of approach as to what evidence the court may want, it not being known in advance, a power should be vested in the Minister to lay down in regulations the type of evidence which should be put forward to support an application of this kind.  That would not preclude the court from looking for additional evidence not specfied in the regulations which I am suggesting the Minister should have the power to make because this is an alternative.  The section would read that the application shall be supported by such evidence as the court may require or as may be specified in regulations.  Therefore, the court could look for additional evidence apart from that specified by the Minister in regulations.</P>
    <P>If this procedure of investigation is to be used, and people are to know whether this procedure of investigation is relevant to the circumstances they are dealing with, some criteria or guidelines should be laid down as to what is envisaged.  This is why I am proposing to give the Minister power to specify in regulations the type of matter which ought to be covered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <P>In a number of sections throughout the Bill provision is included for the Minister to make regulations to overcome certain difficulties which may arise on the implementation of certain sections of Parts as the case may be.  I have tabled, or propose to table, a number of similar amendments to other sections which we will come to discuss in due course.  On a practical level the question as to what minimum evidence ought to be required under section 7 is one which will exercise the minds of the superior courts rules committee following the enactment of the Bill and on that basis the amendment may be unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, however, I do not necessarily disagree with the idea behind the amendment although I have some other difficulties with it.  The first of these is that the subsection talks of evidence which the court may require.  Of course the court might require varying amounts <Col N="307" /> and levels of information in different cases.</P>
    <P>It might also be difficult for the Minister to make regulations as to the type of evidence which he thinks the court might require since he would have no way of knowing this because it is at the discretion of the court.  However, assuming that the Minister did make regulations, I think the court would still have to be free to decide for itself what evidence it required in particular cases. On that basis it would have to be clear that anything specified in regulations would not prevent the court from exercising its own discretion in the matter.  Secondly, it would have to be clear who would make these regulations, and I assume the Minister would be the appropriate person.  Finally, I prefer the word &ldquo;prescribed&rdquo; to &ldquo;specified&rdquo; since this is the usual terminology used throughout the Bill.  If these changes were made I would be prepared to accept the amendment.  To be clear, from a drafting point of view the amendment which I would be prepared to accept would read:</P>
    <P>In page 16, line 19, after &ldquo;may require&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;including such evidence as may be prescribed&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 16, line 20, to delete &ldquo;or section 8&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment arises from a general Committee Stage discussion on section 7 (3).  Some Deputies felt it was wrong that the Minister, as an applicant for an investigation under section 8, might be required to put up security for costs of the investigation.  Having reflected on the matter in the meantime I must say I fully agree with the view that was expressed in the House at the time.  I believe strongly that if the Minister of the day feels there are grounds for going to court to have an inspector appointed, he should be free to do so or if he is carrying out an investigation under section 8, which is actually the point of this amendment, he should be free to do so without the encumbrance of having to lodge money in court as evidence of his bona fides in the matter. At the same time in case anyone feels that the Minister could pursue vendettas by this route or go on fishing expeditions, <Col N="309" /> I would remind the House that even the Minister still has to persuade the court that there are good reasons an inspector should be appointed.  These grounds are laid out in section 8 (1).</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 16, line 22, to delete &ldquo;£200,000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£50,000&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Barrett remarked on an earlier amendment, there is a big difference between £500 and £200,000. Although I acknowledge that this section has been changed substantially from what we started out with, that the power the section confers is discretionary and presumably that the court may choose to waive it, nonetheless, the maximum figure of £200,000 is excessive and could act as a deterrent to the mechanism envisaged in section 7 being triggered albeit for the best of motives.  I am proposing an alternative figure of £50,000.  I would like to hear the Minister comment on whether he considers that not just the scale of the investigation would be taken into account by the court but also the status of the company or the person seeking the application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us refer to the debate we had on the role of non-executive directors.  If I were a non-executive director of a major group of companies and became aware that certain lines of credit were available and had been made available for a specific purpose, and it was proposed that they be drawn down for some other purpose &mdash; for example, to fund speculative ventures abroad that had nothing to do with the purpose for which they were approved &mdash; my own view would be that I would like to be in a position &mdash; as the Minister put it &mdash; to blow the whistle.  Looking at the figure in security of £200,000 that might be extracted I may have to think again. In the example I have given if one were to go into the court here in six months and suggest that one should investigate that company's affairs, the chances are that the court would be of the view that <Col N="310" /> the allegations were of such a scale that the maximum security should be exerted. That would certainly cause me to think again before I would undertake that kind of commitment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton described the Bill as a rich man's Bill.  He was arguing for his earlier amendment to be used as a method of putting pressure on the Government &mdash; on the Minister specifically &mdash; to widen the scope of the civil legal aid scheme.  He warned that those of us on those benches would rue the day we did not support his amendment.  He may be right.  If I were to broaden the scope of the civil legal aid scheme I would not start with the corporate area; nonetheless, I take the point made.  I do not think that access should be cut off because of the expense of the security required.  I would ask the Minister to consider whether the maximum ought not to be reduced.  I thank him for the amendment already made to the subsection in respect of the lower figure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to what has been said.  Deputy Rabbitte may misunderstand because he sees the figure of £200,000 printed in the Bill.  He thinks that the courts will frequently make an order in respect of security of cost for that amount.  That figure is simply put in as a cut off point to prevent the courts putting any higher figure in a very exceptional or unusual case.  The important part of this section reads:</P>
      <P>Where an application is made under this section...., the court may require the applicant or applicants to give security,....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a limit on the amount of security they can ask an applicant to give.  I would imagine that in the great majority of cases the court will not ask for security, particularly if there is some reasonable evidence put before it.  I would think it would be only in a case where there would seem to be very little evidence that they would be inclined to ask for security and probably the order would not be made anyway.  There is provision under the rules of court for all sorts of instances in <Col N="311" /> which the courts may order security for costs against a plaintiff.  The cases are very rare, as I am sure Deputy Taylor would agree.  The court is not inclined, on the face of it, to ask people having recourse to it to give security for costs because if this is done to any excessive extent, except in very exceptional cases, the court is denying access to itself.  The whole approach to the courts under our Constitution is that persons should be encouraged to have access to them and to approach them.  In no sense is this obligatory but it is put in as an indication of a cut-off figure in a very complicated case, which would be very rare.</P>
    <P>I am inclined to leave it there, particularly since I believe that the question of giving any security at all, even as little as £500, will only arise in a small minority of cases.  If an applicant has reasonable evidence I do not think the courts will ask for any security.  It would be wrong for them to do so.  It does not seem to be unreasonable to have a maximum cut-off figure which obviously will be rarely used. There may be some very big, contentious cases where costs would run to £500,000 or £1 million and it is better in those cases to have a cut-off figure.  I recommend that the House should leave the figure as it is.  Perhaps Deputy Rabbitte will consider not pressing his amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it somewhat strange that a provision dealing with security for costs was put in at all.  The Minister was quite right when he said that it is rarely, and only in very exceptional circumstances, that the courts make orders for security for costs when litigation is brought.  The only instance of which I am aware, where it is ever contemplated, although there may be others, is where the plaintiff does not reside within the jurisdiction.  If a person who lives in England, France, Germany or elsewhere initiates litigation in this country the courts may have a fear that if that person lost the litigation the person who got the award of costs would be unable to recover them from the person living outside the jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="312" /> It seems rather strange that in these circumstances it was found necessary to introduce the measure.  My view is that the whole thrust of the direction of the section is wrong and misguided.  It would have been better to have left out the security for costs aspect and to have no provision for it but rather to deal more carefully with the nature of who is to be entitled to bring the application and the evidence to be put up front before the mechanism of the section could be triggered.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for the Minister to say that in any case it is only a discretion to the court and that the court may perhaps not make any order for security for costs. Human nature being what it is, when the judge looks at this section and sees there the unusual provision which enables him to give security for costs, he may be inclined to look at it as an invitation to avail of the power in the section.  I do not recall seeing this power in any other Act. It could have the effect of stifling at birth a worthwhile investigation, which would be a pity if the evidence is there.</P>
    <P>A more logical course would have been to have laid down criteria for the evidence and to have spelled out what evidence would be required to enable an investigation to go ahead.  The question of whether the person making the application to the court has or has not the means to put up security for costs to get proceedings under way seems somewhat irrelevant to the object of the Bill.  If the object of the Bill is to have investigations carried out in appropriate cases and if there is sufficient evidence that would be prescribed to get such an investigation under way, what on earth is the relevance of providing that security for costs has to be given and that the matter cannot go on unless a particular sum, be it large or small, can be provided for security for costs by the person or group of persons who make the application?  That should not be relevant.  Either it is right for it to go on or it is not.  The courts may look at the section and be inclined to see in it the intention of the Oireachtas that this should be a special kind of application and consequently the security for cost <Col N="313" /> provision will be brought into play in a case where it should not be.  If there is to be provision for security for costs, the maximum figure should be kept to a minimum. I agree with Deputy Rabbitte that the figure of £200,000 is too high.  Perhaps the Minister would consider £100,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I might interrupt helpfully to say that this concept of security for costs in this context is not new.  There are two such provisions in the 1963 Act, at sections 165 and 390.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now living in 1990 and should perhaps update our thinking in these matters.  Would the Minister consider the points made here in the light of the provisions of section 13? This refers to expenses of investigation of a company's affairs where the court may direct any person, being a body corporate or the applicant or applicants for the investigation, to repay the Minister for Justice to such extent as the court may direct, not exceeding an amount of £200,000.  In view of that provision, is subsection (3) of section 7 necessary?</P>
      <P>What is emerging from the debate &mdash; and the point I made earlier &mdash; is not so much whether the figure should be £500 or £200,000 but rather its effect on the people whom the Minister would want quite rightly to instigate an investigation. Whether we insert this subsection or not is irrelevant in so far as we have made provision in section 13 for dealing with the ultimate costs of a case.  From what I can gather the point being made from this side of the House is the effect that the provision stated in subsection (3) would have on a possible small creditor seeking an investigation.  He would have to go to court before he would know whether he would be required to lodge security.  That is the problem with the wording of the subsection as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having listened to the debate I would prefer if the subsection were not there at all and that the matter were dealt with under the provisions of section 13.  I do not know whether the Minister has power to delete the subsection without notice at this stage; perhaps he would not want to <Col N="314" /> anyway.  If he does not, then accepting Deputy Rabbitte's amendment might have some minor effect in terms of thinking of a small creditor.  A sum of £50,000 is a great deal of money to a small businessman who could possibly be faced with this ultimate lodging of security up to £50,000 or £200,000.</P>
    <P>Section 7 (3) would appear to be unnecessary if we can deal with the whole issue under the provisions of section 13. For that reason, if it is possible, I would ask the Minister to delete that subsection or, if not, to support Deputy Rabbitte's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to cut my contribution very short if the Minister accepts the suggestion advanced by Deputy Taylor.  If he is not I want to assure him that I think I understand it perfectly well; if one looks at the record &mdash; I am sure I said, in introducing the amendment, that the power being conferred on the court was discretionary and that it will not in all cases extract the maximum security for costs; that goes without saying.  But, as the Minister himself conceded, it may in what he called very contentious cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is one of a very small group of people in this House who knows more about the Goodman affair than we can even put on the record of this House. I would ask him to give me an honest opinion on what he thinks would have been the position if, say, some six months or a year ago somebody who falls into the categories stipulated under section 7 (1) (a), (b), (c) and (d) caused an investigation to take place into that group of companies.  It might have pre-empted the enormous scale of affairs that has happened since then.  It might well have prevented the examiner process being necessary.  Nonetheless, imagine going into a court some 12 months ago talking about the largest group of companies in the meat sector here and making allegations along the lines of the information advanced in this House on 28 August last.  What conclusions does the Minister honestly think the judge would have come to?  What conclusions would a court <Col N="315" /> have come to in those circumstances, as Deputy Taylor said, faced with the fact that section 7 (3) includes this particular provision of security for costs to a maximum of £200,000?  It seems to me that a court &mdash; with the probity that that company had in establishment political circles at that time &mdash; would have said: this exactly fits into the category of the vexatious case Deputy Taylor adduced earlier, or if we are seriously to consider proceeding with this then maximum security of costs would be exacted.  In those circumstances the effect would be to deter the person bringing forward the request for an investigation.  I am not asking that the motion enshrined in section 7 (3) be abolished altogether, that the court has the discretion to exert security for costs where it thinks it proper, but to allow a cut-off point as high as £200,000 could be counter-productive in terms of the objective of section 7, which would be a pity.</P>

      <P>In page 16, line 31, after &ldquo;purpose&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;or in an unlawful manner&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am proposing these two amendments in an effort to make absolutely sure that, within the general bounds of section 8, the Minister is not precluded from seeking the investigation of cases which ought to be investigated.  For example, although section 8 gives wide grounds for the Minister to seek to have an inspector appointed it does not go far enough in two respects.  First, section 8 (1) (a) talks in terms of the affairs of a company being carried on with intent to defraud or for a <Col N="317" /> fraudulent or unlawful purpose. However, a company may be carrying on all sorts of unlawful activities without, technically speaking, doing so for an unlawful purpose.  That is why amendment No. 14 seeks to insert the words &ldquo;or in an unlawful manner&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The second amendment would simply delete the word &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; from section 8 (2) (a) since I see no compelling reason why an inspector should not be appointed in suitable cases to investigate the affairs of a company that is being wound up by the court.  In fact often that may be the more appropriate type of liquidated company to be investigated.  Of course I quite accept that, in a court liquidation, the liquidator, being an officer of the court, might be expected to carry out certain inquiries as to whether anything untoward had occurred in the company prior to its winding up.  But in most cases I would imagine that he would have neither the time nor resources to fund such inquires in the necessary depth.  Therefore, I see the facility to have an inspector appointed in such cases as being a useful additional option in the Bill.  I commend that amendment also to the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion before the House tonight proposes an extension of the powers of the President by law within the limits set out in our Constitution.  These proposals are important in themselves in that they are designed to make the Presidency much more inspirational and to involve the office more intimately in important areas of national life, but they have been given a dramatically new context by the emergence of new, independent evidence of an attempted abuse of the Presidency and of the Constitution by Fianna Fáil, and by the Tánaiste in particular, in 1982. This new, independent evidence shows clearly that the Tánaiste, now a candidate for the office of President, made an attempt in January 1982 to interfere with the President's absolute discretion in deciding whether to grant a dissolution of the Dáil.  I am fully informed as to the <Col N="319" /> nature of the evidence and I am fully satisfied that it is incontrovertible.</P>
    <P>What the evidence shows is not new. What is new about it is the source.  The subject matter is well known and has been written about and spoken about for quite some time.  On 7 February 1982, for example, Miss Geraldine Kennedy wrote about these nefarious activities and, as we all remember, Miss Kennedy's telephone was subsequently bugged at the behest of a Fianna Fáil Government. What she wrote on 7 February 1982 was the following:</P>
    <P>The President, Dr. Hillery, expressed annoyance to the Taoiseach, Dr. FitzGerald, about efforts made by Mr. Charles Haughey to contact him before the Dáil was dissolved for the general election.</P>
    <P>Three telephone calls were made to Áras an Uachtaráin by Mr. Haughey between the time that the Coalition's Budget was defeated and the Dáil was dissolved.  Two other calls, at least, were received in that period from Mr. Brian Lenihan and Mr. Sylvie Barrett. They did not get to speak to Dr. Hillery.</P>
    <P>Miss Kennedy went on then to point out what was the reaction to those telephone calls and the reply she got, reported in the same article, was:</P>
    <P>It would be improper to say anything at any time about the phone calls received at Áras an Uachtaráin.</P>
    <P>In his book, <i>Garret &mdash; the Enigma,</i> Raymond Smith wrote at the very beginning of chapter 2 on page 22:</P>
    <P>When the Coalition Government, led by Dr. Garret FitzGerald, was defeated on the Budget by 82 votes to 81 at 8.15 p.m. on January 27, 1982, Charles J. Haughey hoped that Fianna Fáil could assume power &mdash; without the necessity of a general election.</P>
    <P>Phone calls were put through to Áras an Uachtaráin, the Presidential residence in the Phoenix Park, seeking to <Col N="320" /> win President Hillery's consent to this option.  My information is that Brian Lenihan rang at least twice while Sylvie Barrett also rang &mdash; and there were phone calls too from Charles Haughey.</P>
    <P>Members of the Fianna Fáil Front Bench have confirmed to me that &ldquo;contact&rdquo; was made with Áras an Uachtaráin and they do not hide the fact that the intention was to avoid a general election so soon after the Summer 81 election.</P>
    <P>I have verified too beyond any doubt from Fianna Fáil sources that the number of phone calls to Áras an Uachtaráin was eight at least.</P>
    <P>Stephen O'Byrnes in his book <i>Hiding Behind a Face</i> had the following to say on page 134:</P>
    <P>President Hillery was not immediately available to grant the dissolution and it was after 11 o'clock before Dr. FitzGerald got back to the Dáil.  He said that the election would take place on 18 February, and the 23rd Dáil would convene on 9 March.  During the intervening three hour period, Haughey and other Fianna Fáil Front Benchers had sought in vain to speak with the President.</P>
    <P>In an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 27 September of this year I find the following reference to that three hour period:</P>
    <P>In the delay, the Fianna Fáil leader, Mr. Haughey, called an emergency Front Bench meeting.  A press release issued in which he indicated that he was &ldquo;available for consultation&rdquo; with the President.  To hammer home the point, a series of phone calls was made by him, and, at his insistence, by Brian Lenihan and Sylvester Barrett, two close friends of Dr. Hillery.  The President angrily rejected all such pressure and, having judged the issue, granted Dr. FitzGerald the dissolution.</P>
    <P>On the first of this month my colleague, Deputy Austin Currie, raised the matter in connection with his assessment of the possible independence or otherwise of <Col N="321" /> Deputy Lenihan if ever he were to be elected President.  He said:</P>
    <P>In 1982, when the then Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, had lost the support of a majority in Dáil Éireann, Mr. Haughey sought to interfere with the constitutional independence of the President by pressurising him into not granting a dissolution of the Dáil. According to an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> last week, Mr. Lenihan made phone calls to the President at the behest of Mr. Haughey.</P>
    <P>Indeed, Deputy Currie at the time was at the receiving end of some rather moralistic lectures from some sections of the media for allegedly &ldquo;politicising&rdquo; the Presidential election.  Personally, I can think of few things more political than an election.  Those moralising lectures now look rather hollow.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary feature of these and other references to the matter has been the silence up to this week from Fianna Fáil.  My belief is that the leadership of the Fianna Fáil Party know these stories are perfectly true, and are trying to kill them by silence.  That will not work.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach this morning tried a different ploy.  In his own inimitably brazen way, he tried to tell the House that Fianna Fáil's position had been made clear in a statement that issued a short while after the vote on the night of 27 January 1982.  I have that statement as reported on the front page of <i>The Irish Times</i> on 28 January of that year.  It reads:</P>
    <P>It is a matter for the President to consider the situation which has arisen now that the Taoiseach has ceased to retain the support of the majority in Dáil Éireann.  I am available for consultation by the President should he so wish.</P>
    <P>That is what he said.  It is not what he did; what he said at the time is totally irrelevant to the matter that concerns us now.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil's silence on this issue was broken by Deputy Lenihan on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; last Monday night <Col N="322" /> and again last night on &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo;. Last Monday night he was asked &mdash; according to today's <i>The Irish Times</i> which gives an accurate record of the programme I saw myself &mdash; if he made a phone call or phone calls to Áras an Úachtaráin in that period in February 1982 when the Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, was seeking a dissolution of the Dáil.  Deputy Lenihan said, &ldquo;No, I didn't at all.  Nothing like that ever happened. I want to assure you that it never happened&rdquo; and more tailing off into irrelevancies.</P>
    <P>On &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; on Tuesday night Deputy Lenihan was asked: &ldquo;Did you ring up the Áras and try to speak to the President?&rdquo;  The reply was: &ldquo;...I watched the tape of the programme again: I had nothing got to do with that matter, good, bad or indifferent&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>There we have Deputy Lenihan denying any involvement, in the face of all the evidence that now exists and of the clear knowledge in the minds of the leadership of the Fianna Fáil Party. It is bad enough for any Member of this House to try to interfere with the powers of the President.  It is worse, of course, if that person is now a candidate for the Presidency himself, but that attempt failed.  What is worse is the fact that he persists with a clearly transparent, totally incredible denial in the face of all the facts.</P>
      <P>On those two grounds Deputy Lenihan is clearly unsuitable for any public office let alone the office he now seeks.  The only course that would retrieve any honour for him would be to withdraw from the Presidential election immediately and I call on him here tonight to do that forthwith.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I turn to the proposals we have set out in relation to the Presidency itself.  The President is elected by a direct <Col N="323" /> vote of all the people.  It is a measure of the uniqueness of that office that it is the only directly elected office provided for in the Constitution.  For this reason, if for no other, the President can be truly said to be the representative of the Irish people.</P>
      <P>Whether the elected President epitomises the aims, aspirations and ideals of his people depends in large measure on the quality of the person elected to the office and in particular on his willingness to serve the people who elect him.  My party believe that while the President symbolises the nation, the office of President should not itself be regarded as purely symbolic.  The President is elected to serve his people.  The attributes required of such a person, if he is to discharge his duties properly, are those of energy, enthusiasm, tact and diplomacy, impartiality, integrity, compassion and experience.  I do not believe that the office should be occupied by any person who is not interested in pursuing his duties actively or impartially or who would seek to use the office in a sense as a spokesperson for particular interest groups.  We are committed to the principle that the President, precisely because he is the representative of all the people, should not when elected allow himself to be beholden to any political parties or any sectional interests or lobbies.</P>
      <P>There has not been a Presidential election since 1973.  The Irish people now have an opportunity to vote for a President for the 1990s.  Fine Gael believe that the qualities necessary for the holder of the office have changed over the years and that the new President should be a person truly representative of all the Irish people, committed to doing a demanding job of work, a person who is not self-serving but who has the energy, the drive and the enthusiasm that characterise the modern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We recognise that the powers and functions of the President are limited by the Constitution.  The Constitution provides that the powers and functions of the President are exercised mainly on the advice <Col N="324" /> of the Government.  Some powers and functions are exercised after consultation with the Council of State and two powers are exercised by the President in his absolute discretion.  In his absolute discretion the President may appoint up to seven members of the Council of State and he can refuse to dissolve the Dáil when the Taoiseach has lost the support of a majority vote in the House.</P>
    <P>There are six powers which the President may exercise after consultation wih the Council of State.  He is not bound to accept the Council's advice and those powers can, therefore, be viewed as independent powers, that is, powers that are not exercisable on the advice of the Government.  The most important of these is the power to return a Bill to the Supreme Court for an assessment of its constitutionality provided for in Article 26.  Another such power is the power in certain circumstances to have a Bill referred to a referendum where the President decides that it contains a proposal of such national importance that the will of the people should be ascertained, a power provided for in Article 27.  The President has the power, after consultation with the Council of State, to convene a meeting of either or both Houses of the Oireachtas and he may address either or both Houses or the nation but only where such message or address has received the approval of the Government.  While the Constitution provides that the President shall not hold any other office or position of emolument, the Constitution does expressly provide that, subject to the Constitution, additional powers and functions may be conferred on the President.  That is in Article 13.10.  Article 13.11 provides that any such additional power or functions shall be exercisable or performable by him only on the advice of the Government. In fact, the Oireachtas has over the years entrusted additional powers and functions to the President.  Under the Institute for Advanced Studies Act, 1940, the President was empowered to appoint Council members and senior professors to the institute.  Under the Central Bank Act, 1942, he was empowered to appoint <Col N="325" /> the Governor.  Under the Red Cross Act, 1944, he is <i>ex offico</i> President of the Irish Red Cross Society.  Under the Ombudsman Act, 1980, he is empowered to appoint an ombudsman.  The President's powers under the Institute for Advanced Studies Act, 1940, are exercised on the advice of the Government; his powers under the Central Bank Act are equally exercised on the advice of the Government. However, the exercise of his powers under the Red Cross Act are not so constrained and his appointment of an ombudsman is not made on the advice of the Government but pursuant to a resolution of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>This summary of the powers and functions of the President shows that, while at first glance, the President's powers appear limited, there is nonetheless great scope for extending his powers by legislation. Fine Gael believe that the role of the President can be widened so as to make the office more meaningful to the Irish people in the 1990s.  Fine Gael also believe that giving the President a more extensive role in Irish society can be achieved without the necessity of constitutional change.  More substantial powers can be entrusted by law to the President than those currently exercised by him.  While Article 13.11 of the Constitution places a restraint on the manner in which the President may exercise such powers as might be entrusted to him, the Constitution does not dictate that his powers must be purely symbolic or nominal.  It is Fine Gael's view that powers and functions of substance should be entrusted to the President.  The fact that in the exercise of such powers the President is subject to the Constitution does not prevent meaningful executive work from being entrusted to him by law. Fine Gael believe that the decision as to what powers and functions might be given by law to the President should be governed by the following principles: first, any task entrusted to him should be of such a kind as to heighten awareness of his national standing and representative capacity.  In other words, he should not be entrusted with functions which are of interest only to a limited section of the <Col N="326" /> people, or particular areas of the country. Executive functions entrusted to him should have national application; secondly, the work entrusted to him should be of such a nature as to exclude the possibility of any party political bias and should ensure that the President will not be permitted to entertain any such political considerations in exercising his powers.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael have given detailed consideration to a range of functions which might be exercised by the President bearing the above criteria in mind.  We recommend giving to the President by law the following important executive functions.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of the Constitution, the President may convene a meeting of either or both Houses of the Oireachtas and may address the Houses of the Oireachtas, provided the Government approve of the address.  The President may also, after consultation with the Council of State, address a message to the nation at any time on any matter.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believe the President should, on an annual basis, convene both Houses of the Oireachtas and address them. While his address must receive Government approval, such an address would be welcomed by the Irish people who get little opportunity to hear their President. An annual television address would ensure that the President could be seen and heard by all and provide for a means whereby he could communicate to all of those who live on this island.  In particular, the annual presidential address should include reports on his activities in the areas specified in these proposals and in this motion.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have underused the talents of their Presidents.  Some past Presidents have been slow to exercise the powers and functions entrusted to them in an active or enthusiastic way. Fine Gael believe that era is gone and that what we now need is a new style of President.  An annual address to the nation would emphasise the dawn of a new Persidency.</P>
    <P>For many years Ireland has been committed, along with other developed countries, by a United Nations resolution <Col N="327" /> to increasing its overseas development aid budget each year so that eventually 0.7 per cent of GNP would be earmarked for the purpose.  Our record in that regard relative to some other countries is not a bad one but we have never in any year met our commitment in full and in recent years &mdash; in the last three years in particular &mdash; we have seen a catastrophic reduction in the amounts allocated for Overseas Development Aid.</P>
    <P>Because of our missionary tradition and because of our sharpened sensitivity to famine arising from our own history, the Irish people have shown again and again their willingness to make sacrifices to help relieve poverty and under-development abroad.  I am confident that there would be widespread public support for the commitment to earmark not less the 0.7 per cent of GNP to be made obligatory by law on the Government. We also believe that our commitment would be emphasised both domestically and internationally by the President having a role of substance in this area in a manner that is above party politics. We therefore propose to introduce an overseas development aid Bill which would establish an overseas development commission with the President having the permanent role of chairman of the commission; provide for the commission to be entrusted with the allocation of overseas aid for specific projects out of funds voted by the Oireachtas; provide that the funding of the overseas development commission be increased each year so that over a specified period of years the 0.7 per cent of GNP commitment would be reached and thereafter, become obligatory; and provide that the accounting officer for the commission be the secretary or second secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  That is a model of how we would give the President a meaningful executive function without in any way trespassing on the limits set out in the Constitution or on the prerogatives of the Oireachtas in voting funds for specific purposes.  It is our view that provision should be made by law to the effect that when a vacancy arises on <Col N="328" /> the bench of any one of our courts, the President will initiate a procedure of consultation with the Bar Council and the Incorporated Law Society leading to the recommendation by them of a specified number of candidates for the vacancy whose names would be submitted to the Government.  The Government, having examined the proposals made by the relevant bodies, would then advise the President that the vacancy should be filled by one of these specified persons or in their discretion any other nominee of theirs. The appointment would then be formally made by the President as provided for under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The independence of the courts from the Government is a central pillar upon which all democracies rest.  We believe that this independence will be enhanced if the President is given the initial consultative role which I proposed with regard to the making of judicial appointments. We believe that this proposal would re-emphasise the independence of the courts and the Judiciary, and has the prospect of taking the appointments of judges out of party politics.</P>
    <P>Apart from appointments, there is another key area in which the courts can be impinged upon by deed or omission on the part of the Government.  The courts are entirely dependent upon the Government for accommodation, staff, office facilities and resources.  In general, court facilities are dowdy and under-resourced and, from the perspective of those who have to resort to court to protect their rights and interests, are often perceived as being outdated and inefficient. Lack of resources can be one cause of delays in the courts but there can also be other causes of delays, inefficiencies and inconsistencies in the courts which can detract from the cause of justice. Arising from the essential separation of powers between the Government and the courts, this is conspicously an area where the Government do not and cannot have a role.  However, the same inhibitions do not apply in like degree to the President.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, we propose that there <Col N="329" /> should be established under the chairmanship of the President a judicial commission consisting of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court, the Presidents of the Circuit Court and the District Court, the Ombudsman, the Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Chief State Solicitor, the chairman of the Legal Aid Board, a representative of the Incorporated Law Society and a representative of the Bar Council, to meet quarterly or more frequently as the President in his discretion deems necessary.  The judicial council would have the function of taking an overview of the operation and performance of the courts and to make confidential recommendations to Government as to what action, if any, is required to ensure the efficient workings of our courts system.</P>
    <P>The environment is a matter of concern to us all and the manner in which we treat our environment will determine the health and well being not only of this but also of future generations.  The need to tackle environmental problems both domestically and internationally is now widely recognised in most countries.  We believe that the President should, on all appropriate occasions when representing the State abroad, emphasise the need for international solidarity in taking all the necessary action to provide a healthy and safe global environment.</P>
    <P>In the domestic context too we propose that the President should have a specific role in the area of environmental protection. We have previously published extensive proposals for the establishment of an independent Environment Protection Agency.  We could now be coming close to having a Bill to set up such an agency passed into law were it not for the obduracy of this Government, and the Minister for the Environment in particular, and their stupidity in not recognising the value of their own words when they said that all the things they wanted to do were covered in our Bill.  However, it looks, if we can believe it, as if we will see a Bill fairly soon to provide for an Environment Protection Agency among other things.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="330" /> Our proposal &mdash; we will come back to this when we debate the Government's Bill &mdash; envisaged that the agency would be headed by an environmental commissioner who would be appointed by the President pursuant to a resolution of the Oireachtas.  It was further envisaged that there would be established an environmental council to act as an advisory body to the environment commissioner and the Environment Protection Agency.  We recognised that it was essential to ensure that the members of the council in their work acted independently of Government and represented a cross section of different interests.  We propose that the President should be appointed by statute to act as chairman of the environmental council and by so doing be empowered to contribute by his work to the improvement and protection of our environment.</P>
    <P>Sport plays an increasingly important role in our national life.  Achievements of our sportsmen and women on the international stage in recent years have been a cause of national pride and have stimulated interest in sports throughout our national community.  To date, the only function the President has been allowed play in the area of sports has been in his attendance at major national sporting events.  We previously published proposals for the establishment by statute of a national sports and recreation council to be funded by national lottery moneys. We now propose that the President be empowered to act as chairman of such a council and play a specific role in promoting sports and encouraging participation in sporting activities.</P>
    <P>This State is one of the few countries in the developed world which has no national system to grant recognition to major achievement in any aspect of our national life.  From the Soviet Union to the United Kingdom almost every country in Europe has its own distinct national award system.</P>
    <P>It should be a major function of the Presidency to promote the pursuit of excellence in all facets of national life. The President should have a central role in granting such awards so as to enable national recognition to be given to men <Col N="331" /> and women who, by their actions, make a substantial contribution to the life of this country.</P>
    <P>Article 40.2.1 of the Constitution states: &ldquo;Titles of nobility shall not be conferred by the State.&rdquo;  Article 40.2.2 states: &ldquo;No title of nobility or of honour may be accepted by any citizen except with the prior approval of the Government.&rdquo; While it is clear that no title of nobility can be conferred by the State, there is no prohibition in the Constitution on the establishment of a national awards scheme.  It would not involve the conferring by the State of a title of nobility and it is generally understood that Article 40.2.2 in so far as it refers to titles of nobility or honour, is intended to relate to such titles being conferred by bodies outside the State.  Even if this Article were not so interpreted and if an award pursuant to the scheme proposed were to be regarded as an honour within the meaning of this latter Article, it is highly unlikely that the Government would refuse to allow a citizen of this State to accept an award which it is proposed to make to recognise his or her contribution to national life.</P>
    <P>We believe it is possible to establish by legislation a meaningful and highly regarded system of national awards to mark conspicuous service and the attainment of excellence in various areas of our national life.  Such awards should also extend to non-citizens who have made a substantial contribution to this State or who, in their international work, deserve recognition.  It would be appropriate, for example, to give a national award to a person who has made a substantial contribution towards peace and reconciliation in the international arena.</P>
    <P>We propose that a commission be established under the Chief Justice to make recommendations within six months in relation to the establishment of such a system, including the different levels of such awards, the manner in which nominations should be made and decided upon, the symbols of such awards, the names by which they would be known, the ceremonial proceedings <Col N="332" /> for the granting of such awards and the civic standing, if any, subsequently granted to the holders of such awards. We envisage that the President would have a central &mdash; as distinct from a nominal &mdash; role in granting such awards and the commission be asked to propose the legislative form which will give effect to that in keeping with the other provisions of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>It seems to be common ground among the three candidates in the Presidential election to want to make the Presidency more active, more relevant and a more vibrant part of our national life.  All the evidence so far indicates that a majority of the electorate agree with that view. The question for the electorate, therefore, is which candidate understands most clearly how to go about this.  Which of them is most in tune with that aspiration? Which of them has most clearly expressed what people want to see in that regard?  That is clearly not Deputy Lenihan.  Apart from the fact that he has no proposals, good, bad or indifferent &mdash; as he might say himself &mdash; he is as I said, and I take no pleasure in saying it, simply not fit, for the reasons I set out, to be a candidate in this election.  He should immediately take himself out of this contest, vacate the field and recognise that this country will not have people in public office who try systematically, as he has done, to deceive the public.</P>
    <P>The candidate of The Labour Party and The Workers' Party, Mrs. Robinson, an excellent person with whom I have had the pleasure of working in different capacities going back over many years, has indeed made some proposals in relation to the Presidency.  The first proposal she put forward was that the President should chair Seanad Éireann.  Like any legislative assembly in the democratic world the Seanad has &mdash; and wishes to reserve to itself &mdash; the right to elect its own Cathaoirleach.  In any case, Mrs. Robinson's proposal would require an amendment to the Constitution and, as far as I can determine, that proposal has now been dropped.</P>
    <P>The second proposal was to make a change in relation to the kind of person <Col N="333" /> who may be appointed to the Council of State.  As Mrs. Robinson has correctly pointed out, the President has absolute discretion in the appointment of up to seven members of the Council of State and from that point of view it would appear the proposal is not new as it is already provided for in the Constitution. It was further proposed, however, that these Presidential appointees should not necessarily be appointed for the full term of a Presidency.  On this point the Constitution is perfectly clear.  It provides that, unless a member appointed by the President previously dies, resigns, becomes permanently incapacitated or is removed from office, that member shall hold office until the successor of the President by whom he was appointed shall have entered upon his office.  Thus, that proposal would also require an amendment to the Constitution and, as far as I can determine, the proposal has been dropped.</P>
    <P>The proposals I put before the House this evening are in marked contrast to the other two.  They would involve the President directly in overseas development aid, in the making of judicial appointments, in an ongoing overview of the operation and performance of the courts, in national and international action to protect the environment, in the promotion of sports and of participation in sporting activity and in a national scheme for recognising merit.  We have also proposed that the President should make an annual address to both Houses of the Oireachtas and to the nation.  All the powers which we propose to confer on the President are in keeping with and would be exercised in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.  The Presidency would become a vibrant and active institution and the President would be involved in important areas of national life in a way which has never before been witnessed in this country.  Therefore, I commend these proposals to the House.</P>
    <P>The events of the past couple of days are a matter of great sadness to me.  I do not think there has been a time when the election of a President has given rise to the kind of controversy we now see.  As <Col N="334" /> I said, I take no pleasure in looking at that situation.  It is in the interests of the Presidency, the dignity of the office and in maintaining values, which I hope all Members share, that the cause of that controversy be removed.  The only way to remove the controversy and its cause is for a Member of this House, Deputy Lenihan, to accept the fact that we all know &mdash; and it has been proved incontrovertibly &mdash; that things which he denied took place.  There is no point in his attempting to present any other picture, neither is there any point in any member of the Government attempting to present any other picture.  The evidence is there, has been there ever since January 1982 and has now been independently corroborated by new evidence which has emerged.</P>
    <P>In the interests not just of the Presidency but in the picture we have of ourselves, it is time for that candidate to take himself out of that contest and to leave the decision of the Irish people to be a choice between two people who clearly have never tried to deceive the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the most extraordinary motions I have ever seen and I must call on the House to reject it.  It is based on many misconceptions and it is hard to know where to begin.  It seems to be based on the idea that the President, independently of the Government, can exercise functions other than those he is given in the Constitution.  This is obviously not so; the Constitution says it quite clearly in Article 13.11.: &ldquo;No power or function conferred on the President by law shall be exercisable or performable by him save only on the advice of the Government&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mere passage of legislation through this House and by the Oireachtas generally could not, therefore, do what this motion seems to be asking it to do. It could not confer on the President powers to chair an overseas development aid commission, a judicial commission, an environmental council or a national sports council with the powers to the <Col N="335" /> President to operate these functions separately and independently from the Government.  That could only be done following a referendum to amend the Constitution.  Let us be clear on this point.  Article 28.2 of the Constitution says: &ldquo;The executive power of the State shall, subject to the provisions of this Constitution, be exercised by or on the authority of the Government&rdquo;.  In short, the Government of the day are the executive power in the State subject to the provisions of the Constitution and, in exercise of that power, the Government decide what resources are to be allocated to the different functions for which they are responsible, defence, security, development, health, welfare, housing, education, sport, the environment and all the other functions and purposes of Government.</P>
    <P>It is not administratively or politically conceivable that within the State there should be another constitutional authority with equal command of resources and equal or greater powers of application. Imagine for the purposes of the argument that we had an environment council or development aid commission chaired by the President.  Both would be worthy institutions and command a very high profile, but who would decide how much they should be allocated and what they should do?  Would it be the President or the Government, and what would happen in the event of disagreement? Which would prevail, the President's aspirations or the will of the democratically elected Government whose mandate is to rule and whose fate is determined every few years by the electorate who, in our democracy, are the ultimate arbiters&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The proposals in the motion are a recipe for continued constitutional crisis and <Col N="336" /> they show a fundamental lack of understanding of how the Constitution works. The House need not take my word for it. I quote from Professor James Casey's book &ldquo;Constitutional Law in Ireland&rdquo; as quoted in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> of 21 October:</P>
      <P>Some commentators seem to envisage an ill-defined leadership role for the President.  Whatever the merits of such an idea it is abundantly clear that no such role is conceived of, or can be exercised under the Constitution as it stands.</P>
      <P>The inference from this quotation is as I said earlier; the Constitution does not envisage an executive role for the President, other than the role it specifically confers on him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Another commentator Professor Ronan Fanning is quoted in <i>The Sunday Independent</i> as saying:</P>
      <P>The notion of a populist President, of a new-style President inspired by a sense of purpose separate from the purpose of the elected government is nonsense.  And, in so far as it flies in the face of the letter and of the spirit of the Constitution, it is a potentially dangerous nonsense.</P>
      <P>The Professor went on further that:</P>
      <P>The Presidency should serve as a source of stability, not as a force for change.  To suggest otherwise is utterly to misrepresent the nature of the office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take the proposals in the motion one by one.  The first is for an overseas development aid commission chaired by the President.  This commission would, according to the document proposing it, allocate overseas aid for specific projects out of funds voted by the Oireachtas and in practice the vote would be on the proposal of the Government.  The President can under the Constitution act only on the advice of the Government.  Would it <Col N="337" /> be necessary for the Government in full Cabinet to consider each and every allocation for development projects in order to advise the President so that he could seek to steer the commission towards a choice of projects?  If he agreed every time what would be the point of the commission? If he did not agree there would be a difference of opinion between the President and the Government and under the Constitution he would be obliged to act on their advice.  Therefore this provision would place the President in a position of allocating money which the Government had provided in the way in which the Government advised.  I find it difficult to imagine any proposal so demeaning to the office of the President.</P>
    <P>The proposal indicating that the accounting officer would be the secretary or second secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs would appear to assume that the Department of Foreign Affairs would be the implementing agency of the funds to be allocated by the commission. However, it is not clear whose direction it should follow &mdash; the presidential commission or its Minister.  Would the Minister be responsible to the Dáil under Article 28.4.2 of the Constitution in respect of specific projects to which funds have been allocated by the presidential commission?  The legislation, we are told, would also provide that the funding of the commission would be increased each year.  This would, if operated, take from this House the power to decide annually on the estimates of receipts and expenditure which under the Constitution the Government are required to present to the Dáil for consideration in each financial year.  There would be no point in the Dáil considering an estimate if the amount of that estimate had already been determined by legislation passed by the Dáil and Seanad and signed by the President.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dáil is entitled to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>No other item of expenditure, and I can think of many which deserve at least equal preference, would <Col N="338" /> get the same priority &mdash; not welfare, health services, salaries or anything.  In short the proposal for a commission is unclear and incoherent and its implications have not been throught out.  At best it would provide for the continuation of Government policy by a circuitous route of a commission, adding a layer of bureauracy the country can ill afford, and at worst it would provide a source of conflict between the President, the Government and the Dáil, and a confusing an unnecessary role for the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>The next proposal is to give the President a consultative role in judicial appointments.  Under the Constitution, judges of the Supreme Court, the High Court and all other courts established pursuant to Article 34, must be appointed by the President.  This proposal is, at best, a constitutional <i>non sequitur.</i>  It appears to suggest that the President should advise the Government as to whom they &mdash; the Government &mdash; should advise him to appoint.  Since the President can only exercise a new legal power on the advice of the Government it means that the Government would have to advise the President as to whom he should advise the Government to advise him to appoint.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion envisages the President initiating a procedure of consultation with the Bar Council and the Incorporated Law Society leading to a recommendation by them of a specified number of candidates to the Government. I am not sure whether it is envisaged that the President would simply have a purely formal, neutral role in initiating this procedure.  If so, there does not seem to be any point in involving the President in the process.  After all, there is nothing to prevent the Bar Council or the Law Society from recommending candidates to the Government for appointment to judicial office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, if the proposal is that the President is to have a large say in the selection of the nominees, he would <Col N="339" /> clearly be stepping outside the limits imposed by the Constitution.  But either way the President could be put in a difficult position if in a particular case none of the nominees was acceptable to the Government of the day and the President was then obliged to act on the advice of the Government and appoint someone else.  That could do enormous damage to the Office of President.</P>
    <P>What this proposal chooses to ignore is that the Government do not operate in a vacuum when making a selection for appointment.  They have available to them the advice of the Attorney General who is well placed to canvass the views not only of the Bar Council and the Law Society, as required, but also the views of the Judiciary who could be expected to be acquainted with the qualities of the candidates.  The President could not be expected to be acquainted with the qualities of those available for appointment and so would have to rely almost exclusively on the advice of the Bar Council and the Law Society.  While I have the greatest respect for these bodies I am not satisfied that they would have a monopoly of wisdom in the selection of suitable candidates for the bench.</P>
    <P>While perhaps no system of appointment could be claimed as perfect the existing constitutional process, that is appointment by the Government, has the advantage that it has been found to work successfully in the public interest. Indeed, since the foundation of the State the Judiciary have exercised their functions independently and in accordance with their oath of office.  They are widely respected for that.</P>
    <P>Next, there is the judicial commission, or council, for the document does not seem to be too clear on what exactly is intended.  As I understand it, the role of this commission would be to oversee the adequacy of staff, accommodation and other resources, causes of delays, inefficiencies and inconsistencies.  I should like to focus, first, on the last of these, that is, inconsistencies in sentencing.</P>
    <P>The clear implication is that the exercise by judges of their judicial function is <Col N="340" /> so defective as to require oversight not only by a judicial commission but one chaired by the President of Ireland.  I am not suggesting that particular judicial decisions in individual cases may not, from time to time, give rise to public concern, they sometimes do.  I suggest, however, that there are means of dealing with any such problems without involving the President.  If there are fundamental issues raised by individual decisions the first responsibility for addressing them rests with the Judiciary itself.  There may be a role for the Oireachtas but only after careful deliberation.  There is no reason to think that the President's involvement is necessary or desirable even if there were not constitutional objections to such a development.</P>
    <P>Under the Constitution, there is a separation of powers between the Government as Executive and the courts as the judicial authority.  The powers of the President are also separate from the judicial powers of the courts.  It is my strong view that this separation should be maintained.</P>
    <P>The commission would also apparently concern themselves with the level of resources they thought necessary for the proper provision of court services.  There is clearly room for differences of opinion as to what that provision should be and how it should be treated by the Government which, as I have said, must also have regard to all the other deserving claims made on the Exchequer.  As a practical matter, it would be impossible to avoid a confrontation between the President and the Government if such a difference emerged or if the financial situation became such that not all of the commission's recommendations could be accepted.  In short, the proposal would bring the office of President fully into the Executive area with disastrous results.</P>
    <P>Finally, on this point, I should add that it would also be wrong for the Dáil to assume that the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court or other members of the Judiciary would wish to become involved in such a consultative body in this way for such a purpose.</P>
    <P>I come now to the environment council <Col N="341" /> and sports council to be chaired, under these proposals, by the President. Nowhere among the proposals is anything so much designed as this to bring a President and Government into conflict. The Government of the day must decide on their priorities when it comes to the allocation of resources.  Maybe they would give sports or the environment a high priority.  Maybe they would not, but in deciding on the course they are to follow they would have to look to demands for more and better health services, for higher welfare payments, for more money for education and housing and for all the other pressing demands made on governments in addition, of course, to the demand for lower taxation. The President chairing these commissions could, constitutionally, act only on the advice of the Government: it is not hard to see, however, the seeds of conflict in a proposal to have him chair two high profile councils or commissions, when he himself, as the holder of high constitutional office, cannot determine the resources he can commit or how they are to allocated.</P>
    <P>It is clear, in particular, that an environment council chaired by the President could not be apolitical and it would inevitably become involved in controversy.  It is likely that in some matters it could be in dispute with existing Government institutions, whether at local or at national level.  Any disputes would be most damaging to the office of President which, because of the nature of the duties assigned to it by the Constitution, must be above politics and should not be in open conflict with Government policy or institutions.</P>
    <P>Apart, therefore, from the presidential merit awards scheme &mdash; which exists at present in the form of Gaisce &mdash; these proposals are a recipe for constitutional conflict of a type and intensity from which we in this country have been largely spared.</P>
    <P>What I have said should not in any way be seen as taking from or diminishing the role of the President.  Indeed, as one of the main institutions of this State, the President has many important duties <Col N="342" /> under the Constitution.  For many purposes, he represents the State, as distinct from the Government of the day.  He takes precedence over all other persons in the State and, subject to the advice of the Government, the supreme command of the Defence Forces is vested in him. He appoints Taoisigh and Ministers and, on the advice of the Government, members of the Judiciary, the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>The summoning and dissolution of the Dáil is done on the advice of the Taoiseach, though the President may, in his absolute discretion, refuse a dissolution to a Taoiseach who had ceased to retain the support of a majority.  The President has also the power, after consultation with the Council of State, to convene a meeting of either or both of the Houses of the Oireachtas, or again after consultation with the Council of State, to communicate with the Houses of the Oireachtas by message or address on any matter of national or public importance, subject to the approval of the Government to such communications.</P>
    <P>The attempt being made by the Fine Gael Party to insinuate that some improper, covert attempt was made to influence the President to exercise his discretion to refuse a dissolution of the Dáil to the then Taoiseach on 27 January 1982 is reprehensible.  In fact, the position of the Fianna Fáil front bench was made clear in a public statement issued by the Fianna Fáil Leader that very night and there was nothing secret about the position at all.</P>

      <P>The Constitution clearly states that any additonal powers or functions conferred on the President by law can only be discharged by him on the basis of the advice of the Government of the day.  That advice is not optional. Additional powers and functions have occasionally been conferred on the President by law or under Article 13.10 but these have been purely formal, such as the appointment of the Council members and senior professors of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, the appointment of the Governor of the Central Bank, the appointment of commissioned officers in the Defence Forces, etc.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is essential because of the important constitutional functions already vested in him that the office of the President should at all times be removed from the sphere of political conflict and controversy.  The opposite is being attempted by Fine Gael in this motion. The President cannot become involved in political issues, act as a focus of opposition or as an alternative to the elected Government.  Any attempt to cast the holder of the office in that role is both unrealistic and irresponsible and if put into effect could gravely undermine the stability of our democratic institutions.</P>
      <P>I believe that the office can play a very positive role without the need for new powers and functions.  At the same time, to suggest that the President should take on some new kind of executive role and exercise additional powers indicates, in my view, a profound and dangerous lack of understanding of the fundamentals of Bunreacht na hEireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The balance of power in the Constitution is very delicately weighed: it lies between the Presidency, the Government and the courts in ways that are clearly stated.  This balance has served the country well for more than 50 years now.  It has given us stability; it enables the people democratically and peacefully to change the Government of the day if that is their wish and it brings fairness <Col N="346" /> and equity, through the courts, in the interpretation and operation of the law.</P>
    <P>To attempt to bring this balance into question, through ill-conceived and badly thought out proposals of the kind suggested in this motion is to do neither the country nor the office of President any service.  To proceed as the main Opposition party are now advocating would totally disrupt the constitutional balance and result in legal and political chaos.  That essentially is the reason I would ask the House emphatically to reject this motion.</P>
    <P>In so far as the amendment to the motion is concerned, a lot of what I have already said applies.  Article 6 of the Constitution states that all powers of government, legislative, executive and judicial:</P>
    <P>are exercisable only by or on the authority of the organs of State established by this Constitution.</P>
    <P>The Presidency is one of these organs along with the courts and the Government. The powers of the Presidency cannot be changed without also changing either the powers of the Government or the courts, or both.  There is, therefore, not much point in contemplating a commission whose remit is simply to review the role and functions of the Presidency alone.  Any commission if it were to have a real purpose and a real remit would have to review the balance of functions as between the constitutional authorities in this State.  While obviously we must always keep the fundamental institutions of this State and their functioning under continuing review, I do not think that the present is the time to start, within the framework contemplated by this motion, looking at them by way of a committee or commission however wisely founded or constituted.</P>
    <P>As has been stated across the Chamber, we have major economic problems to face.  We must reduce unemployment and we must also get order into our public finances.  The level of public debt here is still among the highest in the developed world, and debt service still absorbs more than the total yield of VAT <Col N="347" /> and corporation tax, leaving us vulnerable to economic changes over which we as a State can exercise very little control. The problems can be tackled only in an atmosphere of institutional stability.</P>
    <P>In the European Community, we are facing the prospect of major changes which will affect the governance of this country, and of each member state of the Community, in ways nobody at present can foretell.  I refer, of course, to the proposals within the Community for political, economic and monetary union.  We will be debating this subject in the House next week.</P>
    <P>In relation to Northern Ireland, discussions are underway with the British Government which may or may not lead to fundamental changes affecting internal affairs in this island, relationships between North and South and our relationship with the British Government.</P>
    <P>To add yet one further strand of possibilities and doubts to this already tangled weave of uncertainty, by calling in question the function and role of the fundamental institutions of our State would, at the very least, be most unwise.  A commission of the sort envisaged in this amendment could not, as I have said, be confined to the Presidency.  It would add just that note of corrosive uncertainty to our institutions which we can well do without at this time.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware under the Constitution a candidate for election as President can be nominated either by:</P>
    <P>...not less than twenty persons, each of whom is at the time a member of one of the Houses of the Oireachtas, or</P>
    <P>by the Councils of not less than four administrative Counties (including County Boroughs) as defined by law.</P>
    <P>I need, I hope, only mention that each one of 20 persons, if he or she is a Deputy of this House, has been elected with a very substantial number of votes from the electorate to represent between <Col N="348" /> 20,000 and 30,000 people, approximately, in his or her constituency.  In deciding to nominate a candidate for the Presidency, as in his other official decisions, the Deputy is acting on behalf of this number of people.  In other words, 20 Deputies, in the full democratic interpretation of their role, represent between 400,000 and 600,000 people.  Even if within these figures, a Deputy is taken to represent only those who voted for him, the number of people he represents still remains very substantial.</P>
    <P>I need not go into the position here of Senators as nominators of Presidential candidates, except to say that the method by which they are chosen makes them also representative of important vocational interests and groups here.  To assume that they ignore their interest or lightly exercise their role in a Presidential nomination would, I think, be a totally unwarranted assumption.</P>
    <P>Again, I do not wish to detain the House with an analysis of the representative nature of our local authorities, except to say that a county council or county borough corporation, which has nominating powers would have on average, about 30 elected members.  Some authorities would have more, others less. I am using this figure simply in illustration of the point that the nomination of a Presidential candidate, under present procedures, by four county or county borough councils will have behind it the authority of at least a majority of about 120 people, each of whom, in turn, is elected by a large number of electors exercising his choice under the ordinary democratic processes of our country.</P>
    <P>Against this background, the suggestion in this amendment to this motion that there should be wider democratic procedures for nominating candidates for the Presidency runs against commonsense. There is a great deal of democracy in the method of nominating candidates.  What there is also is order and a method of ensuring that an election is administratively possible.  There is an even greater element of democracy in the election of the President who is selected by direct vote of the people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="349" /> I should like to refer to the perception that the political parties have Presidential elections somehow all sewn up, that it is impossible for a non-party candidate to succeed in being nominated as candidate or elected as President.  This, of course, is not true and does not stand up to scrutiny. The history of Presidential elections since 1937 shows that of a total of 12 candidates for the Office, four have claimed not to be members of a political party at the time of their nomination, including one candidate in the current election.  Two of these non-party candidates, the distinguished scholar, Dubhglas de hÍde, the first President, and the late Cearbhall Ó Daláigh actually succeeded in being elected to the Office.  This puts paid to the myth that the office of President is the preserve of party political candidates.</P>
    <P>The functions conferred on the Presidency under the Constitution, as I have said, are substantial and, in present times, require a high degree of knowledge and experience of administration, politics and public life.  Deputy Brian Lenihan alone of the candidates seeking office on this occasion has all these qualities.</P>

      <P>It is, therefore, important that a person elected to this post should know, preferably at first hand, just how Government works and be fully conscious of the sensitivity of the role which the Constitution enjoins on the President. The best way to get the best candidates with these attributes is to have a system of nomination in which the selection is made by persons who have themselves a wide and varied range of experience, who are democratically elected and who are democratically accountable.  That is our present system. We suggest this evening that this motion be rejected.  The Fine Gael document loses sight of the fundamentals of the doctrine of the separation of powers as between the different organs established by the Constitution, the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary.</P>

      <P>In effect, they are seeking to override the constitutional framework on which our democratic society depends.  The Fine Gael document seeks to sweep aside in one three hour debate the basic principles on which our understanding of democracy exists and has been understood to exist for years.  For these reasons I submit that the motion and amendment should be discarded.</P>

      <P>I am glad that this debate on the highest office in the land is taking place tonight as it is long overdue.  How long is it since the role and functions of the President were last debated in this House?  If we search the records we will find that the answer is, not since the Constitution itself was debated.  The role of President is defined in the Constitution under Article 12.1 which states:</P>
      <P>There shall be a President of Ireland <i>(Uachtarán na hÉireann)</i>, hereinafter called the President, who shall take precedence over all other persons in the State and who shall exercise and perform the powers and functions conferred on the President by this Constitution and by law.</P>
      <P>The role of the President is defined under the Constitution and is embodied largely in the oath that the Constitution, under Article 12.8., requires the successful candidate to take on being inaugurated as first citizen of our State.  That oath consists of this promise:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In the presence of Almighty God I <Col N="351" /> do solemnly and sincerely promise and declare that I will maintain the Constitution of Ireland and uphold its laws, that I will fulfil my duties faithfully and conscientiously in accordance with the Constitution and the law, and that I will dedicate my abilities to the service and welfare of the people of Ireland. May God direct and sustain me.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The role of President is defined in the Constitution and the limitations on that role have not only been subscribed by the Articles of the Constitution but more emphatically by convention.  In reality, the traditional role as carried out has been on the minimalist side.  The fact that many Presidents choose not to act in the full meaning of the oath to dedicate their abilities fully to the service and welfare of the people of Ireland and that political parties &mdash; and all the political parties in this House share culpability for it &mdash; have denied the people of this country the right to select their own President for 17 years, has contrived to demean and diminish the office and status of the first citizen of Ireland.</P>
    <P>It was with these facts in mind that Deputy Spring, the Leader of the Labour Party, initiated a debate late last year.  At that stage nobody was talking about the Presidency.  He said two things: that we would have a debate on the status, the role and the function of the President and that we would have an election &mdash; the first in 17 years &mdash; and that, if necessary, he would stand as a candidate.  Earlier this year the Labour Party invited Mary Robinson to be the official Labour Party nominee for the office of President of Ireland.</P>
    <P>We invited Mary Robinson to take on this important task because she is a woman of substance, the first woman to be a candidate for this high office when women constitute 51 per cent of the electorate. Her own background includes a brilliant academic record.  At the age of 25 she was the youngest ever professor of law at Trinity College.  Her career includes a brilliant record as a public representative, including 20 years in <Col N="352" /> Seanad Éireann.  She was the youngest university Senator in the Seanad.  She has outstanding commitment to voluntary organisations.  She has served as president of Cherish &mdash; the representative body for single parents &mdash; and she was a patron of the Liam Maguire Trust.  She was the first president of the Women's Political Association and a host of other international achievements are accredited to her.  Perhaps her greatest achievements have been as a distinguished lawyer.  It is in that area her work has most benefited the ordinary individual.  The list of constitutional cases she took to vindicate the individual rights of citizens is long.  The one hallmark of each case has been that she was invariably on the side of the downtrodden, the underdog, and sought vigorously to vindicate rights for people.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party asked Mary Robinson to take on this huge responsibility and she accepted not because she was underworked or because she did not have a rewarding career of her own but because she grasped the vision of the Labour Party proposal, that vision that began the debate and which is continuing in this discussion tonight.  In those few months she has captured the nation.  She has confounded the political pundits and analysts and she has rallied to her cause young and old, especially women who see her as their first voice.  People who have been disillusioned with politics have rallied to her cause in the last number of months.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party and Mary Robinson initiated a new vision, a vision that was at first attacked by the major party in this House but which now has been embraced by the three major parties and by the three candidates for the high office of President of Ireland.  There is a consensus now that did not exist a few short months ago, a consensus created by Mary Robinson, that we need a working President. There is an advertisement on television which says that the original of the species is best, and I think the people of Ireland will show that they have faith in the person who initiated the discussion and who first laid out a vision rather than <Col N="353" /> those who belatedly tried to catch up with the mood and vision of the people.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael have taken up the Labour Party's challenge to blow away the cobwebs and look afresh at the office and the person of President.  They put forward a motion tonight which contains many innovative and positive suggestions.  The role of the President can be enhanced.  It is important that we look and at least have the courage to address the issues and not dismiss them out of hand as Fianna Fáil so readily dismiss any innovative suggestion.</P>
    <P>The areas suggested in the motion include the establishment of a commission to oversee Overseas Development Aid &mdash; an area in which this country has a shameful record consistently falling well below the United Nations' targets, and an area in which the President could bring moral authority; giving the President a consultative role in judicial appointments.  This is something that could be looked at and debated and not dismissed out of hand; the appointment of a permanent judicial commission, again a worthy and thought provoking suggestion, and &mdash; I am very attracted to this one &mdash; the appointment of an environmental council.  No issue has captured the minds and imagination of people more than the environment. People are concerned about the implications of our careless attitude to the environment and what it will mean for future generations.  It is right and proper that we should explore a role for the President in crystallising public concern and pointing to ways that the nation could move towards improving the environment; it could be by way of tidy towns or involvement in afforestation, in planting flowers, as well as the major issues of deforestation, global warming and ozone depletion.</P>
    <P>The Minister tonight said that no such commission could be apolitical.  That is typical of the thinking of Fianna Fáil. They think in a political vein about everything and they cannot believe that anybody could think in any other way.  The initiation of a national sports recreation council is long overdue and it is probably, <Col N="354" /> and properly, a role for the President. The last suggestion is the institution of a presidential merit awards scheme.  Most countries have such a scheme; we have a limited version of the presidential Gaisce scheme.  This is an area that should be examined.</P>
    <P>As I said, the typical approach of Fianna Fáil is to reject this out of hand because that party have no vision, no foresight.  In short their view is no change. It is a vision, a view and a short sightedness that is out of step with the thinking of Irish people.  Fianna Fáil in this regard are stale and tired and are slowly getting the message on the doorstep in the course of this campaign.</P>
    <P>The thrust of the Labour Party proposals from the beginning of this campaign, not last week or last month but from the end of last year, has been to enhance and enrich the office of President. The President is directly elected &mdash; the only officer who is directly elected by all citizens, of this country.  She, therefore, will have a moral authority which need not be in conflict with the Executive or the Judiciary.  That moral authority can be used to focus on the rights of the individual, to be the personal champion and vindicator of the rights of each citizen, to promote and preserve the best in Ireland and to recognise excellence.</P>
    <P>This debate has witnessed some unseemly squabbling between the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael camps.  It is not my intention or that of my party to become involved in that row.  The office we are debating is far too important and the debate itself is far too fundamental for us to descend into name calling as if we were on the hustings at some crossroads.</P>
    <P>The amendment in the name of The Workers' Party Deputies is also worthy of consideration.  It provides a methodology to do the things listed in the motion and to broaden the scope, since it is not an exhaustive list.  More fundamentally, it incorporates an important additional issue, the democratisation of the nominating procedure.  God knows, we need a fairly severe dose of democracy.  There are many offices which need to be reformed. The nominating procedure for the <Col N="355" /> Seanad is dominated by the political parties or by the elitist group who are graduates of certain universities.  We need to look afresh at the institutions of State and we must not be afraid to do so.  There is a new Ireland out there which has woken up and is sick, sore and tired of stale &ldquo;has beenism&rdquo;.  That is why the campaign, the vision, the sparkle and the enthusiasm of Mary Robinson and all she has put before the Irish people has captured such broad support.  I believe that on 7 November the old stale thinkers are in for a rude awakening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the two speeches before that of my colleague, I noted that in one the word &ldquo;she&rdquo; occurred scarcely at all and in the other the word &ldquo;she&rdquo; occurred once.  This inability to speak about &ldquo;her&rdquo; role or to refer to when &ldquo;she&rdquo; occupies the position or a decision &ldquo;she&rdquo; might make is a indicator of what we are about in debating the occupancy of the Presidency and the nature of the role.  The manner in which people have been socialised in such a way as to make it difficult to recognise that we may be on the verge of seeing a woman occupy the principal position in the country reflects the choice that is before the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not intending to contribute any acrimony or conflict to our debate.  In many ways we have a straightforward choice.  Listening to the debates in recent days and weeks there is a choice between what I would call an administrative experience of the old kind where one endorses, gives the golden seal of approval to the person who has been loyal to a certain kind of experience, or where one gives the seal of approval to another kind of experience, the experience of somebody who has been ahead of the received possibilities of the day.  I believe it is this latter which is appropriate for us to choose as we end this century and begin another one.  To say that one wants to vote to reward what has been is to reward what has been dragged out of the administrative process and out of a slow and tortuous legislative process.  To say on the other hand that one wants to <Col N="356" /> respect and give one's support to the person who has been pushing the boat out in so many areas is to say that one is voting for the ethical impulse rather than voting for what is administratively barely possible.  It is this choice of voting for the ethical impulse which is really invigorating the Irish public.  The fact that for a start they are voting for inclusion of all people, voting for inclusion of the aspiration ethically of so many groups, has led them to vote for a person who represents this choice and who happens to be a woman.</P>
    <P>On the other side of that argument, the people who do not want to support such a view do not address the issue of so many people being excluded in our society; if they do not address the idea of exclusion neither do they address the greatest exclusion in this society since 1937 &mdash; the exclusion of women from full participation in our society.  I am not impressed by those who say that none of this is real.  They say we really should be running this according to the way it was decided in 1937.  Whether we like it or not, we are bound by the 1937 Constitution. I do not think any of us in our senses sitting here this evening could say that it was some kind of holy writ handed down in tablets never to be changed.  It was complimented by Mussolini; Salazar liked it and it was discussed with some favour in very authoritarian circles in Germany.  The 1937 Constitution in the fullness of time will change.  It provides us with a set of articles which limit functions and describe them, as Professor Casey, Professor Kelly and Professor Ronan Fanning note them.</P>
    <P>If the Articles of the Constitution specify functions, there is also the oath of the Presidency.  These taken together provide us with an interesting choice. One is to say that the person who fills the Presidency is the victim of the Constitution; the other is to say that the person who fills the office is a human being drawing energy from their own personality, their own experience, their own history, responding to the human possibilities of the oath of office as well as the rigours of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="357" /> There is a third dimension which the Minister decided to ignore.  Around both the Articles of the Constitution and the fact that the oath of office has been buried as a source of energy there are the numerous conventions which have grown around the office.  Some of these conventions go back to a situation in which a party dominated the choice of who should fill the office.  This led them to the rather extraordinary statement that if people other than themselves were somehow to be allowed the opportunity to rule it could constitute anarchy.  I suppose it is part of the mentality of the divine right to rule.  Louis XIV had such a complex and so had many others.  The truth of the matter is that conventions can be changed and they are neither provisions of the Constitution nor are they inhibiting laws.</P>
    <P>We have been invited by this motion to consider whether there are other areas into which the accepted principles of the exercise of presidential duties might be reasonably extended.  We are also invited in the amendment to discuss the possibility that there might be others as well. There is a suggestion that the form of nomination might be extended.  This is all perfectly reasonable provided one is in favour of living in the modern world, opening the windows and so on.  If one is to say that this is a little casket which is closed and written forever, the way we have always had it, and that our man &mdash; not our woman &mdash; has come through the process in the ordinary way, it is more of the same.  People are entitled to hold this view.  This is a democracy.  I do not want to denigrate anybody standing for this office.  The candidates are people with a contribution and an excellent record.</P>
    <P>I am saying simply that, at the end of the day, there is a choice in this election and our candidate is the person who has taken every marginal issue, every significant civil liberties issue, both in politics and in the courts, who has set her face against exclusion, and who is arguing for inclusion.</P>

      <P>I find myself having to repeat &mdash; and this is in no way to diminish the role of the Minister of State &mdash; that a very short time ago the Minister was seen leaving the House.  It concerns me that he could not have waited another 20 or 30 minutes to hear the views of the House about the continued holding of many Irish people in Iraq and Kuwait. Perhaps he had an appointment he could not have cancelled.  Nonetheless it is important that he know of the deep concern of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now 84 days since over 300 Irish people were taken hostage in Iraq and Kuwait.  There are still others being held as hostages although their numbers have been reduced somewhat.  The Parc organisation have managed to get approximately 91 Irish people out of Baghdad and others from Kuwait and Baghdad have been got home, mainly women and children.  There are 180 Irish people still in Baghdad in the employment of the Parc Hospital.  There are estimates of between 20 to 40 other Irish people in Iraq; it is difficult to ascertain exact numbers. In Kuwait, from where the most disquieting stories emanate, there are approximately 34 Irish passport holders. The stories emanating from there are most disturbing.  In the case of all people being held hostage their loss of freedom and fear must be enormous; at times their <Col N="359" /> feeling of having been abandoned must be very real.</P>
    <P>I spoke today to the father of a girl who managed to escape some time ago with her baby from Kuwait.  She received a letter within the last couple of days from her husband, still trapped in Kuwait, dated 11 September, which took over one month to arrive here.  That was a most disturbing letter in which he said the resistance was very busy around his area.  He said many young Kuwaitis had been arrested and tortured.  He told her that the previous evening there had been a demonstration on the rooftop and the soldiers sprayed gunfire.  He said the Iraqis were gutting and raiding all warehouses, burning them down.  He said they were also commandeering all vehicles and petrol.  On 11 September that man wrote also that there was no bread, meat or vegetables available to them.</P>
    <P>I spoke today to the wife and children of another Irishman trapped in Kuwait. She received a letter yesterday, through the New Zealand Embassy, in which her husband said they were now reduced to flour and water.  This is very disturbing news.</P>
    <P>Obviously, it is not Irish people only who are suffering like this.  There are many other non-nationals, Kuwaitis and Iraqis who are suffering also.  But our concern in this Parliament obviously must be for our citizens.  Probably we do not have the full or true story.  Irish people in Kuwait know that if they endeavour to escape and get to Baghdad &mdash; where there is a certain amount of safety &mdash; they will be detained and arrested.  Apart from that they do not have the petrol and, in most instances, the vehicles either.  It is the lack of information that worries me. Indeed, we are lucky to have had those two pieces of information at all.</P>
    <P>I understand that the position in Baghdad is not as serious as that in Kuwait. Nonetheless the low morale is of obvious concern.  I understand from the Parc organisation there is not any great difficulty being experienced by way of shortage of food.  I understand that, although transport, movement and petrol are <Col N="360" /> being rationed, Parc have made facilities available so that their staff can get away from the hospital on their days off.  I welcome the fact also that, within the last couple of weeks the Parc Hospital was granted special status.  This means that people whose work permits have expired are gradually being furnished visas to leave.  Not everybody has managed to leave but I understand another seven or eight will be home within the next few days and some more next week.  At least there is some movement there which must help in some way people becoming too depressed.</P>
    <P>I must stress that there is still concern being expressed to me by relatives that the Minister does not appear to be as serious as he might be.  I welcome the fact that a delegation will be going to Baghdad which I hope will be effective and will be able to express the abhorrence of this country about Sadam Hussein.  I am somewhat concerned that there might be an effort made to keep them quiet so that they can get in there, be seen to be friendly and so on.  I hope that will not be the case.  I hope that the members of that delegation will be forthright in their abhorrence of what Sadam Hussein has done.</P>

We should give priority to a comprehensive debate enabling people to understand the full implications of the invasion of Kuwait and the awful summary detention of thousands of hostages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present people are receiving information about what is happening there secondhand; they have to cobble together bits and pieces of news from RTE and <Col N="361" /> the press.  They do not understand or know what is Government policy or thinking.  That is unfair on relatives who are awaiting and hoping for news of their loved ones.</P>
    <P>There are two such families in my constituency. One involves a young mother with a baby whose husband went out there 12 weeks ago to undertake a two week locum and who has not returned. She is desperately worried about him and his job.  The other case is that of a mother whose son is in Kuwait.  She does not know where he is, or how he is existing. She received a message from him by a very circuitous route and she is extremely concerned.</P>
    <P>I want an immediate debate in this House so that people will know and understand what is Government thinking, what are the various issues involved. It would also mean we would be given a chance to discuss what is now the meaning of Irish neutrality.</P>

What is coming across from us, and from other Members who have not had an opportunity to speak, is the vital importance of sharing information with people here who have relatives in Kuwait and in Iraq &mdash; any reassurance, any sharing of information is of the utmost importance.  The sense of isolation and vulnerability of such relatives cannot be overstated.  Any effort by the Government, and at European level, must include full dissemination of such information to relatives and, indeed, to all our people.  I know that other Members will accept that some of the relatives of Irish people with whom I have spoken have said they are not asking that the special position of Ireland's neutrality be used in any concession for the Irish over and above any other nationality or to damage the European collective decision at UN level.  However, they asked that Ireland use its neutrality and particular acceptability in certain countries in the most positive way to help continue the non-violent and, above all, <Col N="362" /> diplomatic negotiating that is going to be needed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I thank Deputy Owen for putting down this question and Deputy Fennell and Deputy Barnes for their contributions. The Government, as indeed all of us in the House, share the Deputies' concern for those Irish who are trapped in Iraq and Kuwait as a result of Iraq's invasion and annexation of Kuwait.  We can fully appreciate the frustrations, the distress and the sense of helplessness which are felt by those relatives who have family members in these two countries.  The House can be assured that the Government are doing everything in their power to tackle the problems caused to Irish citizens as a result of Iraq's actions.</P>
      <P>In relation to Deputy Owen's opening contribution, let me say I am here with the full authority of the Government to speak on behalf of the Minister, and of myself because I have been in constant touch with the situation since it arose.</P>
      <P>Since 2 August, the safety and welfare of our over 400 citizens has been and will continue to be the Government's foremost priority.  In both countries all Irish citizens are safe.  No Irish national has been detained as part of the &ldquo;human shield&rdquo; as is the unfortunate case for the nationals of Britain, the United States of America, France, Germany and Japan. The only Irish citizens who are detained are the three men facing specific charges and on whose behalf we are in constant contact with their lawyers, the Iraqi authorities and their families here in Ireland. The Embassy in Baghdad has also been afforded consular access to the three men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our citizens must be given their rights under international law to travel freely and to leave Iraq and Kuwait for the destination of their choice.  We have insisted that these rights be respected by the Iraqi authorities.  My colleague, the <Col N="363" /> Minister for Foreign Affairs, in his meeting last month with the Iraqi Ambassador to Ireland formally protested on behalf of the Government at the Iraqi treatment of our citizens.  He told the Ambassador that the refusal to allow Irish people to leave Iraq and Kuwait was unacceptable and a breach of the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, to which Iraq is a party.  The Government are sparing no effort to secure the maximum possible number of exit visas but it is not within our power to bring our citizens home without the consent of the Iraqi authorities.  All possible pressure is being brought to bear to achieve this end and that will continue to be done.</P>
    <P>In the days following the invasion of Kuwait, the Minister for Foreign Affairs together with his two EC Troika colleagues visited a number of capitals in the area.  The question of the welfare and safety of our citizens was specifically raised during the meetings with Arab leaders.  The Ambassador at Baghdad has made and will continue to make repeated and strongly worded protests to the Iraqi authorities from the Foreign Minister downwards about the situation of our citizens.  We have increased the staff levels of our Embassy in Baghdad &mdash; all of whom have worked tirelessly to obtain the right for all our citizens to leave Kuwait and Iraq and to make the necessary arrangements in the case of those permitted to leave.</P>
    <P>However, in relation to that, I must say with sorrow that the Iraqi authorities today informed the Irish Ambassador in Baghdad that the First Secretary of the Embassy, Mr. Adrian McDaid, was being asked to leave Iraq in retaliation for the withdrawal of the diplomatic accreditation of the Iraqi military attaché based in London and accredited to Ireland, the withdrawal of the accreditation of the Military attaché following the decision of the Twelve on 7 September to expel all Iraqi military attachés from member states.  My colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, has commented that he is extremely disappointed and regrets this decision, which is unjustified <Col N="364" /> and disproportionate.  Our views on this matter have been conveyed to the Iraqi authorities by our Ambassador in Baghdad.</P>
    <P>At home, in order to keep relatives as fully informed as possible &mdash; this for information though I am sure the Deputies know it already &mdash; the Government formalised the provision of information with the establishment of the Special Information Service on the Middle East. The service collates all available information from our diplomatic missions, the EC and other sources.  It provides up-to-date information to relatives &mdash; 12 hours a day, seven days a week.  My Department also readily agreed to provide a venue for the weekly meetings of the Gulf Relatives Support Group.  Senior officials of the Department have met with the group every week since the invasion to brief the relatives on the latest developments. The Government have also provided to the relatives group an office with telephones, fax etc. for their exclusive use.  This is intended to enable relatives of people stranded in the Gulf to speak to others who are in a similar situation. In addition both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs on two occasions have met with the relatives' committee to have a full discussion as to how the Government could assist the relatives in this most distressing situation for them and to explain what the Government were doing to seek the early return home of their loved ones.</P>
    <P>I can fully appreciate the distress and frustration which the present situation causes to the relatives.  We in the Government are sparing no effort to secure as many exit visas as possible for our citizens.  At the time of the invasion of Kuwait, we had a total of 109 Irish citizens in Kuwait; today there are only 30.  Some 68 per cent of the total have now returned home.  Of those remaining, 19 are men of whom 11 are dual nationals, four women and seven children.  The 11 women and children could have availed of evacuation arrangements but, for the moment, have chosen to remain.  All of the men in Kuwait are free to leave <Col N="365" /> Kuwait for Iraq but so far have not taken this option.</P>

Let me say on this &ldquo;green ribbon&rdquo; day for those stranded in the Gulf, I can appreciate the sense of tension and distress felt by relatives of the Irish citizens trapped in Iraq or Kuwait. They can rest assured that the Government will not cease efforts to secure for their family members an early and safe return home.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this issue because of the very unsatisfactory nature of the ambulance service in the Cork-Kerry region.  It has been unsatisfactory for quite some time and in recent days the position has deteriorated because the emergency back-up ambulance service provided by Cork Corporation has been withdrawn because of the condition of the ambulance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Allied to the unsatisfactory service, there is no maximum standard response time in existence in this country.  In cities like Belfast 90 per cent of the emergency <Col N="366" /> calls are answered within six minutes. A standard response time of this type I believe is necessary along with proper cardiac equipment and crew training for each ambulance.  A properly equipped ambulance and proper crew training would increase the survival rate of heart attack patients in the region.  Most deaths from sudden heart attacks come within the first hours and it is highly important that, in the event of emergency calls involving heart attacks, there be a ready response from a properly equipped ambulance.  Most calls in the event of sudden heart attacks come over the 999 emergency system, and in most cases such calls are not pre-announced as cardiac calls, they are described as collapses. The first attention the victim gets is from the ambulance crew, so it is vital that there be a fully equipped ambulance and a fully trained crew.</P>
    <P>Most of the ambulances in the Dublin area responding to 999 calls &mdash; in an area of high density population and low areas to cover &mdash; are adequately equipped with cardiac monitors and cardiac defibrillators and the crews are properly trained to work this equipment.  In contrast, in the Southern Health Board area none of the health board ambulances are equipped with cardiac monitors or cardiac defibrillators.  There is no doubt whatsoever that the provision of cardiac equipment and cardiac training does reduce mortality rates in cardiac emergencies especially with the new semiautomatic monitor defibrillators.</P>
    <P>There is a number of sudden deaths in Cork city alone every week, many of which are caused by heart attack.  In fact 50 per cent of all sudden deaths nationally are caused by heart attacks or at least by cardio-vascular disease, and two thirds of those who die from coronary arterial disease die outside of hospital, and 90 per cent of people who suffer sudden cardiac arrest develop ventricular fibrillation, a condition which can often be corrected if a defibrillator is available quickly.</P>
    <P>Fifty per cent of people who die from sudden heart attack present no evidence of disease on the face of it.  What I am <Col N="367" /> saying is that a properly equipped ambulance service is essential for the saving of lives.  I am not being over dramatic when I say that people are dying on the streets of Cork city and in the towns of Counties Cork and Kerry who need not die.  The Southern Health Board in fact recognise this fact and have asked for adequate funding to upgrade the ambulances.  The ambulances in Dublin have this equipment since the late seventies.  Mr. Seán Hurley who is the manager of the Cork Regional Hospital said that £200,000 would be sufficient to equip the ambulances. I would ask the Minister what is the price of life?</P>
    <P>In a so-called Christian country £17.6 million is being spent on a Taoiseach's office block while the Department of the Taoiseach are spending £20 million on an extension to the National Museum.  If we can spend money like this, it is a crime against the people of this country that we cannot spend £200,000 to equip heart ambulances.  Despite the feeling of complacency around at present about the health services, they are still deteriorating. In the Southern Health Board region we are being forced to close a hospital because of financial starvation. Waiting lists for surgical procedures are being lengthened because the Minister will not make decisions regarding the appointment of consultants.</P>
    <P>A paltry £200,000 would be sufficient to give us a properly equipped ambulance service and I am asking the Minister tonight to make an early decision to rectify the appalling and tragic situation that is taking place every week of the year in the streets of Cork city and in counties Cork and Kerry.</P>
    <P>At this stage I would like to hand over to Deputy McGinley.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank my colleague, Deputy Allen, for giving me the remaining few minutes of his time. Everything he has said about properly equipped ambulances to deal with cardiac arrest can be applied to any rural area in the County of Kerry and along the entire western seaboard.  It is unbelievable that <Col N="368" /> this service has been available to the capital city here for over ten years where most people are living within ten or 15 minutes of a major hospital whereas in rural areas such as Deputy Allen and I represent, it takes an hour or two to get to a hospital.</P>
      <P>I believe the equipment needed in ambulances for this purpose is relatively inexpensive.  For about £10,000 or £12,000 any ambulance can be equipped with a defibrillator, a stabiliser and a resuscitator.  I have no doubt that if they were available to ambulances in rural areas, countless lives would have been saved.</P>
      <P>It is no joy to me to have to relate that in my own parish I know of two people who passed away on their way to hospital during the summer, young men in their forties who had 20 or 30 years life expectancy. I am firmly convinced that if the service had been available it would have prevented that loss of life.</P>
      <P>I understand that in Scotland where there is terrain and rural population similar to the situation here there is an excellent service.  It would be worthwhile for the Department of Health and the Government to find out how they can do it so that we might take steps to provide an adequate service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my own constituency it takes an hour or two to get to a hospital and there are people on Island communities who have to cross the seas to the mainland to get to a hospital.  It should be a top priority for every health board, particularly in the north west where we have some of the remotest areas in the country and unhabitated islands, to have this necessary equipment available.  I can inform the Minister that in the north west at the moment &mdash; in west Donegal, Gweedore, the Rosses, etc. &mdash; a voluntary committee of concerned citizens have already been established and are in consultation with the health board.  There is a major fund raising campaign going on.  They can certainly make their contribution but they must have the backing of the health board, the Government and the Department.  I understand also that it only takes weeks to train the personnel <Col N="369" /> to manage this equipment.  I understand there are three-week courses in the Phoenix Park here in Dublin which nurses and medical personnel can attend and thereafter be perfectly able to handle this equipment.</P>

      <P>Thank you very much, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to speak on this major issue. We are talking about the saving of life.  I would ask the Minister to give the issue his immediate attention and to instruct the health boards to have this equipment available in all rural based ambulances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Deputies Allen and McGinley for raising this matter on the adjournment.  I welcome this opportunity to explain the current position in relation to ambulance services in general and cardiac ambulances in particular.  The provision of ambulance services is a matter for each health board in the first instance.  Health Boards may provide ambulance services under section 57 of the Health Act 1970. Ambulance services are also provided by a small number of voluntary agencies. Dublin Fire Brigade provide an accident and emergency ambulance service for the Dublin City area for the Eastern Health Board on a contractual basis.  The eight health boards provide funding for their ambulance services from their own allocations.</P>
      <P>Ambulance services in each health board area are based at a number of ambulance stations, which are usually located on hospital sites.  The health boards provide a 24 hour, seven day week accident and emergency ambulance service as well as routine minibus transport of patients to out-patient appointments and clinics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All ambulances are equipped with radio communications and are in constant contact with their station.  They carry an extensive range of first-aid and medical <Col N="370" /> equipment based on recommendations made by the Ambulance Services Council. Ambulance personnel are trained in first-aid and resuscitation techniques and other skills related to their job.</P>
    <P>Defibrillators are the only piece of equipment which distinguishes cardiac ambulances.  All ambulances carry various types of equipment but cardiac ambulances carry defibrillators.  Normal ambulances are not equipped with this type of equipment.</P>
    <P>Normally, the ambulance service is the first link between a member of the public involved in an accident or emergency and the health services.  A rapid response by the ambulance service is especially important when the patient has suffered a heart attack.  The ambulance service has always coped very well with these situations and I am sure it will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>However, specialised cardiac ambulances have been introduced over the past number of years, especially in the USA, as an alternative approach when dealing with cardiac patients.  A cardiac ambulance service is operated in the Dublin area by the Eastern Health Board and now responds to around 5,000 cardiac calls per year.  This service has been assessed by the Eastern Health Board and I understand that the board intend to continue its use in the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Southern Health Board, I understand that a private cardiac ambulance service already operates within the Southern Health Board region.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not respond to 999 calls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy got his opportunity but I will respond to what he has said.  In regard to the Southern Health Board's service I understand that the provision of pre-hospital cardiac care, including the introduction of a cardiac ambulance service is being actively considered by the board at present in the context of the development of cardiology services in general.  Officials of my <Col N="371" /> department are available at any time to discuss proposals with the board for the provision of such a service.</P>
      <P>The Irish Heart Foundation also provides some cardiac assistance by way of cardiac cars and have made two cardiac cars available to two health boards in this country.  I understand that an offer of a cardiac car was made to the Southern Health Board and that having considered the matter, they decided not to avail of the offer.</P>
      <P>Deputy Allen made a statement at the weekend that was quoted in the press saying that there was a very poor ambulance service in the Southern Health Board area.  The chief ambulance officer of the Southern Health Board has assured us that this is not true and that the service is up to the proper standard.  Tonight Deputy Allen has said that the ambulance available to Cork Corporation has been withdrawn because of its condition. The Department of Health have not been notified of this nor have representations been made to us about the situation.  I am quite confident that if that situation was made known to the Department and if consultation takes place between the corporation and the Southern Health Board who have responsibility and a statutory duty to provide ambulance service in the Southern Health Board region, in consultation with us, we can resolve the matter in a reasonable way as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>It is important to recognise that we have an excellent ambulance service in this country.</P>

There is a proper ambulance service in this country.  At this time the Department of Health are examining the whole ambulance service.</P>

I would further assure the House that the totality of the ambulance service available is under examination by experts in my Department and that if changes need to be made they will be made in due course.</P>

    <P>I am circulating to Deputies an outline programme of the events and activities to mark Dublin's year as the European City of Culture, 1991.  This programme was prepared by the organisers of Dublin <Col N="117" /> 1991 who are publishing a detailed brochure next month.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will note from this programme, Dublin 1991 is providing a focus and stimulus for many important and innovative events and initiatives which will be staged in Dublin next year and which will be of lasting benefit to the city. I am satisfied that this will involve many additional special events to mark the year which will permanently intensify the level of cultural activity in the city.</P>
    <P>A total amount of £1.25 million has been allocated by my Department from the national lottery to the project.  Other public bodies are also making a significant input to the cultural capital activities including Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council, the Office of Public Works, Bord Fáilte and the Department of the Environment.  An allocation from the European Community is also being arranged and over £900,000 sponsorship has been pledged to date from private sources.</P>

However I expect that this is one of the variables which the wider Irish tourism industry will obviously have to take into account in determing their pricing policy for the coming season, to ensure that the overall cost of the Irish tourism package remains competitive in our main markets.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>On 2 October last, I announced that the Government had agreed to extend for a period of one year, the repayable loan of £500,000 given this year to Swansea Cork Ferries Limited in order to enable the company to provide a service in 1991.  Meanwhile, Bord Fáilte have already had preliminary discussions with the company to agree a marketing strategy for the ferry service for the coming year.</P>
      <P>The financial assistance which has been offered by the Government to Swansea Cork Ferries Limited for 1991 is intended to assist the company in their transition to a fully commercial status.  In this regard, I have indicated to Swansea Cork Ferries Limited that, in order to guarantee the future of the service, they must now approach tourist and commercial interests in the south-west and secure their support and assistance.  I have also made it clear to the company that the future of the Cork/Swansea service rests with them and will depend on full support from the region.  There can be no question of further support from the Exchequer for the service.</P>

      <P>As I explained in reply to questions from Deputy McGrath on 19 June 1990, weather forecasts issued by the Irish Meteorological Service are based on a vast range of data from a wide variety of sources including reports from Irish stations, from other countries and from ships in the Atlantic, as well as from meteorological satellites and weather surveillance radar.  In a volatile weather situation the absence of data from some normal sources could have adverse effects on the quality of forecasts.  On 4 June last relatively quiet conditions prevailed and a comparison of actual weather conditions with the forecast <Col N="123" /> issued revealed no detectable loss of quality.</P>
      <P>The general high level of accuracy of forecasts issued by the Irish Meteorological Service, including those issued on 4 June, should ensure that public confidence in the forecasts will remain high.</P>

      <P>I share the Deputy's concern that the process of economic development should not be pursued at the expense of disproportionate damage to the environment.  The European Community, for its part, has taken particular steps to ensure that such an eventuality does not arise in relation to projects assisted by the Community's Structural Funds.</P>
      <P>The Structural Funds are dispensed under a Community Support Framework which is drawn up in respect of each region.  Once the Community Support Framework has been adopted by the Commission, as it has been in respect of French Guiana, the implementation of the programmes identified in the framework is a matter for the Commission and the member state concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each Community Support Framework requires that measures supported under the framework comply with EC legislation on the environment.  Furthermore, in respect of projects likely to have a significant impact on the environment, there is a requirement for member states to supply the Commission with appropriate information so as to allow the Commission to evaluate the impact on the environment of the project concerned.  I <Col N="125" /> understand that it is the intention of the Commission to follow this procedure in respect of major road building projects to be funded under the Community Support Framework for French Guiana.</P>

      <P>The Government have consistently condemned South Africa's efforts to destabilise neighbouring independent African states, and in particular, Mozambique through its support for the MNR.  The South African Government have stated that their support for the MNR has ceased and we welcome this development.  Our hope is that the improved climate of relations between Mozambique and South Africa under President De Klerk will result in the effective cessation of these aggressive activities.</P>
      <P>We remain concerned, however, at reports that the MNR may still be receiving material support from non-official sources in South Africa and elsewhere. We believe it is in South Africa's own interests that immediate steps be taken to terminate any such aid or assistance to the MNR.</P>
      <P>The Government want to see the abolition of the apartheid system and its replacement by a united, democratic and non-racial South Africa, founded on respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states.

      <P>The Civil Service Commission, in common with other employers, take up references from former employers of appointees to the Civil Service.  In addition, the Civil Service Commission verifies that all the information provided by applicants in support of their application is correct. Where candidates state that they were employed or unemployed for a period of longer than three months, they are asked to provide documentary confirmation of that fact.  Confirmation of periods of unemployment is normally obtained by the candidate from the employment exchange.  It is to cater for the small number of cases where information is not available from that source that the alternative sources listed in the question are suggested to the candidate.</P>
      <P>I am assured by the Civil Service Commission that where candidates have any difficulty in responding to requests for information or any other matter connected with their appointment, the commission are only too happy to discuss these problems with them.</P>

      <P>Restructuring programmes which are endorsed by the IMF must be based on sound economic policies, including a strong budget.  They must also be the country's own programme: IMF experience has shown that a programme can only be effective if the authorities of the country concerned are genuinely committed to it and it is supported by a broad consensus of the population.  In order to help protect vulnerable sectors of the population when corrective policies are implemented, the IMF advises the authorities to give due weight to poverty and income-distribution issues.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, at the commencement of the current year, 1990-91, the taxpayer and her husband were assessed to tax on the basis of the aggregation of their incomes.  As her husband was unemployed, the tax-free allowances due to the couple were allocated to the taxpayer.  Her husband commenced employment during the year and both spouses advised the inspector of taxes that they wished to be taxed on the separate treatment basis.  Under this system, the taxpayer and her husband are taxed as single persons and there is no provision for the transfer of any unused tax-free allowances from one spouse to the other.  An amended certificate of tax-free allowances on this basis was issued to the taxpayer on 20 August 1990.</P>
      <P>On the basis of this amended certificate granting reduced allowances, an underpayment of tax amounting to £350 arose since 6 April last.  The taxpayer advised her employer that she wished to have the underpayment collected as quickly as possible and arranged with her employer that it would be collected by January 1991.  Otherwise, the employer would have spread collection until the end of the tax year.</P>

    <P>** Excludes the effects of the tax amnesty.</P>
    <P>The figures in column (a)  of the table are based on income tax collected through the PAYE mechanism which covers more than income tax on ordinary wages and salaries.  It includes tax paid by directors of close companies who are akin to the self-employed as well as tax on &ldquo;other income&rdquo; of employees such as rent and other investment income.  It also includes the tax paid under PAYE on the income from employment of farmers and other self-employed individuals.</P>
    <P>NOTES ON TABLE</P>
    <P>
      <i>Column (a)</i>
    </P>
    <P>(i)  The average tax payment for each year is obtained by dividing the net receipt of PAYE tax in each calendar year by the number of taxpaying units effectively liable to tax in the income tax year in which the calendar year ends e.g. the 1985 net receipt is divided by the number liable to tax in 1985-86.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Column (b)</i>
    </P>
    <P>(i)  In calculating the figures in this column the estimated net receipt from farm taxation in each calendar year has been divided by the number of farming tax units assessed to tax on their farming profits in the year of assessment in which the calendar year ends e.g. the 1985 receipt is divided by the <Col N="145" /> number assessed for the year 1985-86, irrespective of whether the assessed tax was actually payable.</P>
    <P>(ii)  The reduction in the average tax payments made by farmers over some of the years in question is mainly due to the introduction of additional numbers of farmers to tax records since 1983-84 consequent on the abolition of the rateable valuation threshold.  It follows that the new cases, in general, had much smaller holdings and consequently had, on average, lower taxable incomes.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Full-time farmers and farmers who, or whose spouses, carry on another trade or profession have been included in the calculations in respect of tax paid on their farming profits.</P>
    <P>(iv)  Income tax on farming profits is collected with schedule D tax generally and because of this it cannot be separately distinguished. Accordingly, the figures shown for tax payments by farmers are estimated.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Column (c)</i>
    </P>
    <P>(i)  The figures contained in this column are obtained by dividing the estimated net receipt of income tax from other self-employed tax units in each calendar year by the estimated number of those units assessed to tax in the year of assessment in which the calendar year ends as explained in note (i) for column (b).</P>
    <P>(ii)  Some of the increases in the average tax payments made by other self-employed in 1987 and 1988 are due to the introduction of the withholding tax on professional fees in 1987 and the combined effects of the tax amnesty, the introduction of the selfassessment system and a full year payment of the withholding tax in 1988.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Columns (a), (b) and (c)</i>
    </P>
    <P>(i)  A married couple who has elected or has <Col N="146" /> been deemed to have elected to have the income of both spouses assessed on the husband is counted as one tax unit.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Some figures in the columns differ from those given previously.  This is due to more accurate information becoming available in the meantime.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Receipts of deposit interest retention tax and tax deducted by building societies under the former composite rate arrangements are not included in the calculations.  Basic data are not available which would enable the amounts of these taxes referable to interest paid or credited to particular classes of taxpayers to be ascertained.</P>

    <P>It should be noted that the balance outstanding in the case of each of the taxes includes amounts under appeal or inquiry, not disputed then but likely to be the subject of claims for admission of late appeals or revision on submission of returns, under demand or enforcement, and/or not likely to be collected.</P>
    <P>In effect therefore the difference between the balance and the amount likely to be collected is largely accounted for by anticipated reductions of estimated amounts included in the balance.  Self-assessments for individuals and companies will have a beneficial effect on the figures in future years.</P>

    <P>(3)  Up to and including 1985-86, an income tax allowance was available in respect of dependent children and this is reflected in the table for the relevant years.  It was abolished in respect of the 1986-87 and subsequent tax years.  Its abolition was accompanied by an increase in child benefit sufficient to compensate standard-rate taxpayers &mdash; then paying tax at 35 per cent &mdash; for its loss.</P>

    <P>The figures in the table do not include receipts of deposit interest retention tax or of certain other miscellaneous tax payments. Basic data are not available which would enable the amounts of these tax payments which are attributable to particular classes of taxpayers to be ascertained. The percentage figures given must be seen in the context of the relative numbers of taxpayers in each of the sectors mentioned.</P>

      <i>Notes</i>
    </P>
    <P>(1)  The figure covers more than income tax on ordinary wages and salaries. It includes tax paid by directors of close companies who are akin to the self-employed as well as tax on &ldquo;other income&rdquo; of employees such as rent and other investment income.  It also includes the tax paid under PAYE on the income from employment of farmers and other self-employed individuals.</P>
    <P>(2)  Income tax on farming profits is collected with Schedule D tax generally and the figure shown is, to some extent, estimated.  The figure shown is an estimate of the tax paid by full time farmers together with the estimated tax paid by trader-farmers on their farming profits only.</P>
    <P>(3)  This figure includes tax paid on income from trades and professions (other than farming), together with tax paid on other income such as rent and other investment income.  It also includes withholding tax on professional fees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that in addition to the <Col N="154" /> £497 million which was received in 1988 on foot of the amnesty and related matters, the breakdown of which was already given in my reply to your previous parliamentary question on 14 November 1989, a further £20 million approximately in excess of what is normally received by them from the sheriffs in the first three months of a year, but which was received in that period in 1989, could reasonably be attributed to the amnesty.  A breakdown of that figure by tax category is not available.</P>
      <P>I am also informed that because of the vast number of individual cases involved covering all the taxes concerned, the commissioners did not compile statistics for the total amount of interest due by persons and companies who came within the terms of the amnesty.  All available resources during the amnesty period were fully extended in coping with accounting and receipting procedures and could not be deployed to the costly exercise of calculating interest that might otherwise be due.  The task of managing the amnesty would have been totally disrupted if resources had been expended on such a calculation.  This disruption would have adversely affected the success of the amnesty.</P>
      <P>I am also informed by the commissioners that precise information on numbers who benefited from the amnesty is not available.  In 1988, as a result of the amnesty, 357,000 more payments were receipted by the Collector-General than in 1987.  This represents a 30 per cent increase in 1988 as compared with 1987. As many of those availing of the amnesty submitted multiple payments in respect of their various tax liabilities, it is not possible to state the number of taxpayers from whom payments were received.</P>

      <P>Section 25 of the Finance Act, 1987, provides that section 52 (1) of the Finance Act, 1986, which restricts capital allowances for machinery or plant by the amount of any grants effectively paid out of Exchequer funds, will not apply in relation to machinery or plant purchased by a company for use by it in the manufacture of processed food for human consumption.</P>
      <P>Statistics are not available which would enable an estimate of the cost or of the value of the qualifying plant and machinery to be given.  Such information could not be obtained without undertaking inquiries which could be carried out only at a disproportionate cost.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that their obligation to observe confidentiality in relation to the taxation affairs of individual taxpayers and small groups of taxpayers precludes them from giving the other information requested by the Deputy.  In any event, the Revenue Commissioners have not compiled the information sought and a detailed examination of individual tax files which could be carried out only at a disproportionate cost would be required to obtain it.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>if he will categorise for each of the last five years the purposes for which money, qualifying for section 84 relief, was loaned by financial institutions; and, in particular, if he will give the amount for each year in respect of the beef industry.</Quest>

      <P>Since the Finance Act, 1984, in order to qualify as a domestic sourced <Col N="156" /> section 84 loan the money must have been lent to a borrower carrying on a trade which consists wholly or mainly of the manufacture of goods and must have been used by the borrower for the purposes of such a trade.</P>
      <P>The term &ldquo;manufacture of goods&rdquo; includes activities which are regarded as the manufacture of goods under the manufacturing relief provisions of Chapter VI of the Finance Act, 1980.  It also includes the selling by wholesale of agricultural products or fish by a 75 per cent subsidiary of an agricultural society or a fishery society, respectively.  Up to 1 September 1986 a loan could also qualify as a section 84 loan if given in respect of a trade consisting wholly or mainly of the rendering of services in the course of a service undertaking in respect of which an employment grant was made by the Industrial Development Authority.  This category of section 84 loan was terminated with effect from 13 May 1986 or, in some cases, 1 September 1986.</P>
      <P>Prior to 12 April 1989 all exempted or 10 per cent trading operations carried on at Shannon Customs-free Airport also qualified for domestic sourced section 84 loans.  Since that date no new such loans are allowed to companies carrying on service activities at Shannon Customs-free Airport.  Companies carrying on manufacturing trades at Shannon Airport may, however, continue to avail of these loans.</P>
      <P>Statistics are not available which would enable an estimate of the amount of such loans applicable to the beef industry to be given.  Such information could not be obtained without undertaking inquiries which could be carried out only at a disproportionate cost.</P>

    <P>The figures of cost include preference share financing which is a minor element in the total.  The figures are gross figures, and do not take account of the yield from the levy on section 84 loan interest which was introduced in 1986.  This levy yielded <Col N="158" /> £14.4 million in 1987, £18.5 million in 1988 and £24.9 million in 1989.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that measures were taken in the 1989 and 1990 Finance Acts to restrict the growth of section 84 lending.</P>
    <P>As the figure for 1989 relates to accounting periods ending not later than 31 March 1989, it would not reflect the effect of the 1989 Finance Act measures.</P>

      <P>When all the relevant factors are taken into account it is estimated that the increases in the price of petrol since August 1990 should have little or no effect on overall VAT and excise receipts from petrol sales.  Moreover, higher total expenditure on petrol would tend to have effects on the consumption of other taxable goods which would have the result of reducing other VAT receipts.</P>

      <i>Notes</i>
    </P>
    <P>1.  VAT returns are not furnished in a manner which would enable the yield from particular items to be identified.  It is the practice to estimate the yield on an annual basis using non-VAT statistical data.  The figures for 1987 to 1989 are given on this basis and an estimate for 1990 can be given when final consumption figures for the year are available.</P>
    <P>2.  VAT yield is affected by the fact that VAT registered persons are entitled to a deduction in their returns for VAT borne on business purchases of oils other than petrol.</P>
    <P>3.  A breakdown of the excise yield from oils other than petrol is not available for the current year.</P>

      <P>The following recommendations have been received from the Shannon Forum and are being examined in detail by the Commissioners of Public Works in the context of their statutory responsibilities relating to the River Shannon, viz: (a) optimum management of water levels to minimise flooding; (b) study of flood storage-control potential of Loughts Allen and Ree; and (c) effects of siltation in the Meelick-Banagher stretch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, with regard to the question of flooding, the forum urged further investigation of the summer relief scheme and the carrying out of drainage work to the main channel.  However, the Government decided some time ago to defer any further consideration of these matters. Other recommendations related to the <Col N="163" /> EC Structural Funds and effluent discharges.</P>
    <P>Among the works being carried out this year by the commissioners on the navigation system are the strengthening of Meelick Weir, the construction of a new jetty at Roosky and the construction of a new jetty at Portrunny, Lough Ree. Others will be undertaken in the coming years as resources permit as part of the commissioners' ongoing programme for the development of the navigation.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 129, 136, 142, 145, 146, 155, 156, 162 and 163 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish proposals for the extension and reclassification of our disadvantaged areas were submitted to the EC Commission on 8 June 1990 and the Commission was asked to deal with them as <Col N="171" /> quickly as possible.  A visit of Commission officials to Ireland on 29 August 1990 for the purpose of discussing the submission was arranged but cancelled at the behest of the Commission on 21 August 1990.  On 5 September 1990 the Commission forwarded a request instead for specific survey data which were supplied at a bilateral meeting with the Commission in Brussels on 25 September 1990.  Information was then requested in a new format and this was supplied at a further bilateral meeting on 11 October 1990 in Brussels.</P>
    <P>We are pressing the Commission services for swift completion of consideration of our submission.  The services have limited staff resources and are also under pressure of work arising from submissions from three other member states.  They have promised, nevertheless, to complete consideration of the technical aspects of our case in the near future to clear the way for a proposal to be put to the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>As regards the questions dealing with specific areas, I cannot disclose details of areas included in the submission nor can I announce any new boundary extensions until EC approval of new and reclassified areas is obtained.</P>
    <P>As regards the methodology and accuracy of the survey, I must stress that areas for which requests were received, were surveyed in a fair and equitable fashion on the basis of a 50 per cent random sample of farms and the accuracy of the results double-checked to the extent that entries made by departmental surveyors on the survey form were verified by the farmer when he/she countersigned the form on the completion of the survey of each farm.</P>
    <P>This was the most extensive nationwide survey undertaken and was completed in the shortest time period since 1975.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 140, 141, 143, 149 and 157 together.</P>
      <P>Areas approved for inclusion in our disadvantaged areas will be published in advertisements in the local papers in the counties concerned after approval of those areas has been given and published by the EC.  In this way, farmers whose areas have not been included will be made aware that these areas did not meet the five criteria for disignation of an area as disadvantaged, viz.  (1) less than 7.8 per cent of the area is ploughed; (2) stocking rate is less than one adult bovine livestock unit per forage hectare; (3) the family farm income per male farm worker does not exceed 80 per cent of the national average; (4) there are not more than 27 people per square kilometre and (5) at least 30 per cent of the working population is engaged in agriculture.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that all areas were surveyed equitably and fairly on the basis of a very high random sample of farms. Every effort was made to ensure that the 50 per cent of farms surveyed in all areas were representative of the areas concerned. It is, of course, possible that, purely by mischance, in some small number of cases they were not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of this possibility and in line <Col N="177" /> with the commitment given in the Programme for Government, I have provided for an appeals system in my submission to the Commission.  Until this is approved, however, it would not be possible to set up an effective appeals system or decide its terms of reference or procedure.  Deputies can, however, rest assured that I will continue pressing for EC approval and will set up an appeals procedure as soon as possible after approval is obtained.</P>

    <P>The question of charges for farm visits is a matter for Teagasc in the first instance. Teagasc's view is that current levels of charges are modest relative to the cost of providing the services and the value that can be derived by farmers from them. There are no proposals to drop such charges.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that, while there has been a drop in the number of farms visited, phone and office consultations have more than doubled between 1985 and 1989.</P>

      <Quest>whether he has considered extending the conditions of qualification for social employment schemes so that married women returning to work could qualify, in view of the fact that the restriction of the scheme to persons in receipt of unemployment assistance effectively disqualifies any person in a household where the father is earning an amount equivalent to the average industrial wage.</Quest>

      <P>I have no plans, mainly because of the cost involved, to change the eligibility conditions to allow participation by persons who do not satisfy the current requirements.</P>
      <P>Removing the conditions relating to unemployment compensation would increase the net cost of the scheme to the Exchequer and reduce the number who could be catered for with a given budget.</P>

A welcome and timely independent review of the plan is at present under way.  As no other agreed framework for international co-operation in this area exists, the best way forward is the revision and strengthening of the action plan, and this country supports the efforts being made to make it more effective.</P>

      <P>I proposed to take Questions Nos. 177 and 192 together.</P>
      <P>The free travel scheme applies to all residents of the State aged 66 years or over and to certain categories of disabled persons under 66 years.  The scheme also applies to spouses under age 66 for journeys on which they accompany the qualified person.</P>
      <P>The free travel scheme is being extended to enable a companion travel free with certain recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance who due to infirmity may not be in a position to fully avail of their personal entitlement. The detailed arrangements for the introduction of this extension are currently being put in place and the concession will be available to recipients shortly.</P>
      <P>The issue of free travel passes, for particular purposes, to spouses in their own right or the issue of interchangeable free travel passes would constitute major extensions of the free travel scheme.  It is not possible to give a precise estimate of the cost of extending free travel to spouses of recipients.  However, the cost of such an extension would be significant and could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for an old age non-contributory pension in November 1989.</P>
      <P>Initially, the applicant failed to make himself available for interview.  When he was eventually interviewed by the social welfare officer in May 1990, he failed to supply details of his income, including details of his wife's earnings and a life assurance policy.  In the circumstances, a deciding officer decided on 11 July 1990 that the person was not entitled to a pension on the grounds that means were not fully disclosed.</P>
      <P>The person appealed this decision and the case was referred to an appeals officer for determination.  The appeals officer referred the case for further investigation to allow the person concerned to produce the necessary evidence to decide on entitlement.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 209, 210, 211 and 212 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I cannot and will not condone any illegal activity, and while I must emphasise that for technical reasons as well as reasons relating to Ireland's international obligations the deflector systems can have no future, it is not the intention <Col N="204" /> to take action against them until an alternative legal system &mdash; whether cable or MMDS &mdash; is available.</P>
    <P>In this regard my hope is that the vast majority of these systems will close down of their own volition as the alternative legal systems come on stream and indeed there are already indications that many of them will be willing to do so &mdash; this was broadly the experience with the &ldquo;pirate&rdquo; radio stations.  This would mean that ultimately action would only have to be taken against the hard core who may try to remain in place when the legal alternatives are available.</P>
    <P>I would also point out that the provisions of the Broadcasting Act, 1990, have no bearing on or relevance to the status of illegal rebroadcasting systems &mdash; deflectors &mdash; whatsoever.</P>
    <P>The operators and those associated with illegal rebroadcasting or deflector systems are, and always have been, liable to prosecution under the Wireless Telegraphy Acts, 1926 to 1988.</P>

    <P>Donegal County Council made a recent application to my Department for <Col N="205" /> national lottery funds for the construction of a pedestrian bridge at Binnion. However, as I have allocated the full £6.5 million made available to me under the 1990 amenities/recreational facilities grant scheme, this application cannot be considered under this year's scheme.  It would, of course, be open to the council to reapply for a grant under any further scheme.</P>

      <P>The total amount of accumulated arrears, i.e. payments two months or more overdue, in respect of Housing Finance Agency loans at the end of December 1989 was estimated at £3.8 million&mdash;equivalent to 1.5 per cent approximately of the value of mortgages outstanding.</P>
      <P>As these loans are repayable on an income-related basis, borrowers with loans approved before 1 July 1986, which account for the vast majority of such loans, who experience a drop in income are entitled to a full proportional reduction in their monthly repayments. However, in the case of loans approved after that date, the repayment cannot be reduced below 90 per cent of the previous year's repayments.  It is open to any borrower in financial difficulties to apply for assistance towards the interest element of his or her mortgage payments under supplementary welfare allowances scheme, which is administered by the health boards.</P>
      <P>It is the policy of the Housing Finance Agency to treat as sympathetically as possible those borrowers who unavoidably get into arrears, having regard to the agency's statutory obligation to break even.</P>

      <P>The primary purpose of vehicle registration is to enable vehicles to be identified accurately and the vehicle owners traced quickly for law enforcement purposes.</P>
      <P>A fundamental feature of the existing vehicle registration system is that a unique identification mark, registration number, is assigned to each vehicle on registration and remains assigned to that vehicle.  This allows a complete and accurate history to be maintained in relation to each vehicle as it moves from one owner to another and in relation to each vehicle owned by vehicle-fleet operators. Arrangements which allowed vehicle identification marks to be transferred from one vehicle to another could undermine the effectiveness and integrity of the system and would be incompatible with the requirement that new vehicles be assigned a registration number incorporating the current year-numeral.</P>

      <P>The legislation governing compulsory land acquisition by local authorities provides for the payment of compensation for lands acquired by them on the authorisation of a duly confirmed compulsory purchase order.  Section 79 of the Housing Act, 1966, sets out the procedure whereby local authorities initiate this process by serving a notice on all owners, lessees and occupiers of land, except tenants for a month or a period less than a month, stating that they are willing to treat for the purchase <Col N="218" /> of the several interests in the land.  Each party is required to submit specific details to the local authority of their interest and the amount of compensation claimed.  In the event of dispute, a party has recourse to the Land Values Reference Committee for the appointment of an official property arbitrator to determine the case.</P>

      <P>I have great sympathy for people who are finding it difficult to adopt due to the decline in the number of children available for adoption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the guiding principle in adoption is that the best interests of the child is the first and paramount consideration. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which was recently signed by the Taoiseach with a view to its ratification by the State, includes a provision in relation to inter-country adoption.  This requires states to &ldquo;ensure that the child concerned by inter-country adoption enjoys safeguards and <Col N="228" /> standards equivalent to those existing in the case of national adoption&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>My Department is in consultation with the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Justice with a view to identifying the legislative or other measures required to enable the State to regulate the adoption of foreign children by Irish people in compliance with the U.N. Convention.</P>
    <P>With regard to home study assessments, the legal position appears to be that a social worker acting in a private capacity may carry out such assessments provided he or she does not receive any payment.  However, I understand that the Adoption Board would have grave reservations about individual social workers taking on this work.  The board expects assessments for inter country adoptions to be carried out to the same standard as for Irish adoptions.</P>
    <P>This involves assessments carried out by social workers experienced in adoption, supervised by an independent committee, obtaining Garda clearances and medical reports and arranging pre-and post adoption advice and support for the natural mother and the adopters.</P>
    <P>The role of the health boards in relation to inter-country adoptions is one of the matters being examined in conjunction with the introduction of safeguards for such adoptions as required by the U.N. Convention.</P>

      <P>The resources provided for mental handicap services have been protected in real terms since 1987.  This year approximately £140 million will be spent on services to people with mental handicap. Earlier this year I allocated £2 million for the development of additional services. As a result, an extra 149 residential places, 21 places for respite care, serving about 200 people, 442 day places and over 25 additional staff for other supports are being provided to meet immediate priority needs.</P>
      <P>I am aware, however, that there are waiting lists in some areas and I have asked the eight health boards to prepare multi-annual plans in consultation with the regional mental handicap co-ordinating committees.  These plans will be available in the near future and will be targeted over the next five years and will form the basis for the preparation of a national programme, to be implemented in accordance with the resources made available to me for this purpose.</P>
      <P>There is also a wide network of organisations which provide care services on a day-care basis for physically handicapped children and young adults.  Many of these organisations such as the Central Remedial Clinic and Cerebral Palsy Ireland receive substantial State funding mainly through the health boards.  In addition to these services, the Irish Wheelchair Association operate a home care attendance scheme which provides on-going support for carers.  Funding for this project to date has amounted to £300,000.  Total funding for mental and physical handicap services through the national lottery over the past three years amounted to £3.3 million.</P>
      <P>The MS Care Foundation provide a centre in Dublin to allow short residential stays for those suffering from multiple sclerosis, and in the process to provide respite for the carers.  This project received substantial capital funding from my Department amounting to £388,000.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 287 and 288 together.  My Department supports the Eccles Breast Screening Programme currently underway at the Mater Foundation. This breast screening programme came into operation in November, 1989. The precise duration of the programme will be determined by the results of the on-going research.  This programme is part of a network of pilot schemes on breast cancer screening underway within the European Community.  The geographical areas selected are North Dublin and Cavan/Monaghan and are representative of both urban and rural populations. The objective of the screening programme is to evaluate the validity of mammographic screening tests and the up-take of the programme by the target-population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The screening programme requires a <Col N="238" /> range of necessary support services such as pathology, oncology, cytology, surgical and radiography which are provided by the Mater Hospital.  It is estimated that in 1990 that the cost to public funds of providing these support services will be approximately £190,000.  In addition, a capital sum of £35,000 was made available in 1989.</P>

      <P>Visiting hours in hospitals are primarily a matter for the hospital authorities concerned. I consider that visiting should not be regarded by the hospital staff as an intrusion into the working regime of the hospital but as a very important link for the patient with his or her close relatives or friends, many of whom may be very anxious about the patient's well being. I am, therefore in favour of a liberal approach to visiting hours.  However the attendance of too many visitors may upset or tire a seriously ill patient or interfere with their treatment.  Therefore, I accept the need to exercise some control over visiting times.  I agree that there should be the same visiting times for public and private patients.</P>
      <P>I am conscious that there is scope for improvement in making hospitals more sensitive to the needs of patients and relatives in a number of areas, including visiting times, and my Department is at present addressing these issues with the health boards and the voluntary hospitals.</P>

      <P>An estimated £1 million is currently committed to improving accessibility to airports and railway stations and facilities therein for persons <Col N="257" /> with disabilities, including persons in wheelchairs.  That expenditure relates mainly to the provision of easy access for such persons at proposed new railway stations on the Dublin/Cork line between Clondalkin and the city centre, the provision of portable ramps at other railway stations to facilitate boarding of and alighting from trains and the provision of accessible toilets at main railway stations and at two regional airports which do not have them.</P>
      <P>The proposed expenditure is additional to the very substantial capital expenditure already incurred on accessibility improvements to transport facilities in the past few years, notably in providing the new passenger terminal at Rosslare Harbour, in major refurbishing of Tara Street Station (Dublin), including the provision of escalators and lifts to enable persons with disabilities to have access to and from both platforms, the provision of portable ramps and accessible toilets at main railway stations and the provision of easy access to the four new stations provided on the Dublin/Mullingar railway line to serve Dublin suburbs.  All nine airports in the State, as well as 86 out of 124 railway stations, are accessible to persons with disabilities, including persons in wheelchairs.</P>
      <P>As regards trains and buses, Iarnród Éireann are well advanced in preparing for the adaptation of dining cars on mainline trains to accommodate persons remaining seated in their wheelchairs and both Bus Atha Cliath and Bus Éireann are committed to acquiring more accessible buses when replacing over-age buses in their fleets.  Some new more accessible buses are already in service and are a significant improvement on earlier models.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>EC funding has been used in the general development of transport facilities which are of benefit to persons with disabilities as well as to other users of the facilities.  The new passenger terminal at Rosslare Harbour, because of its essential accessible design which secures the integration of all users, is the prime example.  The scope for EC funding for experimental development of accessible <Col N="258" /> transport facilities, under EC initiatives designed to enable persons with disabilities to get to work or to vocational training, is being pursued at present with the relevant EC Commission services.</P>
    <P>It is Government policy that transport providers must, on an ongoing basis, give attention to improving accessibility to transport for persons with disabilities, as resources permit, so as to allow persons with disabilities to participate as fully as possible in community life.  An Inter-Departmental Transport Accessibility Committee, chaired by the Department of Tourism and Transport, is charged with helping to establish priorities for attention and with advising transport providers as to the appropriate measures to be taken in their particular circumstances. The obvious physical, operational and safety constraints will determine the nature and pace of improvements which could reasonably be made to existing infrastructure and equipment.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether the Government's plan to double tourism revenue by 1993 will give rise to uneven results in some areas because in-built advantages will more than double income while other areas like County Roscommon, because of lack of development and other disadvantages, will be unable to reach the target; and the special plans his Department have to help such areas realise the target thus keeping with the principles of economic and social cohesion in the Community.</Quest>

      <P>The growth targets for the tourism industry in the Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery (1988-1992)</i> are to double the number of foreign tourists visiting Ireland to over four million per annum, to increase earnings from foreign tourism by £500 million and to create an additional 25,000 jobs in the economy.</P>
      <P>The Government and Bord Fáilte are making every effort to secure a good regional distribution of the benefits of this increase in tourist activity.  Local tourism interests, working with the local regional tourism organisation, in this case Ireland West, have, of course, a major role to play in attracting a fair share of the extended market to County Roscommon.</P>
      <P>I understand that Ireland West are currently finalising a detailed tourism plan for the county of Roscommon in consultation with the county development team.  The question of support for proposals contained in the plan, will then be a matter for the individual developers, Ireland West, and Bord Fáilte, whose responsibilities now include the allocation of EC Structural Funds, in accordance with criteria set out in the operational programme for tourism launched last January and due to run to the end of 1993.</P>
