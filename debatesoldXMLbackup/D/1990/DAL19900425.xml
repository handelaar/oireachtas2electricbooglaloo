      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 1, 6 and 7 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not the practice, nor would it be appropriate, to disclose in reply to <Col N="2118" /> Parliamentary Questions, details of confidential discussions at the level of Head of State or Government, or to anticipate the outcome of the discussions at the special informal meeting of the European Council to be held on 28 April.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Without disclosing any private consultations, will the Tánaiste simply state what the Government's policy is on whether the Inter-governmental Conference that is proposed to revise the treaties should concern itself solely with economic and monetary union or should concern itself with the wider issue of political co-operation, extension of the competence of the Community to include education and matters of this kind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="The Tánaiste Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has already stated publicly that the Summit will set a date for a second Inter-governmental Conference which will work in parallel to that on monetary union.  This will be held before the end of the year to discuss political union.  The progression proposed is that the conference on economic and monetary union will take place and there will be a separate conference on political union.  Both will take place before the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Tánaiste agree that it is in the interests of Ireland, in view of the fact that we have a much higher dependency ratio than any other country, that there should be equal progress in extending the Treaty of Rome to include matters like education to enable us, with our extra budgetary responsibilities in that area, to receive assistance from the Community, given that we would suffer from some of the other dimensions of the Single Market?  Will the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach ensure that there is equally fast progress on both aspects?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="The Tánaiste Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>These are matters that will be considered in preparing the agenda for the two Intergovernmental Conferences.  The Deputy's point is a valid one and will be considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Tánaiste agree with me that it is a bit of a farce for him to say he cannot reveal the content of private discussions to this House when the Belgian Prime Minister has said he wants the meeting this weekend to discuss security and defence and when Chancellor Kohl and President Mitterrand have both said they want to enlarge it to include matters such as the political integration of Europe?  Frequently it happens that this House is the last to hear anything officially but we have to read things in the papers that should be discussed on the floor of this House.  Will the Tánaiste facilitate the debate that will take place after the Summit by allowing contributions from more than just the leaders of the parties? In other words I am asking for a full debate, not just statements on this very important Summit that is to take place this weekend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="The Tánaiste Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter can be considered. In regard to the first part of the Deputy's question, the Summit is promised.  While points of view can be made known at this stage we should await the outcome of the discussions rather than engage in speculation.  The parameters of the debate to take place after the Summit will have to be considered and Deputy Barry's point will be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Tánaiste not agree it is ridiculous that he cannot answer that question in this House even though the Prime Minister of Belgium, immediately after the meeting with the Taoiseach, gave a press conference at which he said that he wished to see defence and security discussed at the Summit next weekend in Dublin?  In spite of that, the Tánaiste will not indicate to this House whether that matter will be on the agenda.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="The Tánaiste Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>The National Economic and Social Council are undertaking a study of emigration which will be available later in the year.  A study is being undertaken in conjunction with the European Commission on the connection between growth and employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Tánaiste indicate if the National Economic and Social Council have been asked to make any specific recommendations in regard to the problem of emigration?  Does he agree that the rate of emigration, at 46,000 a year, is a matter of the gravest concern and that the Council should, therefore, be asked not simply to carry <Col N="2121" /> out another academic study on emigration but to actually make concrete recommendations upon which the Government could act to deal, in so far as it is within our power, with this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="The Tánaiste Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely what they are engaged in and the work will be completed towards the end of the year. The mandate that has been given to the National Economic and Social Council is precisely along the lines suggested by Deputy Bruton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On Question No. 3, is the Tánaiste aware that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions stated that with the present rate of job creation there will still be a rate of unemployment of over 200,000 in 1992?  Is the Tánaiste aware that there are very serious views in the trade union movement that while there has been relative success in regard to economic growth, we have been unable to convert this into actual job creation? Can he tell us the nature of the expertise that is being provided to the Government by the EC in this matter and whether he expects that this study will make specific recommendations as to what the Government should do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="The Tánaiste Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has interpreted correctly the basis of the problem and on that basis this study is being undertaken as a matter of urgency.  It will involve a steering group which will include the European Commission, NESC, the Department of Finance and the Department of the Taoiseach, a small, tight group of that nature which will report urgently.  Its mandate will be to deal with specifics of this problem rather than analysis.  I think there has been enough analysis.  It is time to get down to specifics and that is what this working group will be concerned with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Tánaiste's reply to Question No. 2, may I ask him if discussions have taken place in relation to the anomalous position of Irish emigrants as regards voting rights? Further, what were the reasons for the <Col N="2122" /> failure of the Irish Government to support the demand of emigrants' groups to have a clear question included on ethnic status in the British census?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="The Tánaiste Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of this working group is to deal with the economic and social aspects of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Tánaiste conclude that the circumstances that exist now are in any way dissimilar to those which existed in the 1950s when a Commission on Emigration was established? What reasons have the Government for refusing, as this question suggests, the establishment of a commission on emigration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="The Tánaiste Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>From Deputy Bruton's remarks a few minutes ago I think he will concur that we have had enough analysis in these matters and we now want to get to a decision point.  Both of these problems in relation to emigration and translating investment and growth into jobs are intertwined.  What we want to do now is to get down to basic specific proposals as to what we are going to do about these problems.  That is the type of mandate these two groups will have and they will report back urgently to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Tánaiste agree that the policy of the IDA over the past ten years has been a total disaster in the area of job creation, the main area they are supposed to be dealing with, in that there are now fewer people in industrial employment than there were ten years ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a lot of extraneous matter being injected into this question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="The Tánaiste Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will agree that due to the good work of this Government, in particular since 1987, and the <Col N="2123" /> IDA, we have now created the investment base on which we should proceed to create the jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>There were not high interest rates in 1987.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="The Tánaiste Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the purpose of this exercise but we could not engage in it if we had not got the investment and industrial base that has been created through the efforts and the work of the IDA under the direction of this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Tánaiste not agree it would be a good idea that, apart from the NESC examining this very serious matter, an all-party committee of this House would have the opportunity of considering such a problem?  Will he agree that the Government have consistently refused offers from this side of the House to deal with our most basic problem, that is tax reform?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Tánaiste agree the Taoiseach has been talking in <Col N="2124" /> terms of possible talks with unionist representatives for well over a year, with no concrete results?  Does he consider it might be time for the Government to take some initiatives with a view to removing the roadblock that seems to exist in the way of these talks rather than simply sitting there expressing their willingness to talk without pre-conditions? Would the Tánaiste agree that some initiatives might be taken by the Government to try to reach out to the unionist community, without whom we cannot have a satisfactory solution to this problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="The Tánaiste Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is aware of the relevant meeting in this context with the Ministers for Justice and for Foreign Affairs at the Anglo-Irish Conference last Friday and Saturday, which dealt with this matter and which shows an element of progress.  The Taoiseach's subsequent meeting with the British Prime Minister indicates that this matter is at present proceeding along the lines we would wish in a constructive manner.  That is the precise up-to-date position which is really in context as far as the Deputy's question is concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Tánaiste agree that there have been many hopeful signs like this before, only to find that events occurred which subsequently dashed those hopes?  Does he at least consider that the Government, rather than simply expressing a willingness to engage in these talks, should find out by whatever channels are available to them the actions they could take which would be within their own policy parameters and which would perhaps represent some form of enticement to the Unionist community to enter into dialogue?  In other words, the Government must not adopt what appears to be a rather passive approach in this matter.</P>

      <P>Would the Tánaiste join with me in welcoming the reported remarks of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in Downpatrick yesterday which, while not exactly optimistic, were at least hopeful?  This apparent movement ought to be encouraged in every way possible by this Government, always remembering, of course, that any form of political dialogue at this stage in Northern Ireland circumstances is a very fragile plant that needs to be nurtured carefully and with sensitivity.  In those circumstances maximum encouragement behind the scenes as well as publicly ought to be given to those involved in these delicate explorations.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>There is continuous contact maintained, in particular by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, with the Parliament.  As a result of that the President of the Parliament will, at the invitation of the Taoiseach, make a 15 minute presentation at the beginning of the summit on 28 April.  Similar arrangements will also apply at the June European Council.  Parliament will make a preliminary submission to the summit meeting before it gets underway.  That gives the Parliament some linkage.  It is a very interesting development which I am sure the Deputy will welcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do, but would the Tánaiste not agree that in addition to what might be seen as simply a symbolic appearance by the President of the Parliament there should be a better established institutional link between the current Presidency and the Parliament secretariat on an on-going basis in Strasbourg with a view to ensuring that the Presidency proposals at the summit represent as near as possible the views of Parliament?</P>

      <P>At the end of our six month Presidency I believe we will receive certain approbation on this matter.  We have made a point of cultivating exceptionally good relations with the Parliament and its committees.  That has already been acknowledged as a feature of the Irish Presidency and it has led to successful conciliation and clearance by the Parliament of many matters that were being blocked in regard to the Parliament itself and its relations with the Council of Ministers and the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will refer briefly to diverse cases and decisions in regard to the first stage of EMU, the establishment of the European Environment Agency, the revision of the five year financial perspective and the multi-annual framework programme in research and development.  These are some of the areas where blockages had arisen.  By reason of our special arrangements for regular day-to-day contact <Col N="2127" /> between the Irish Presidency and the Parliament, matters were cleared.  At the end of the six months this is one of the matters for which we will be remembered.</P>

If the Community's responsibilities are to be increased, would the Tánaiste not agree that there is a responsibility on this Government that this be done in such a fashion that it is most democratic and consistent with the interests of small countries like Ireland who might lose out in a larger arrangement?</P>

      <P>Faoin Acht Airí agus Rúnaithe (Leasú), 1956, féadfaidh an Rialtas ó am go ham le hordú a chinneadh gur limistéir Ghaeltachta limistéir shonraithe, is limistéir ar Ghaeilgeoirí mórchuid de na daoine iontu agus limistéir ina n-aice sin ar dóigh leis an Rialtas gur cheart iad a áireamh sa Ghaeltacht d'fhonn an Ghaeilge a chaomhnú agus a leathadh mar ghnáth-urlabhra.  Rinneadh <Col N="2128" /> ceithre ordú den chineál sin, i.e., Orduithe na Limistéar Gaeltachta, 1956, 1967, 1974 agus 1982.</P>
      <P>Aithnítear go coitianta nach bhfuil labhairt na Gaeilge, mar ghnáth-urlabhra nó mar ghnáthmheán chumarsáide, chomh folláin nó chomh forleathan agus ba mhaith linn í a bheith sa Ghaeltacht ina hiomláine.  Tá sí beo bríomhar mar theanga pobail i go leor ceantar, áfach, agus níor chóir bheith éadóchasach faoina todhchaí.  Caithfear bheith ag brath cuid mhaith ar na pobail éagsúla chun an teanga a shlánú.  Ar ndóigh ní mór tacaíocht chuí a bheith ar fáil ón Stát chomh maith leis an nGaeltacht a chaomhnú mar thobar ár dteanga agus ár n-oidhreachta agus is chuige sin a chuireann mo Roinn-se cúnamh ar fáil, trí scéimeanna éagsúla, agus trí Údarás na Gaeltachta, chun gach gné de shaol na Gaeltachta a fheabhsú ionas go mbeidh deiseanna leormhaithe ag a muintir chun fostaíocht shocrach a fháil agus caighdeáin réasúnta mhaireachtála a bheith acu.</P>
      <P>Nuair a sonraíodh na limistéir oifigiúla i 1956 samhlaíodh go bhféadfaí an Ghaeilge a. chaomhnú sna ceantair ina raibh sí láidir ag an am sin agus í a thabhairt chun cinn de réir a chéile sna ceantair eile ina raibh sí lag mar ghnáth-urlabhra. Is cinnte go bhfuil cumas Gaeilge ag daoine sna ceantair laga agus leanfar le hiarrachtaí chun í a láidriú iontu.  Ní dóigh liom go mbeadh sé praiticiúil nó tairbheach ag an bpointe seo, áfach, na limistéir a ath-tharraingt go hiomlán le freagairt go geografach amháin ar an staid reatha a mheastar atá ag an nGaeilge mar ghnáth-urlabhra sa Ghaeltacht nó lasmuigh di. B'fhearr i bhfad, dar liom, go leanfaí leis an obair spreagúil atá ar siúl ag mo Roinn-se agus ag Údarás na Gaeltachta laistigh den Ghaeltacht agus ag Bord na Gaeilge lasmuigh di, agus ag na heagrais dheonacha go léir a bhfuil obair thábhachtach ar siúl acu ag spreagadh agus ag gríosú pobal i dtreo polasaithe forbartha teanga.</P>

Má thógaim mo thoghlach féin agus toghlach an Teachta Higgins, tá thart ar míle teach cónaithe i gceantair limistéir 1956; as an míle teach sin rinneadh 109 iarratas ar dheontais tithíochta Gaeltachta, agus as an 109 iarratas fuair 38 gclann deontas.

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Priority Questions Nos. 11 and 12 and Questions Nos. 50, 56 and 61 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent decisions of the Supreme Court in the Finucane, Clarke and Carron cases arose from appeals taken in respect of orders for extradition which were made by the District Court under Part III of the Extradition Act, 1965. In reaching those decisions the Supreme <Col N="2135" /> Court applied the law to the isssues argued before it on the basis of the facts established in the proceedings.  That is the function and indeed the duty of the courts.  Under the Constitution the Judiciary are, of course, independent in the exercise of their functions and are pledged to uphold the Constitution and the law.</P>
    <P>Our extradition code now comprises three Acts of the Oireachtas &mdash; the Extradition Act, 1965, the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987, and the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987.  It is important to note that the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987, did not apply to the three cases in question because the warrants in those cases were issued before the commencement of that Act.  However, that Act will apply to any future extradition case in which the warrants which form the basis of the proceedings were issued after 1 December, 1987, the date on which the Act commenced.</P>
    <P>The Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987, gives effect in our law to the Council of Europe Convention of that name.  The Act implements article 1 of the convention in full and consequently provides that the offences specified in that article shall, for extradition purposes, never be regarded as political offences or offences connected with political offences.  The Act also contains special provisions relating to the offences covered by article 2 of the convention, which is an optional article, whereby those offences are not to be regarded as political offences in certain circumstances. In addition, the Act provides that nothing will prevent a determination being made that an offence is not a political offence in circumstances or by reason of considerations other than those referred to in the Act itself.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the 1987 Act fully meet the obligations we undertook in <Col N="2136" /> signing the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism and enabled this country to ratify it without recourse to a reservation permitted by Article 13. Article 13 allows contracting States to make reservations in respect of the application of article 1 &mdash; in effect to refuse extradition for an offence covered by article 1 which it considers to be a political offence provided certain specified matters have been considered in reaching that decision.  Ireland is one of only eight countries to have acceded to the convention without entering a reservation. The remaining 14 parties to the convention &mdash; Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Malta, The Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden and Switzerland &mdash; have entered reservations.</P>
    <P>In addressing the issues raised by the court decisions to which attention is drawn in these questions, it should be stressed that the 1987 Act has, as yet, not been relied on in any case decided by the courts.  That Act is, therefore, untried and assumptions should not be made in regard to what some choose to describe as its limitations.</P>
    <P>My comments so far have been largely directed towards those aspects of the recent Supreme Court decisions that concerned the political offence exception. We should not, however, lose sight of the fact that, quite irrespective of the provisions of any legislation governing extradition, neither Mr. Finucane nor Mr. Clarke would have been extradited because the Supreme Court concluded that to have done so would have infringed their constitutional rights.  Indeed, in the case of Mr. Clarke no reliance was ultimately placed on the political offence exception and the ground upon which his release was sought and granted was solely that of his constitutional rights.  In reaching its conclusion on these issues, the Supreme Court was influenced by the findings of the present Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland in his judgment in a case known as the Pettigrew case, which was a civil action taken against the Northern Ireland Office and the Governor of <Col N="2137" /> the Maze Prison by a Maze prisoner arising from events occurring in the aftermath of the 1983 escape.</P>
    <P>It is also important to recognise that, apart from extradition, our law provides another method of dealing with fugitive offenders.  That is the extra-territorial method whereby, notably under the provisions of the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976, our courts have jurisdiction to try persons for certain serious offences committed in Northern Ireland and, in certain circumstances, elsewhere.  The Government are committed to the use of both methods to tackle the problem of fugitive offenders in appropriate cases. The Government also believe that there is scope for greater use of the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976 in such cases.</P>
    <P>As the joint statement issued following the meeting of the Anglo-Irish Inter-governmental Conference in London on 19 April records, officials were instructed to undertake a review of the situation pertaining to arrangements for dealing with fugitive offenders and to report back to a future meeting of the conference. That review will not be confined solely to extradition but will also cover the possibilities afforded by the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976.  My Department will, of course, be participating in that review.  When that review has been completed, the matter will be looked at again in the intergovernmental conference.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister not agree that there is apparent conflict and confusion in the whole area of extradition and that as a result of various Supreme Court decisions and of the legislation as at present available to the courts, there is an urgent need for a review of this whole area?  Would the Minister agree also that this review can take place only in a political framework and should involve all political parties on this island but at the very least in the Republic of Ireland in arriving at a consensus on the issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not accept the need for that at all.  We already have the legislation in place.  The 1987 Act and the <Col N="2138" /> scope and application of it have as yet to be tested in our courts.  I suggest that it would be very unusual to amend an Act before the opportunity had arisen for it to be tested before the courts.  Also, it should not be forgotten that there exists, as I have said already, an alternative to extradition, namely, the possibility for extra-territorial trial under the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976.  Therefore, I do not accept the point made by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise two questions on this issue.  Would the Minister not agree that it would be outrageous that political exemption be available to somebody who committed a murder with a non-automatic weapon such as a revolver and that, in the light of recent court decisions, such a scenario is possible under the 1987 Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, it is far too early yet to decide on the 1987 Act.  It is worth bearing in mind that that Act was designed to give effect to the Council of Europe Convention of that name and that it meets our obligations totally under that Convention.  It is also worth bearing in mind that in addition to section 3 of the Act which provides that certain offences are not to be regarded as political offences or offences connected with political offences, section 4 provides that other serious offences which are not already covered by the exclusion are not to be regarded as political offences where a court, having given due consideration to any particularly serious aspects of the offence concerned, is of the opinion that the offence cannot properly be regarded as a political offence.  Furthermore, to answer directly the question the Deputy asked, it will, of course, be open to the courts to decide that the political offence exception does not apply in any particular case on the basis of the reasoning and judgments in recent cases.  I suggest strongly to the Deputies that they should <Col N="2139" /> not make assumptions about the scope or the application of the 1987 Act in circumstances where those matters have yet to be tested in the courts.  I suggest that this Chamber is not the place to argue such details, that they are a matter for the courts of the land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Secondly, our concern is, of course, to ensure that we do not close the stable door after the horse has bolted.  In relation to section 4 there is a reference to &ldquo;persons&rdquo;, not a person, but that is not the main point.  Will the Minister accept that there is a European dimension here, that the European Convention to a degree is outdated in the light of 1992 and that in the context of open borders and open frontiers there will have to be discussion and decision at EC level to ensure that those open frontiers without efficient extradition might lead to chaos?  Will the Minister agree that even from that point of view there is need for an urgent review of our legislation in conjunction with the legislation of the other member states of the EC?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy is asking whether there is a need for a review of the Convention, that is a separate thing. As far as the review of the Convention is concerned a working party are involved in looking at the extent etc. of the Convention and of various conventions dealing with terrorism and criminal acts generally within Europe.  That is going on within the Council of Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will agree that we have a problem with regard to terrorism that other European countries or signatories to the Convention do not have.  Will he not agree that it is necesary for us to look at the situation on that basis and will he inform the House as to what the views of the Northern Ireland Secretary of State are on the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, since he said it has not been tested?  Obviously, that part of the country which is otherwise affected by the problem of terrorism <Col N="2140" /> should have at least given the Minister its view at this stage on the adequacy or otherwise of that Act.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2142" /> A person who persistently makes telephone calls for the purpose of causing annoyance to another commits an offence which may be prosecuted in the courts by Telecom Éireann.  A person who is convicted of such an offence is liable to a fine of up to £50,000, or to imprisonment for up to five years or to both the fine and the imprisonment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that there are considerable difficulties of proof in regard to the identity of persons who are making such calls?  In the case I have in mind in my constituency a person is using various public phone boxes to make these nuisance calls.  That person does not speak but simply makes the call persistently, hour after hour, to create a state bordering on mental breakdown on the part of the person who is the victim of these persistent calls.  Will the Minister agree that in that case the Telecom officials, as they have admitted to me, cannot do anything under the present law, they cannot take any penalties against the person whom they are convinced is responsible in that they cannot prove the case against that person within the confines of the law of evidence?  Will the Minister agree that there is a problem in that case and, because of that, see what powers he can take or give to Telecom Éireann to deal with that type of problem?</P>

      <P>I accept that there is a difficulty in relation to the powers of Telecom because of the question of proof.

For the information of the House, I should like to state that Telecom are bringing in new phones which will show the number of the person dialing in.  In that way it will be easy to trace the person who makes the call.  Even if the phone goes dead after it is picked up by the subscriber, the number of the caller will be registered.</P>

      <P>Radio Tara have been licensed to RTÉ under the Broadcasting Authority Acts 1960-1979.  RTÉ are not charged a fee for their broadcasting licence.  Tests have on occasion been carried by Radio Tara after 7 p.m. to determine reception quality in their primary reception area.  However, such broadcasts were made at the reduced power of 100 KW fully in accordance with the licence issued to RTÉ.</P>
      <P>Accounts for Radio Tara Ltd. in respect of the period ended 31 December 1989 &mdash; at which time, I would point out, Radio Tara was in operation for only three months &mdash; have not yet been audited.  While initial indications are that advertising revenue has been less than projected, RTÉ remain confident that the service will operate profitably.</P>

Will the Minister indicate if monthly accounts of advertising revenue are being kept?  Will he agree that in the House I indicated my belief that there was a serious question mark over the long term, even the medium term, economic viability of this project on the long wave, leaving aside the many objections that exist to the sitting of the mast?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, as a former Minister for Finance, will be aware of when the project was originally approved.  That was done prior to my arrival in the Department of Communications. Accounts for Radio Tara for the year ended 31 December have not been audited but unaudited accounts show an operational loss of the order of £260,000.  The results would suggest, as the Deputy has said, that advertising revenue was not as high as was projected. However, it must be pointed out that the station was only three months in operation at the end of December last.  RTÉ are hoping the service can break even in 1990.</P>

      <P>This distortion arises from the dominant position of RTÉ which exists due to the privileged monopoly position they enjoyed for many years, the lead time they had in that protected environment to develop their services, the substantial resources at their disposal, with particular reference to their access to licence fees.</P>
      <P>I am sympathetic to the arguments put forward in these representations and propose to bring forward shortly legislative measures which, I believe, will result in a fairer, competitive environment to all concerned and should not result in any deterioration in RTÉ programme standards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>For example, the national newspapers of Ireland as far back as 1985 made representations.  The Deputy will be aware of the volume of articles that appeared in the newspapers, in particular a couple of months back, on this whole question of access to the advertising revenue, the licence fee and the dominant position of RTÉ.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>They made representations as a group.  When I toured the country opening radio stations and so on I had talks with the people involved in the electronic and print media and the Deputy will be aware that articles have appeared in various newspapers on this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the suggestion by the Minister that one of the grounds on which he is sympathetic to the representations made to him is that RTÉ enjoy a monopoly position, I should like to ask him if he is aware that according to plans at least one organisation will not exist very much longer.  Will the Minister agree that this is an inopportune time to be talking about challenging the revenue base of RTÉ in view of the fact that shortly they will be in competition with another commercial TV station?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and it is a pity that others did not take this issue on board and bring forward the necessary legislation <Col N="2148" /> when they had the opportunity to regularise the licensing of radio stations and put the pirates off the air.  They should not have waited for us to do so.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Coolock Community Law Centre operates outside the State scheme of civil <Col N="2151" /> legal aid and advice and on a different basis.  I am not in a position to assist in the funding of the centre because the moneys that are voted by the Oireachtas for the provision of civil legal aid services are for the purposes of the State scheme exclusively.  Furthermore, at a time of scarce financial resources it is incumbent on me to channel whatever public funds are available to me to the State scheme.</P>
    <P>The future improvement and development of our civil legal aid service will be based on the phased expansion of the State scheme, i.e., mainly through an increase in the number of law centres operated by and under the control of the Legal Aid Board.  I am satisfied that this is the proper way to proceed but, of course, progress will depend on financial circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that Coolock Community Law Centre have produced a more cost effective service to their clients than the legal aid boards?  Will he further agree that the commission set up by the Government to examine the establishment of legal aid centres recommended centres along the lines of the one established in Coolock?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the whole question of civil legal aid, it is my intention to provide whatever money is available through the State civil legal aid scheme.  I began the process this year of getting extra funding and this year the <Col N="2152" /> highest amount ever &mdash; £2.163 million &mdash; has been provided.  I want to build on that year by year but it will go through the civil legal aid scheme which I want to put on a statutory basis as it has been in existence since 1980.</P>

      <P>I am bitterly disappointed with the Minister's response given the fact that many of his constituents avail of the service, some on his recommendation and referral.  If Coolock Law Centre was not in existence there would be an onus on the Minister to provide a State legal aid centre similar to that provided in Tallaght on the west side of the city.  On the basis that the north side have an unanswerable case in that regard, will the Minister agree that there is equity in the centre looking to his Department for part funding?  I ask the Minister not to close the door and to open negotiations with the Minister for Social Welfare and the Combat Poverty Agency to see if there is any way in which a more co-ordinated approach could be taken. The centre simply want to expand in a small but effective way by employing one <Col N="2153" /> extra person.  In view of the excellent work &mdash; which the Minister acknowledges &mdash; of the centre, will he again look at this matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not denying the excellent work done in the Coolock centre and, as the Deputy said, some of my constituents use it.  However, my responsibility is in relation to the national scheme as Minister as distinct from the Deputy for the area and to ensure that the national scheme is working properly. The Combat Poverty Agency are used by the Department of Social Welfare in relation to additional funding being made available and it has been increased for Coolock this year.  Indeed, to remove their uncertainty from year to year money will be provided for the next three years.  I do not want to give any commitment here which might be wrongly interpreted by those involved in the community law centre to the possibility of funding from my own Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1978, prevents the creation of new ground rents on dwellinghouses.  The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978, provides, as regards existing ground rents on dwellinghouses, a low <Col N="2154" /> cost purchase scheme and the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (Amendment) Act, 1987, extends indefinitely the operation of that scheme.</P>
      <P>The existing law, therefore, provides a ready means by which any person can terminate the ground rent payable on his dwellinghouse.  A considerable number of people have availed themselves of that opportunity.</P>
      <P>Nobody may be committed to prison merely for non-payment of ground rent or any other debt.  A person may be committed to prison for failure to comply with a court order to make certain payments in discharge of a debt, an order which may be made only after an examination of means designed to establish that the person can pay and that failure to pay is due to his wilful refusal or culpable neglect.  It does not appear to me that there is any rational basis on which a distinction can be made between the enforcement of court orders concerning ground rent debts and court orders concerning other civil debts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the termination of ground rents without giving some payment or compensation to landlords would not be in keeping with the Constitution and that it would cost between £35 million and £40 million to compensate landlords in the event of the abolition of ground rents at no cost to the householder.  Any such charge on the Exchequer would be totally unjustifiable.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Minister a question in regard to committal to prisons.  If the Minister has a difficulty in differentiating between those committed to prison for the non-payment of ground rent as opposed to those committed for other civil debts, in view of over-crowding and for economic reasons, would he not consider introducing legislation to abolish committal to prison, for the non-payment of debt, which I believe is an invidious and unnecessary step?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2157" /> I should like to take the opportunity of paying my respects to the two men in particular, John O'Hanlon who comes from my constituency who spent Easter in prison, because of their objection to the payment of ground rent which they consider illegal.  Would the Minister consider abolishing the right to committal to prison in all matters of civil debt and not just in regard to ground rent?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if, in view of the serious economic threat to Waterford arising from the continuing strike at Waterford Crystal and the statement made yesterday by the company's chief executive that a prolonged strike would damage the company to the point of no return, he intends to use the powers available to him to request the Labour Court to intervene; if he intends to take any other steps to facilitate a solution; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>This dispute has resulted in the close-down of one of Ireland's most important manufacturing plants which employs 2,300 people.  Waterford Crystal is a famous name both at home and abroad. This company have been in operation for over 40 years.</P>
      <P>The company are, however, in serious financial difficulties.  The crystal division have lost £60.5 million in the last three years.  I think the amount of money involved here cannot be overstressed.  In 1989 the crystal division alone lost over £20 million.  The only conclusion one can reach from figures of that size is that losses of this magnitude cannot continue. Obviously the whole question of costs has to be addressed if the company are not to close down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think all sides should be clear about <Col N="2158" /> the realities of this situation and the current dispute.  There is a real possibility that the company will cease to operate as presently structured and other drastic options will have to be considered.  The wage bill in Waterford Crystal is over £40 million per annum.  It is clear that if this spending power is lost it will have a devastating effect on the whole economic structure of the Waterford area.  A key factor in relation to Waterford Glass is that labour costs constitute 70 per cent of overall costs.</P>
    <P>The dispute which commenced on 5 April was triggered by the withdrawal by the company of so-called bonanza payments. These payments apply to holiday weekends where there is a short working week and affect around 400 cutters.  The cost to the company is about £750,000 per annum.  The union, the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers' Union, were notified in January 1989 that this payment would have to cease as the company could no longer afford it.  The union committee convened a meeting of the workers and, on a show of hands, got a mandate for immediate strike action.</P>
    <P>The management and the union cannot agree on the basis for commencing negotiations. Pre-conditions are causing the problem.  The management state that they want to sit down with the union without pre-conditions on either side but insist that the decisions taken in relation to the withdrawal of the bonanza payments are irreversible.  The union, on the other hand, are insisting on the restoration of these payments before talks can commence.  What we have here, therefore, is what is commonly described as a &ldquo;Mexican stand-off&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The dispute has now lasted three weeks.  All the signs &mdash; from the attitudes being adopted &mdash; are that the dispute could continue for three or even six months.  The parties have dug very deep trenches and the warfare has all the signs of a long battle.  At the end of the day one thing is certain, both sides will have to commence talking at some stage if Waterford is not to lose its most valuable asset.  Therefore I might suggest to both <Col N="2159" /> sides that they exercise that option as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The question holding up negotiations is that of bonanza payments which I have already mentioned.  In this connection, having studied the matter carefully, I suggest both sides might consider putting the issue of bonanza payments to the end of the negotiating agenda without prejudice to their positions on the issue.  This would allow negotiations to commence on other issues with a view to finalising a settlement package.  The issue of the bonanza payments could then be dealt with as a final agenda item.  In this connection I would point out that the issue of these payments affects one section of the workforce only.</P>
    <P>As will be clear from my remarks, I have been keeping in close touch with the situation in Waterford over the last few weeks.  I have met the Federation of Irish Employers as well as representatives of the management and union officials.  Naturally the Labour Court and its conciliation service are available at all times to help the parties reach an agreement.</P>
    <P>I would once again ask the parties to consider their respective positions in the context of my suggestion on the issue of bonanza payments.  In my experience of industrial disputes like these, negotiations have to start some time.  It is my belief that it would be better to do so now rather than in several months' time when the positions of the parties could be further entrenched and bitterness increased.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that discussions to resolve this dispute must start some time; indeed, that is the purpose of my question.  Would the Minister not agree that, in the earlier part of his reply, he ignored the background of the major, far-reaching rationalisation programme that has contributed to the magnitude of the losses he has described; that against that background the chairman of the company unprecedentedly admitted that management seriously mishandled the implementation of that programme? In that context, would the Minister agree that extremist statements <Col N="2160" />&mdash; such as we have heard from some Members of the Oireachtas &mdash; are distinctly unhelpful?  Would the Minister comment further on the end of his statement &mdash; designed not so much to advise both parties how to conduct negotiations but seeing that such a stand-off exists &mdash; and say whether he intends in any way to facilitate, without the imposition of preconditions, talks getting under way as quickly as possible using any of the instruments available to him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I might deal with the Deputy's last question first.  Naturally the services of any or all of the bodies within our control will be used when we consider it useful to do so.  That is a matter of timing and for the parties involved.  We are keeping in close touch with all sides in that regard including the Congress of Trade Unions, the union involved, management, workers and a number of other interested groups.</P>
      <P>With regard to the history I should say that over the last three years Waterford Glass and Crystal division has been one of the files that has not been off my desk, indeed has not been off any Minister's desk since 1970.  I thought my reply was sufficiently lengthy.  I did not go back over all the major issues that arose over the last 20 years.  However, I could go on at some length because I am familiar with all the arguments involved.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Labour I am endeavouring to be responsible.  Therefore, I will not agree or disagree with Deputy Rabbitte's conclusions other than to make the point that, in any dispute, particularly one that affects a wages bill of £40 million, 2,300 workers and the whole economy of the city of Waterford, or indeed any other city, blood pressure needs to be kept as low as possible.  Anything said which raises that blood pressure will be unhelpful.  I would rather adhere to the conclusions I have reached and the suggestion I have made.  Perhaps everybody could leave aside all of the strong statements being made, examine the issue and reflect positively on the suggestion I have made in response to Deputy Rabbitte.</P>

      <P>I take it from his reply the Minister does not intend at this stage to cause the Labour Court to intervene or to facilitate direct discussions taking place without precondition.  Would the Minister request his officials to re-evaluate some of his assessment which does not have regard to the fact that the bonanza payments were terminated unilaterally or to the fact that the chairman of the company has admitted that the genesis of much of this problem lies in the mishandling of the extensive rationalisation programme implemented at Waterford Glass?</P>

First, I believe this House should record its sadness at the passing this week, at an early age, of one of Dublin's finest citizens, Mr. Willie Bermingham of the ALONE organisation.  Second, <Col N="2352" /> seeing that the Tánaiste is in a generous mood today, perhaps we could elicit another debate on a matter which the Opposition parties raised together one morning on the Order of Business and that is the collapse of the Merchant Banking Group.  The Taoiseach said that this matter would be referred to with the possibility of a debate.  Can the Tánaiste tell us if the Government have considered it and if we will have a debate in this House as urgently as possible on the failure of the Merchant Banking Group and the failure to initiate any prosecutions as a result?</P>

Second, the programme of legislation circulated by the Government lists 19 Bills which are at various stages.

    <Title>Finance Bill, 1990: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The essential purpose of this Finance Bill is to provide a statutory basis for the taxation measures which I announced or foreshadowed in this year's budget.  The measures represent a very significant tax reform package which will promote the development of the economy.  They include the reduction in the standard rate of income tax to 30 per cent and the reduction in the top rate to 53 per cent, which are now beginning to reflect themselves in pay packets; the reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax to 40 per cent which will help job creation in the services sector; the extension of the 10 per cent rate for manufacturing industry to the year 2010 so as to create greater certainty for investment planning; the extension of the urban renewal incentive package to 1993; the reduction in the standard VAT rate which has already taken effect and is helping to reduce inflation; changes in stamp duties to further encourage the development of the financial services sector, and the abolition of the 60 per cent rate of capital gains tax which has been an inhibiting factor on investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are also measures to curb tax abuse, notably in relation to the business expansion scheme and the definition of manufacturing for the 10 per cent rate, <Col N="2360" /> and to deal with other areas of tax avoidance.</P>
    <P>Taxation is, of course, a key component of overall economic policy and the measures in this Bill are an integral part of the Government's economic and social policy.  Before detailing the main provisions of the Bill I would like to review briefly the present economic position, outline the general direction of Government policy in this regard and touch upon the general approach to tax reform.</P>
    <P>We can take heart from the major economic achievements of the past three years.  As a result of pursuing the right policies we have created the conditions for a resumption of growth.  Irish economic performance has improved enormously over this period.  Annual growth in real gross national product has averaged 3.5 per cent over the three years. We have now resumed our position as one of the top performers in the world league.</P>
    <P>The underlying objective of Government policy is, of course, to maximise growth and thereby jobs.  This is the payoff we are seeking from our comprehensive policy approach.  Non-agricultural employment in the private sector did, in fact, increase by some 30,000 in the two years to April last.</P>
    <P>In considering the effect on jobs of the resumption of economic growth, it is vital to remember that the net improvement shown by last year's labour force survey &mdash; 10,000 more employed than two years before &mdash; understates the gross private sector job-creation response to the economic upturn.  In addition to creating those 10,000 extra jobs, the private sector has produced new employment sufficient to offset both the necessary reductions in public sector employment and the continuing secular decline in agriculture over the period.  More recent indicators suggest that employment is continuing to expand.  For 1989 as a whole, there was an estimated net increase of the order of 13,000 jobs outside agriculture.</P>
    <P>I am confident that, despite some moderation in growth internationally and in particular the weakening in the UK, we <Col N="2361" /> can again this year achieve a growth performance on a par with that of the past three years.  In the light of the budget measures to strengthen the economy, GNP should expand by around 3.5 per cent once more.  The budget also puts us on course for a significant reduction in inflation &mdash; to a little over 3 per cent in 1990 as a whole, with the annual rate slowing down to about 2.5 per cent by the end of the year.  Provided we carry this through into our international competitiveness, we can anticipate further solid export growth even if not so spectacular as over the last couple of years because of the more muted external demand now in prospect.</P>
    <P>The signs are that the volume of business investment is headed for expansion of the same order as in 1989 &mdash; 10 per cent.  Personal consumption seems set for a further significant rise also, perhaps of the order of 4 per cent this year.  All three &mdash; exports, investment and domestic demand &mdash; will have a strong positive effect on jobs.  The overall result is that a net increase in non-agricultural employment of 16,000 can be achieved this year.</P>
    <P>A key element in our economic success of the last three years has been the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>.  The success of the programme has set an international example of what can be achieved by a consensus approach.  The Government have played their part in achieving, ahead of schedule, the financial objective of stabilising the national debt-GNP ratio and setting it firmly on a downward trend.  Employees, by adhering to the moderate pay increases provided for in the programme, have greatly contributed to the reduction in cost and price inflation while at the same time, as a result of the substantial income tax reductions made possible by the improvement in the public finances, they have enjoyed an increase in real take-home pay over the last two years and into 1990. For example, single workers on average male industrial earnings have enjoyed an increase in real take-home pay of 8.5 per cent over the period of the programme. Employers, through increasing investment and job creation, are making their <Col N="2362" /> contribution.  The whole community has gained.</P>
    <P>It is essential to future employment prospects that we do not lose the ground gained under the present programme. We reached, in the present <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, an eminently sensible agreement whereby, as I have said, living standards of employees were secured through a combination of pay increases geared to give us an edge on our competitors and reliefs in personal taxation which enhanced real take-home pay.  This arrangement can be a model for the future.  To be viable, of course, it presupposes that the terms under the various headings of a new agreement are consistent with the wider needs of the economy.</P>
    <P>A vital ingredient in the improved economic performance and outlook has been the progress made in recent years in correcting the imbalance in the public finances.  In 1986, Government borrowing stood at nearly 13 per cent of GNP.  As a result of the firm action taken by the Government, this had been more than halved by the end of 1988, to 6 per cent of GNP.  Last year there was a further significant fall in Government borrowing to 2.4 per cent of GNP.  Borrowing is now at its lowest level in about 40 years and the debt-GNP ratio, which was stabilised in 1988, has begun to fall at a significant rate &mdash; down from 131 per cent at end-1988 to about 123 per cent at end-1989.  It will fall further this year.</P>
    <P>While there were some timing distortions in the Exchequer figures for the first quarter, the returns indicate that the results so far are broadly in line with budget expectations.  The Government will be monitoring trends closely over the remainder of the year so as to ensure that the budget targets will be achieved.</P>
    <P>I would emphasise to Deputies that the Government are fully committed to reducing further both the level of borrowing and the debt-GNP ratio.  Specifically, the aim now is to achieve broad balance on the current budget by 1993. By the same deadline, it is intended also to make a significant rate of progress in reducing the debt-GNP ratio towards 100 <Col N="2363" /> per cent, down from its end-1989 level of 123 per cent.  These objectives require that tight control is maintained on current expenditure and that borrowing for investment purposes continues to be subject to rigorous scrutiny.  There is no scope for reverting to a relaxed approach to the public finances.  To do so would undermine confidence and destroy the very basis on which the improvement in the economy, and the increase in income for workers and welfare recipients, has been secured.</P>
    <P>The Government have an ambitious agenda in the field of tax reform.  Already in the past three years major progress has been made in reducing personal income tax rates, in starting the reform of the corporation tax system to make it more conducive to job creation and, last but by no means least, in greatly improving the system used to assess and collect taxes.  As I have indicated, this year's Finance Bill builds on the progress already made and breaks new ground with major further development of the self-assessment system by placing self-employed taxpayers on a current year basis; the significant new reductions in personal income tax for all taxpayers; further reform of the corporation tax system; initial steps to reduce our indirect taxes so as to help lower inflation and to bring our rates closer to European levels and the new steps as part of the Government's determined efforts to curb tax avoidance and ensure greater equity in the system.</P>
    <P>In relation to income tax, the changes in the Bill mark a substantial step towards fulfilment of the Programme for Government commitments.  The Government are well on target to meet their objectives of achieving a standard rate of 25 per cent by 1993 and of moving towards a single higher rate.  The Government are determined to achieve the income tax targets we have set ourselves in tandem with the overall objectives for continuing improvement in the public finances.  We recognise the negative impact on enterprise and initiative of high tax rates and we have shown that we are able to tackle <Col N="2364" /> it.  This is a major element in our approach to tax reform.  The Government are anxious to see this process continue and to ensure that lower income tax rates do, in fact, bring about not only a more favourable climate for employment but more actual jobs on the ground.</P>
    <P>If others have a different approach to tax reform they should say clearly what changes they would make and how, specifically, these would be financed. Calling for new reliefs without any counterpart funding plans does not represent a coherent approach to tax reform.</P>
    <P>I will turn now to the individual sections of the Bill and draw the attention of the House to the more significant items.  Full details of the individual sections of the Bill are contained in the Explanatory Memorandum which has been circulated to Deputies with the Bill.</P>
    <P>The opening sections of the Bill deal with the substantial package of income tax reliefs which I announced in the budget.  These reliefs continue the process which I began in 1989 of reducing income tax rates while making special provision for the low paid and maintaining at 63 per cent the proportion for the taxpayers on the standard rate.  The reliefs will cost over £200 million in the current tax year; taken together with the 1988 and 1989 budget changes, they mean that income tax reliefs costing over £800 million on a cumulative basis will have been provided over the period of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>In addition to the reductions in the rates of tax to which I have already referred, the specific income tax changes are as follows.  The general exemption limits are being increased from £6,000 to £6,500 in the case of a married couple and from £3,000 to £3,250 in the case of a single person.  The age exemption limits are being increased from £3,400 to £3,750 for single persons aged 65 years or over and from £4,000 to £4,350 for single persons aged 75 years or over.  The age exemption limits are being doubled, to £7,500 and £8,700 respectively, for married couples.  The special child addition to the exemption limits, which I introduced last year at £200 per child, is being <Col N="2365" /> increased to £300 per child.  Finally, the marginal relief rate, which applies where income does not greatly exceed the exemption limits, is being reduced from 60 per cent to 53 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that these changes will exempt some 31,000 taxpayers with 58,000 children from tax altogether, while a further 65,000 taxpayers with 123,000 children should benefit from marginal relief.  The Revenue Commissioners have, as I indicated at budget time, conducted a publicity campaign to make low paid taxpayers aware of these concessions; they also sent an information leaflet, incorporating a short application form, to low paid taxpayers with their tax-free allowance certificates. This leaflet also drew their attention to the family income supplement scheme operated by the Department of Social Welfare and described how to get details of that scheme.  I understand that there has been a good response so far to this publicity.</P>
    <P>The exemption limit changes will benefit a wide variety of taxpayers, small farmers and shopkeepers as well as PAYE taxpayers.  They mark the second year in a row that the Government have taken special measures to help the low paid.  The changes are substantial.  The general exemption limit for a married couple has been increased from £5,500 to £6,500 in two years, an increase of nearly 20 per cent; for a couple with three children, the increase is nearly 35 per cent; with five children, over 45 per cent.  These various changes complement the rate changes in what is a significant package of income tax reliefs.  As I have said, the Government are committed to continuing with this process.</P>
    <P>Chapter 1 of the Bill deals also with other income tax changes.  Section 3 renews the PRSI allowance for 1990-91, while section 4 reduces the level of life assurance relief from 80 per cent to 50 per cent of what previously applied.  This restriction was necessary in order to meet a small part of the cost of the budget income tax reliefs.  Without the restriction, life assurance relief would have cost some £35 million in the current tax year. <Col N="2366" /> The restriction will yield some £13 million in the current tax year.  Even taking account of this, the cost of the overall budget package of income tax reliefs will, as I have said, exceed £200 million in the 1990-91 tax year.</P>
    <P>While I am dealing with restriction of reliefs, I want to refer to the question of mortgage relief.  Deputies will be aware that this relief has been restricted twice in recent years.  It was restricted to 90 per cent of interest within the £2,000 single &mdash; £4,000 married ceilings in 1987.  The second restriction of the relief, to 80 per cent, was made last year.  I decided to make no further change this year.</P>
    <P>The restrictions of 1988 and 1989 must be seen in the context of the major package of income tax reliefs which have been introduced in recent years.  Since 1987, the general exemption limits have been increased from £2,650 to £3,250 for a single person and from £5,300 to £6,500 for a married couple, and a child addition of £300 per child has been introduced. The standard rate band has been extended by £1,800 for a single person and £3,600 for a married couple, and now stands at £6,500 single and £13,000 married.  Most dramatically of all, the standard rate of tax has fallen from 35 per cent to 30 per cent and the top rate of tax has been reduced from 58 per cent to 53 per cent.</P>
    <P>These reliefs have benefited every taxpayer in the country.  It is against this background that the restriction of mortgage interest relief must be viewed.  It must also be seen in the context of the Government's commitment in the Programme for Government to further reduce the standard rate of tax, to 25 per cent by 1993, and to move towards a single higher rate.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made that mortgage interest relief should be restored to 100 per cent because of the rise in interest rates over the past year. This suggestion ignores the fact that, as I have already pointed out, the revenue gained from the restriction has been used to pay a small part of the cost of the major income tax improvements made in recent years and no suggestion has been <Col N="2367" /> made as to how the Government should recoup the cost &mdash; estimated at £55 million a year &mdash; of such a restoration.  The second point I would make is that, despite the restriction to 80 per cent, mortgage interest relief will cost the Exchequer an estimated £220 million in terms of tax foregone in the current tax year, as compared with some £170 million in 1989-90. The vast bulk of this increase is due to increased interest rates.  By any standards, this is a very substantial level of on-going Government support for mortgage-holders.</P>
    <P>There is no question of the Government being unconcerned about those paying mortgages.  The underlying problem is of course the increase in interest rates which, unfortunately, has occurred due mainly to international factors.  In our domestic policies the Government have done everything possible to promote lower interest rates and we will maintain our efforts in this regard.</P>
    <P>Section 6 implements the budget proposal relating to farmers' stock relief. This is aimed at farmers whose stock has to be disposed of under disease eradication measures.  In such cases, there will be an extra period of one year allowed to farmers for restocking before a claw-back of stock relief takes effect.</P>
    <P>There are two provisions in the Bill, in sections 7 and 29, which impinge on the Business Expansion Scheme.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the BES was introduced in order to generate risk capital for companies in selected sectors of the economy.  The scheme is a very attractive one from the investor's point of view, because he or she can obtain tax relief on the full amount of his or her investment up to the agreed limits; this is intended to encourage him or her to take the risk involved in putting up venture capital.</P>
    <P>The scheme has, I regret to say, been the subject of continuing abuse.  Last year, as Deputies will recall, I introduced a number of measures intended to counter these abuses: the principal one was a ban on guarantees and options to purchase BES shares, at the end of the <Col N="2368" /> obligatory five-year holding period, at other than market value.  The purpose of that measure was to try to eliminate the guarantees which had become a feature of BES schemes while allowing the investor an exit mechanism from his investment at the market value of his shares.</P>
    <P>Despite this restriction, guarantee arrangements aimed at eliminating risk and circumventing the legislation remained a feature of BES projects in the tax year just ended.  This is obviously inconsistent with a scheme for generating risk capital.  In my budget statement I indicated my determination to ensure that the BES remains a risk capital scheme.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, section 29 of the Bill ensures that BES relief will not apply where arrangements exist which guarantee the investor's shareholding regardless of whether or not the company is successful. Relief will be denied where an arrangement exists to eliminate the risk that shareholders might be unable to recover an agreed amount in respect of their investment within an agreed period. In other words, guaranteed investments will no longer qualify for BES relief.  I consider this provision an essential one to counter the sort of abuse which we have seen taking place in recent months. I am also conscious in this context of the necessity to protect the equity of the tax system.  The BES was not introduced to provide a guaranteed tax shelter for well-off investors at the expense of the Exchequer &mdash; that is, at the expense of other taxpayers.  It was introduced to encourage those with funds to make them available as risk capital for investment in productive Irish industry and thus to help maximise the value to the economy in terms of employment and output.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is to prevent a situation where investors could get interest relief on loans taken out to buy BES shares, as well as the BES relief itself on the capital invested in the scheme.  Such interest relief could be available where the investor is an employee or director of the BES company.  However, there is in my view no reason why an investor, having got tax relief on the capital amount he invested <Col N="2369" /> through the BES, should also be able to get relief on the interest paid on a loan taken out to enable him to acquire the shares.  In other words, tax relief should not be available on both the capital and the interest.  Accordingly, section 7 provides that where tax relief is claimed on capital invested through the BES, relief will not also be available on money borrowed to fund the investment.</P>
    <P>This is the second year that the Government have had to introduce anti-abuse measures in relation to the BES.  I think it is proper that I should record my deep disappointment, and the Government's, at the way that this generous tax relief, far from being used for the productive purposes for which it was introduced, has been abused.  At a time when improved industrial performance and increased employment are so vitally necessary, it is a great pity that the considerable talents involved in the BES industry could not have been put to more productive use.</P>
    <P>I would add that I will continue to take careful note of the behaviour of the BES industry and will take account of that behaviour in future decisions on the BES.</P>
    <P>Section 8 deals with the tax treatment of <i>ex gratia</i> payments made to individuals on retirement or termination of employment. The section provides that where tax relief on such payments is being calculated, account will be taken, not only of any tax-free pension scheme lump sums which the individual has received or will receive, but also of any options he has &mdash; which have not been revoked &mdash; under which he may receive such lump sums in the future.  The purpose of the section is to ensure that individuals do not get excessive levels of tax-free payments on retirement or termination of employment. I should stress that the tax-free status of ordinary pension scheme lump sums is not affected.</P>
    <P>Section 9 exempts local committees, vocational education committees, county committees of agriculture and health boards from income tax other than deposit interest retention tax.  These bodies are already exempt from corporation tax and capital gains tax.  The <Col N="2370" /> fact that local authorities were liable to income tax used not to give rise to any actual liability.  However, the restriction of interest relief in 1973-74 gave rise to the possibility of a tax charge and some authorities have in fact been assessed to income tax which is unlikely to be paid without assistance from the Exchequer. The present section therefore exempts local authorities, and the other bodies I have mentioned, from income tax with effect from the 1973-74 tax year, the year when the possibility of a tax liability first arose.  I am sure that Deputies from all sides of the House will join in welcoming this section, which settles the long-running question of the income tax liability of local authorities.</P>
    <P>Chapter II, comprising sections 10 to 23 of the Bill, gives effect to the change in the basis of assessment for self-employed taxpayers.</P>
    <P>As a result of these provisions self-employed taxpayers will, with effect from the present tax year, have their liability for tax based on the profits of the current rather than the preceding year.  This major change is necessary to facilitate further development of the self-assessment system.  The self-assessment procedures introduced on a voluntary basis in 1988 have been a tremendous success but further development of the system is essential at this stage if the momentum of progress is to be maintained. A prerequisite for this development is that all sources of income &mdash; trading income, investment income and so on &mdash; should be assessed for tax on the same basis: at present some income is assessed on a preceding year basis and other income is assessed on a current year basis.  This gives rise to considerable confusion and, in effect, necessitates the submission of two years' returns before the liability for a particular year can be finalised.  The switch to a current year basis of assessment for all income is, therefore, the next logical step in the progress towards a full obligatory self-assessment system where taxpayers would be required, in due course, to compute and pay their tax themselves.</P>
    <P>The switch will bring greater certainty <Col N="2371" /> and efficiency into the system and in particular will result in a lower compliance burden for taxpayers and their advisers, greater efficiency in, and therefore better service from, tax officers and the intensified pursuit of tax evasion through better use of resources.</P>
    <P>Details of the legislative arrangements for the new assessment regime are set out in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill.  The main features are as follows: For the 1990-91 and subsequent tax years all income will be charged to tax on the basis of the income in the year of assessment. In the case of trading profits of the self-employed, which are computed by reference to annual accounts, the charge to tax will, as I indicated previously, be based on the profits of the accounting period ending in the current tax year, as opposed to the accounting period ending in the preceding tax year as at present.</P>
    <P>There will be changes in the tax payment arrangements.  Preliminary tax will be due on 1 November in the tax year and, to avoid an interest charge for underpayments, the taxpayer must pay not less than 90 per cent of the current year ultimate liability or not less than 100 per cent of the preceding year's actual tax liability.  The option of paying the previous year's liability will assist taxpayers who may not be in a position to estimate their liability on a current basis by 1 November of the tax year.</P>
    <P>As a result of the switch to a current year this year accounting periods ending in 1989-90 will not now form the basis for an assessment.  A transitional measure is included so as to reduce any hardship that might arise, as a result of a significant fluctuation in income between 1989-90 and 1990-91.  The Bill provides that where the profits for 1990-91 exceed the profits for 1989-09 by 50 per cent or more, the assessment for 1990-91 will be reduced to the average profits of the two periods. Farmers will of course continue to have their general averaging option available.</P>
    <P>Transitional provisions are also included to deal with the treatment of capital allowances in the changeover year <Col N="2372" /> 1990-91 in the case of unincorporated businesses.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding that 1989-90 will not form a basis for an assessment, a return of income for the period will still be required.  This is necessary to settle outstanding matters relating to 1989-90 tax liability and to ensure that no one is taking unfair advantage of the changeover to transfer income into the period which would not form a basis of assessment.</P>
    <P>The tax return filing date is being changed from 31 December in the year of assessment to 31 January in the year following the year of assessment.</P>
    <P>Provision is made to retain the existing arrangements as regards crediting of tax deducted in the preceding year and the operation of the interim refund procedures under the scheme of withholding tax on professional fees.  There are certain other mainly technical consequential provisions.</P>
    <P>While these measures will bring the tax treatment of the self-employed closer to that of PAYE taxpayers, important differences still remain.</P>
    <P>I would like to underline again the importance I attach to this change in our continuing efforts to have a simpler and more effective tax system.  Much has been done in this regard in recent years and we can now go further.  The proposals represent a reasonable and balanced package of measures and I commend them to the House.</P>
    <P>Before leaving this topic it is only right that I should acknowledge the valuable role played by the tax practitioners in the success of self-assessment to date and I look forward to their continuing co-operation in relation to the new measures provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Sections 25 to 28 are concerned with the urban renewal tax incentives for the designated areas.  As announced in the budget the time-limit for this incentive package is being extended by two years from 31 May 1991 until 31 May 1993.  The development of the designated areas will be given a further impetus by this measure, especially in the case of projects <Col N="2373" /> which are as yet only at the planning stage.</P>
    <P>Sections 27 and 28 are intended to counter several unintended uses or abuses of the generous tax incentives contained in the designated areas package. The double-rent allowance available to tenants in these areas allows them to reduce their income for tax purposes over a ten-year period by taking a deduction each year of an amount equal to twice the rent actually paid.  In the case of sole traders or partnerships, where income tax at a rate of 53 per cent can apply, the tax saving can actually exceed the amount of rent paid.  This is unduly generous, and section 27 accordingly limits the tax foregone by the Exchequer to an amount not exceeding the rent actually paid by the taxpayer.  That section also provides that the double-rent allowance will not be given in a contrived &ldquo;cross-letting&rdquo; situation.  It was never intended that any one party could obtain both the full capital allowances as the lessor of a qualifying building, and the double-rent allowance as the lessee of a similar building, in an arrangement undertaken purely to exploit the tax provisions.</P>
    <P>Section 28 excludes finance leases of commercial premises from qualifying for the double-rent allowance.  Such leases include capital payments which enable the lessee to purchase the building.  The double-rent allowance was intended for normal rental payments by the lessee and not for capital payments.</P>
    <P>The overall effect of sections 27 and 28 will be to eliminate excessive levels of tax benefit which were never intended under the incentive package for the designated areas.  By reducing the potential for excessive tax gains to lessees, the provisions will enable market forces to operate more freely in regard to rental levels.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to section 29 in dealing with the business expansion scheme.  Section 29 also deals with abuses of the exemption for Shannon dividend income.  A number of schemes were launched last year which involved the extension of this Shannon exemption to <Col N="2374" /> investments which had a bank guarantee for both the sums invested and the investment return.  Through the use of a combined loan-share arrangement, the guaranteed fixed rate of return amounted to over 800 per cent per annum on the very small amount of actual share capital invested.  I announced on 21 July last that if necessary I would introduce legislation in regard to these schemes.  Section 29 accordingly provides that where arrangements exist to eliminate the investor's normal risk, the Shannon tax exemption for shareholders will not apply.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to state that I will not hesitate to take similar action in future where necessary and with similar immediate effect from the date of the announcement, if I become aware of other abuses of a specific exemption.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the main changes in the Bill relating to corporation tax.</P>
    <P>As announced in the budget, the standard rate of corporation tax on company profits is being reduced from 43 per cent to 40 per cent from 1 April 1991.  This is part of the continuing process of reform which includes also the phasing-out of accelerated capital allowances, which I will refer to shortly.  Sections 31 and 32 of the Bill give effect to the reduction in the rate and to the related adjustment in the tax credit attached to company distributions out of profits taxed at this standard rate.  This change will be of particular benefit to the services sector which is such an important source of new jobs.</P>
    <P>Section 33 is concerned with the definition of manufacturing for the purposes of the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax.  I announced in my Budget Statement that I was concerned about the fact that the 10 per cent rate for manufacturing now applies to a wider range of activities than was originally intended.  This reflects court decisions in particular cases as to what constituted manufacturing.  The concept of manufacturing has, as a result, been extended well beyond the normal everyday meaning of the term to include activities which are not really manufacturing activities at <Col N="2375" /> all.  These activities have gained an unintended benefit by being taxed at only 10 per cent instead of at the standard corporation tax rate of 43 per cent.  New provisions are therefore being introduced under section 33 so as to restrict the definition of manufacturing to what was originally intended.  This is done by excluding certain processes from the scope of the relief.  The change is necessary in order to protect the corporation tax yield because the standard 43 per cent rate is the rate at which the bulk of corporation tax is paid.</P>
    <P>The categories to be excluded are set out in the section and in the explanatory memorandum and the new rules will come into effect for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April 1990.</P>
    <P>It has been claimed that meat processing is now being given the 10 per cent rate for the first time.  I would like to correct this impression.  Meat processing has always been eligible for the 10 per cent rate.  The reason section 33 specifically provides for meat processing is a technical drafting one, which is designed merely to ensure that meat processing does not lose its exsisting entitlement to the 10 per cent rate as a result of the application of the new rules.</P>
    <P>As announced last week, the Government have decided that the termination date for the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax for manufacturing and related activities is to be extended from 31 December 2000 to 31 December 2010. This special low tax rate has proved to be a very effective incentive for attracting mobile international investment and for assisting the expansion of domestic manufacturing companies.  Because of the long lead time associated with major manufacturing projects it is necessary to provide assurance and certainty now to foreign investors that the 10 per cent rate will continue after the year 2000.  The necessary legislative provisions are being prepared and I hope to include these in the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>These measures will clarify the 10 per cent regime for manufacturing both as to <Col N="2376" /> its scope and the period for which it will apply.</P>
    <P>Section 34 allows the Irish branches of foreign parent companies to deduct their patent royalty payments against their income for tax purposes.  This will give such branches equality of tax treatment with Irish subsidiary companies of foreign parents where such payments are already allowed.  It will also assist the industrial development agencies in their promotional activities abroad.</P>
    <P>In my 1989 Budget Statement, I invited the business community to launch an initiative which would help to alleviate poverty and increase employment.  I also asked that the initiative should be organised and operated by the business community itself.  That community's response has been to set up a trust for community initiatives which will receive donations from companies and apply those to assist suitable projects in line with the aims of the trust.  In order to encourage companies to contribute, section 35 provides for a relief for corporate donations which are given to the trust in the period between 20 April 1990 and 31 March 1991.  This gives a reasonable deadline and should serve to stimulate a quick response by the business community.  The trust deed itself, which has been drawn up in consultation with officials of my Department, of the Revenue Commissioners, and of the Chief State Solicitor's Office, contains appropriate measures in relation to the appointment of new or additional trustees, and to any changes in the trust deed.  There is also a requirement on the trust to publish an annual report and to make detailed returns to my Department on the donations it receives, and on the disbursements it makes to assisted projects and initiatives.</P>
    <P>Section 36 confirms the budget proposal to reduce the volume of section 84 loans with effect from budget day.  No new domestic-sourced section 84 loans are now permitted except where the total loan volume of the lender does not exceed 75 per cent of his loan volume as of 12 April 1989.  A special transitional arrangement will apply in the case of <Col N="2377" /> certain loans for new manufacturing projects which were under negotiation with the industrial promotion agencies.  Provided particular qualifying conditions are fulfilled, section 84 loans for these projects which cannot otherwise be catered for under a lender's 75 per cent ceiling will be allowed.  This transitional arrangement will apply to qualifying loans of this type given in the period 31 January 1990 to 31 December 1991.  The total amount involved, which is not to exceed £170 million, will count towards the 75 per cent ceiling rule after the end of 1991 by which time section 84 loans to Shannon companies will have been phased out in accordance with the 1989 Finance Act.</P>
    <P>The self-assessment system was extended to companies from last October.  Sections 37 to 45, inclusive, introduce technical changes designed to assist both companies and the Revenue Commissioners in operating the self-assessment system.  They will ensure as far as possible that the liability for an accounting period can be finalised in one return form and in a single payment of tax.  In this way these sections will streamline the operation of self-assessment for companies.</P>
    <P>Sections 46 and 47 contain provisions relating to the conversion of building societies into companies.  These cater for the taxation consequences of such conversions which were provided for in the Building Societies Act, 1989.  Similarly, sections 48 to 50 provide for the taxation consequences of the amalgamation of trustee savings banks and for their reorganisation into companies which were provided for in the Trustee Savings Banks Act, 1989.</P>
    <P>Chapter VII of Part I, comprising sections 51 to 58, implements the budget proposal dealing with the distribution of income to their Irish investors from foreign unit trusts and similar investment funds.  This measure is designed to promote a more level playing field between Irish and foreign investment media.  Up to now investors in certain foreign funds had unrestricted scope for converting a taxable income into tax-free capital gains.  With effect on and from 6 April <Col N="2378" /> foreign investment funds will have to distribute at least 85 per cent of their annual income each year to their Irish investors. If this distribution condition is not met, the investors will become liable to income tax instead of capital gains tax on the disposal of units or shares in these funds.</P>
    <P>Chapter VIII of the Bill provides for the budget reduction in accelerated capital allowances for plant, machinery and industrial buildings.  These will be reduced from 50 per cent to 25 per cent from 1 April 1991, and to nil from 1 April 1992.  As I have noted earlier, this is linked to the parallel reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax and is necessary to defray the cost of the tax rate reduction.  It will also contribute to a broadening of the corporation tax base. The normal annual wear and tear allowances will still be available and the reductions will not affect the special building incentives in the areas designated for urban renewal, or qualifying service companies in the Custom House Docks area and in the Shannon customs-free airport.</P>
    <P>A transitional arrangement is being applied in the case of new industrial projects approved for grant assistance by the industrial development agencies on or before 31 December 1990.  For such projects accelerated capital allowances will continue to be available at a level of 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>Sections 60, 61 and 62 contain the general measures for the phased reduction in accelerated allowances for plant and machinery, and sections 63 and 65 cater for similar restrictions in the case of industrial buildings.  In similar vein, section 66 restricts accelerated allowances for certain farm buildings and other works.  Finally, certain loopholes in the application of the capital allowances regime are covered in sections 59, 64 and 67.</P>
    <P>Sections 71 and 72 provide, as announced in the budget, for the abolition of the 60 per cent rate of capital gains tax.  The top rate of tax for disposals made on or after 6 April 1990 will be 50 per cent which is closer to the new top rate of income tax.  This change is not <Col N="2379" /> expected to have a significant effect on revenue receipts.</P>
    <P>The relief available under sections 26 and 27 of the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975 on disposals of certain business assets by individuals aged 55 years or over &mdash; referred to as retirement relief &mdash; does not at present extend to disposals of shares in holding companies of trading groups.  Sections 73 and 74 of the Bill provide for such an extension.</P>
    <P>Section 75 in an anti-avoidance provision. Under the Capital Gains Tax Act a capital loss cannot be transferred between members of a group of companies. A practice has arisen whereby companies have used a particular provision in an unintended way to circumvent the above rule with a consequent loss of tax revenue to the Exchequer.  The Bill closes this loophole.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill deals with changes in the Customs and Excise area.  Sections 78 to 84 give effect to the reductions in excise duty which were announced in the budget.  Section 78 provides for the reduction in excise duty on environmentally friendly motor fuels, with tax on unleaded petrol being reduced by 5p per gallon and the tax on auto liquid petroleum gas being halved.  The tax differential in favour of unleaded petrol is now 13.5p per gallon.  Sections 79 to 84 provide for the budget reductions in duty on table water, televisions, videos and camcorders and for the abolition of duty on records, compact discs, matches and mechanical lighters.</P>
    <P>Section 85 is a technical adjustment.  It provides for a change in the technical composition of the tax on cigarettes made necessary by the 1 March reduction in the standard rate of VAT.  This change is necessary in order to comply with an EC directive.  This section will not change the overall level of taxation on cigarettes, nor will it affect the price of cigarettes.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill, covering sections 86 to 96, gives effect to the VAT changes announced in the budget as well as a number of further largely technical measures.  The major change is of course <Col N="2380" /> the reduction of two percentage points in the standard rate of VAT to 23 per cent which is making a significant contribution to lower inflation this year.  The other budget changes include the increase from 2 to 2.3 per cent in the farmers' flat-rate refund and associated livestock rate, the increase from 5 to 10 per cent of VAT on electricity and the imposition of VAT at 10 per cent on telephone and related charges.  The VAT imposition on telephones will now take effect from 1 January next instead of the originally proposed date of 1 July 1990, so as to facilitate Telecom Éireann in completing the installation of their new billing system.  There will be no loss to the Exchequer since Telecom will pay over an amount in respect of the net VAT due.  As I indicated on budget day, the VAT measures on electricity and telephones are being given effect without any increase in charges to consumers.</P>
    <P>As a result of developments on the EC front we are required to terminate the VAT-exemption of horses and greyhounds, the non-taxation of which was only allowed temporarily by way of a derogation from Community law.  I am proposing to bring these to tax at the low rate of 2.3 per cent which already applies to livestock and the effects on the industries concerned will be minimal.</P>
    <P>The technical VAT measures in this Part of the Bill deal with taxation of services received from abroad that may currently avoid tax; clarification of the law in regard to the taxation of driving schools and a number of other items; and, finally, a minor extension of the existing definition of newspapers which can qualify for the 10 per cent rate of VAT.</P>
    <P>It is gratifying that we have been able to make a number of indirect tax changes this year, especially the reduction in the standard VAT rate, which are consistent with the emerging framework for 1992. Much of course still remains to be agreed at EC level as to the rates of both excise and VAT and the other arrangements to apply post-1922.  EC Finance Ministers took stock of the situation at a meeting which I chaired in Luxembourg on <Col N="2381" /> Monday last.  I brought my colleagues up to date on the work which has been undertaken in this area under the Irish Presidency.  The work is to be pushed ahead actively and the Commission was asked to bring forward the outstanding proposals as soon as possible.  I also look forward to early completion of the study which the Commission is undertaking on the implications of tax approximation for Ireland.</P>
    <P>Section 97 continues the bank levy for 1990, as announced in the budget.  The total levy amount is £36 million, which is the same as for 1989.  Section 98 implements the budget proposal for a 3 per cent levy on investment by Irish residents in unit trusts and similar investment funds.  This will provide equality of treatment in this regard with investment in life-assurance linked funds, where the 3 per cent levy has applied since 1987.</P>
    <P>I now come to a number of other measures which will help with the development of the financial services sector which is another important source of new jobs.</P>
    <P>I announced in my budget speech that it was my intention to clarify and simplify the way stamp duties are to apply to various financial services and transactions. Sections 99 and 101 contain these measures together with the rationalisation of the rate bands applicable to property valued at less than £25,000.  For bonds, covenants, mortgages and so on the exemption limit below which stamp duty is not payable is increased to £20,000 and there is a ceiling of £3,000 on the maximum charge.  I hope that these changes will encourage the execution in Ireland of transactions which at present are being effected abroad.</P>
    <P>Section 103 provides for exemptions from companies' capital duty for collective investment undertakings which come under the UCITs Directive.  This measure is aimed at establishing UCITs in this country, especially in the IFSC, and is in line with a proposed amending Directive which has now been put forward by the EC Commission at our request.  The fact that a 1 per cent duty <Col N="2382" /> could be charged on the foreign investment funds under management by these undertakings was proving to be an obstacle to their establishment here.</P>
    <P>Section 100 provides for the charging of full stamp duty on non-grant type new houses.  This measure is a response to the situation which had developed whereby the intending purchaser of a non-grant type new house could reduce his or her exposure to duty by having separate contracts for the purchase of a site and the construction of a house.  In order to allow more time to cater for those persons who entered into contracts prior to my budget announcement to complete their transactions, this section will only become operative for conveyances executed after 1 September next.  This section will not apply to an individual building a house on his own land nor will it apply to industrial or commercial property.</P>
    <P>There is also a number of specific anti-avoidance measures and technical provisions in relation to stamp duty which we will have an opportunity to discuss on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 110 will facilitate the self assessment of residential property tax by making provision for the rounding upwards of the market value exemption limit to the nearest £1,000 and for the use of the new house price index for the three months ended 31 December instead of the three months ended 31 March, in determining the market value exemption limit as at 5 April each year.  The use of the March index at present is causing delay in administering the tax.  Section 111 provides for the rounding up of the income exemption limit to the nearest £100.</P>
    <P>More significantly, section 112 provides for the restoration of child relief under the residential property tax code in accordance with my budget announcement. The provision allows for a reduction of 10 per cent in the amount of tax payable for each child up to a maximum of ten.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill deals with capital acquisitions tax.  In addition to the measures for indexation of thresholds and the exemption for gifts between spouses <Col N="2383" /> announced on budget day, it contains two further provisions.  Section 116 tightens up the legislation in respect of certain exemptions from discretionary trust tax. Section 117 provides for an extension of the scope of section 60 insurance policies. The proceeds of these policies are exempt from tax where they are used to pay inheritance tax.  The new provision will cater for joint policies effected by husband and wife where the estate is not left absolutely to the surviving spouse, for example, where the estate is devolved to a child on the death of that spouse.  This extension will make these policies more popular.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains some non-tax items. These include a number in relation to debt management as is customary with the annual Finance Bill.  An important aspect of national debt management relates to conversion of existing Government loans, whereby the Minister for Finance may offer to replace a stock due for redemption by giving holders of the redeeming stock the opportunity to convert into another stock.  This process is at present governed by legislation that is nearly 40 years old.  During this period our capital market, and especially the bond market, has developed greatly.  In line with this development, the stock conversion legislation needs to be updated to reflect modern market conditions and practices.  This is the purpose of section 120.</P>
    <P>Section 124 will provide the basis for the introduction of a new short-term Government security, Exchequer Notes, which will effectively widen the existing market for Exchequer Bills and provide greater flexibility for investors.  For example, the notes will be made available more or less on a continuous basis, in contrast to Bills which are sold by weekly tender.  The section provides that where Government securities are issued at a discount, the discount will be liable to tax; and exempts the discount in the hands of non-residents.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a major and lengthy one. Some of its provisions represent significant policy initiatives while others, as <Col N="2384" /> I have indicated, are of a more technical nature.  The real importance of the Bill lies in its furtherance of the Government's overall economic and financial objectives which are aimed at achieving more econiomic growth and jobs and, as part of this, a greater equity and efficiency in out tax system.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I thank the Minister and his officials for a very detailed speech.  This Finance Bill is particularly long &mdash; 130 pages &mdash; and complex and the detail and clarity of the Minister's speech, together with the explanatory memorandum, will be of great benefit to Members of the House and interested parties outside it as they seek to come to terms with the Bill.  Like all Finance Bills, generally it enacts the announcements made by the Minister on budget day and, where the Minister merely foreshadowed an announcement by a statement of principle, it spells out in greater detail the implications of such statements.  I should like to commence by referring back to the budget since the Bill enacts it.  I now believe that the budget is going off the rails.  The very large increases in expenditure by the line Departments during the Estimates campaign in the autumn of last year and the over reliance on buoyancy of taxation in the Minister's budgetary figures are now coming home to roost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Exchequer returns for the first quarter of the year show that the Minister will now have to run a surplus of over £100 million on current account for the next nine months if he is to achieve his budgetary targets.  This has never been done in living memory and I would be surprised if the Minister achieves it this year.  It certainly looks unlikely that he will achieve his budgetary target.  I know that the Minister has attempted to explain some of the very disturbing first quarter Exchequer returns.  Some of what <Col N="2385" /> he claims is correct and the effect of certain provisions is a once off.  There are, however, claims in the budget of savings made which are of doubtful validity. As I mentioned on the Order of Business, the Minister, for example, has included a saving of £35 million in his figures for the proposed new debt management office in the Department of Finance but we are still awaiting legislation to set up that office and the schedule of impending legislation circulated at the start of this session does not include a provision for it.  It is unlikely now that the experts who would manage the debt more efficiently than those who do so at present &mdash; to the extent of saving £35 million in a half year &mdash; could be recruited by mid-year.</P>
    <P>Even a small overrun on the budgetary borrowing target this year could have very serious consequences.  I believe that the political consensus in favour of tight control of public expenditure is now evaporating.  The demand for increased public expenditure is now widespread, in Government, in the Oireachtas, in various interest groups and in the electorate at large.  There is no stomach for further expenditure cuts and if the current budget deficit begins to increase again the Government will have great difficulty in reversing the trend.</P>
    <P>As a nation we have tottered on the brink of insolvency through most of the eighties.  There is a widespread perception that our debt problems have been solved but of course they have not because the debt continues to rise.  The pace at which it is rising has been reduced but it will rise again this year by almost half a billion pounds.  It takes almost all income tax receipts to service the debt, the debt keeps interest rates high and costs jobs.  The Minister had a unique opportunity in that he could have brought in the first balanced budget for years but his chances of doing so now are slipping away.  He talked in his speech about bringing in a balanced budget by 1993 but that will be a very difficult target to achieve.</P>
    <P>There are signs in the economy at present that there is very little buoyancy <Col N="2386" /> even though a huge amount of tax revenue has been included in the budgetary figures. For example, bookings in the holiday package trade are down by between 25 per cent and 30 per cent.  That is always a reasonable indicator of activity, especially among young people and the amount of disposable income they have.  Applications for new house loans are drying up; one building society manager recently told me that it was like turning off a tap in the first week in March after a buoyant January and February.</P>
    <P>The retail sector is depressed and there are sales in half the shops in every town in the country.  Sales of cars, new and second-hand, are beginning to slow down, especially in relation to the second-hand trade.  The forecourts of garages are filling up with second-hand cars and this will spill over to the new car trade very shortly.  There are signs of depression in this area.</P>
    <P>Rural Deputies are very conscious of the fact that the price of milk has come down by about 20 pence per gallon and this affects buoyancy, not only in rural areas but in every small town in the country.  I am not pointing out these things to paint a black picture of the economy or to adopt the role of some kind of Cassandra, all I am saying is that there is a question mark over the revenue buoyancy figures which have been included in the budgetary arithmetic.  If there is an overrun on expenditure and if revenue begins to fall short the Minister will have a problem.  I do not know whether this anecdotal evidence which I indicated is reflected in the tax receipts going to the Department or whether there is any evidence yet that there has been a reduction in stamp duty, excise rates or VAT to Revenue but I will certainly await the second quarter revenue returns with great interest.</P>
    <P>Rising interest rates are putting a serious brake on economic growth at present and are costing jobs.  Rates have risen four times in about 12 months and there is wide speculation regarding further increases.  A leak of a briefing document from the Minister's Department <Col N="2387" /> published in yesterday's Irish Independent has further fuelled this speculation and I should like the Minister to comment on whether this was a genuine briefing document, if it was leaked and, if so, how?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Progressive Democrats have a more catholic attitude to leaks.  The Minister for Finance merely leaks to Michael Ronayne of RTE and to a well known journalist in the Irish Independent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is astounding that the Minister ignored interest rates in his budget speech and it is equally astounding that he has not taken any steps to treat either the symptoms or the disease of rising interest rates in the Finance Bill.  The Minister should have restored full mortgage interest relief in the Bill.  I know he gave the reasons for not doing so but he dealt with the matter more by assertion than by any reasoned argument.  It will cost more in tax revenue and lost buoyancy by not doing so than the measure would cost.  The Minister said such relief would cost £55 million but that is the gross cost and I presume the buoyancy on a relief like that would be in excess of 40 per <Col N="2388" /> cent.  The real figure would be something in the region of £30 million and not £55 million as the Minister stated.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also have come to the aid of farmers, especially those in the beef sector, who need less expensive working capital.  The Minister could provide exchange rate, risk free Deutsche Mark loans which was done in similar circumstances in the early eighties by Deputy Dukes when he was Minister for Finance.  If the Minister is as firm as I hope he is &mdash; and as he says he is &mdash; on exchange rate policy there would be no cost to the Exchequer for providing loans at German interest rates to a very restricted sector rather than at Irish interest rates.</P>
    <P>It would be possible, allowing for a commission to the banks, to provide money to farmers, especially in the beef sector, at about 10.5 per cent to 11 per cent as against anything between 15 per cent and 18 per cent which they are paying at present.  It would not be at a cost to the Exchequer if we are to believe the Minister's commitments to a strong currency.  I believe the Minister and I hope he sticks to his commitments.</P>
    <P>These are merely suggestions to deal with the symptoms of rising interest rates where they pinch hardest and cause the maximum pain and a major downturn in economic activity.  The great problem with Irish interest rates is that they are 4 per cent higher than those in West Germany, even though our punt has been tied for a long time to the Deutsche Mark within the EMS.  While there were widely differing inflation rates and a widely differing attitude to fiscal policy, a differential can be justified but it is very difficult in present circumstances to justify such a wide differential.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister does not take the decisions to increase or reduce interest rates, that decision is taken by the Central Bank.  About two months ago the Governor of the Central Bank said he believed the present 4 per cent differential rate will have to continue and gave his reasons.  If the Minister wants to reduce interest rates &mdash; he has got the reasons they are high from the man who <Col N="2389" /> is in the position to reduce them &mdash; he should introduce policies to accommodate the Governor of the Central Bank so that the differential between the two rates can be reduced.</P>
    <P>The Governor of the Central Bank said that the 1990 budget was too soft.  He said the borrowing targets were too soft and, therefore, interest rates would have to remain high.  The Minister is smiling but he has read this statement and has been briefed by his officials.  The Minister may like or dislike the Governor of the Central Bank or agree or disagree with his attitudes, but he happens to be the person who is statutorily empowered to fix interest rates.  If he decides that Government policy keeps interest rates high, the Minister has two choices &mdash; he can either maintain the same policies and high interest rates or he can change policy and reduce the differential between the Irish and West German rates.</P>
    <P>Of course, if the Minister does not achieve the soft targets he has set &mdash; even the reputable economists the Taoiseach referred to when he arrived back in Dublin Airport recently are now saying there will be an overrun of at least £50 million &mdash; I do not think the Governor of the Central Bank will be encouraged to reduce that differential.  The Governor also said that the medium term target to bring the national debt to a point where it is equal to one year's GNP is too soft. The Minister repeated this today when he said that if we could bring the debt down to 100 per cent of GNP by 1993 it would be good progress.  Of course it would, but if he simply takes growth at 3.5 to 4 per cent of GNP and maintains the same ratio of expenditure a rising GNP will give a different percentage.  If this is maintained over three years it will be reduced from the present 123 per cent to 117 per cent at the end of this year and perhaps to 100 per cent without the Minister taking any action whatsoever.  I agree with the Governor that this is the minimum acceptable target.  Any other kind of target would mean the Minister would be increasing disproportionately public expenditure.  As I said, the Governor of the Central Bank believes this <Col N="2390" /> target is too soft.  I believe it needs to be revised and strengthened.  A total national debt of 75 per cent of GNP by 1993 would be a far more appropriate target if the Minister wants to reduce interest rates.</P>
    <P>The Governor of the Central Bank also pointed out that our historically high inflation rate works against lower interest rates even though Irish inflation rates now compare favourably with other EMS countries.  To an extent both individuals and countries can be blamed for the sins of the past.  When we went into Government inflation was at 21 per cent, when we left it was below 5 per cent, and a year later it was down to 3.5 per cent.  The Minister has continued this progress and we are now regarded as a low inflation country.  However, even in that context there is still work to be done.  For example, I do not believe that the benefits of a strong pound are now being passed on to the consumer in terms of lower retail prices on imported goods.  I raised this issue previously and the Minister for Industry and Commerce in a burst of frenetic activity called in the importers and the supermarket proprietors and threatened and cajoled them into reducing the price of some goods.</P>
    <P>In a competitive economy the benefits of a strong currency should be automatically passed on to the consumer and we should not have to rely on fire brigade action by the Minister for Industry and Commerce for this to happen.  However, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has an obligation to introduce legislation as a matter of priority to ensure that competitive factors are allowed to operate and that they are not obstructed by cartels and quasi-monopolies in the pursuit of windfall profits at the expense of the Irish consumer.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has singularly failed to introduce such legislation and I have not seen any sign of that Bill in the list of legislation which was circulated to Deputies today.  The Minister should at a very early date introduce into domestic legislation the anti-monopoly and anticartel provisions in the Treaty of Rome. It is ludicrous that when the swings favour <Col N="2391" /> the consumer the windfall profits are taken up but when the roundabouts go against the consumer, prices go up.  I do not believe it should be necessary to raise a row in this House so that the Minister has to call in certain people again to get them to pass on the benefits they should automatically pass on in a competitive economy.</P>
    <P>The Irish pound strengthened by over 25 per cent against the yen during the past 12 months, but has anyone noticed a drop in the price of new or secondhand Japanese cars?  The Irish pound has further strengthened against Sterling in recent months, but there is no sign of the benefits being passed on to the Irish consumer.  We will not be taken seriously as a low inflation economy if only adverse trends are immediately reflected in prices and beneficial effects are not reflected in the downturn.  This is one of the reasons we have this differential of 4 per cent between Irish and German interest rates. There is not widespread credibility that we have a low inflation economy, we are committed to low inflation, we are prepared to take the necessary steps to keep it low and to organise a free market competitive economy where the cartels, monopolies and vested interests do not gain when economic factors run in favour of the country at the expense of the consumer who should gain.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister and the Government well in their talks on the next pay round.  I presume the first joust will begin before the summer recess and that the main activity will be in the autumn.  Wage rises quickly impact on inflation figures and I hope the social partners will be able to conclude an agreement appropriate to present economic circumstances.</P>
    <P>If the above package of immediate measures to treat the symptom of rising interest rates and long term policy changes to reduce the differential between us and the West Germans is implemented, our interest rates could be cut or alternatively a further rise in German interest rates in July could be absorbed without an increase here.  In the absence of policy changes it seems quite <Col N="2392" /> clear from the statements of the Governor of the Central Bank that he will keep that differential at 4 per cent whether or not it is justified.  It is justified in his opinion and it will require policy changes to make him change his mind.</P>
    <P>Building society managers and bank managers are now openly speculating on the prospect of a credit squeeze.  A liquidity problem is emerging in the banks. Some building societies are contemplating reintroducing the restrictive criteria for lending which were common in the past &mdash; so much on deposit for a certain length of time, £2,000 for six months, £5,000 for a year, etc.  That mood is back in the building societies and they are speculating about it.  The banks are also talking about a liquidity problem. One of the main banks is refusing to fund new projects, not because of doubts about the validity of the project or the repayment capacity of the borrower but because they would have to borrow the necessary funds from the Dublin interbank market to fund the project, which they are not prepared to do.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance should reconsider his position on the second liquidity requirement on banks by the Central Bank.  I know this is something his Department proposes.  It is a very easy way of funding if the banking industry have to hold 25 per cent of their assets in Government paper.  When I raised this issue by way of Priority Question with the Minister for Finance he said the banks were holding more assets in Government paper than they were required to.  I accepted that at face value but when I inquired into the matter I was told that while the overall banking system may be holding more than the 25 per cent required and certain banks do not have a problem, some of the main banks are right up against the wire, they have a severe liquidity problem and are down to their 25 per cent of Government paper. Relief here would be of major benefit.  I do not believe the economy needs a credit squeeze at present as a matter of fiscal policy.  As a matter of fact I contend it would be quite damaging to our economy if there were a restriction imposed on <Col N="2393" /> credit, especially when that would arise from a liquidity problem within the banks rather than as a result of any policy instituted by the Central Bank or the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Yes, I made that point.  I agree fully with Deputy Taylor in that respect; in fact it is putting a brake on economic activity. The point I have now moved onto is that, on top of interest rates, there is an actual liquidity problem.  At present the banks are attracting a certain amount of savings as are the building societies and the insurance industry, the latter attracting many savings.  I do not know whether it is correct &mdash; no doubt the Minister has the relevant information &mdash; but I am informed that insurance companies are now attracting a disproportionate amount of savings and that, because they are insurance companies, are not in a position to lend.  This means they can invest their money where we know they will but they cannot lend it to their customers over the counter.  I understand there is now a shortage of savings in building societies and the banks.  It is emerging that there is a demand for credit.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank say they will confine the expansion of credit to 10 per cent this year &mdash; that they will have no problem with that &mdash; that they will back the banks up to that limit but, beyond that, they will be on their own.  The demand for credit is higher than that.  It is justified with the influx of Structural Funds, by the activity in our economy which does not need to be dampened down at this point by a credit squeeze.  I would hate to think that our economy would be damaged by a credit squeeze due purely to a lack of liquidity in the banks when the Minister has instruments of policy available to provide the necessary liquidity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After consideration with the Central Bank if the Minister does not favour a reduction in the secondary liquidity requirement he might examine the <Col N="2394" /> schemes introduced by his counterpart in the United Kingdom, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who introduced schemes specifically related to encouragement of savings.  It would be worth examining that possibility in coming months.  The banks and building societies are already being quite restrictive on the basis of picking and choosing between customers beyond what is due to considerations of repayment capacity.  I predict it will go beyond that point in the next two months or so when we could run into a very serious problem.  Perhaps the Minister would take up that point when replying.</P>
    <P>I have referred already to the complexity and length of this Finance Bill.  It adds to the mounting evidence that our tax code must be consolidated.  The Bill will add an additional 130 pages of tax law to an already very complex code. Consolidation is necessary and the Minister for Finance should begin that process immediately.  I know it constitutes an enormously difficult task but someone must begin somewhere some time.  It is now at the stage when most talented people are wasting their time simply trying to ascertain what is the law scattered across such a multiplicity of Acts. That does not take into account the hordes of other people wasting their talents and contribution to our economy in trying to identify further scams to benefit various people who are their customers and to whom the Minister referred also in the course of his introductory remarks.</P>
    <P>I will defer my detailed comments on the personal taxation provisions of the Bill until later.  The Minister does not appear to have an overall plan on tax reform.  Indeed, some of the measures introduced are contradictory.  Fine Gael proposed an all-party committee to the Minister's predecessor to examine the whole issue of tax reform.  We made a similar offer to the Minister but he and his Government rejected that offer.  I would suggest to the Minister now that the Commission on Taxation be reconstituted to re-examine the question.  Many of their recommendations have been implemented piecemeal over the years. <Col N="2395" /> The time has now come for another overview. I contend a reconstituted Commission on Taxation could undertake that task very quickly and report within, say, six months with a view to having their recommendations implemented in the next Finance Bill if that proposal were greeted with favour by the parties in this House.</P>
    <P>The Minister foreshadowed certain announcements on industrial policy in his Budget Statement and he spelled them out in greater detail today.  The latest proposals on corporation tax demonstrate some confusion with regard to industrial policy.  I presume the budgetary announcements in this respect have been watered down after much lobbying on the part of the IDA, SFADCo, the Department of Industry and Commerce and others, to the effect that projects negotiated on a certain basis should have the benefit of the case made in the first instance.</P>
    <P>The announcement to extend the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax to the year 2010 was made in the course of the Minister's press statement accompanying the Bill but was contained neither in the budget nor in the Finance Bill.  I am glad the Minister has decided to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to give this provision a statutory basis.  I believe the commitment to the continuation of the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax to the year 2000 was contained in the 1980 Finance Bill and has a statutory basis.  I thought it most peculiar that the Minister announced this latest provision by way of a press statement rather than in a section of the Bill.  However, I now note he will mend his hand on Committee Stage.  Certainly it shows the decision was not taken before the budget or indeed up to the publication of this Bill, that it has been a very recent one.  It appears to me to be a premature one.  The announcement has all the appearance of the Minister for Finance jumping the gun; whether jumping the gun on the issue or on his colleague in the Progressive Democrats I am not sure.</P>
    <P>If an extension is justified it should <Col N="2396" /> arise from an overall review of industrial policy.  I cannot see why the Department of Industry and Commerce are engaged in an overall view of industrial policy if the politically sexy bits are picked by the Minister for Finance, like currants from a cake and presented to the House before its introduction.  Certainly the Minister made no case for this extension in the course of his introductory remarks.  It appears to me to run counter and to be contradictory to a general trend of an increased take on the corporate tax side, the transference of the tax gain here to the personal side to reduce the rates. Now a heavy line has been drawn under the process.  Indeed one might well ask: when the section 84 relief is reduced somewhat further, when accelerated allowances disappear, what more will be left on the corporate side which can be removed in a subsequent Finance Bill to gain the kind of revenue necessary?</P>
    <P>One of the big problems involved here is the jump from the 10 per cent to the 40 per cent corporate tax rate.  For example, if one is sufficiently lucky to fall within the ambit of the Minister's new definition, one will pay tax at 10 per cent whereas if one is unlucky enough to be on the other side of the line and classed as a service industry rather than a manufacturing one, one will pay tax at 40 per cent.  Let us take the example of a small service industry with three fellows showing profits of, say, £100,000.  They will pay £40,000 in corporation tax.  They will then distribute £60,000 between the three of them &mdash; £20,000 each &mdash; and will be taxed at 53 per cent on that amount.  Is it any wonder there is unemployment in the country?  Nobody wants to get involved in any activity where the return is so meagre.  This also means that those involved endeavour to open every door, push out every window where there is any possibility of availing of a tax break or tax avoidance scheme.  The whole of the accountancy profession and tax experts, instead of advising people on how to run their companies efficiently and effectively, spend their entire time trying to find gaps through which to derive a coach and four.  The greatest <Col N="2397" /> example of that has been the unholy disgrace of the business expansion scheme in the months between Christmas and the beginning of the new tax year.  It is a pity.</P>
    <P>The entire corporation tax area warrants examination as a separate issue. Indeed the whole attitude to corporation tax, as an instrument of industrial policy, also needs to be examined in the context of industrial policy.  It seems to me that, in this case, that has not been done at all. The announcement was not contained in the budget or in the Finance Bill but rather is being introduced by way of amendment on Committee Stage. Obviously it was a decision taken off the top of the head within Cabinet.  Bearing in mind the narrowing of the focus of the scheme, the lobbying on the part of the interest groups, this amounted to throwing a fairly large bone to a dog that was getting upset.  I do not think it was considered in any proper fashion.</P>
    <P>I wonder what consultations the Minister had with the EC Commission on that issue because it appears to me that an extension of the 10 per cent regime runs counter to Commission policy.  I remember when in Industry and Commerce being involved in the preliminary negotiations on export sales relief to companies being raised from zero, not to 43 per cent but to 10 per cent.  It proved difficult enough to get the agreement of the Commission and I think it was the Minister who finally got their agreement for a rate of 10 per cent.  This required much toing and froing to Brussels at the time where we happened to have a Commissioner at the right place who did his best for us.  Against that background I cannot see how the Government can arbitrarily decide to extend the period during which the 10 per cent regime will apply from the year 2000 to the year 2010 without first holding lengthy consultations with the Commission.  It also seems to run counter to the proposals being made by Commissioner Schrivener on tax harmonisation. I have read some of her statements in which she has made it clear that one of the objectives of the Commission is to extend harmonisation not only to VAT and excise duties but also <Col N="2398" /> to corporation tax.  Her approach to tax harmonisation is to set a minimum rate, be it for VAT or excise duty, to dismantle borders and remove customs posts following which the forces of competition will force everybody to reduce their rates to the minimum rate.  At present the rate of VAT in Newry is 15 per cent while it is 23 per cent in Dundalk.  If we were to dismantle the economic border and customs posts the Government would have no choice but to reduce the rate to a figure as close as possible to 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>Commissioner Schrivener has made proposals on corporation tax along the same lines.  She has said that it is her objective to put in place a minimum corporate tax rate to which all member states would approximate.  Against that background and in that context it is difficult for me to understand how the Minister and the Government felt they were in a position without entering into consultations to make an announcement on the extension to the year 2010 of the period during which a particular regime will apply.</P>
    <P>One of the Minister's colleagues, Deputy Roche, said in a radio interview on this topic last Saturday that this is all in the future but I pointed out to him that the year 2010 is also in the future.  We are talking about decisions which will only have an effect on taxation between the year 2000 and 2010.  We know what the system is going to be to the year 2000 but it seems that this is a very peculiar decision and I would like the Minister to give us some idea of the thinking behind it.  Could it have something to do with the temporary little arrangement and is the Minister trying to be nice to the leader of the temporary little arrangement?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I would now like to deal with some specific provisions of the Bill which were not dealt with in any detail in the budget but rather <Col N="2399" /> merely suggested.  The Minister's proposal to restrict the business expansion scheme is a very belated response to difficulties which have been apparent since the middle of last year.  I think the Minister has wrecked the business expansion scheme and that it has now degenerated into a tax avoidance scheme.  Proposals absolutely in line with the intent of the scheme when initiated are now unable to attract funds.  It will prove very difficult to bring that scheme back as a mechanism for the provision of venture capital to people who are taking real risks in manufacturing industry.  I regret that over the last year and a half a very valuable scheme for the provision of venture capital to the industrial sector has been damaged and probably irreparably damaged. It is a pity, given that the Minister had the support of this House, that following the summer recess he did not introduce the provisions outlined in his statement of intent in August last rather than wait for the shambles to occur at the end of the tax year which places a question mark over the future of the business expansion scheme.</P>
      <P>The Minister has announced major restrictions in the application of the 10 per cent corporation tax rate.  He has listed activities which will no longer qualify for the 10 per cent rate and introduced a catch-all provision requiring a change of form which must take place before an activity can be described as manufacturing for the purposes of qualifying for the 10 per cent rate.  The activities which will no longer qualify are ill-defined. The provisions are of doubtful legality and could result in raising the prices of certain goods and in the loss of jobs.  I wonder if some of the activities which will continue to qualify have any greater merit than those which are being excluded.  I intend exploring these in greater detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech the Minister justified the insertion of these sections by saying that this marks a return to the original intent of the 10 per cent tax regime which was widened unnecessarily, not as a matter <Col N="2400" /> of policy but rather through the exploitation of the scheme in the courts by certain companies.  He stated that it was expanded by the courts.  Let us take the case of the tea blending industry which requires an enormous amount of expertise. This was always an activity which qualified for the 10 per cent rate.  It was not included following any court case but rather was there from the start.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the provisions will relate to the food industry and I would like the Minister to spell this out in greater detail.  It seems that he is including meat processing and has stated there was never any question of meat processing not qualifying.  He has written it in in case it could be caught by the exclusion provisions but what about food processing in general, such as the processing of vegetables and the preservation of peas and beans?  Are these in or out?  It seems the cutting up of meat and putting it into packs to be sold in supermarkets is a very valuable and necessary activity but the processing of food in other ways is also a valuable activity.</P>
    <P>I am not clear why certain activities are specified as being in and others are specified as being out.  There is a vast twilight zone where one is not clear whether an activity is in or out.  Let us take the case of small pork butchers around the country who used to make sausages and black puddings in the back kitchen.  That activity qualified for the 10 per cent tax rate but it will be excluded from now on.  It is also quite clear that the activities of the providers of hamburgers who incorporated the kitchen in one company with the sales outlet in another will be excluded because, as the Minister says, the food must be prepared in a manufacturing unit of some sort and not on the premises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am saying that you are in that respect but before I could cope with this matter on Committee Stage I seek clarification from the Minister on what he thinks is in and <Col N="2401" /> what is out.  If he fails to do this either in his reply to Second Stage or on Committee Stage the Bill will not have been signed one week before it is taken into the courts by somebody with case law following very quickly.</P>
      <P>I also doubt the legality of some of the provisions.  It is very difficult in law to make fish of one and flesh of another. If one activity is included and related activity, which is equally valid is excluded, it is a very pertinent image because the flesh would be in and as far as I can see the fish would be out.  I do not think this kind of arbitrary list will stand up in law.</P>
      <P>What does a change of form mean? Does one change the form of the product in blending tea or whiskey or in cutting up a sheep into gigot chops, side loin or centre loin chops to be put in vacuum packs and sent out to supermarkets?  One certainly changes the form when one boils an egg but is somebody involved in light assembly work changing the form of the product or are they simply putting all the pieces together with no change in form? There is an absolute minefield here and I would like far more clarification before I would accept even the principle of what the Minister is doing.</P>
      <P>The move to tax on a current year basis is a logical development from self-assessment. It was recommended by the Commission on Taxation and I am glad the Minister has introduced it in the Finance Bill.  The commission were aware that allowances which apply to PAYE workers should also apply to the self-employed when they are put on a current year basis.  The recommendation of the Commission on Taxation was two fold, to tax on a current year basis and give the same allowances.  There is a case now for schedule D taxpayers getting the £800 allowance and, if they pay full rate PRSI, for getting the £286 allowance as well.  If the Minister does not give this willingly some of them will test it to see if they are legally entitled to it under the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other things I want to refer to, many of which will be left until Committee Stage because I have very little <Col N="2402" /> time.  I would like to deal in detail with the whole attitude to tax reform and the Minister's provisions, and also with certain other aspects of the corporation tax. Before the Minister comes back here to reply, I would like him to reconsider his decision to index the thresholds on inheritance tax.  That does not go far enough.  The Minister should seriously consider raising the thresholds in this Finance Bill and continuing then with the indexation process.  They are cutting in at a point where it is very expensive to transfer a small shop or the family farm from father to son or daughter, because the thresholds are at a very low level. There are other anomalies that arise in regard to transfer that the Minister will be aware of and I would like him to look at those in particular.</P>
    <P>I would also like the Minister to give us far more information on the harmonisation process.  He says there will be a report to the EC soon to bring them up to date on the present position.  I would like a report to this House from the Minister because it seems that harmonisation has taken a back seat.  I know there are other happenings in Europe of far greater magnitude, but harmonisation was one of the commitments and I do not think the targets will be met now.  The move towards 1 January 1993 has been stalled and there will be a big falling behind now. I would like to thank the Minister again for his contribution.  It clarifies much.  I would, however, like far more clarification on the corporation tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister has introduced a new schedule of stamp duties for the transfer of property.  In particular, he has closed an avoidance loophole whereby people will not now be able to have separate contracts for the site and for the house which they build on the site.  The Minister has extended to 1 September the date of completion for any conveyancing transactions carried out before then.  Could the Minister look at the possibility of including some kind of provision to cover cases where for example, there are delays in the Land Registry office through no fault of the applicant or his solicitor.</P>

      <P>The 1990 Finance Bill is a flawed and dangerous document.  Preliminary examination of the Bill reveals a number of areas of major concern.  It is noteworthy that none of those areas have been highlighted in the Government's statement accompanying publication of the Bill.  For instance, the proposal to change the basis for self-assessment for the self-employed includes a provision which could turn into a once-off tax bonanza for many self-employed people. One year, namely, 1989-1990 will no longer be used as an assessment period. For many self-employed people this means that tax due this year will be assessed on income generated in 1988 and tax due in 1990 will be assessed on income generated in 1990.  There will be an incentive therefore for people to declare inflated incomes in respect of 1989 in order to minimise the income on which tax would be assessed in 1990.  The scope for abuse in this provision is enormous.</P>
      <P>Second, the tightening up of the BES scheme is modest and it only operates from today.  There is a strong case for a tax scheme which provides an incentive for people to invest savings in productive and risky enterprises but the BES scheme no longer functions to that end.  It is time the whole scheme was scrapped and that a new scheme was devised to maximise investment in truly productive enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, the decision of the Government to continue meat processing as manufacture of goods is inexplicable.  On the face of it, it will be seen by many as yet another device to continue handing over millions of pounds of taxpayers' <Col N="2404" /> money to the beef barons.  Whatever happened to the new get tough image of this Coalition Government?</P>
    <P>I intend to elaborate on all of these issues and on others that arise from our examination of the Bill in the course of these remarks.  It is necessary, however, to see this Bill in a particular context and against the background of the budget whose provisions it is intended to enact. There is every possibility now that we are facing into a period of sustained economic growth.  The recent medium term review published by the Economic and Social Research Institute heralded the possibility that within a few short years we will be making capital repayments on our debt rather than simply servicing the interest.  According to the Economic and Social Research Institute our economy could grow on average by 5 per cent a year for each of the next five years.  By 1991, on the basis of present revenue and spending policies, we would be taking in more in taxation than we have spent for the first time since the early seventies. This is a rosy picture.  Some would say it is much too optimistic, but even if we allow for a degree of optimism the likelihood is that our economy will grow.  The question that poses is, who will benefit from that growth?  The authors of the Economic and Social Research Institute review pose that question well.  They say the policy dilemma will be the reconciliation of the need for economic efficiency and the desirability of social equity.</P>
    <P>In the past the Labour Party has attempted to pose the same question over and over again.  We have, at all times, insisted that the management of our economy must be efficient and tough; but it must go hand in hand with a deep underlying commitment to the principles of social justice.  We have had economic growth in the past two and a half years; we have had more efficiency in the public service and throughout the economy &mdash; nobody can deny that.  It has, however, been built on the backs of 100,000 emigrants and a quarter of a million unemployed people.  It has been built on the backs of one million poor people.  It has <Col N="2405" /> been built at the cost of increasing inequality and disadvantage at every level of our society.  Side by side with the increasing efficiency of our economy we have witnessed in the past two and a half years an increasing polarisation in our society.  It is manifest in our two tier health system just as it is manifest in the virtual collapase in our public housing, the gradual elimination of free education and the dismantling of social welfare schemes.  A more efficient economy coupled with a more unjust and less equal society is what we have begun to create in the short lifetime of the last Dáil.</P>
    <P>Sadly, there is little evidence in anything we have seen so far that the issue of equality and justice will feature on this Government's agenda.  From what we have seen of the Programme for Government it is not a programme for Government at all but a recipe for ensuring that the spoils of office are grabbed by the few and held onto.  From the recent Kanturk declaration of the Minister for Finance we can deduce that what is uppermost in his mind is the need to assure the party faithful that he at least has not lost sight of Fianna Fáil's core values.  Not for him the weighty issue of how economic growth should be fairly managed; not for him the task of ensuring that those who are now marginalised in our society will be entitled to participate fully in the future.  His primary concern, indeed his only concern is the task of positioning himself to succeed his present leader by sniping in private at his Government partners.  For as long as this power struggle bubbles under the surface of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach is on record as saying that the major issue facing us in the context of growth is the question of ensuring that the growth is translated into jobs here in Ireland but what is he doing about it?  What review of industrial policy has been initiated since he took office?  The only views we have heard on the subject from the Taoiseach appear to rely totally on renewal of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> without spelling out the new and different elements that would make the programme meaningful to those who are unemployed.  The only views we have heard so far from the relevant Minister, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, appears to consist of suggestions that the buses should be privatised.  On every recent occasion that he has been asked to intervene in tragic situations where job losses have occurred or are threatened, his efforts have been entirely desultory and have usually been accompanied by plaintive bleatings about the importance of market forces being allowed to work their magic.</P>
      <P>A great deal of the growth that we have already seen and are likely to see is in very restricted areas.  There has been substantial growth in multinational profits and in profits in the financial services sector.  A great deal of this growth has already drained out of the economy.  It is clear from the warnings contained in the Economic and Social Research Institute report that they fear that a continuation of the policy of wealthy Irish companies of investing the bulk of their profits abroad will deny us the opportunity of benefiting from that growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noonan wonders why interest rates in this country remain so persistently high and so many percentage points above the West German level.  The question of what interest rates are is a matter of supply and demand.  What is keeping interest rates at their present level is a shortage of funds on the money markets.  Why is that?  It is because of <Col N="2407" /> the export of £2 billion of profits by the multinationals and the massive extent to which investment abroad by Irish companies has followed from the relaxation in exchange controls.  That is the reason money is in such short supply in this country and that is the reason we are in the remarkable position of having a relatively low inflation rate of 3 or 4 per cent while interest rates are running primarily at 12, 13, 14 or 15 per cent.  That is an unheard of gap between the interest rate level and the rate of inflation level.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the Government have no coherent industrial policy aimed at translating the growth we have had into wealth retained in Ireland and into jobs for Irish workers.  We need radical changes in industrial policy to secure the concept of value added in the Irish economy and to maximise investment in the Irish economy.  Without such changes our economic growth will continue to have more impact on job creation in America, Japan and Germany than it will here.  The experience of the Irish economy since independence has been the failure of job creation in Ireland.  That has been the central fact of Irish economic and social development.  Associated with this, apart from certain brief periods, we have had comparatively high levels of unemployment and unique levels of forced emigration by European standards.</P>
    <P>Is it not an appalling reflection on this Government to read the recent figures just published by the OECD and find that of all the countries covered by the OECD, Ireland tops the percentage level of people unemployed?  Likewise in the European Community we have the ignominious role of topping the percentage levels of people unemployed.  Is that something to be proud of?  Is that something that warrants the smug responses of the Minister for Finance and other Ministers about how well we are doing, how fine everything is, about jobs created and so on?  Of all the OECD countries, we top that level and that is an absolute and appalling disgrace and a reflection on the policies that have been tried and have been shown to be patent failures.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2408" /> For the last two years the Labour Party have been undertaking a fundamental reassessment of the type of policies necessary to confront fully this legacy of failure by our society.  We see it as our task to place on the agenda the goal of full employment as the fundamental objective of Government.  This needs to be demonstrated and expressed as a moral as well as a political commitment. Growth, competitiveness and job creation can and must be pursued in the context of Labour's vision of a humane, just and democratic economy.</P>
    <P>One of the most critical factors in ensuring long term economic growth and employment is a strong domestic industrial base.  It is a fact that no small country has achieved self-sustaining industrial growth and expansion in employment when it was based mainly on multinational investment from abroad.  The objective must be to retain value-added in Ireland.  That is not being achieved by the current strategy. All the current strategy has achieved is that a high proportion of value-added by overseas industry is repatriated as profits &mdash; as I have said, nearly £2 billion in 1988 &mdash; and that is dead money, money which is being generated here and is going to create jobs and wealth elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The key to creating wealth and jobs here is by retaining value-added in the economy.  To retain value-added in the economy we have proposed a number of factors: public ownership, part or whole, in the traded sector; public intervention by targeting grants and incentives to overcome the issue of firm size; tax reform through radical changes in the income, company and wealth tax codes, with far larger revenues from the company sector.  This approach is not in conflict with any obligations arising from the Single European Act and is applicable to both manufacturing and internationally traded services.  We recognise that strategic investment abroad by Irish firms will often be an essential part of the overall development.  One of our key proposals to build up native industry is to get the <Col N="2409" /> IDA to focus entirely on inward investment from abroad and to reorganise fundamentally the National Development Corporation as the major leader in the development of Irish industry.  We cannot hope to win the battle to retain value-added in Ireland and increase jobs if we sell our proven winners to foreigners.</P>
    <P>Another key proposal is that public sector commercial enterprises must be given independence to make commercial decisions and be compensated by the Government where they are required to retain non-viable enterprises for social or national reasons.  The reward package for top managers in the enterprises must be market-related and the link with public service pay and control by the Department of Finance must be broken.  The National Development Corporation should be allowed powers to raise up to £500 million of commercial capital for selective investment in expanding indigenous industry, with the transfer of the IDA grant budget for indigenous industry to them.</P>
    <P>In addition, Labour want public and private sector workers to have both an individual and a collective financial stake in their place of work and in the creation of new resources of wealth in the economy. We have already published detailed plans for the establishment of employee investment funds.  These plans would include tax relief in the form of deduction from taxable income of 125 per cent saved and contributed to a fund each year, a key promotional role for the trade unions, and the fund to be used for the expansion of existing public or private companies.</P>
    <P>We have also taken a view on the issue of privatisation, spelled out by the Leader of the Party in the budget debate, which is totally at variance with the anti-national and anti-public sector approach of this Coalition Government, an approach which is being debated and developed behind a large number of closed doors. It is impossible to make decisions about privatisation without deeply affecting the national interest, yet a great many of these decisions will be made without the <Col N="2410" /> slightest involvement of the public at large.</P>
    <P>A number of issues are involved in the privatisation debate.  It often seems to me that the public good is the last issue to be discussed on the agenda.  These issues must be addressed before any rational decisions can be made on this subject and certainly before the public can be assured that their interest is being served by a privatisation programme.  Listening to many of the commentators, one would almost believe there was no point in raising one's voice about this subject.</P>
    <P>A culture has been growing in the financial press and the pubs frequented by the business gurus to the effect that privatisation is the only sensible way to approach the issue of the development of State companies.  All right-thinking people, they proclaim, will readily agree that it is nonsense for the State to hold on to valuable assets when they could be offset against the national debt or sold in order to reduce taxation.  What these so-called independent experts never talk about is the large fee to be obtained by advising and consulting the State about these matters.  Ever since the good people in National City Brokers were paid more than £500,000 to advise the Government to sell Tara Mines to Outukumpu the fashion for consulting about privatisation has grown.  There are huge question marks as to why that fee was paid in the first place, especially when anyone with eyes to see could have told the Government that once the decision to sell had been made there was only one company that made any sense as a customer.</P>
    <P>Since then there have been consultancy reports on State companies generally including Irish Life, the Irish Sugar Company, the Great Southern Hotels Group and Irish Steel.  As far as we know, all those reports would say roughly the same things.  There are two reasons for that. No consultant worth his salt nowadays will say something which his paymasters do not want to hear.  Secondly, all these reports were prepared from the base of anti-public sector bias.  In the case of Irish Life, for instance, I understand that four options have been recommended but <Col N="2411" /> each one is a different method of privatisation. No serious examination was given to the possibility of developing Irish Life into a strong player on the European insurance scene as a native-owned Irish public company.  When are these reports to be published?  When are the policy holders in Irish Life to be consulted about their future, or the workers in Irish Steel, or the farmers who supply Irish Sugar, or the tourist industry generally about Great Southern Hotels?  When will the people as a whole be consulted on any of these issues?  If a consultant prepared a report, say, for Mr. Michael Smurfit and told him the only sensible way of dealing with his overdraft was to sell off all his most profitable business, I doubt if that consultant would ever work in Dublin again. That is what we the Irish people are being told and we are not being given an opportunity to express our views on all these consultants and their conventional wisdom.</P>
    <P>The argument has been bolstered of course by some public company managers who feel constrained by the influence of Government Departments and who long for the excitement of a private sector.  I have great sympathy for them in this dilemma and would argue strongly that when public sector control becomes public sector interference they have a case.  The way to deal with it is hardly to swap the control of a Government Department for the control of a German or French multinational.  If our public sector managers believe they will be better off in the private sector, many of them will have a rude awakening.  Over and above that, it was the spirit of public service in our public companies which was one of the mainsprings of our national economic development in the 1960s.  We cannot and should not allow that to be frittered away in dreams of private sector glory.</P>
    <P>On the subject of national development there is another side to this argument. How can our national interest be served by selling our insurance companies to the French, our steel industry to the Germans, the flagships of our tourist <Col N="2412" /> industry to the English, our sugar industry to the Americans or our aviation company to the Arab?  Surely future economic prosperity depends on the development of strong native-owned industries.  How could we be so blind as to sell to the highest bidder without any regard to where the future lies?  That is why I have described the blinkered approach to privatisation adopted by this coalition Government as essentially anti-national. I fully endorse the call by the Congress of Trade Unions for a White Paper on this subject which will set out all the arguments, not just the self-serving ones.  I would go further and assert that if any of these State companies are sold off without the people having been consulted the Government will have lost all sight of the need for accountability.  Irish State companies are the property of the people.  Our past and our future is bound up with those companies.  We are entitled to a say in what happens to them.  They are not the property of any Minister, consultant or entrepreneur.  They are ours and we demand to know what is going on before any final decisions are made.</P>
    <P>Poverty is one of the most scandalous and burning issues of our time in this, the twenty-third richest country in the world. There is a number of reasons the extent of poverty in Ireland is so great and has grown larger in the last few years, high unemployment, low pay, an increasing number of people in part-time or casual work, inadequate social support, charges for essential services such as health care, cutbacks in education and so on.  Perhaps the largest single cause is unemployment and we have already outlined a number of proposals in regard to that.</P>
    <P>In many other areas that have been mentioned, direct Government action is not only essential but possible in the short term.  Under the social charter for instance, our Government have accepted a moral obligation to ensure that part-time workers are no longer exploited. That will require legislation covering such items as pay, sick leave entitlements, protection against unfair dismissal and so on. There is also an obligation now on the <Col N="2413" /> Government to examine the whole issue of low pay and to legislate for a minimum wage.  There has been a great deal of publicity recently about the so-called poverty trap which results in some people on social welfare being better off than some people at work.  The right wing politicians and commentators always seem to draw the conclusion that the reason for this is because social welfare levels are too high.  The truth is that in all too many cases wage levels are too low but it is in the context of the budgetary process that the Government can do most to begin an attack on poverty in the short term.</P>
    <P>Last year the 1989 budget aimed to remove 24,000 low paid employees from the tax net but according to the Combat Poverty Agency and other reputable sources there are still families paying tax whose incomes are less than 60 per cent of the average industrial wage, in other words, very poor families.  In most cases the £10 or more which they pay in income tax is the reason they fall below the poverty line.  To take another example, it has been estimated that the cost of feeding, clothing and caring for a child varies from £19.60 per week for children under four years of age to £28.20 per week for children over the age of four years.  Almost 350,000 children in Ireland are being maintained by social welfare payments. The basic child dependant rate was £10 per week until the budget.  Is it any wonder that all too many of our children are under-nourished?  Child benefit which is intended to supplement these rates and to be an income for mothers has been frozen ever since Fianna Fáil returned to office or, to put it another way, it is being cut in real terms by about 15 per cent. The 1989 budget contained a welcome innovation in as much as it added an additional £200 per child to the exemption limits that applied to low paid workers.</P>

      <P>They are relevant to the finance of this nation and they are budgetary matters.  The purpose of the Finance Bill is to enact into law the impact of the budget.  These items are relevant and were touched on by the Minister in his speech.</P>
      <P>In the Labour Party pre-budget submission we estimated it would cost about £20 million in 1990 to increase that allowance for each child to £600 and the net result would be to remove 50,000 low income families from the tax net altogether. In addition, it would cost about £60 million to increase child benefit by 25 per cent and to pay an extra months benefit in September, a time when many families suffer the hardship of enormous additional child-related expenditure. These are not solutions to poverty.  That cannot be achieved by one or two isolated steps but only by a concentrated and integrated programme of activity which may take several years and which must be based on the twin principles which I mentioned earlier, economic efficiency coupled with social justice.  That would help many families who are suffering now to share in the benefits of the very considerable improvements in our financial situation the past few years of hardship have brought about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What was the Government's response in the budget?  They raised child dependant rates by about £1, increased the children's allowance by 19p per week and through various other measures <Col N="2415" /> exempted about 30,000 people from the tax net.  As was the case in 1989, the vast bulk of the relief granted in the budget, representing the beginning of an assault on poverty, will benefit the better off sections in our community.  In a nutshell the budget was a rich man's budget and that trend is continued in this Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>When the budget was published the Labour Party said that while many of the individual items in the budget 1990 were welcome, in overall terms it was a budget that tinkered with our many social problems rather than addressing them in any fundamental way.  There is nothing in the budget that seriously attempts to address the unemployment and emigration cancers that affect us and not nearly enough to address the growing crisis in health. The crisis in our health services generally has been almost totally ignored.  There is nothing here to shorten waiting lists, to reopen the acute beds that are urgently needed or to employ doctors and nurses. On income tax it is surely typical of a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat coalition that it would offer more to the highest paid taxpayers in our country than to the lowest paid.  The combination of measures outlined today will ensure a disproportionate benefit to those on the highest income.</P>
    <P>Many of the measures applicable to low pay will have effects that are more cosmetic than real.  Child benefit is increased for the first time since 1986 but continues to lag well behind inflation.  In general, the provisions in this budget for children show that the Government have not studied the evidence available that shows that the cost of nurturing children is almost twice what the Government are providing.  In this context an increase of 19p per week in child benefit can only be described as a cynical gesture, especially when set beside the continuing favourable treatment for companies and profits. Few people, apart from the very well paid will see significant improvements in their living standards when all these factors are taken into account.  There is nothing in <Col N="2416" /> this budget to deal with the growing housing crisis, nothing to alleviate overcrowding in the classrooms.</P>
    <P>I see no reason to change our judgment now.  The reality is that our economy needs fundamental reform in order to bring justice and equity to our society. The task of reform holds no interest for the parties now in Government. Nowhere is that lack of concern more evident than in regard to the housing crisis which is growing daily and which is increasingly at the core of family poverty in Ireland.  In the week Willie Bermingham died there is a tragic irony in the fact that this Government's appalling provision for housing should need to be raised in a debate of this kind.  A fiercely independent and caring man, Willie Bermingham devoted the last years of his life to highlighting the plight of old people living alone and helping them to find the dignity that old age deserves.  The organisation which he founded, ALONE, was more than a charity, it was also a political pressure group in the best sense of that word.  He used that organisation to help individuals and to prick the conscience of the community.  Willie Bermingham would not particularly welcome any fine words from politicians, what he would want instead is to be remembered and for the work of ALONE to continue. Indeed, his hope was that some day an organisation such as ALONE would no longer be necessary as the community would have accepted the responsibility of ensuring that its old people lived in security, comfort and dignity.  Unfortunately, the work he wanted to see made redundant will be necessary as long as we have a Government in Ireland who do not even recognise the need to provide public housing.</P>
    <P>Pádraig Flynn's and Mary Harney's allocation for housing in next year's Estimates is a fraud.  They provided money in two ways.  The first allocation is £6 million from the State to enable local authorities to build houses.  That will build between 250 and 300 local authority houses in the whole of Ireland.  They have also said that the local authorities can build up to £45 million worth of houses <Col N="2417" /> next year provided they raise the money themselves.  How are they supposed to do that?  They will have to do it by selling the houses they already own to sitting tenants. On average each local authority house will yield somewhere from £12,000 to £15,000 but in Dublin, for instance, it will cost the corporation about £50,000 to replace that house.  This means in effect that every local authority will have to sell three houses to build one.  That might be all right if there were a glut of local authority houses but the opposite is the case.  There are now 25,000 individuals and families on waiting lists all around the country, 5,000 of them in Dublin alone.  A year ago there were 20,000 on the waiting lists, and a year from now no more than 500 or 600 at best will have been accommodated.</P>
    <P>The real scandal in all this is that the Government are hoping emigration will solve the problem.  Waiting lists would be even bigger if so many young couples had not left Ireland.  While the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Coalition Government wait in hope that the rest of this social problem will be driven away, hundreds of families in every town in Ireland are living in overcrowded conditions and losing hope day by day of ever getting decent accommodation.</P>
    <P>Side by side with this problem is the increasing ghettoisation of many urban areas.  There are parts of our major cities now with 75 per cent unemployment and all its attendant social problems.  One of the main reasons is that tenants in these areas who have jobs have simply moved away, tired of coping with bad planning, lack of amenities, high crime and all the other evils that go hand in hand with deprivation and the collapse of community spirit.</P>
    <P>In the sixties housing was a major political issue.  It will be again in the nineties and Pádraig Flynn and Mary Harney and their respective political parties will carry the blame.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister Deputy Flynn and the Minister of State Deputy Harney.  I want to say a few more words about some of the issues in this Bill.  No doubt when we get to Committee Stage there will be opportunities to elaborate on these issues in greater detail, but I must advise the Minister strongly that his provision for self assessment by the self employed will have to be brought back to the drawing board, I have already pointed out that the proposal to change the basis for self assessment for the self-employed includes a provision which could turn into a once off bonanza for many self-employed people.  As I said, one year, 1989-90, is no longer going to be used as an assessment period for many self-employed people.  This means tax due this year will be assessed on income generated in 1988 and tax due in 1990 will be assessed on income generated in 1990.  Therefore, there will be an incentive for some people to declare inflated incomes in respect of 1989 in order to minimise the income on which tax will be assessed in 1990.  The scope for abuse in this provision is enormous. I know the Revenue Commissioners will be alert to the possibility of this loophole being used on a significant scale, but we all know the Revenue Commissioners do not have the resources or powers to police these new provisions effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage we will be arguing that without new powers for tax inspectors, specifically the power to treat these situations in exactly the same way as at present the cessation of trading is dealt with, the provision simply will not work. Already many accounting firms are drawing up plans for seminars and leaflets to advise their clients on how the new method of self assessment can be used for transitional gain.  Without effective counter measures this will turn into a major mistake by this Government.  In addition most of the accountancy firms spent last week end heaving huge sighs <Col N="2419" /> off relief that the curbing of the Business Expansion Scheme has turned out to be largely cosmetic.  Many worthwhile endeavours have been started under that scheme but too many others have been used simply as risk free guarantee vehicles for tax avoidance.  It is essential, not only in the public interest but also in the interest of job creation, to get back to first principles in relation to this scheme.</P>
    <P>There is a strong case for a tax scheme which provides an incentive for people to invest savings in productive and risky enterprises but the BES no longer functions to that end.  It is time that scheme was scrapped and new schemes devised to maximise investment in truly productive enterprise.</P>
    <P>One of the features of this Bill is the relaxation of the Government's original intention to curb the use of section 84 lending.  That would be understandable if the banks were in trouble or were being asked to increase their contribution to the economy in some other way, but at a time when the two largest banks in the country continue to report huge increases in profits it is surely appropriate to reflect on the way they continue to fail to make a social contribution to the economy in which they thrived.  We know what the Government are prepared to do for the banks: give them further relief in this Bill from decisions already taken to phase out the advantages of section 84 lending. Clearly this is not a Government who expect a social contribution from the wealthiest companies in the economy.</P>
    <P>In the end of year Exchequer returns published last January we can see that the tax contribution from nearly all sectors has risen but that the contribution made by companies has fallen by about £30 million despite the fact that the profit repatriated by the multinational companies has reached the staggering figure of £2 billion.  Against that background how do the Government attempt to justify the decision, without any mandate, to extend the most favourable tax regime in the western world to the year 2010? One wonders who the Government consulted about that decision.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2420" /> As a result of this Bill it will be possible for the beef barons to continue to claim the 10 per cent manufacturing rate for processing meat.  Why should they be able to continue to avail of that high advantageous rate? What story are we not being told? Why do this Government insist on talking tough about the Larry Goodmans of this world yet still ensure they get every advantage that is possible to dish out behind the door?</P>
    <P>Submissions have been made to the Minister and other Deputies from the ICMSA regarding the treatment of farm families on the question of tax free allowances, particularly on the basis of treating all taxpayers in the PAYE system in the same way.  That also applies to employee relatives of self-employed persons.  The Labour Party support them in their representations and will be raising amendments on that issue on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In summary, there are too many aspects of this Bill which are dangerous and too much failure in the background of the Bill for us to be able to welcome it.  We will be opposing the Bill on Second Stage and making every effort on the later Stages to highlight its inadequacies further.  This Bill is a monument to a Government who have long ago decided to pay no heed to the poor and deprived. It amounts to a confession by this Government that they are prepared to continue to preside over a society which becomes more unequal and unjust by the day.  This Bill and the economic and fiscal policies behind it are yet another failed effort by a Coalition Government who have no imagination, no compassion and no sense of justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to share in the remarks that have been made concerning the Minister's presentation being helpful in the context of what is indeed a very long complex and, may I say, even tedious Bill.  I agree that the Departmental backup provided in the Minister's speech makes the purpose of the provisions of the Bill a lot clearer, even if I do not agree with some of them.  The Bill faithfully reflects the two great failures of the budget which I described at the time <Col N="2421" /> it was introduced as the failure to tackle any real structural tax reform and the failure to reduce the number of people out of work.  I am glad the Minister for Finance has returned to the Chamber because in his capacity as the great soother of the nation he has failed to use the Bill as an instrument of economic policy to encourage any real dent in the extent of the employment crisis.</P>
      <P>The Bill fairly reflects the complacency that is at the heart of the Minister's steady-as-she-goes policy by seeming to accept that high unemployment and emigration will in themselves remain instruments of economic policy in the Ireland of the nineties.  Certainly, one would never get the impression from reading the Bill, or listening to the Minister's presentation, that we have the worst emigration since the nadir of emigration in 1955 or that we have virtually the highest unemployment in the European Community. Indeed, the Taoiseach seemed to communicate the same damning complacency in the television interview he gave in the aftermath of the recent Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis.  In the course of that interview he conceded that it was puzzling, and disappointing, that the jobs were not coming onstream as they were supposed to in the new climate.  He said that economists told him that if there was a repeat of about 3 per cent growth over a few years the jobs would come.  That represents the politics of self-delusion. The economists of that climatology school ought to know by now that getting the climate right will not by itself produce more jobs.  Private enterprise is motivated by profit and if extra jobs materialise that is a bonus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, who was previously Minister for Industry and Commerce, has ignored the fact that Irish industrial policy is a costly failure.  It has not brought a greater degree of industrial employment, not to mention full employment. It has not encouraged or increased the disposition on the part of Irish firms to export or, amongst indigenous exporters, to diversify overseas sales to a signficant degree away from the United Kingdom. Our industrial policy, and the Minister's <Col N="2422" /> approach, has been dealt with at some length in the contributions so far.  It is difficult to put the Finance Bill we would all like before the House if we do not manage to generate and create more wealth in the economy.  Having 250,000 people unemployed is an enormous burden on the declining number at work and unless more people are put back to work the wealth cannot be generated to support the services we would like to see.</P>
    <P>Policymakers in the Minister's Department, in the Department of Industry and Commerce and, I suspect, in the Department of the Taoiseach are fully aware of the extent of the failure of current industrial policy.  I await with great interest the publication of Mr. Frank Roche's report for the Department of Industry and Commerce which the Minister for Finance properly commissioned when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce.  That report concerns industrial performance.  My understanding is that the report identifies the extensive shortcomings of our industrial policy and makes specific recommendations.  It is the comprehensive nature of the indictment of existing industrial strategy that has caused the panic at the heart of Government about its implications for the future. Beyond acceding to the IDA's request to extend the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax to the year 2010 the Minister has largely chosen to ignore the opportunity presented to him in the preparation of the Finance Bill to refocus industrial policy. Our industrial policy is so bad against the background of all the favourable indicators that we have heard trotted out by Minister after Minister over three years that steady-as-she-goes down the tubes would be a more accurate comment on their philosophy.  Steady-as-she-goes down the tubes will continue to be the Minister's maxim if he does not frankly admit the extent of failed industrial policies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan asked how this decision to extend the 10 per cent rate to the year 2010 emerged when the dogs in the street were aware that industrial policy was the subject of major discussion, debate, argument and difference <Col N="2423" /> within a number of Departments.  I do not wish to reopen the political question Deputy Noonan raised about whether this reflects a difference in approach between the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance. However, the fact remains that it is extraordinary when there now seems to be a consensus that existing industrial strategy has failed, and failed miserably, when a number of experts are advising on this matter, and when the triennial report is due to be published soon, that the Minister ought to have proceeded before the conclusions of the study were published and included this provision in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is not long since the Taoiseach answered a question by me on this point. The Taoiseach said he regarded the review as a major one as far as our industrial policy was concerned.  He said he had now come around to concurring with the Minister for Labour that the jobs were not coming on stream or that major private employers were not showing returns in any commensurate fashion for the favourable climate that had been created for them.  As a result, the jobs are not coming.  When the Minister for Labour expressed his frustration initially concerning the performance of the leading private companies, the Taoiseach's secretary was wheeled out to a meeting of the Federation of Irish Employers to reassure them that this was not really the view and that they were doing a very fine job.  I was glad to see in a frank interview after the Ard-Fheis that the Taoiseach admitted that the jobs are not coming on stream.  What depresses me is his statement that he is now advised by the same economists that if there is a repeat growth rate of the order of 3 per cent for three or four more years sequentially the jobs will come.</P>
    <P>The jobs will not come.  Private enterprise is there to make a profit; if it creates jobs it is fortuitous and everybody will welcome that.  A rechannelling of money that goes towards industrial policy will have to feature in any review of industrial policy.  I should like to indicate in this regard the extent of the cost to the <Col N="2424" /> Exchequer of the reliefs and allowances that we make currently to industry.  In reply to a Parliamentary Question on 22 November it was stated by the Minister for Finance &mdash; I think it was the Minister for Finance, perhaps it was the Minister for Industry and Commerce &mdash; that the cost to the Exchequer of the export sales relief was £729.2 million, the Shannon relief scheme cost £116 million, manufacturing profits were reduced by 10 per cent, costing £131.4 million taking in accelerated allowances and so on, giving a total of £1,186.2 million.  That is a lot of money and the time has come to examine whether we are getting value for that money.  I say that we are not and it is premature to advance &mdash; as the Minister has &mdash; the extension of the 10 per cent rate to the year 2010 without first having an opportunity to look at the comprehensive set of proposals which, I hope will emerge from the current review.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that in the eighties the figures for industrial output have been taken out of context. Taken in isolation they are correct.  There has been a fantastic increase in industrial output and in productivity and the same applied to the balance of trade.  In the eighties industrial output expanded by 50 per cent while industrial employment over the same period went down by one-fifth or 20 per cent.  That is the kind of relationship which has us all at sixes and sevens.  The climate that private entrepreneurs asked for has surely been created.  I know that interest rates have started to get out of hand again but we have had unprecedented pay moderation and reasonable inflation for the past three years.  Workforce productivity and output has been unprecedented in the last 20 years and yet the jobs are not coming on stream.</P>
    <P>This Coalition Government and the last Coalition Government have not grasped the nettle of tax reform.  Last January was the tenth anniversary of the unprecedented tax marches which brought 750,000 people on to the streets of the cities and towns looking for tax reform.  Ten years later the tax system has got more complicated and unjust. The Minister will say that he has given so <Col N="2425" /> much in tax relief.  I agree that he has given tax improvements but not tax reform.  The Fianna Fáil Government's initial response was to set up the Commission on Taxation which Deputy Noonan suggested might now be reconstituted to report on the up-to-date situation within a short period.  The Commission on Taxation published five excellent reports.  I am not saying that The Workers' Party agree with everything in each of these reports but internationally they have been accepted as the basis of a more equitable tax code and would also encourage industry.</P>
    <P>One of the fundamental tenets underlying the philosophy of the Commission on Taxation was that there should be no expansion but rather a retraction of exemptions and allowances.  Governments have constantly gone against this and indeed the 1990 Finance Bill extends the exemptions.  Worse still, it extends them for those who can best afford to pay their fair share of tax.</P>
    <P>Last week <i>The Irish Times</i> revealed that the average industrial worker on PAYE is no better or no worse off now than he or she was ten years ago at the time of the great tax marches to which I referred.  Therefore, as far as the PAYE worker is concerned there has been no tax reform and there is a hell of a difference between tax improvements and tax reform.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote two brief paragraphs from <i>The Irish Times</i> of 16 April 1990:</P>
    <P>People on the average industrial wage have entered the first year of the decade with no gains in take-home pay compared with people in corresponding earnings brackets ten years ago, an analysis of wage rates, income tax and inflation during the period shows.</P>
    <P>That the take-home pay of those on the average industrial wage has remained virtually unchanged after a decade suggest that the chances of achieving substantial gains from changes in the tax system are low in the long run.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2426" /> The cost of living doubled during the decade, eroding the value of most pay increases.  While the average industrial wage before tax rose by about 10 per cent in purchasing power, this gain was eaten up by rises in income tax and PRSI deductions.</P>
    <P>Indeed, a married head of household with a dependent spouse and two children, and earning the average industrial wage of £11,000 per annum can expect to take home £162 per week at present compared with £164 per week (at 1990 values) ten years ago, when the average wage was £5,000 a year.</P>
    <P>I argue that there cannot be tax reform when the barrage of exemptions and allowances to the business sector, self-employed and large farmers have been continuously expanded.  In the run-up to the last two budgets it was widely expected by all commentators &mdash; particularly by business magazines &mdash; that there would be a considerable tightening up of exemptions and allowances to the corporate sector.  This has not happened although the Bill contains changes that were not presaged at the time of the budget.  Export sales relief or the total exemption of taxation on profits derived from exports ended this month but only because the EC demanded that it should. I believe &mdash; although I have seen the figures projected by the IDA &mdash; that in the present calendar year there will only be a minimal accrual from that measure.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to specific sections of the Finance Bill which deserve comment. The Government have failed to introduce tax credits which would have been more equitable.  While the Government introduced a new exemption for extremely low paid workers they should have done the proper thing and exempted PRSI up to the point of personal income tax allowance and converted these into tax credits.  I made the point during the budget debate that the Minister's statement that 31,000 low paid workers would be taken out of the tax net altogether was not valid for longer than it took the Minister to read out the budget speech. The facts are that between the impact of <Col N="2427" /> fiscal drag, inflation and wage increases a number of those people have already found themselves back in the tax net.</P>
    <P>In addition, the PAYE allowance should have been at least doubled because these people have no opportunity to fiddle their taxes as many self-employed and corporate interests do, and will continue to do.  The PRSI allowance has not been raised for many years. I do not know why the Minister will not take this on board; he probably knows my party have some connection with the origin of this allowance but it is now lower than it was originally.  While the Government cut the top and standard rates of tax it should be pointed out that this is of greater benefit to the higher paid and in any event does not constitute tax reform.  The Government do not appear to be concerned with tax justice.</P>
    <P>After the budget and in advance of the publication of the Finance Bill, The Workers' Party published a five point programme against tax evasion calling on the Minister for Finance to use the opportunity of the Finance Bill to launch a major offensive against those who fail to pay their fair share of taxation.  All of us in this House claim to regard abuse of the tax system through evasion, avoidance or non-payment as a social crime. Yet the success of the tax amnesty establishes beyond doubt the frequency and magnitude of this offence against society. Expert advice has assured me that notwithstanding the tax amnesty the problem continues to exist.  One pound cheated by the tax dodger is £1 extra on the PAYE workers' bill.  Those who refuse to pay their fair share of tax cheat the old age pensioner, the young child, the hospital patient and the unemployed. If the five point programme we have published is taken on board I believe it would, as a minimum, stimulate a serious and informed debate on tax evasion.</P>
    <P>During my contribution on the budget debate I referred to our submission, which contains 31 proposals under the heading of tax reform in advance of the budget.  Few of these proposals were taken on board.  I do not want to take up <Col N="2428" /> the time of the House now going over those 31 proposals, but obviously the Finance Bill deals in a major way with the whole question of taxation.  Taxation is a fundamentally important issue in this economy and society.  While people in the PAYE bracket are bearing the lion's burden of taxation and the people who own wealth in our society are paying an army of professionals to find loopholes so that they can evade or avoid paying their tax, this major issue must remain on the political agenda and must be tackled. For that reason I will dwell on it for a moment.</P>
    <P>In our five point programme we set out the significance of tax evasion.  A tax evader is someone who fails to submit a return to the Revenue Commissioners for any tax showing the full liability to tax. This applies most often in relation to PAYE, VAT and income tax.  The staff of the Revenue Commissioners inspect any returns submitted to them.  In the case of PAYE and VAT returns this involves a visit to business premises to inspect the records and to seek to ensure that the returns are complete.  During a recent year, £69 million in VAT under-payments and £32 million in PAYE underpayments were discovered on such visits to a relatively small number of businesses. The inspection of returns for income tax in the tax inspectors office has up to now been ineffective in detecting evasion.</P>

      <P>Under self-assessment the Revenue Commissioners have instituted a system of field visits involving an indepth examination of the business at the place where it is carried out. However, this will apply only in a very small proportion of cases and the other returns will be accepted without question. The proportion of income tax reforms selected for audit by the inspectors must, therefore, be high enough to pose a realistic deterrent to tax evasion by the understatement of income.  We recommend, therefore, that there should be a statutory minimum level of inspection of returns.  Obviously the place to enshrine this provision is in the Finance Bill.  For example, in the case of income tax, VAT or PAYE 10 per cent of businesses should be visited at least once every three years.</P>
      <P>The Workers' Party are also concerned at the attitude taken by the Revenue Commissioners to evasion when it is discovered in PAYE, VAT and income tax. They seem content to take the corrected liability for the one year being examined and if the business can sustain it may reopen a number of earlier years.  On top of the tax they seek a level of interest which is derisory compared with the interest on penalties due under the tax law.  No serious effort is being made to deter tax evasion by the majority on the application of the full rigours of the law to those who are caught evading tax.  This is because the Revenue Commissioners have discretion to waive interest and penalties in part or in full.  Restriction of the discretion of the Revenue Commissioners to waive interest on penalties to ensure a minimum payment of 50 per cent in addition to the tax due where evasion is detected is necessary. The Minister may well say that this would have the effect of putting some companies out of business.  That would not be the purpose of it and presumably the Revenue Commissioners could exercise their discretion in that kind of situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners recover interest and penalties either by an agreed settlement or by taking civil proceedings in the courts.  This latter system is very <Col N="2430" /> inefficient and we propose to improve it by staffing the Revenue Commissioners solicitor's office and by the creation of courts which would deal exclusively with cases brought by the Revenue Commissioners. However, the taking of a criminal prosecution which could lead to a jail sentence is rarely, if ever, taken and the prospect of anyone going to jail, unlike the case in Britain for the crime of tax evasion, remains remote.  We recommend that there should be a legal obligation to take a criminal prosecution in any case where the tax involved exceeds £100,000.</P>
    <P>Workers generally do not have the opportunity to engage in tax evasion because of the PAYE system.  However, many workers are being driven into the self-employed sector by employers who change their contracts of employment so that they become sub-contractors.  This makes it possible for the workers concerned to operate within the black economy, evading tax and PRSI, possibly fraudulently claiming social welfare support as well.  The fact that payments to such sub-contractors are often pitched at a low level by employers &mdash; in the knowledge that a living income will be obtained only by not paying tax or PRSI and by claiming social welfare as well &mdash; results in lower labour costs to the employer who then competes unfairly with employers operating legally, in addition to the removal or negation of workers' protection legislation.  We recommend amendment of the tax law to ensure that such sub-contractors are treated as employees and are not excluded from the PAYE-PRSI system.</P>
    <P>Tax evasion is a serious, prevalent crime against the community.  Those who pooh poohed this in the past must have changed their view when they saw the returns from the tax amnesty campaign. The Workers' Party are concerned to eliminate this strain on the largely PAYE-funded public finances.  The recommendation in this submission will be of assistance to the Revenue Commissioners in tackling tax evasion. However, all the legislation in the world will not prevent evasion. Legislation must <Col N="2431" /> be effectively implemented by adequate levels of Revenue staff.  Additional resources must be made available to the Revenue Commissioners to be used specifically for tax evasion work.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill would seem to confirm there is little political will on the part of the Government to tackle fundamental tax reform or even seriously minimise evasion and/or avoidance.  I am advised there has been a reduction of something of the order of 600 in the staff of the Revenue Commissioners since 1981.  The general secretary of the Irish Tax Officials' Union told the annual conference of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions last summer that effectively the self-employed were being given an opportunity to write their tax bills.  I welcome the provisions of this Bill for the self-employed to be taxed on a current year basis.  I also welcome some of the other minimum measures designed to close some of the loopholes for tax avoidance, the limited measures to extract some additional revenue through restricting the terms of reference of the business expansion scheme and limit section 84 lending, by redefining what is involved in the process of manufacturing.  However, these are limited, minimalist, when set against the background of the scale of the problem I have just outlined.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Taylor.  Belatedly the self-employed are being taxed on a current year basis and it is regrettable that is should have been done &mdash; and I say this with the utmost respect to the Minister &mdash; by this sleight-of-hand, demanding very little creative accounting ingenuity to ensure that the scope for abuse is reduced.  It is my understanding that up to 5 April 1990 it is possible for a self-employed person to have his or her tax returns compiled on the basis of their income of the previous year whereas the earnings of the self-employed for 1990-91 onwards will have to be returned on a current year basis.  It does not require too much ingenuity to envisage how that loophole will be exploited in terms of returns made to the Revenue Commissioners. I look forward to hearing <Col N="2432" /> from the Minister on Committee Stage how it is proposed to police this measure in order to avoid this, albeit once-off, scope for abuse inherent in the manner in which it is being suggested.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned the provisions of section 6 are no more than a ruse to extend relief to the wealthiest section of the farming community.  In the absence of real tax reform I see no justification for supporting positive discrimination in favour of those with substantial productive assets.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party are extremely disappointed the Minister did not avail of the opportunity &mdash; as had been expected by many within the business community &mdash; to completely revise the so-called business expansion scheme as it relates to tourism.  It is quite clear there has been a lot of abuse in this area.  We had the scandal of the holiday homes in the middle of Dublin 4, moderate compared with the abuses we have seen in recent months.  Tens of millions of pounds have been poured into these schemes which are of benefit to the higher paid income group.  These people can write off up to £25,000 a year from their investments in these schemes which have been guaranteed and are virtually risk-free notwithstanding what was in the minds of the people who formulated that measure as a vehicle for risk capital being channelled to the manufacturing, wealth-creating sector of our economy.  In parliamentary questions to the Minister on the numbers of jobs created by these schemes so far he has been unable to give any precise information.  It can be argued &mdash; though I am not sure I could accept the argument &mdash; that the schemes are of help to manufacturing.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking I believe &mdash; and I have given some figures already &mdash; there is sufficient assistance given to manufacturing every year, of the order of £500 million in tax breaks and subsidies, so that this scheme is merely more cream for those who can avail of those tax breaks. Belatedly the Minister is outlawing schemes where there is no risk to investors. Why that is being done from 5 April 1990 only is incomprehensible.  It is time <Col N="2433" /> the Minister considered abolishing this scheme altogether.  The number of jobs created has been minimal.  The building industry is booming and does not need these risk-free hotel projects. Its provisions seem to benefit the very wealthy only.</P>
    <P>Neither Deputy Noonan nor Deputy Taylor referred to section 8.  I am surprised because I have had aggressive representations already concerning the proposal contained therein which, as I understand it, sets out to increase the liability to taxation of PAYE workers on any lump sum on retirement or on termination of employment.  That is the only occasion in the working life of somebody in the PAYE system when they can look forward to a lump sum, within certain terms, not attracting further taxation. In other words, when one retires I think one is at present entitled to the equivalent of one and a half years' salary without attracting tax liability.  As I understand it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Minister is saying in the case of retirement, where there is an entitlement of certain years' salary, it does not interfere with that <Col N="2434" /> entitlement but that it would interfere in the kinds of circumstances we have witnessed so frequently in the 1980s of redundancies, of companies shaking out workers in order to introduce technology or whatever, when substantial payments were made in compensation for loss of employment.  From my reading of the Bill I am quite certain that such lump sums at a certain threshold will now attract a tax liability that did not exist heretofore. If the Minister can assure me on that, I can assure him, in turn, there will be a great number of people very pleased to hear it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, I will.  If my understanding is correct it is my intention to table amendments on Committee Stage.  I would ask the Minister to have a re-think, that this cannot constitute an area of significant abuse.  I cannot understand why somebody who has worked their lifetime and paid tax should be subjected to tax a second time on their lump sum.  Secondly, I cannot understand why somebody finding themselves out of work or redundant should be subjected to tax on any compensation involved.  It is not fair that such payments should attract a tax liability at a threshold that did not obtain heretofore.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I look forward to hearing from the Minister on that.  I am talking as a trade union official although I know there is a theological argument about whether I remain one.  I am talking as a trade union official who negotiated settlements I do not believe were exorbitant or were abused.  I contend it is <Col N="2435" /> unfair that such payments should be subject to this penalty; that is as I read it.  I take some comfort from what the Minister is hinting at, if I read it correctly.</P>
      <P>On Chapter II, I have already dealt with the question of the self-employed being assessed on a current year basis. Apart from the caveat I entered, I welcome this measure.  Turning to Chapter III, I would like to look at sections 25 and 26 and ask the Minister to tell us, given the building boom in Ireland, if he is overheating the economy and acting in a counter cyclical manner in extending the period during which urban renewal reliefs will apply to 1993?  Can the Minister explain the reason for this?  The section on taxation evasion, section 27, is to be welcomed but, again, I would like to point out that all of these exemptions for the money classes lead to loopholes.  As sure as the Minister closes this loophole some clever accountant, whose patriotism is measured by how well he serves his wealthy clients rather than by how well he serves the State, will come up with a new loophole.</P>
      <P>I also welcome section 29 which attempts to plug a loophole.  It relates to the so-called Disneyland scheme to which the Minister referred last summer.  I would like the Minister to quantify if he can, how many millions have been lost through the abuse by essentially rich people of the Shannon export sales and business expansion schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Chapter IV, section 32 reduces the rate of corporation tax from 43 per cent to 40 per cent.  While this section must be read with sections 59 and 70 which reduce capital allowances, I would like to take this opportunity to say that these nominal rates of tax are just that &mdash; nominal &mdash; and that the average rate of tax paid by companies in Ireland is less than 10 per cent and declining.  The rate of corporation tax in 1988 was 50 per cent but this has been progressively reduced. What The Workers' Party would like to see is an effective rate of tax of 20 per cent on all non-manufacturing companies and an effective rate of 10 per cent on the manufacturing sector.  In plain <Col N="2436" /> English we would like to see companies pay tax on between 10 per cent and 20 per cent of their profits depending on what line of business they are in.  This would save a lot of time for tax inspectors, accountants and everyone else.</P>
    <P>Section 33 contains the promised definition of manufacturing relief. Banana ripening etc. will not qualify from now on.</P>
    <P>Why did the Minister not define manufacturing some years ago when it became clear the spirit of the law was being broken? I intend to return on Committee Stage to the point I made on meat processing.</P>
    <P>Section 36 extends section 84 loans.  I would like to point out that section 84 was introduced as a counter-avoidance measure to outlaw directors' loans.  There was never any intention to use it to provide subsidies to the industrial sector.  I would also like to point out that during 1987-88 section 84 loans cost the Exchequer a staggering £95 million.  This is outrageous.  According to the section it appears the Government are going to allow loans up to a limit of £170 million. This is also outrageous.  Each year the IDA give out over £100 million in grants to companies.  Given these tax avoidance measures which are supported by the Government, we do not know what is happening.  We are greatly disappointed that the Minister did not see fit to abolish section 84 loans.  It must be remembered that along with industry the major beneficiaries of these loans are the banks who made profits of over £400 million last year and paid virtually no tax largely because loopholes such as the one in section 84 exist.  We also believe that building societies and the trustee savings banks should be taxed on the same basis as other companies and it is a myth that either are acting in the best interest of their members as both are run by selfperpetuating oligarchies.  The Workers' Party welcome Chapter VII which deals with offshore funds but, again, we hope such complicated legislation will not be found to be full of loopholes by the very vigilant accountancy profession.  We also welcome the measures which reduce <Col N="2437" /> capital allowances.  I note that accelerated allowances cost the Exchequer over £100 million in 1987-88 and it would not be untrue to say that many companies over-invest in capital equipment because of the existence of these allowances. Indeed, in regard to those areas outside manufacturing, it appears that capital allowances are far too generous as can be seen by the constant upgrading of public houses and other non-productive areas. In relation to section 89, The Workers' Party oppose the continuation of unrestricted accelerated capital allowances for the Custom House Docks area and Shannon airport.  In 1987-88 Shannon airport relief cost the Exchequer £116 million. We have yet to find out what the Exchequer is going to give by way of tax subsidies to the Custom House Docks area.  It seems ironic that the most profitable institutions in the State &mdash; the financial services sector &mdash; should get special tax deals.</P>

      <P>I should preface my remarks by saying that times have certainly changed.  Deputy Noonan, the main Opposition spokesman, acknowledged that inflation is spiralling down-wards. Deputy Taylor wondered how the fruits of this marvellous growth would be distributed in society while Deputy Rabbitte welcomed what he described as the building boom.  This is in stark <Col N="2438" /> contrast to the position which obtained a few short years ago.</P>
      <P>We are all aware that the last Fine Gael-Labour Government doubled the national debt, that there was a feeling of hopelessness and helplessness not just in the economy generally but among the young and their parents who watched emigration and unemployment figures go through the roof.  Yes, times have changed but this is not to say that everything in the garden is rosy or, that we are now in an idyllic position but it would be fair to say that we have advanced considerably from the misery that was being experienced up to the time Fianna Fáil came to power as a minority government in February 1987.</P>
      <P>Many critics of the Government argue for quicker movement in the area of taxation. This is but a pipedream.  The progress which has been made to date is significant, not least in this Finance Bill. The reduction in the standard rate of income tax to 30 per cent and the reduction in the top rate to 53 per cent are further advances that have been sought for several years in the reform of the taxation system.  This Government and the previous one are the only Governments to have made signficant progress in this regard in recent years. The reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax to 40 per cent will be of benefit in terms of job creation in the services sector.</P>
      <P>The extension of the period to the year 2010 during which the 10 per cent rate for manufacturing will apply is to be welcomed as also is the extension to 1993 of the period during which the urban renewal package will apply.  We welcome, too, the reduction in the standard rate of VAT, the changes in stamp duties to further encourage the development of the financial services sector, the abolition of the 60 per cent rate of capital gains tax and the indexation of capital acquisitions tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noonan said something startling this evening.  He indicated his disappointment that the number of package holidays being taken were down saying that it reflected a slowing of growth in the <Col N="2439" /> economy.  As late as yesterday evening I was reading a magazine printed by Irish Rail which boasted that over the last number of years there was tremendous growth in the domestic holiday market so far as Irish holidaymakers were concerned. The number of package holidays taken abroad may be down but the number of people taking holidays in Ireland has increased significantly.</P>
    <P>The amount of employment created by the private sector over the last number of years could have been greater.  It would, however, be unfair to ignore the fact that there has been an improvement in the employment situation and that a constant effort is being made by the Government to create employment wherever possible. The provisions in this Finance Bill will assist this further and I am delighted about that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan referred to the Governor of the Central Bank who said that the budget was too soft.  The Governor of the Central Bank is, of course, entitled to his opinion.  Deputy Taylor would say that the budget was too hard.  Somewhere in between there has to be an answer. One cannot say that the budget was too soft and then oppose measures which are aimed at correcting the public finances at every opportunity.  One cannot have it both ways.  Similarly Deputy Taylor cannot call for vast increases in social welfare and at the same time oppose every reasonable effort to lay a foundation stone of some relevance for the economy.  He cannot have it both ways. One cannot criticise the Government for doing something while being unwilling to support the Government when they try to do what is necessary to achieve what one wanted.</P>
    <P>It has been a disappointment that with the strengthening of the Irish pound the value of goods in the shops has not come down appreciably.  It is wonderful that we are starting to talk about falling prices. Multinational companies and multi-chain supermarkets have, however, more than a commercial obligation, they have a social obligation as well.  It is incumbent on them to deal honestly with customers <Col N="2440" /> and to charge the prices which should be charged, taking into account the strength of the Irish pound today against other currencies.  Not to do so would be amoral and this needs to be brought home to them as a matter of urgency.  In an ideal world these retailers would reduce the prices themselves but if they are unwilling to do so the legislation will have to be passed to force them to do what is right.</P>
    <P>The low inflation which has been created by the Government is to be greatly welcomed but this could not have happened without the co-operation of the social partners.  Co-operation between the social partners and the Government is the ideal way forward, and I hope the Minister and his colleagues will be successful in negotiating a further period of growth with the social partners.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan painted a picture of gloom and doom in many areas of the economy.  This is not reflected on the ground.  There is, of course, continuing concern about the level of unemployment and emigration but any fair observer would say that the level of progress by the last two Governments compares favourably with the performance of the earlier Government.  That Government had no overall plan.  They did not seem to have any ideas or, if they did, they did not appear to be able to implement them. That is probably the reason for the despair the country fell into during their reign.</P>
    <P>Opposition Deputies of the left, what I would call the extreme left, often try to polarise Fianna Fáil as a right wing party. We heard it again this evening when Deputy Taylor spoke about the poor and said they were not being treated fairly in the budget or by this Bill which implements the budget.  Neither Deputy Taylor nor any other Deputy has a monopoly on concern for the poor.  I have no doubt but that Deputy Carey sitting opposite is every bit as concerned about the poor as Deputy Taylor or I.  However, one can talk about economic efficiency being balanced by social equity only when one has an economy which has grown sufficiently to enable social equity.  Economic efficiency and social equity go <Col N="2441" /> together like a horse and carriage. Nothing causes polarisation of society or increasing inequality more than a country which is failing to have growth in its economy and wealth.</P>
    <P>This Government have laid the foundation stone in this and previous Bills to enable the poor to share as much as is humanly possible in the growth that has taken place in recent years.  It would be remiss of me not to remind Deputy Taylor that much of the major social legislation dealing with the poor since the foundation of this State was introduced by Fianna Fáil.  Nobody has a monopoly on concern for the underprivileged.</P>
    <P>Having said that, it is wonderful to hear Deputy Taylor admit that the goalposts have changed and that now it is a question of how the cake is to be divided; there was no cake to divide when Labour were in Government between 1982 and 1987.  It is wonderful to hear Opposition Deputies speak of growth in this manner and it is of course a wonderful tribute to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about descriptions which were used this evening such as business gurus.  If there were not business gurus &mdash; I assume the word was used disparagingly and I object to it &mdash; there would be no business and if there was no business there would be no employment. It would be as well for some people to remember that the business of Government is Government and the business of busness is business.  Reference has been made to the fact that there is an antipublic-sector bias and that the public sector companies must be allowed to make independent decisions.  I sincerely hope the decisions referred to are not of the ilk which An Post, in their wisdom, reached recently, to close down 300 sub-post offices around the country.</P>
    <P>At various stages in the short history of the State rationalisation of State and semi-State services hit rural areas hardest. Small national schools which were at the nerve centre of rural communities were closed down not in the interests of education but in the name of rationalisation. Another semi-State company <Col N="2442" /> affected is the one dealing with railways. Railway lines leading through and passing the most breath-taking scenery in the world have been taken up.  This was not done in the interests of rural communities which were decimated by emigration but in the holy name of rationalisation.  The decision of An Post to close up to 300 sub-post offices around the country was the major element of plans to end financial losses in An Post.  They are dangling the carrot in front of proprietors of suboffices in rural areas.  This heralds the end of one of the last bastions of rural Ireland. It is wrong and is fundamentally unfair. The rural sub-office is not just a means of communication with the outside world or a convenient place to draw one's old age pension or welfare entitlement; it is a meeting place and a way of life.  An Post should pick on someone their own size.</P>
    <P>There are other inequities in Irish life which it would be difficult for a city bureaucrat to understand.  This is what I will describe as the distance factor.  This means that the further you are from the centre the more you pay, even for a simple telephone call.  The system of charges applied by Telecom Éireann is a disincentive and a positive disencouragement to industry and business in rural Ireland.  There is an urgent need for a more equitable system of charges.  I acknowledge that semi-State companies have a commercial obligation but they also have a social obligation and they must not be allowed to make their pound of flesh on the backs of the vulnerable. That has happened far too often in the past and the consequence was a creeping erosion which ultimately robbed Ireland's peripheral regions of its youth. We cannot seriously call upon the EC to give us special status on the grounds of our peripherality if we allow Goliaths like An Post to wield their big stick at our own peripheral regions.</P>
    <P>The speech of Deputy Rabbitte was a revelation. He acknowledged the boom in the construction industry and unquestionably there has been a substantial improvement in the construction sector <Col N="2443" /> as a result of Government policies.  Without doubt the construction industry is going through one of its better periods, having been years in the doldrums in the early eighties.  Indeed there was a belief that it could not come back but back it has come.  I understand it was a former Taoiseach, Seán Lemass, who said he could tell the state of the economy by the number of bags of cement sold in a given year.  Unquestionably there has been a substantial improvement in this area and that improvement has been transferred in particular to the tourist industry.  It has to be remembered that throughout the early eighties, during the period of the Fine Gael Coalition Government, not only was tourism stagnating but it was showing a slight decline in this country at a time when it was increasing all over the world.  Projections at that time foretold a 95 per cent increase in tourism but Ireland's share of the market stagnated or declined and that was a great pity.  It is marvellous that this Government and the previous Government changed the policy and went into the marketplace to sell rather than hide behind telephones in semi-State offices.</P>
    <P>I have watched the growth in my own constituency which is considerd to be the primary tourist resort in this country. New hotels have been erected in Killarney; millions of pounds are being invested in a hotel in Kenmare; in their first venture into northern Europe, Club-Med and Ryanair are investing £5 million in Waterville; domestic holidays, as I have already said, have increased; new golf courses are proposed at Killarney, Killorglin and Castlegregory; and the Cork-Swansea ferry has returned.  There has been a substantial advance in this industry.  The best year ever in Irish tourism was 1989.  Never before was such a large number of tourists seen in the country.  It is an outstanding tribute to the Government and to all those involved in the industry that this should have happened when it was believed that it could not be done.  Many of the things which people believed could not be done have been achieved by this Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2444" /> Perhaps one of the most innovative and imaginative approaches of this Government and the previous Government was their investment in regional airports.  Few would have believed a short few years ago that many of these airports would become the success that they ultimately became.  Even what was described by an Opposition Deputy, who was then a Minister, as a foggy bog has become one of the leading airports in the country.  The Government gave a grant of £1.25 million towards Farranfore Airport, which lay dormant for years, and that amount was quickly matched by the business community in County Kerry.  Between June and December 1989, 49,000 passengers passed through the terminals at Farranfore and projections for 1990 are that 100,000 passengers will pass through the terminals there.  Is this not what one could only describe as a metamorphosis of gigantic proportions? It is symbolic of the success of this Government in so many areas of our national life. I would like to call on the Government to provide the airport company with the necessary structural funds to enable them to make Farranfore an international airport.  An airport which only housed hang gliders could become a national airport in less than three years and that is a remarkable performance.  When planes are flying in and out of Farranfore to every European City, even Deputy Carey would be welcome to utilise the facility.</P>
    <P>The integrated rural development programme was the most innovative ever to emanate from the Department of Agriculture and Food.  It, like everything else, requires funding and I sincerely hope that at the next available opportunity a Finance Bill will provide for such funding.  There is a possibility of the rejuvenation of rural communities, especially those on the periphery, but funding is required to enable it to be successful.</P>
    <P>Possibly the best type of industry for rural Ireland is in the financial services area.  I compliment the Minister for Finance on making Killorglin, a small town <Col N="2445" /> in my constituency, arguably the headquarters of the Irish technological industry. The decentralisation of the prize bonds to the Foreign Exchange Company of Ireland based in Killorglin, County Kerry, led to the creation of many jobs in three separate small towns in the region.</P>
    <P>Financial service industries are not dependent on transport because communications are now far easier due to the introduction of fibre optic cable in places like County Kerry.  Half the installation there has already been completed.  I would encourage the development of that kind of industry in the west.  It is the answer to many of the unemployment problems and I would strongly urge the Minister to continue the wonderful work he has done in this area by providing the necessary infrastructure and encouraging the IDA to site these types of industry in areas which are far from the centre.</P>
    <P>I now refer to the submission by the ICMSA regarding the tax allowance for farm families.  The ICMSA argue that the Government decision to propose a current year basis of assessment for farmers and other self-employed people removes the justification put forward in 1980 when the PAYE allowance was introduced.  The then Minister stated that the purpose of the PAYE allowance was to take account of the fact that the self-employed generally have the advantage of paying tax on the basis of the previous year.  They point out that the Commission on Taxation recommended that when all taxpayers were brought on to a current year basis of assessment taxpayers should receive the same overall personal allowances regardless of the schedule under which they are assessed.  On behalf of farm families I would urge the Minister to ensure that an appropriate amendment is adopted in this Bill to cater for farm families.  It would be an advantage to them and it would appear to be equitable and fair that they should be treated in this manner.</P>
    <P>Emigration is still a very serious problem. While the figures have fallen since the period in office of the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government, there is a lot to be done.  I have received complaints <Col N="2446" /> from young Irish people seeking American visas during the past year or more. These complaints, if true, need to be addressed.  Some young people say that they are not being treated courteously when they apply for visas, or rather when the interviewing process takes place. They say that the interviewing at times appears to take the form of interrogation. People who wish to emigrate voluntarily or involuntarily or who wish to take holidays in the United States are entitled to be treated with dignity at all times. Human dignity must always be respected. If the complaints are true I sincerely hope the necessary action will be taken by the appropriate authorities to ensure that young Irish people are treated with the dignity they unquestionably deserve.</P>
    <P>There is a need for greater incentives for those working in the public sector. For several years there has been a brain drain from the public sector and very often people with the very best talent move to the private sector, with consequent loss to the State.  Some system will have to be introduced which will ensure that initiative, imagination and ability are recognised.  That is in the interests of the State and of people.</P>
    <P>Finally, I refer to the taxation of wards of court.  I understand there are about 110 such people in the country, many of whom are greatly disabled.  Is it fair that people in this position should have their profits taxed in the same manner as able bodied people? I believe it is not and that their plight should be looked at sympathetically by the Government.</P>
    <P>We cannot say that everything in the garden is absolutely rosy but certainly things are beginning to bloom.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to wide ranging addresses from various people and ideologically there is not much difference between Deputies on any side, even the people on my right who were concerning Deputy O'Donoghue, the alleged left.  There is not much between any of us about the conduct of affairs.  It is really a matter of a certain amount of begrudgery about who should have this or who should have that.  I regret it is <Col N="2447" /> not acknowledged that there is a certain amount of agreement on which we should be building.</P>
      <P>Deputies opposite are trumpeting the successes they have achieved during their period in office.  The big problem is that we have 250,000 people unemployed. The motivation behind any Finance Bill is to achieve huge reductions in the numbers of unemployed.  Jobs are the most important aspect of young life and of family life.  The Bill contains some provisions with which I agree but there is not enough emphasis on the creation of employment.  There may not be a simple solution but the Minister should make a greater commentary on the problem.  I was admonished during the budget debate for saying that there is too much of a drag towards Dublin.  Every economic activity has to be brought to Dublin.  Take, for example, a major part of this Bill, the financial services.  Deputy Noonan rightly referred to the Governor of the Central Bank who when he was secretary of the Department of Finance resisted totally the idea of legislation for offshore banking and financial services, yet when he moved to the Central Bank he was amenable and at the Taoiseach's request he encouraged the establishment of financial services in the centre of Dublin near the Custom House Docks site.  As far as I am concerned Irish people want to see a level playing pitch whether in County Clare or in Dublin.  In this Finance Bill I do not see any levelling of the pitch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the financial services there is greater emphasis on the success of the Dublin Docks site.  I was reading documents which the Minister liked to give us when he was on this side of the House.  Frequently he would throw them over to the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes.  He used to say: &ldquo;I see in the CII newsletter so and so of such a date&rdquo;.  The Minister enjoyed doing that. I have read some of the contributions in recent weeks to the CII newsletter and they are talking about the great success of the Custom House Docks site.  They have forgotten that we have a little place <Col N="2448" /> in Shannon from where the original idea came.  Offshore banking originated in Shannon.  We had been knocking on the door of the Department of Finance for many years.  Were it not for Deputy Noonan, <i>Limerick East</i>, I am sure financial services would never have taken off. I do not know whether this is adverted to in former Minister Hussey's book but Deputy Noonan, contrary to the wishes of the majority of the previous Coalition Government, brought in the legislation for financial services and made it available in Shannon.  At that stage we were behind in trying to set up financial services because all over the UK they had been trying to set them up.  The Taoiseach, in his wisdom, felt that since Dublin is a capital city, this had a greater chance of success in Dublin.  Therefore we will move financial services from Shannon to Dublin where it will be of no consequence.  We can still keep Shannon going and we will have Dublin going and everything will be all right.</P>

      <P>It is not true because Mr. Hely-Hutchinson, Chief Executive, Bank of Ireland, went down there to a major conference where he made a long speech about financial services.  He was all in favour of the Custom House Docks site and he gave warnings that the financial services area should be controlled, that people should get greater encouragement and that there should not be total dependence on tax incentives. I suppose there should not.  Mr. Hely-Hutchinson does not seem to know we have financial services in Shannon Airport. I ask the Minister, if a slice of Longford was taken to Dublin would he resist it?  I am sure he would.  He certainly would not accept it.  That has not happened. As far as this Finance Bill is concerned it is the same thing again, we have the financial services where great emphasis is put on the success of Dublin but the poor boys in the country can take the crumbs from the table and that is it.</P>

      <P>It will make more than that by the time I will have finished with it. Not only that but all speakers on that side of the House are talking about the huge increase in tourism and how great it has been for the country.  The Minister for Tourism and Transport when he contributed to the budget debate on 1 February 1990, at column 556 of the Official Report said:</P>
      <P>I am pleased to report that the two sectors &mdash; transport and tourism &mdash; for which I have responsibility have continued to play their part in the growth of the economy.</P>
      <P>Everything has been a great success since he came to office.  He was able to report that to the House while we still had the sole transatlantic rights for Shannon Airport. In recent days he has decided that he will open up the economy in the interests of tourism and he will deny an area in the south-west which had delivered the goods to the west for the last 47 years by taking away our only protection. The Minister, with sleight-of-hand, conceded to the Dublin lobby and gave away charter flights to Cork, Dublin and Knock.</P>

The Minister for Finance will probably facilitate them in this Bill in some way or other where there will be a business expansion scheme that will be helpful to these people in the hotels, and naturally there will not be any losses in the west.  As the Taoiseach assured us in <Col N="2450" /> Ennis a few days ago we have no problems in Shannon.  He said: &ldquo;Do not worry, you are all right&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The pitch is not level.  If it does not relate to Dublin it does not relate at all.  As far as I am concerned this Finance Bill will contribute further to the long-term economic desert in the west.  That is what is facing us.  The Minister came in here today and said nothing about Structural Funds or whether he had revised the figures he had produced and which were to be the basis of our future for 1992 and 1993.  I heard on the radio today that there would be a link from Dundalk to Wexford and there will be two ring roads where one can go to the left or to the right around Dublin.  I know that will happen.  Dublin needs that and that is where the growth will be.  The Minister told us today that there has been great growth; of course there has been great growth in Dublin.  Go to other parts of the country and see if there is great growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the building industry where is this <Col N="2451" /> great growth outside of Dublin? Is it in Limerick?  Certainly the builders I met at a function the other night did not say the growth was in Limerick.  I know there is some activity in Limerick city where the legislation is being applied for designated areas.  In fact, the Minister has extended the lifetime of the designated areas but he should also have said that he would do something about controlling the designated areas.  I would like to see the Department of Finance taking an active part in seeing what goes on in the designated areas.  In my constituency in Ennis we have made an application for a designated area but, of course, it has been continually refused.  However, in some midland towns one individual gets his whole property included as a designated area for urban renewal.  I do not know who that individual is but he is very lucky.  I do not know whether it is in Portlaoise or Tullamore.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is unfortunate now. In the spirit of the thing the Minister wanted to create employment but this is an out and out abuse.  In the city of Limerick there is no revision of the areas that are supposed to be in the designated area.  I do not know what hand the Minister for Industry and Commerce has in this, but the Department of Finance and the Department of the Environment should put their heads together to see that there is proper developments.  Nobody objects to this scheme.  After all, it was introduced by Fine Gael Ministers, but it is not right to see one individual having so much influence on whichever Department it is, whether Finance or the Environment, that he is able to get his own property in to the exclusion of others. Developments are taking place, where one side of the town is taking it at the expense of the other.  I do not accept that is the right way to go about it either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2452" /> When the Minister is accepting ideas from his advisers I think he overlooks the fact that they are all Dublin-based themselves.  While he is encouraging people to decentralise and so on, I do not think sufficient has been done in this regard.  The Minister is a countryman like myself and he has to go back to a rural constituency to be re-elected.</P>
    <P>I would like to see him putting into his Bill a provision to look after the farmers as Deputy Noonan requested earlier today.  The ICMSA have made representations about how they want to be treated.  I have sympathy with their case and the Minister should consider some amendment on Committee Stage of the Bill.  I do not know whether the Minister is aware that Departments to whom he is giving money to give to farmers are holding on to it.  That is the only logical explanation I can give for the delay in headage payments for instance, or is it that the Department of Finance have learned from Dunnes Stores or such people that delayed payment is a good system to have because you make a certain saving in one year at the expense of someone else? In this instance you are making six months' saving at the expense of small farmers in the West.</P>

I spoke with a fellow yesterday who is owed £13,000 and the documents have all been passed since sometime early in January and the good people in Cavan told him yesterday he would be lucky if he was paid in June or July.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>If they are not I want to know why there is discrimination against County Clare.  I was very interested to hear Deputy O'Donoghue talking about the 300 rural post offices being the backbone to the economy.  A few minutes before that he was talking about the great action and the hard decisions this Government took and how they would stand behind hard and really tough decisions.  The rural post offices brought to my mind another case where the bias is definitely towards Dublin.  As long as the cuts are not in Dublin it is all right. The taxpayers come from all over.  They are in a central pool.  In each of the rural constituencies outside Dublin we have such things as local charges.  We pay water charges in my constituency. Deputy Noonan pays them in Limerick. They are paid in Sligo and by the Minister in his constituency, yet in Dublin no water charges are paid.  Who is paying for these water charges?  Down along the line the taxpayer is paying because either Dublin Corporation are not utilising their funds properly and do not need some of the subventions they get or Dublin Corporation have let people go and we are paying for it directly out of the social welfare fund.  It is either one way or the other, but it is because of the lack of moral courage on the part either of the Minister or his Government who promised at the last election to abolish charges.  Everybody said that when Fianna Fáil got back to power charges would be gone, but, totally inconsistent, <Col N="2454" /> the Minister goes in &mdash; he is consistent in one thing; as long as Dublin is not touched he will agree &mdash; and the rural fellows can pay water charges but the Dublin fellows need not do it at all.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not explained how exactly he arrived at the balance he reached in distributing the Structural Funds.  Why has the east to get the greater amount? Why have we in the west to suffer totally?  I imagine if the Minister wants to level the pitch he will have to have a review of how the funds are allocated.  In the mid-west region with the new policy now being conducted by the Minister for Transport and Tourism we want a review of the Structural Funds. We want new, bigger, better funds to compensate us for the loss in principle of Shannon as the sole trans-Atlantic airport. If that is not done the Minister will add to our problems.  While some people have great faith in the resilience of the people in Shannon to survive, this Minister owes it to us to make some effort to correct the imbalance.</P>
      <P>One aspect of this debate about economic balance is that people seem to ignore the various regions in this country, that all regions cannot have the same prospects and cannot depend totally on the same economic mix.  While we in the west and in the mid-west in particular enjoyed a certain advantage-we got the American tourists first &mdash; I do not think Dublin lobbyists are entitled to describe that as a restrictive practice.  I hope the Minister will keep that in mind when having this review of the Structural Funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should now like to say something nice about the Minister.  His decision to extend the tax filing date from 31 December to 31 January of the following year is to be welcomed.  The old deadline came at an inappropriate time of the year because it coincided with the busy time for traders who found difficulty in taking advantage of the Christmas rush business and having to comply with the provision that they should have their returns filled in.  I compliment the Minister on this move.  The new date is more realistic. The month of January tends to be quiet <Col N="2455" /> in terms of trading and the Minister's decision removes an element of hardship which I have no doubt was not intended when the original provision was passed.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the decision to redefine the definition of manufacturing for the purposes of the corporation tax rate of 10 per cent.  The proposals will, undoubtedly, result in great hardship for a number of businesses which have benefited under the existing scheme. It will have an inflationary effect because some businesses will pass on the extra cost.  In fact, some businesses may go to the wall.  The Minister did not respond to the suggestion that he should take into account the types of businesses involved.  Did he review the position of the service industries as distinct from the manufacturing industries?  Will he consider an averaging of the figures involved? Will he consider revising the 10 per cent rate leading to a greater averaging of the tax rates?  I do not know if that will be possible or the amount of money that would be involved.</P>
    <P>I should like to make an appeal on behalf of sub-contractors.  There is an anomaly in tax legislation with regard to provisions which relate to appeals by people who are denied a sub-contractor's number.  The final arbiter is a tax inspector and provision is not made for appeal to an appeals commissioner.  That is very unfortunate as many people who make application for a sub-contractor's number do so because they are compelled by market forces.  Many employers are not prepared to take on certain trades because of the nature of work.  For instance, these people often work on their own away from supervision, particularly the supervision of the employer. They are forced to accept full responsibility for their own work and there is always a stipulation that the labour will be supplied by the sub-contractor rather than the employer.  These traders when they apply for sub-contractors' numbers find that the inspectors take a very strict interpretation of the provision.  I do not know if the Department have received complaints about this but I am aware of <Col N="2456" /> difficulties in regard to this in my constituency.</P>
    <P>There is a very uneven application of the interpretation of the statute as between different tax districts. I am not asking for a diminution of the rules of issuing sub-contractor certificates but an appeals commissioner would be a more objective person in assessing applications than a tax inspector.  These sub-contractors face an element of hardship which is seldom highlighted because they tend to be persons who are not members of an organised body.  I understand that representations have been made by the accountancy body and that they agree with the plea I have made to the Minister. The Minister should review this matter.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Noonan I would like to see a consolidation of legislation. I should like to refer to section 8 which deals with lump sum payments.  In my experience lump sum payments have caused great difficulties with Departments and tax inspectors.  There is a long delay in the processing of applications for refunds and I should like to ask the Minister to give further thought to his proposal in regard to them.  It may be that all that is needed is for the Minister to explain his intentions but my reading is that he will be making things more difficult.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister has not introduced a system to help the stamp duty review which was called for by the farming bodies.  Under the previous scheme there was stamp duty relief for transfers from fathers to sons and I should like to ask the Minister to consider introducing an interest free instalment arrangement over a number of years.  I accept that there is a 50 per cent reduction for such transactions but young farmers involved in the transfer of holdings need all the money they can get.  I have no doubt that agreement could be reached on a scheme.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to consider semi-mature forests for exemption from stamp duty.  People who are promoting the extension of forestry have made representations to me in regard to that.  The Government have told us on many occasions that they are anxious to <Col N="2457" /> develop our forests.  Semi-mature forests are vital if we are to have a continuation of the enormous amount of interest in forestry by the private sector.  The change I have suggested will encourage farmers to get involved.  It takes a long time for one to see a return on investment in forestry but if we had a system of mobility under which semi-mature forests would be exempt, or partially exempt, we would be moving in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I should like to make an appeal to the Minister on behalf of the poor.  In particular, I should like to ask the Minister to reconsider the overseas aid allocation. I am disappointed that that allocation is reduced each year.  I do not think we are asking the Exchequer to make a great sacrifice in regard to overseas aid.  We will have the Telethon shortly in an effort to raise funds for our poor people and that is laudable, but at the same time our overseas allocation is derisory.  It should be improved.  I agree with Deputy O'Donoghue that the Minister has disappointed in the budget in not providing sufficient funds for the immediate improvement of schemes devised under the integrated rural development programme.  That programme in other countries, such as Germany, has flourished and it is sad to say that in the West finance is not being provided to get some of those pilot schemes off the ground.  Many of the schemes that have been prepared are worthy of support.</P>

      <P>While this country has seen tremendous improvement in its fortunes since last June when the country once more chose a Fianna fáil led Government, the framework for this revival was laid in 1987 when the people voted out the previous Fine Gael &mdash; Labour Coalition.  Since last June the Government have grown in popularity because they have gone about tackling the serious economic problems that we faced.  The Irish economy has continued to respond to strong fiscal medicine.  For too long a stop-go cycle has characterised Ireland's economic history.  There is now <Col N="2458" /> an opportunity for sustained growth, certainly in the medium term.  Gross national product grew by about 4 per cent in 1989, which was higher than has been predicted, and, indeed, most forecasts suggest that GNP would be maintained above the 4 per cent mark up to 1993.</P>
      <P>The drop in the borrowing requirements were achieved by public expenditure cuts which at times were politically costly.  However, the Government, and their predecessor, did not flinch from pursuing this line of fiscal rectitude as its need was clearly seen.  As in the past, the Fianna Fáil Party saw that the well being of the country was of paramount importance.</P>
      <P>There has also been a reorganisation and tighening of the tax collection regime.  Standard tax rates were cut in 1989 for the first time in many years and this was continued in the 1990 budget as outlined in the Finance Bill before us. The Government have pledged that income tax will continue to fall over the next couple of years &mdash; up to 1992 &mdash; to two rates of 25 per cent and 48 per cent. It is indeed a remarkable achievement to have brought about a reduction in income tax rates over the past three years and to be in a position to confidently predict that this will continue over the next couple of years despite the problems the country faced because of over-borrowing in the past and the over-use of current budget deficits.</P>
      <P>The trade picture has never been brighter. Exports last year were in excess of £14 billion which was £2 billion greater than the record achieved the previous year.  There are signs that the return of economic confidence has led to a rapid rise in imports.  While a considerable portion of imports are plant and machinery to feed new industrial investment, there has also been a great surge in consumer spending.  For instance, new car registrations in the first six months of 1989 were up by about 20 per cent on the previous year and that increase has continued into 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> involving unions and industry in wide-ranging pay agreements <Col N="2459" /> tied to an overall economic programme has worked well.  Over the past two years, there have been fewer strikes than at virtually any time in our history.  I am saying that in the full knowledge that there is an extremely serious dispute in my own constituency which has been ongoing for the past three weeks.  I refer, of course, to the unfortunate situation at Waterford Glass which has very serious implications for Waterford city and for Dungarvan.  I hope, in line with the general mood of confidence and prosperity that now abounds throughout the length and breadth of this country, that this impasse can be quickly settled to the mutual benefit of all concerned.  Not only would lasting problems at Waterford Glass be to the detriment of Waterford city and county but also to the country as a whole, as ongoing problems there would reflect far and wide.</P>
    <P>This growing popular perception of better economic times also brings its own problems.  The pace of pay claims is likely to quicken as a result and a property boom in Dublin and growing consumer spending has forced interest rates up although they are still well below UK levels.  Previously when we complained about interest rates rising here, we were traditionally three or four points ahead of the British rates but now the boot is on the other foot and we are that three or four points below.  It looks as if we will maintain that position.</P>
    <P>Ireland has also successfully fought the inflation battle.  From an annual rate of nearly 20 per cent in 1980 it went down to around 3 per cent last year.  The deflationary measures contained in this year's Finance Bill should ensure that a similar performance is again achieved in 1990.  The punt has maintained its value within the European monetary system and there is growing maturity and confidence in the Dublin money market.</P>
    <P>While Fianna Fáil have pulled this country back from the economic brink, several major problems remain.  Because we are such a small country, any significant slow-down in the outside economy could have a detrimental effect on <Col N="2460" /> growth prospects.  A downturn in the UK which still accounts for approximately one-third of total Irish exports could cause us some problems.  The national debt at £25 billion is still too high but because of the economic progress that has been achieved over the past three years, this Government have succeeded in stabilising that debt.  However, this debt still eats up a large slice of the economic cake and debt servicing is still costing about £40 per week for every worker in the country.  That is the reason, even though our public finances are improving faster than might have been expected, that there can be no let up on Government policy, we cannot dispense with expenditure restraints and engage in a spending spree.</P>
    <P>Public sector spending has been the traditional engine of Irish economic growth.  The State is now disengaging itself from many areas of economic activity and it is up to the private sector to invest in this more favourable climate which we have been able to create over the past three years.  While there has been tremendous success on most fronts, the one disappointment was that the number of unemployed was not falling as rapidly as one would have liked.  It is still the biggest problem facing us although the figures for March of this year were a great encouragement when almost 9,000 people were taken off the unemployment register.  I believe this is the result of the better economic climate that has been created and while it has taken a little bit longer to reflect itself than we might have hoped, it bears out a report which I read recently in a national newspaper which said that the number of positions being advertised through the media had increased over the past couple of months in comparison with previous periods.  It is a significant increase reflected in falling unemployment.  This is a sure sign that there are jobs out there to be picked up and I look forward with confidence to this unemployment figure falling even more over the coming months and throughout the rest of 1990.</P>
    <P>In the run-up to 1992, Ireland is likely to receive more than £3 billion from EC <Col N="2461" /> Structural Funds.  This money is vital to the development of Ireland's infrastructure. In particular, the roads system urgently needs development and repair. A private sector investment is vital to maximise the take from Brussels and ensure future development and I am pleased to note that, by and large, private sector investment appears to be there to match Government funding.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that over the past three years the Government have created a sound foundation for economic progress in the 1990s.  We are now in a strong position to face the challenges of 1992. For this country it was important that our tenure as President of the EC for six months should have some credibility. This credibility would not be there if our economy was to continue along its merry way as it did prior to 1987.  Thankfully, the new-found confidence the past three years have engendered in this country, has also been reflected in our Presidency of the EC and indeed, not only has our Presidency been a credible one but, it played, and is playing, a most important role in the future development of Europe.</P>
    <P>No matter what changes are taking place, we must always have one eye on the performance of the agricultural section as it is so important to the economy of this island.  The EC's Common Agricultural Policy has been undergoing substantial reform during much of the 1980s. The EC's agenda for 1992, which includes expansion of the Social Fund, marks a further major change in the policy environment. With the assistance of the Structural Funds, the Community is increasingly focusing on the issue of rural development.</P>
    <P>The increasing public concern with environment matters and with food quality would also influence policy towards agriculture and food during the nineties. At an international level the current round of GATT negotiations may have a major influence on the future of Irish and European agriculture.</P>
    <P>Nineteen eighty nine was another good year for Irish agriculture.  The Central Statistics Office estimated in December <Col N="2462" /> that income from self-employment and other trading had risen by 5.2 per cent in 1989 thus consolidating the increases in income which had occurred over the previous two years.  Within this overall increase in income, gross agricultural output increased by 5.5 per cent.  On a sectoral basis, dairying had a very good year with milk prices about 11 per cent higher than in 1988.  The national quota has been increased by virtue of the additional Mulder quota and an additional 11 million gallons which the EC Council agreed on in order to permit an increase in the quotas of specified categories of milk producers.</P>
    <P>These improvements would not have happened if Ireland had continued with its pre-1987 strategy.  Thankfully that was changed and the rural community and the country as a whole have benefited as a result.  In February 1989, when the EC agreed on a major review of the beef régime, the special position of the beef industry in the Irish economy was accepted by the EC.  This special position was subsequently acknowledged by the Commission.</P>
    <P>The sheep sector had another good year in 1989.  The pig sector also had a good year and, while there is room for improvement, for the second year in succession the cereals sector maintained a relatively satisfactory level of output and return.  These successes would not have been recorded were it not for the favourable climate that was created at home.</P>
    <P>Because of the advances that have been made in the economy over the last three years, real increases have been applied to the less well off in our community through increased social welfare payments.  The total value of the package for those on social welfare, or at work on low pay will be £216 million in a full year.  This will bring total social welfare expenditure in 1990 to £2,764 million, which is its highest ever figure.</P>
    <P>Some of the main social welfare provisions in 1990 are as follows.  There will be an across the board increase of 5 per cent in all payments, including child benefit. This is well ahead of the expected inflation rate of just over 3 per cent for <Col N="2463" /> 1990.  This is a further indication of the Government's policy of getting to grips with the poverty problem.  A major initiative is also being launched to relieve people on low earnings of liability for PRSI while preserving their entitlements. This is a very important move.  There will also be substantial improvements in the tax exemption level for people at work on low pay.</P>
    <P>One of the most important advances made in the social welfare area has been the increase and streamlining of payments in respect of child dependants.  The child dependant payment will be paid up to age 20 in respect of all long-term recipients as a further step towards age 21.  These payments are already paid up to the age of 21 in respect of widows and other lone parents.  These increases will mean that a couple on long-term unemployment assistance with two children will receive £105 per week while a couple with four children will receive £127 per week and a couple on short-term unemployment assistance or supplementary allowance with four children will receive £120 per week.  These are real meaningful increases which will substantially relieve the burden on many families.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Government are conscious of the position of individuals on low pay who had their net take home pay reduced by the deduction of PRSI contributions.  The payment of such contributions can be a heavy imposition on those below the poverty line.  Moreover, PRSI contributions penalise those who are willing to take up low paid employment rather than remain on social welfare. This problem has been tackled by exempting low paid workers from PRSI contributions, which will not affect their entitlement to social insurance benefits.</P>
    <P>We can now clearly identify, not on the basis of theory but on the basis of experience, the unduly high level of personal taxation as a specific impediment to the creation of employment.  It is the reason some of our most talented and able people who would naturally generate enterprise here decide to go abroad and pursue their careers there.  It is for <Col N="2464" /> this reason that taxation had to be reduced. The burden was lowered in 1988, lowered further in 1989 and reduced again through the provisions in the 1990 Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>Looking back, it is absolutely clear that one of the main factors depressing our economy during the eighties was the continual increase in taxes of all kinds.  High tax levels removed the incentive to work and encouraged emigration.  In this regard the 1989 budget will be seen as a watershed and the year in which the demolition of the high tax régime began. The standard rate of tax was reduced from 35 to 32 per cent and is now being reduced further to 30 per cent while the highest rate was reduced from 58 to 56 per cent and is being reduced again to 53 per cent.  As a result of the enormous improvements in the economy since 1987, the 25 per cent standard rate of tax has become feasible as a target by 1993 with the top rate target of 48 per cent also being eminently achievable.</P>
    <P>While much is always made of any reduction in the rates of income tax paid, I believe that the measures taken in the very first section of this Bill are an even more important element in the reduction of income tax.  The widening of the income tax bands slows down a person's rise into the higher tax backets.  In the case of married persons, the general exemption limit is being increased from £6,000 to £6,500.  This move has to be warmly welcomed.  People do not realise the important part this move plays in the income tax scenario.  The reduction in the rates of income tax and the widening of the exemption limits has meant that real extra money has been put in the pockets of the PAYE workers.</P>
    <P>Sections 10 to 23 form an important part of the Finance Bill because of the changes that are made in the basis of assessment.  When the proposals as outlined in this Bill are implemented, it will mean that in future all incomes will be charged a tax on the basis of the income of the year of assessment.  Up to now some sources of income have been taxed on the basis of the previous year's assessment &mdash; these include business profits for <Col N="2465" /> trades and professions, foreign income not already taxed in Ireland and rents and incomes from any employment not subject to PAYE.  This Bill is effectively moving all of these categories on to the current year's assessment.  It will mean that the taxpayer's liability will be finalised on the basis of one return of income to be submitted after the end of the tax year when all the details relating to that year are known.  This will bring greater efficiency and certainty to the system, equalise the tax burden and will mean that the advantage sole traders, etc., enjoyed over the PAYE sector heretofore will be abolished.</P>
    <P>The new provisions will further mean that the tax office will not need to contact the taxpayer or his or her tax adviser as often as before to finalise his or her tax affairs and there will be no need to reopen the preceding year's figures.  This, in turn, will mean less of a compliance burden for taxpayers and their advisers, a greater efficiency in and, therefore, a better service from the tax office.</P>
    <P>The provisions outlined in sections 25 and 26, which provide for the extension from 31 May 1991 to 31 May 1993 of the time limits applying to qualifying expenditure for the purpose of the urban renewal reliefs, are very important particularly to my constituency of Waterford. The area which was designated in Waterford city a number of years ago has been transformed because of the tax breaks which applied to that area.  The biggest development in the urban renewal area in Waterford is a major £20 million shopping centre.  That development should and would have been finished some time ago were it not for the problems which arose because of the many important archaeological finds that were made on that site.  Obviously these digs delayed the building work considerably and if the completion date had not been extended, it would have had grave implications for Waterford.</P>
    <P>Because of the provisions in these sections this means that Waterford will benefit two-fold.  First, there is the major economic benefit of providing such a large shopping centre which is going to <Col N="2466" /> generate something in the region of 400-500 jobs.  It will also make Waterford an even more attractive city, thereby generating an extra through-flow of people with the obvious spin-off benefits that will bring.  Second, because of the archaeological find a new heritage centre has already been opened in Waterford which displays many of the items that were unearthed.  This is proving to be extremely successful and obviously helps the drive that is on at present to bring more tourists into the area.</P>
    <P>While the whole concept of the business expansion scheme has been a good one, and indeed has provided much needed equity capital for a wide range of business ventures, there is nevertheless no doubt that many creative accountants have been able in the past to get projects approved under this scheme that were never really intended to be included.  The spirit of the business expansion scheme was being ruined by the application of the strict legalities of the scheme.  There is very little point in giving investors a surefire way of putting up money with absolutely no risk attached to it.  This had to be changed, and thankfully it was under this Bill.  I am sure everybody will welcome the provisions in this Part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I was gratified to hear Opposition spokesmen welcome these changes. Other provisions contained in this Finance Bill to be welcomed include the new subsection which provides that the production of a film on a commercial basis will be treated as the manufacture of goods provided that not less than 75 per cent of the work on this production is carried out in this State.  Classifying this procedure as manufacturing, means it attracts corporation tax at a rate of 10 per cent.  This should be of tremendous benefit to our film industry and demonstrates that the Government are prepared to play their part in promoting the film industry following on their recent tremendous success.  Also welcome is the section which provides tax relief on donations made by companies to the Trust for Community Initiative.  A company which makes a gift to the trust will <Col N="2467" /> be entitled to treat the payment as a trading expense or as an expense of management, as appropriate.  Obviously this action will encourage such donations.</P>
    <P>The provisions contained in sections 59 to 70 are not only an important element of this Bill but also indicative of the general thrust of Government policy.  Accelerated annual capital allowances are being reduced which has the effect of endeavouring to shift the emphasis from machinery to people.  In recent years, investors have been encouraged to invest in machinery to the detriment of the labour force.  There were always penalties associated with employing people but tax breaks if one employed machinery instead.  At the end of the day this has cost the Government in terms of revenue. There has also been a social cost.  Hopefully these provisions will encourage investors to invest once more in labour rather than machinery which would go a long way to reducing unemployment figures also.</P>
    <P>While some manufacturing entities may view this as a retrograde step, they are more than compensated by the extension of the 10 per cent corporation tax régime to the year 2010.  Many people may feel this has been an imprudent move.  There may be others who think that, as we are still ten years away from the year 2000, it is very early to take such a decision.  However, such a decision was necessary.  An indication had to be given to the manufacturing sector of what would happen.  We must remember that current management thinking dictates that corporate plans be prepared ten years in advance rather than three to five years which was the position heretofore. Obviously, industry had to know what was happening.  Hence the taking of the decision at this time.</P>
    <P>While a 10 per cent corporation tax figure is quite low it must be weighed against its attendant benefits.  There is no doubt that it is an attraction to foreign investors to be able to set up a manufacturing plant here, knowing that our tax concessions are so beneficial.  Were we to frighten off such investors it would <Col N="2468" /> leave very little hope for those people at present unemployed.  There is no doubt that, with new cheap labour markets opening up throughout Eastern Europe, we are going to have to fight even harder in ensuing years to attract investment here.  We must remember that the first thing any investor will ascertain is what return he will get on his capital.  If he is not going to get sufficient return here, obviously, he will go elsewhere.  That is why it is imperative that the 10 per cent rate remains.  International factors will render the future difficult enough for us without us adding to our difficulties by effectively shooting ourselves in the foot. In ten years time we may be able to lift this rate of corporation tax.  Certainly we cannot tamper with it at present.</P>
    <P>Reductions in capital gains tax, customs and excise duties and VAT are all to be warmly welcomed.  This first step towards the harmonisation of taxes, looking forward to 1992, was necessary.  The most significant decrease has been the 2 per cent reduction in VAT which has meant reduction in household goods, both durable and non-durable, electrical and non-electrical, consumables such as wine, beer spirits, goods for personal use, sport and recreational goods, educational goods, religious goods, building materials, marine goods, medical goods, agricultural goods, office equipment and stationery, clothing materials and equipment, packaging, services, and other miscellaneous items including motor vehicles, petrol, bicycles, and so on.  In short, almost anything one cares to name has been reduced in price because of the VAT provisions outlined.  I look forward to further VAT reductions in ensuing years.</P>
    <P>It has become evident that the path we have been pursuing over the last three years, most certainly is the correct one. It would be very easy for us to fall back into our old bad habits, that is demanding lower taxes while at the same time seeking higher public spending. Employment has been responding to the new and better conditions created.  This response appears to have been accelerated of late and should continue into the future.  The <Col N="2469" /> general well-being and morale of our people is high at present.  This Bill and its provisions ensure a continuation of the sound basis on which that morale was generated.  This is an excellent start to the 1990s.  Indeed it is a decade to which we can now look with increasing confidence.</P>

    <P>I have heard some very confident statements by people on the Government side of the House.  Confidence is a wonderful thing provided one does not have to suffer later on its account.  I have also heard Government speakers talk about the present state of our economy, how good it is and what the Government have done in bringing that about.  I give credit to them for everything good they have <Col N="2470" /> done.  Nonetheless I contend it is somewhat small-minded not to acknowledge that the Coalition Government of Deputy Garret FitzGerald set the scene for this recovery.  To talk about inflation having been reduced, not paying the slightest attention to the fact that it was at 21 per cent when the Coalition Government of Deputy FitzGerald assumed office and at something of the order of 4 per cent when they left office, surely is closing one's eyes to reality? While one can adopt a very confident line in speeches one must also give credit where it is due.  Cothrom na Féinne has always been important.  There could be no improvement in the economy without first reducing the rate of inflation but with inflation going through the roof how one could ask for wage restraint or keep down the cost of living?</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the improvement in our exports and balance of payments but the first improvements were brought about by the Coalition Government under Deputy Garret FitzGerald.  There is no point in Deputies getting up in this House to repeat nothing happened until this Government took over; nothing would have happened if the ground work had not been done.  Indeed much more might have happened if the Government when in Opposition had adopted a much more realistic approach and had not told the people then that there was no need for cutbacks and that the Government of the day were trying to screw them into the ground.  There has been an improvement in the economy and I welcome it but we should give credit to all sides.</P>
    <P>Turning to the Finance Bill itself, it is time we introduced equality in the taxation system.  In all my time in politics I have found that nothing has led to more divisions in society than the structure of the taxation system.  People will always feel they are paying too much tax and that some sections are not paying their fair share.  I welcome the proposal that the self-employed be taxed on a current year basis.  I believe they could make a <Col N="2471" /> very good case, as one farming organisation has done, for receiving the £800 allowance which PAYE taxpayers receive.  Why should one section of the community receive an allowance while another does not?  I urge the Minister to consider introducing an amendment on Committee Stage which would make this allowance available to all taxpayers.  Failure to do so will lead to further divisions as both the self-employed and farmers will feel that they are being discriminated against.  The self-employed also have their grievances and we should do everything in our power to change the system so that the PAYE taxpayers, the self-employed and farmers will not feel the others are getting away with murder.  The first step we should take is to make the allowances which are available to PAYE taxpayers available to the self-employed and the allowances which are available to the self-employed available to PAYE taxpayers.</P>
    <P>Nowhere are the divisions more apparent than when it comes to applications for third level grants.  PAYE taxpayers have to produce their P60 form and if they are found to be £5 over the limit no grant will be paid.  Divisions are caused when they see children of self-employed people receive grants.  The reason for this is that the self-employed can list expenses which PAYE taxpayers are unable to claim for.  Admittedly, some of these expenses are legitimate but they are simply complying with the system as laid down.  It is about time that both the self-employed and PAYE taxpayers received the same allowances.  It is grossly unfair that a family should have to pay to put their child through third level while knowing that a child of self-employed parents is receiving a grant, although we cannot conclude that each self-employed person or farmer with many acres of land is doing well.  Given the performance of the beef sector during the past year, it is easy to see why the children of farmers qualify for third level grants.  This is a question the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Education must tackle.  They <Col N="2472" /> must sit down together to decide what is allowable.</P>
    <P>In my own county there is a dispute as to whether the children of certain self-employed persons are entitled to receive third level grants.  The academic year is almost complete, yet this dispute is still going on.  It is obvious the Department have passed the buck to the officials in the county councils who say they are complying with the regulations as laid down. It is criminal that this dispute has not been settled given that the students will leave college at the end of May.  This should be tackled as a matter of urgency and we should ensure that this is the last year in which a row will take place over who is entitled to receive third level grants.</P>
    <P>We are not being fair to parents who have to submit their accounts in allowing this dispute to continue.  Some have been asked to give a breakdown of the figures and, as I say, a year has gone by and they still do not know whether their children will receive a grant.  Some of the students do not know if they will be able to return to college for a second year as they are not sure if their parents can afford to send them there.  Many of them went to college on the understanding they would receive the grant.  I hope the Minister will tackle this matter and make reference to it when replying.  Decisions are made on the basis of the information contained in the P60 form and, therefore, we must achieve a balance and ensure people do not end up feeling aggrieved.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister made reference to mortgage relief and defended his positon by stating that those paying mortgages have benefited from the reductions in income tax.  I do not accept this argument because we have to bear in mind that many people took out mortgages when the rate was four percentage points lower and at a time when they were well able to meet their repayments. However, they now find they are unable to meet repayments while obtaining 80 per cent relief.  We are not being fair to these people who, by taking out mortgages, have eased the pressure on the Government to provide housing.  As we <Col N="2473" /> are all aware, house building by local authorities has become a thing of the past.  I am not aware of the position in Dublin but on average Carlow County Council used to build 55 houses per year but this year we are going to build 14. The waiting list is getting longer and longer and this is why people should be encouraged to take out mortgages.  The Minister missed a golden opportunity to increase the amount of relief available and grant 100 per cent relief on interest paid on mortgages.  He should have grasped the nettle and done so.  The Minister indicated they have benefited from the reduction in income tax but he should remember they are not the only ones who have benefited.  They are not the only ones who are gaining as a result of the reduction in income tax but they have certainly stuck their necks out by trying to build their own houses and we should acknowledge that.</P>
    <P>The whole question of covenant payments needs to be looked at.  It is confined to 5 per cent of the parents' salary.  There is no limit on other people.  The very people who need these covenants, because they could not get third level grants perhaps, are the people with two children in university.  If one pays for one child the 5 per cent limit is used up.  I do not know why this 5 per cent limit is put on parents and I suppose it does not take a great genius to see a way around it.  For that reason the fairest thing would be to remove the 5 per cent limit on deeds of covenant where parents are concerned. If one pays for one's children in university and one does not get tax relief on that, a covenant at least gives one a break.  It is grossly unfair to taxpayers that they are paying out money for university fees and cannot get any relief if they have already paid 5 per cent of their income in one deed of covenant.  It can be got around easily.  People should not be forced to abuse the system.  I hope the Minister will reconsider that for Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I was very disappointed because of all the hype beforehand about the threshold levels for inheritance tax.  It is very hard to understand how limits set up 15 years ago have not changed.  The fact that it is <Col N="2474" /> being index-linked for this year proves that it was too low.  It has been argued that a person who gets a farm worth £200,000 is very lucky but if he has not got the money to pay the tax and has to start selling the land, it is rather like being left a jumbo jet and not being able to use it for want of the price of the petrol to run it.  A person who inherits a huge hotel, if it is his livelihood, has to have the money to back it.  We cannot compete in Europe and expect young farmers to go into debt as soon as they get a farm where instead of investing money in the land they have to borrow money.  The same applies in business.  It looks very glamorous to see a person taking over a big business but there are so many overheads that if they are clobbered straight away with a bill for £50,000 they are off to a bad start.  The inheritance tax should have been index-linked from the time it was set up because it was not set up at a certain level in the seventies just for the sake of it.  It should be index-linked right along and then we could start off with this year as the base and keep adding on from here.  Otherwise people will be in difficulty.  The official response from Revenue seems to be that before a person inherited land they did not have that much land and therefore, they could sell some of it to pay the tax.  However, farms are not just sold off in pieces. Neither can one sell off part of a shop.  If one is giving employment and producing goods that should be enough.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to some of the allowances being given.  I was appalled to find that so many widows have found their widows pension reduced by 3 per cent because of PRSI payments. This has not gone down very well.  They are getting almost nothing because I believe the extra benefit is half disability benefit.  It is amazing that when somebody loses a partner, instead of getting extra help they are suddenly left on their own and will not even get a married person's allowance.  I cannot see why a person who has to take on the running of a family on their own should suffer. Should we not be giving further help because that person more than likely will <Col N="2475" /> have to pay someone to come in and mind the children?  Would it not be more in our line to give them an extra allowance to help them to get over their difficulties than to clobber them by reducing them to an in-between status between being single and being married when it comes to allowances, in this case putting a 3 per cent tax on them for PRSI which will be of very little benefit to them.  During the budget debate I said I was interested in seeing what PRSI payments public servants will have to pay.  I predicted that it might put the cat among the pigeons later on.  I do not know what progress has been made on the matter but we will be lucky to get away with 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the growth of the economy and how well we are doing.  It was said we had an increase of 13,000 jobs last year.  I am beginning to wonder if we are like Alice in Wonderland or Rip Van Winkle just waking up.  Does this labour force survey mean that all that was done previously was done the wrong way?  Where did all these jobs come from?  If people are emigrating at the rate they are, how could we possibily be creating these jobs?  Unemployment is staying as it is; emigration is increasing. I suppose if we did not have FÁS schemes and other temporary jobs we would have far more unemployed.  Women are certainly being taken off the unemployment list because no matter how they try to prove they are looking for work they are being told that they are not making a proper effort.  We have an artificial cutting down of the unemployment figures. We have a growth of a mythical 13,000 jobs.  I would like to know what exactly is happening in this area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey mentioned delays in headage payments and so on.  It must be policy to delay payments.  Certainly there is no defence this year.  Things are chaotic.  Payments that were always made before Christmas were not going out until February.</P>
    <P>Decentralisation is to be welcomed but it does not look as if the decentralisation that took place in the past few years has been very successful or that the transfer <Col N="2476" /> to Cavan brought about greater efficiency.  It seems enough people did not go or if they did their goods and chattels were lost in the train somewhere. The whole thing was chaotic as far as I can see.  At one stage they could not even answer the telephones here in Dublin because they were making such an effort to get the payments out.  That should never happen.  I do not know how farmers put up with that.  Would any of us do without our salaries?  That is what it boils down to.  Headage payments and sheep subsidies were all due.  Farmers also have arrangements with banks and with their own families and they suddenly find that there are delays of a few weeks and then another few weeks.  These things should not happen.  The numbers may vary up or down but there is a standard payment and it should not cause any great hassle.</P>
    <P>Urban renewal has been mentioned and I welcome it as long as it does not cause a complete imbalance in a town.  If the old part of a town is not renewed but rather a new shopping centre is opened in a different part of the town, it is just bringing business from one part of the town to another.  It gives unequal advantage to new businesses which may last a few years during which they have special rates of tax and so on and might then go out of business while the long established businesses that might be there for 100 years will have to compete with them. There will not be a level playing pitch because these established businesses will be at a disadvantage straight away.  With urban renewal we should ensure that the old parts of towns are brought up to date and people are encouraged to renovate derelict sites and repair old buildings.  I would welcome that but I am concerned that it might cause havoc in a town.</P>
    <P>I hope, as I have said, that the hiccup as regards income will only be temporary and that the country will benefit at the end of the year.  I hope the Minister will consider some of the matters I have raised, in particular equality in taxation, widows' rights, inheritance tax levels and the question of giving allowances to the self employed equal to those given to the PAYE sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister for Finance on bringing forward this very impressive legislation.  The purpose of the Bill, as we all know, is to give effect to the various provisions of the budget of 1990.  Included also are a number of very detailed changes in our elaborate system of tax law.  The various provisions in the Bill will come to be dealt with at Committee Stage.  Looking through the Bill one cannot but be impressed by the great amount of detailed work which went into its preparation and I think it is only right that we in this House should acknowledge the competence and professionalism of the various sections of the public service which helped the Minister to bring the Bill forward.</P>
      <P>My congratulations to the Minister apply also, of course, to the budget which he introduced in this House on 31 January 1990.</P>
      <P>I think therefore that in commenting at this Second Reading Stage on the Bill it would be well to recall to the House some of the broad points of policy for the future and reports on the budgetary results of the past three years which the Minister gave us on budget day.  Budget 1990 and the Finance Bill 1990 are important steps on the way to achieving the objectives of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the National Development Plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two of the greatest problems which the Government have to contend with are the high levels of unemployment and the great difficulties of people at lower levels of income.  It is generally agreed that the first step in dealing with these two major problems of unemployment and lower income is the putting in order of the public finances.  The area of public finances has been very efficiently managed over the years since 1987.  That management has brought around a greatly strengthened confidence in the economy of this country not only within the country itself but within the many places in Europe and outside of Europe where decisions can be made which would be of <Col N="2478" /> benefit or of disadvantage to us depending on the view taken of how we are managing our affairs.</P>
    <P>Under this broad heading of control of the public finances there are two major barometers of progress.  One is the rate of inflation and the other our own internal costs which affect every aspect of our economy.  Keeping costs at competitive levels is all important.  That importance grows as we approach the increased economic integration within the European Community which is already beginning to take effect and which it is intended to have fully in operation on 1 January 1993.</P>
    <P>I think it is as well also to recall briefly some of the major pointers to success in Government policy which were set out in the Minister's Budget Statement.  In 1989 the growth of real gross national product is estimated to have been 3 per cent, a very impressive figure.  The effects of this increase and the results of Government policy are to be seen in the increase by more than 30,000 in the number of jobs in the private non-agricultural sectors in the two year period April 1987 to April 1989.  Non-agricultural employment is estimated to have grown by some 13,000 in 1989 and this despite necessary reductions in public service staffing.  This figure matches closely the decrease of 12,000 in the numbers on the live register at the end of the year 1989.</P>
    <P>There are a few more facts which I would like to quote in order to emphasise the very good effects of Government policy over the past three years.  If we continue to do our work properly we can look forward to inflation of less than 3 per cent by the end of 1990.  Another very encouraging figure is that in 1989 Government borrowing at 2.4 per cent of GNP was at its lowest for about 40 years.</P>
    <P>I think it is well to recount these figures briefly in view of the Bill which we are now discussing.  They are extremely relevant to the deliberations on that Bill. They are equally relevant to the day-to-day problems which all Members of this House have to deal with in the course of work in their constituencies.  I refer in particular to the problems of people who are looking for work or the problems of <Col N="2479" /> those who find it very difficult to manage on low incomes.  Broad indications of how the economy is improving may be of no great immediate comfort to somebody looking for a job.  Nevertheless it is true that the hope for an improved future must be based on broad facts concerning the improvement of the economy which I have just been referring to very briefly. There is also, of course, the very important aspect of this Bill and of the budget in regard to improving the lot of people who are on low incomes.  Budget 1990 made significant improvements in the lot of these people.  Noticeable increases were given in weekly welfare payments including pensioners, the long-term unemployed and other categories.  In addition to this, very acceptable improvements were made to help taxpayers on low incomes.</P>
    <P>If I were asked to summarise the good points about budget 1990 and the Finance Bill which we are now discussing I would say that both measures are on target as regards Government policy to improve the lot of all our people in this year and in the years ahead.  In order to make sure that we achieve our objectives the policies of the last three years in regard to putting the economy back on the right road must be followed.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn for a little while to some areas which concern me more closely in my responsibilities as Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food.  I referred earlier to the great importance of maintaining our internal costs in this country at competitive levels.  This particular factor has been brought home very forcibly to me in recent months, particularly with regard to the mushroom industry for which I have responsibility.  That industry as we all know has made particularly noteworthy progress in recent years.  Production increased from a base of 6,800 tonnes in 1980 to 31,000 tonnes in 1989. That 1989 production was valued at £35 million and the greater part of the production is exported to the United Kingdom market.  I refer to that market in particular because of the very noticeable <Col N="2480" /> change which has taken place over the past six months or so in the relative values of the Irish pound and the pound sterling.</P>
    <P>For the first nine months of 1989 the exchange rate was of the order of 84p sterling to the Irish pound.  In recent months however this exchange rate has moved up well into the mid and high 90s. The result has been a price drop of about 6p a pound to the Irish producer.  This is a serious drop in returns for the very many people throughout the country who have put very hard work into the development of this industry and who are depending on it for their livelihood.</P>
    <P>As I have told this House already in the course of a debate in the past month, I have had a number of meetings with representatives of both the mushroom growers and the companies exporting the mushrooms.  I impressed very strongly on the groups I met that they should give the greatest possible attention to the matters which were under their own control, especially their own costs and the efficiency of their production methods.  I think it is worth saying here that many growers in this country are getting upwards of 20p per pound less for their mushrooms than the growers of higher quality produce elsewhere.  As far as mushroom yields are concerned, some growers are getting yields of about 30 per cent lower than the best growers.  There is clear scope for improvement.</P>
    <P>Fluctuations in exchange rates are at risk which traders generally have to contend with.  However, I would like to draw attention here to a statement made by the Minister for Finance already in this House that it is the clear policy of the Government to link the exchange rate firmly with the European monetary system.  In this way we can reduce inflationery pressures, achieve a stable low rate of inflation and consequently improve competitiveness.  I think we have here in regard to the mushroom industry a very clear example of what I have already been saying in regard to the Government's economic policy, i.e. that the pursuit of a policy aimed at fostering a more competitive environment for Irish business is still the most effective way in <Col N="2481" /> which the Government can assist exporters including, of course, mushroom exporters, to compete effectively in the United Kingdom and other markets.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the mushroom industry I would like to tell the House that a review of the industry is in the course of being carried out with a view to a strategy for medium and long term development. The Department of Agriculture and Food, Bord Glas, IDA, CTT and, of course, the industry itself are involved in this review.</P>
    <P>I hope very shortly to be announcing the membership of the new Board Glas to be set up under the provisions of the Bord Glas Act, 1990.  I am looking forward to close co-operation with the new board in the carrying on of the work of developing our horticultural industry. For this work a very good headline has been set by the interim Bord Glas.  Still on the matters connected with Bord Glas, I would like also to tell the House that the interim board set up a sub-group to consider the possibilities of developing organic farming.  That work has now been broadened out by the special section to deal with organic farming which has been set up in the Department of Agriculture and Food.  This sector has possibilities of development which could have very useful economic effects including, of course, the improvement of employment possibilities and the increase of export opportunities.</P>
    <P>On the general subject of economic development there are some major points I would like to refer to very briefly here.  We are all aware of the importance of the current round of GATT negotiations. An important meeting was held on this subject in Mexico in the past week and I am going to a meeting of Community Agriculture Ministers and Agriculture Ministers from other European countries which will be held in Austria in the coming week.  Agriculture is a very important issue, but not the only issue, in the current round of negotiations.</P>
    <P>Ireland in common with its partners in the European Community wishes to see an overall outcome to the negotiations which will give mutual advantage and <Col N="2482" /> increased benefits for all participants. The European Community is the world's largest importer and the second largest exporter of agriculture and food products and, indeed, as the world's biggest exporter in overall terms, has a vital interest in ensuring that world markets function satisfactorily.  This includes establishing a fair and market-oriented trading system for agricultural trade.</P>
    <P>In the negotiations to date the Community has adopted a realistic, comprehensive and consistent approach to agriculture.  We have expressed a willingness to seek out better ways to manage international markets and to re-define GATT rules and procedures.  The negotiating proposals which the Community has put forward are consistent with the objectives of the negotiations and also with the policies which have applied internally in the Community since 1984. Other participants in the negotiations have put forward their views on how the objectives of this GATT round should be attained.  While the Community is reasonably open in its negotiating position, the eventual outcome must enable us to continue to maintain viable rural societies.</P>
    <P>Of relevance to my remarks about the GATT are the negotiations going on these days in Brussels to enable the Council of Agriculture Ministers to take decisions on the Commission proposals for the 1990-1991 price proposals.  Anybody who has any experience of these negotiations at the Agriculture Council will know that they are far from easy.  I know that my colleagues, Minister O'Kennedy, in his position as President of the Council and Minister of State, Joe Walsh, who is the Irish spokesman, are giving their best to see that there is a fair outcome for the Community and for Ireland.</P>
    <P>I would like to make two more points before I conclude.  The first is to draw the attention of the House to an announcement I made earlier today about the 1990 flood damage relief scheme.  The scheme will assist farmers who have suffered genuine hardship as a result of livestock, fodder and grazing losses arising from <Col N="2483" /> flooding earlier this year.  I would like to add that this is a once off measure because of the exceptionally difficult circumstances with which farmers had to cope.  This is not the first occasion on which I have spoken in the House on this issue and I am glad that the Government have put me in a position to announce the details of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Finally, and I deal with a concern which affects me in my position as Deputy for a Border county, I would like to express again my appreciation of the actions taken by the Minister for Finance in regard to excise duties payable on televisions, videos and camcorders.  As the House knows, traders in Border areas have for a considerable time been subject to a great amount of unfair trading pressure because of imports of these items from outside the State.  I am hopeful that the changes which the Minister has introduced will lead to increased trade for businesses in Border counties and to the curbing of illegal imports.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Finance Bill, 1990 and I wish it a speedy passage through the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I listened with interest to the Minister of State's reference to the GATT round and I am reassured that he and the Government are paying considerable attention to that area.  I would ask that they convey to our European colleagues the importance of ensuring the future of the agricultural production sector from a European point of view.  Whatever else may prevail in politics worldwide, one thing is certain. The job of European representatives is to have regard to world politics but to have a prior regard to the need to ensure that production in the food sector is assured of a healthy future right across Europe.  We do not want to have a situation which has prevailed for some years whereby other much more affluent nations have used mechanisms to offload cheap feed supplements into the European market with the result that huge surpluses were created which ultimately <Col N="2484" /> caused problems for European farmers but more particularly for Irish producers who are more dependent on this than most.</P>
      <P>I listened with interest to the various speakers on the Government side of the House.  Their enthusiasm never ceases to amaze me.  One thing that could be deduced was that each speaker responded with even greater enthusiasm than his predecessor on the basis that the country was virtually booming.  I am surprised that out on the streets huge changes are not taking place, that the stock market, Wall Street, Tokyo and all the major markets have not been shaken by the huge input of enthusiasm from that side of the House and particularly the strong and firm foundations that the Government have laid.  One can only compare that to the guy who is trying to teach a parrot to talk.  He feels that by repeating the message often enough the message will get across and that he will not have to say it anymore.  I am sorry to disillusion anybody on that side of the House that reality is far from the picture that has been painted by the Government.</P>
      <P>If we want to talk in this House about stability in the economy &mdash; and in the financial markets there may well be stability &mdash; I can assure you that in the households throughout the country the same degree of stability does not extend.  The same degree of stability does not extend to the 70,000 young people who left this country in the past 12 months and a similar number who left last year and the previous year.  The degree of stability which we have heard about this evening obviously is little reassurance to those people who are in London or, perhaps, illegally in Boston, New York or elsewhere. It is of little reassurance to the people who have left the shores of this island to seek employment elsewhere.  It is of little reassurance to those people who have known, as we have known, that employment has been virtually taxed out of existence by PRSI and other charges. I do not want to go into too much detail in that area at present because I intend to refer to it at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2485" /> All the accolades that have been given to the Government by the various speakers on their side of the House count for very little when one considers the real situation which is that we have 250,000 people unemployed.  We have exported another 250,000 in the past three years. Interest rates are rising rapidly and dangerously.  In relation to agricultural prices we heard about stability and about structures which are in place.  Agricultural enterprises are becoming less profitable and more people are leaving the land simply because they see no future in it.  We can continue on down that road.</P>
    <P>The one issue that irritates and irks me intently, and which needs to be responded to, is that speakers on that side of the House repeat &mdash; I presume in order to convince themselves &mdash; that good things began to happen in a certain period in 1987, that the misery and the difficulties which existed previously were all resolved, that suddenly the clouds were rolled away, the sun shone, the birds sang in the trees and everything in the garden was rosy.  I know that by repeating this message often enough the speakers on that side of the House probably believe it.  A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I would regard that as the most serious problem.  It is one thing telling the world outside and telling the unfortunate people on this side of the House that things are in a certain way but it is much more serious if they actually believe it themselves.  If they believe what they said in the House this evening, then I would have to raise serious questions about the various facts and figures which were trotted out over the past two or three years. If they believe what they told us here this evening &mdash; and they expect us to believe it &mdash; then the credibility of the entire story must be called to question.</P>
    <P>Let us look at some of the aspects of the Finance Bill.  I welcome the increases in the income tax exemptions.  Like many things they sound great.  Everybody comes along to our clinics and say: &ldquo;This is great, it will be fantastic, we will be tax free next year, we will get a virtual handout&rdquo;. Then they receive their certificates <Col N="2486" /> of tax-free allowances and at certain income tax levels some are tax free, some who will have to pay more than previously, but the allowances are not in any way dramatically increased.  The poor unfortunate people who were looking forward to this bonanza are disappointed. They are disappointed simply because in the presentation of figures the various thresholds are introduced in such a way as to make it look attractive.  In reality when the unfortunate person receives his first paypacket after 5 April the fun starts and this year was no exception.  It was no exception for the number of people who found from January right up to April, if they were unfortunate enough to have moved into a different tax band, that they took home less money as happened in previous years.  The story is still the same.</P>
    <P>The value of the reduction of the rates of income tax must be measured against other increases.  I will not refer too deeply to that at this stage.  The increases I am talking about are the possible benefits that could have accrued to the public, for example, VAT on electricity or telephone charges.  It can be argued on that side of the House that the ESB and Telecom Éireann can absorb the increases. That is not the point.  The point is that a reduction would have accrued to the consumer if the Government had not stepped in and decided that they wanted some of the benefit.  Consumers here who were levied with one of the most expensive electricity and telephone charges in Europe for many years and were at last going to receive some of the benefits and a good telephone and electricity service will not benefit.  It will not be done by way of a levy but we will impose it on the board or the company providing the service.  However, the consumers will be affected ultimately because they will not get the benefit of any reduction in costs. Very little was said by the other side of the House on this matter.  It will take about one year before the negative aspects are felt.  I would not expect the people on that side of the House to say it too often or each speaker to say it but now and again I would have expected some speakers to mention in passing that <Col N="2487" /> these aspects were also related to the budget and the Finance Bill, and, as we know, the Finance Bill is the mechanism which gives statutory effect to the budget.</P>
    <P>Another item is the reduction of life assurance tax relief.  That is an interesting one.  One thing that was brought home to me when I first read about that &mdash; again it was not repeated very much on that side of the House &mdash; was that young single people in the one area where they could possibly do something for themselves by way of savings and giving themselves a little bit of income tax relief was through life assurance but we have started at last to take that on board and erode it a little further.  Is it any wonder that 75,000 of them have left the country, that they have not confidence enough in this economy to remain here?  Why should they when we do not seem to have regard to the fact that single people in particular are the very people who are highest taxed, they have little or no allowances, that in many cases they do not have mortgages and so on, yet we decide to clobber them?  There was very little reference to that on the other side of the House.  I was disappointed.  I would have thought at least one or two of the backbenchers would have created some kind of row about that and suggested that somewhere in future budgets or Finance Bills or even in this Finance Bill a little innocuous amendment could be introduced whereby the unfortunate victims of this atrocity would at least be aware that somebody had concern for their plight.</P>
    <P>Now we come to mortgage interest relief, something I have not figured out fully yet.  We know that with 1992 on the horizon everybody is calling for the harmonisation of taxes, excise duties and so forth.  While a certain amount of harmonisation is taking place, ironically it is taking place in such a way as to have a negative impact on the Irish consumer. In other words, we are introducing the penalty parts of it.  We are not so enthusiastic about introducing the other more positive aspects of tax harmonisation which would bring us into line with our <Col N="2488" /> colleagues in the rest of Europe.  This is serious because we are going to have to do so in the next couple of years.  In the meantime all we are doing is penalising a number of people simply by chipping away at the little concessions they have and at the same time giving no recognition to the fact that out there are those who are buying cars, petrol, diesel and a whole host of consumer goods and who are looking on and wondering whether there could be a catch in it.  Could there be some little trick up somebody's sleeve whereby the consumer could be disappointed? I hope not because if that is so, serious problems will exist not only for this country but also for the EC.</P>
    <P>At a time when interest rates are at their highest for some several years, when house prices have inflated out of all proportion, when people are borrowing and getting new loans in an attempt to look after themselves in terms of housing, we decide to continue the trend of reducing mortgage interest relief.  In the current year there should have been a restoration of the relief that existed in the past.  That would have been an obvious gesture, a recognition of the people who are working hard to supply themselves with housing, who are supporting the building industry by causing houses to be built.  All we have done this year is to leave relief as it was.  That is negative but, obviously, views on this differ.  My attitude to it is that anybody who has had a mortgage for less than ten years is hit hard by increases in interest rates while anybody who has had a mortgage for more than 20 years will at this stage have gained the benefit of mortgage interest relief for all those years.  It is all very fine for people in the latter category to say that we should abolish mortgage interest relief but those people who have bought houses in the last five or ten years and who have young families who are expensive in terms of schooling and the provision of clothing, footwear and so on, are at least entitled to a recognition of their plight.  A time when house prices have increased out of all proportion should have been the ideal time to restore the kind of mortgage relief that existed a <Col N="2489" /> few years ago.  There are those who will say that such a suggestion is flying in the face of what 1992 and the harmonisation of taxes is all about.  That may well be, but when we want to do so in other areas we are quite good at introducing things that fly in the face of 1992.  For the very useful and constructive reasons I have just set out, mortgage interest relief should have been restored to its former level.</P>
    <P>I note the extension in relation to stock relief for farmers.  That may be useful to a limited extent.</P>
    <P>Those who are members of local authorities must realise that VAT is a huge cost, a burden that private enterprise does not have.  This tax so far as local authorities are concerned serves no useful purpose.  All it does is impose directly a burden on a body who are subservient to the Department of the Environment, an unnecessary financial burden which is not at all beneficial to the provision of services nor conducive to efficiency or the better delivery of services. It is the one issue that has come up year after year at local authority estimates meetings and it should be referred to on both sides of the House in this debate.  As a member of a local authority I would be very remiss in my duty if I did not raise that issue now.  There are those who will say that relief from that burden is not feasible but many other things that were supposed not to have been feasible have been attempted.  Indeed people on the other side of the House this very evening have even attempted to justify some of those impossible and totally unfeasible things.  I see no reason at all that there should not have been an attempt to alleviate that burden at a time when it has become acceptable for private enterprise to carry out many of the tasks that were previously undertaken by local authorities.  I do not want to delay the proceedings of the House any further on that, but I think it should be looked at.  I am disappointed that greater consideration was not given to it.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers have referred to the ICMSA's campaign for the introduction of PAYE and PRSI allowance as it <Col N="2490" /> applies to the PAYE sector.  I accept that fully.  If the same system of taxation is to apply &mdash; there may be differing views as to whether it should &mdash; then let it apply and let the same concessions apply.  If the farming community are going to pay their tax in the current year, as opposed to the former practice when they paid in respect of the previous year, the same concessions as apply to other sectors should apply to them.  I am disappointed that that was not taken into account.</P>
    <P>From time to time we all make a case in terms of how it relates specifically to our constituents.  While that may be done in the interest of political expediency, it is not always in that best interests of society as a whole.  We should all try to be as fair as possible regardless of whether there exists within our constituencies the urban-rural division that seems to have developed in recent years.  That is divisive, destructive and unhelpful in our society.  I will elaborate on that issue on another occasion.</P>
    <P>The farming lobby has requested an adjustment in the thresholds that apply to inheritance tax.  In the early seventies if an agricultural property was passed on to a son or a daughter the amount of duty levied in some cases made it impossible for those people to continue with the enterprise.  On occasions when the property had to revert back to the original owner that person had to pay a huge sum in duties.  That system was changed and other taxes were introduced but no regard has been had for the dramatic increases in the value of property in the last 18 months.  As a result agricultural property will have to be sold if people are to pay the duties levied on them. Families have worked all their lives to improve their holdings and they are now being forced to sell them.  The morality of that is highly questionable.  I appeal to the Members opposite to use their influence with the Government to bring about a change in that system this year. It is still not too late to do so.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the question of transport costs.  If one discusses transport costs with those involved in the haulage <Col N="2491" /> business in any part of the country, one quickly gets the message that the costs here are considerably higher than in any other European country.  That is because of the duties they have to pay and the many obstacles that are placed in their way, some by the institutions of State and others by nature.  I accept that as an island nation on the western extremity of Europe our transport costs to the other member states will be high but I do not think they should be as high as 50 per cent more than our competitors.  If we are serious about encouraging our industrialists to compete on the so-called level playing pitch of Europe we should ensure that our transport costs are below those of our competitors.</P>
    <P>We should give our industrialists the same chance as their competitors on the Continent.  If we do not improve their position after 1992 our hauliers will register outside the country.  They will gain if they do that.  Big vehicles from the UK and the Continent can be seen on all our roads.  They can operate more effectively here if they are based outside the country. One must take into consideration the many costs that our hauliers must face, such as replacing broken springs and burst tyres.  There is a strong case for having another look at the VAT and excise duties levied on fuel and other items used by the transport industry.  It is easy to justify the need for a change.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the opening of the Channel Tunnel will reduce transport costs of British hauliers.  How do we propose to counter that?  Do we erect a bridge or construct a tunnel?  In my view we should use the existing ferry system and reduce the costs to our hauliers.  We should make it attractive for such firms to locate here by reducing the VAT and excise duties that they must pay.  If we do not, they will move out.</P>
    <P>In response to a parliamentary question some time ago, I was given information about the level of start-ups or installation grants available to farmers here, in Britain and in the rest of Europe. I was surprised to learn that up to 40,000 ECUs are available to young French <Col N="2492" /> farmers for start-up or installation purposes. I admit that some European countries do not give their young farmers such assistance but we depend very heavily on the food industry, as the Minister of State opposite is aware.  I accept that the French Government, because of their big industrial base, can afford to meet the cost of assisting young farmers but notwithstanding that we should bear in mind our dependance on agriculture. Our climate is ideal for the growing of crops and if we do not capitalise on our assets, particularly in the context of 1992, we will not gain anything from our membership of the community when all barriers and tariffs are removed.  The Government should take a hard look at that.  We have been told on many occasions that by 1992 all members of the Community will be treated equally, but I wonder if that will be the case because we are not receiving equal treatment at present.</P>
    <P>Stamp duty on house property is causing serious difficulties for young couples. Up to now their savings of £3,000 or £4,000 was sufficient as a deposit on a house but that is no longer the position. When the legal fees and the stamp duty on second-hand houses are taken into account, bearing in mind the huge increase in prices, they require in the region of £10,000 as a deposit.</P>
    <P>The last point I wish to make may not be relevant to the debate but it is important that I should raise it.  In the contributions from the Government side I did not hear one word about our health services.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt that my comment will prove to be in order.  All Members at local authority estimates meetings or in debates on Finance Bills or budgets refer to the health services. As a member of a health board I can say that we are far from having an adequate health service.  With each passing day we are getting further and further away from <Col N="2493" /> one.  I ask Members on the Government side to support the unfortunate Minister for Health and try to loosen up the system.  Otherwise we will shortly have to warn people of about 40 years of age that when they get old and are unable to work all their PRSI will be null and void, there will be no recognition of the payments made and they will be charged for everything.  If a person gets a stroke, becomes immobile or incontinent the Government will not do anything to help them.  I am sorry to have to say such a sad and harsh thing but I do so deliberately because, unless somebody urgently tackles this area in the very near future, we will not have a health service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest to Deputy Durkan and I agree with his comments regarding aid to young farmers.  However, I am sure he is mindful of the fact that the Government in their wisdom reinstituted installation grants for young farmers recently.  It was a very welcome move which I am sure Deputy Durkan welcomed.</P>
      <P>Before I speak on the Bill I should like to make a few comments on another matter.  I am very disappointed that Deputy Rabbitte or some of his cohorts are not here tonight because some of his negative comments earlier in the day deserve a response.  He spoke in very derogatory terms about the present Administration's efforts in regard to job creation and he talked about complacency but his remarks ring very hollow in view of my experience of Deputy Rabbitte and his party and their philosophy. They were the instrument of closing down firms in Cork and Longford and Veha in my own constituency of Wicklow. Deputy Rabbitte went in there like the pied piper.  He was not leading rats, but human beings &mdash; along the road of commercial and industrial suicide.  We had a thriving industry in Wicklow which, alas, went to the wall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Veha were a thriving concern but they went to the wall because of the philosophy of The Workers' Party and Deputy Rabbitte.  By virtue of his advice <Col N="2494" /> and tactics he led the workforce into suicidal activity and closed the firm which was the life blood of Wicklow town and its hinterland.  That is the gentleman who today had the gall to talk in derogatory terms about the complacency of the Government in regard to job creation.</P>
    <P>After Deputy Rabbitte was elected to this House, having closed down operations in Cork, Longford and Wicklow, he then tried to close Liberty Hall by putting a picket on it.  The suicidal tendencies of the Deputy and his party are a malaise, a myxomatosis type of disease which consumes, destroys and decays all it touches.  That has been our experience in Wicklow of Deputy Rabbitte and his party.  Their philosophies and policies are outmoded and have proved to be inerable.</P>
    <P>This Administration have been doing their utmost to create jobs.  The industrial output has been magnificant over the past three years.  However, nobody can explain why, although macro-economics are working extremely well, they do not result in job creation.  I do not believe that anybody in the House can explain why this is so.  I cannot although I have been in business all my life.  I am totally frustrated in this regard and I cannot come to terms with the reasons for the failure to create jobs.  The upward trend in the economy, the industrial output and the balance of trade have not resulted in job creation.  We must address the problem to ensure that there is an improvement in this area.</P>
    <P>Mr. Michael Smurfit is one of our most esteemed, experienced and successful businessmen.  He spoke recently about the Minister for Finance and I should like to quote from <i>The Irish Independent</i> of Saturday, 7 April 1990.  He said:</P>
    <P>With the economy facing the combined problems of unemployment, emigration, high taxation levels and a large national debt, I welcome comments by the Minister for Finance, Albert Reynolds, who said recently that sustainable jobs could not be created by injecting State funds into the economy.  How I wish the previous <Col N="2495" /> Ministers had shared the same views as Mr. Reynolds....  A more realistic method of tackling unemployment is for the Government to continue to control the public finances which had resulted in an air of quiet optimism returning to the country.</P>
    <P>The aim of Fianna Fáil since they came into office has been to go along the road referred to by that entrepreneur <i>par excellence</i>, Michael Smurfit.  When the Fianna Fáil Government under the leadership of the Taoiseach, Deputy Charles J. Haughey, came into office in 1987 they set about restoring the confidence that had been lacking in the despicable Administration which had been in office for the previous four and a half to five years.  That Administration left us with a national debt with which we cannot cope, and rising emigration and unemployment, which is a plague on our nation at this time.</P>
    <P>That Government set about improving these problems in a methodical way.  As I have said in this Chamber before, the Taoiseach and his Administration took these problems by the scruff of the neck and slowly and methodically set about creating that air of confidence which is necessary if business, trade and commerce are to flourish.  Trade is flourishing at present and the figures are there to prove it.  I will not reiterate the figures referred to by many of my colleagues during their contributions.  However as I have said, even though industrial output and the balance of trade have been increased jobs are not being created.  This is a phenomenon and we will have to continue to tackle it.</P>
    <P>This Administration have also addressed the service area, in particular tourism which is creating jobs.  When the previous Government took office in 1987 they set a target of doubling the number of tourists coming to Ireland over a five year period &mdash; they are well on the way towards meeting this target even though we are only half way through that five year period &mdash; and Martin Dully was given that mandate.  He has done an <Col N="2496" /> excellent job with the support of the Government.</P>
    <P>The people in my constituency did not bother too much about tourism heretofore because they were doing very well in terms of the number of jobs being created by industry.  As a result of a fall off in for example, the fertiliser and pottery industries the hungry fighter syndrome took over and the people in County Wicklow started developing the tourism potential as a result of the example set by this Administration whose efforts are paying dividends, creating jobs and they have given new hope to the county and to the country as a whole.  The Minister for Tourism and Transport, Deputy Séamus Brennan, will visit County Wicklow next Friday to launch a new tourism company which is the brain child of Wicklow County Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>This will help to keep the graph going in the right direction so far as tourism and job creation are concerned. We can boast about our job creation activities in the tourism area in which we are all very interested.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has responsibility for the Office of Public Works and in recent times he referred to establishing a national park in County Wicklow which will take in the mountain plateau.  The development of this park will give real prospects for job creation by expanding tourism and opening up to the world the beauty and assets in that area.  This park will be of great significance in creating jobs in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the development of a national park in County Wicklow is welcomed by the people of that county, and the people of Dublin who live on the periphery area and it will be a playground for them, I want to point out that interests of the people who live within the confines and on the periphery of the national park will have to be made a priority.  Any improvements to the park must not mean a disimprovement in their lifestyle or <Col N="2497" /> their plans for the future.  A landowner who lives within the confines of the national park and worked his land for generations must not have his plans to build a house on the land interfered with.  I do not want outside bodies such as Bord Fáilte or the Office of Public Works being able to object to legitimate planning permissions which have been granted by the local authority in their wisdom or otherwise.  I can see signs that this is happening at present.  I will be very vociferous in my opposition to any such interference by Bord Fáilte or the Office of Public Works though interference is welcome within the context of tourism thrust, national and international progress in this area.</P>
    <P>The building industry has been referred to by a number of speakers on the far side of the House and the word &ldquo;booming&rdquo; was used on more than one occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank you, Sir, for having facilitated me in my request to raise this matter on the Adjournment, one that has been debated on many previous occasions in this House.  Unfortunately, despite the debate which has taken place, no progress is yet in evidence. The necessity, reasoning and logic of having a Shannon Estuary Authority is unquestionable.  All the political parties in this House have debated its necessity on one or more occasions when it appeared in principle there was agreement around this House that such an <Col N="2498" /> estuary authority be established.  Unfortunately, the necessary legislation aiming to set up such a body also seemed doomed to failure on more than one occasion.</P>
      <P>Of itself the Shannon Estuary constitutes a tremendous resource not only to the north-west Munster region but to the whole of the West.  It is unfortunate that on this occasion one must seek some clarification from the Government in order to reintroduce some activity into the otherwise total lack of action on the part of a Government who seem to the outsider to be totally divided and split on the formation of a Shannon Estuary authority.</P>
      <P>The development and utilisation of the Shannon Estuary in the past has been confused.  The involvement of disparate bodies has not assisted in the utilisation or development of this resource.  It is now of grave urgency that this Government take some initiative, at least seek the agreement of this House, on the future of a body to regulate and develop this resource.  On the last occasion of such a discussion in this House I aired my views contending that as a matter of urgency we should seek agreement among all the parties in this House.  I do not believe the Shannon Estuary is the prerogative of any of the parties in this House.  I contend the issue is bigger than the political parties. It is unfortunate that it has been made a political issue at local and national level.</P>
      <P>On the formation of the present Government I asked whether some action would be taken.  Unfortunately the Minister's escape clause was that a report was being sought.  The number of reports prepared already in relation to the Shannon Estuary would be greater than any prepared in relation to any of our other waterways.  I do not believe there is any other information that can be gleaned by any other experts in relation to the Shannon Estuary.  What is now needed is action on the part of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister of State present to inform the House specifically whether the Government have discussed legislation in relation to this area, <Col N="2499" /> whether they are in a position to introduce such legislation and if the divisions between the Leader of the Progressive Democrats, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State himself in relation to the establishment of an estuary authority have been overcome. Unless the Minister of State is in a position to state that those divisions have been overcome this is a pointless exercise and there will not be a Shannon Estuary authority established in the near future. Consequently any possibility of development in the Shannon Estuary will be impeded.</P>
    <P>We in County Kerry are particularly concerned at the lack of development in relation to the Tarbert-Ballylongford land bank now under the auspices of Shannon Development who are setting out to reappraise prospects of development in that area.  Even after such reappraisal the necessity for the establishment of a single estuary authority will remain necessary.  If that is not done then the relevant local authorities, Shannon Development and the various harbour commissioners will all be seeking a slice of the action whereas one single estuary authority, irrespective of its location, would be in a position to go out and market the estuary and its facilities.  The counties of Clare, Limerick, Kerry and indeed Tipperary are suffering in terms of economic development because of the failure of the Government to make any progress in this area.</P>
    <P>It would be my hope that the Minister of State could give the House some indication this evening whether the Government have at least discussed or recognised the necessity for the establishment of such a body and whether they have resolved their difficulties.  If the Minister is not in a position to so inform us then he should inform the House categorically that, because of the differences obtaining between the Progressive Democrats and the Fianna Fáil Party, there are no prospects for the establishment of this estuarial authority.  It would then become incumbent on the Opposition parties to introduce legislation in the <Col N="2500" /> interests of the development there that I contend to be absolutely necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank my colleague, Deputy Spring, for allowing me some of his time.</P>
      <P>Over the past 15 years there have been many efforts made in this House to introduce legislation for the establishment of a single estuarial authority for the Shannon Estuary.  Despite those efforts there obtains fragmentation, no co-ordination, indeed a total lack of development in that region.  Apart from the ESB station in Tarbert, the Kerry bank of the estuary has been totally ignored.  Despite the fact that the IDA amassed a land bank of some 600 acres in the region there has been no development whatsoever in the Tarbert-Ballylongford area, still a green field site.  The Tarbert-Ballylongford land bank has been recognised in the many studies and reports prepared over the past ten years as constituting an area of massive potential.  It remains a green field site with very little immediate prospect of development despite promises by a number of politicians even in recent times.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State present might inform the House whether he would request his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to publish the report submitted to him recently by SFADCo on the future development of the Shannon Estuary.  It is most important that all representatives of the area should read that report.</P>
      <P>I agree totally with Deputy Spring, that because of the failure to introduce legislation so far, it is now time an all-party committee was established to examine legislation for the establishment of a Shannon Estuary authority.  In the past all-party committees of this House have proved successful in overcoming parochial problems and individual differences. I see no reason such an all-party committee would not be successful in the case of the Shannon Estuary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that the Minister of State has a keen interest in this matter as it also <Col N="2501" /> affects his constituency.  It is of paramount importance that there be development along the Shannon Estuary.  I envisage a single authority acting as a catalyst in developing the estuary to its full potential.  I appeal to the Minister of State to bring forward the necessary legislation, even if this means setting up an all-party committee, as there is a need for action in the region.  The days for promises are long gone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Noonan, Limerick West)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank both Deputy Spring and Deputy Deenihan for their contributions this evening and wish to say in reply that Deputies will be aware that the objective of the Harbours (Shannon Estuary Development Corporation) Bill, 1988, was to bring together the three main harbours of the estuary, Limerick, Foynes and Kilrush, under the one umbrella. Deputies will be further aware that this was not the first occasion on which proposals for the setting up of a single authority for the Shannon Estuary had been put before this House.  The concept of a single estuarial authority has been under discussion for a period in excess of 20 years.  Successive Ministers have had extensive negotiations with the various interests involved over the last ten or 12 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bills providing for a single harbour authority for the estuary were introduced in 1977 and 1986 but lapsed on the dissolution of the Dáil in those years.  Likewise, the 1988 Bill had only completed Second Stage when the last Dáil was dissolved. I decided not to restore the Bill to the Order Paper on the assembly of the new Dáil but this is not to say I have decided to drop the legislation altogether. I have decided to defer it for two reasons.  At about the same time a strategic study for the integrated development of the Shannon Estuary, commissioned by the Government and undertaken by SFADCo, was in progress. This study, which has a very wide remit, examines the estuary's natural and economic advantages and its potential for further integrated development having <Col N="2502" /> regard to the need to protect the estuary's environment from inappropriate developments.  Consideration of this study is at a very advanced stage.  In the light of the fact that this study covers among other things ports, shipping and trans-shipment facilities I consider that it would be prudent at this stage to await its findings.</P>
    <P>There is one other reason for my decision.  The challenges of 1992 and the implications of the Channel tunnel have led me to the conclusion that a major review of the entire legislation code under which commercial harbours operate, the Harbours Acts from 1946 to 1976, is very necessary.  For this reason I will establish in the near future a review group to examine the issue with the intention of replacing the existing legislation with a body of legislation more suited to the modern ports system.  Deputies should bear in mind that the Shannon Estuary Bill would have amended the Harbours Act only in certain respects and did not deal with the many other issues which it is now clear need updating. Rationalisation of harbours is an appropriate subject for consideration by the review group and in the case of the Shannon Estuary proposals can be examined in parallel with the review group's work.</P>
    <P>I am very familiar with the views of many Deputies, including those of Deputy Spring and Deputy Deenihan, on many aspects of the Shannon Estuary Bill.  However, I still have some difficulty in establishing whether Deputy Spring is firmly in favour of the Bill referred to and in his remarks this evening he failed to clarify his position.</P>
    <P>Nothing which has been said this evening should lead me to alter the stance I have taken.  It is in the best interests of the region that we await the outcome of the Shannon development study and the findings of the review group before progressing further with Shannon Estuary legislation.</P>

      <P>I plead with the Minister and the Department of Justice to show a humanitarian face in dealing with the case of four Polish refugees who because of weather conditions had to disembark at Shannon on 13 December and who have been in the care of the Irish Red Cross since.  Many efforts have been made to help them reach Canada.  When they started out on their journey they understood that the United States and Canada would readily accept applications from Polish and Russian emigrants.  They made their applications bona fide.  On learning of their mistake, the Irish immigration authorities tried to deport them but were prevented from doing so by a High Court judge who decided to give the Poles further time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime a member of the Canadian Baptist Federation, Mr. Lloyd Jones, has indicated that he has found four people willing to sponsor these people.  The four people concerned are Zbignew Iwuc, Tan Bury, Daniela Terenkiewicz and her 14 year old son Tomasz.  Each of them hoped to gain entry to Canada and filled up their application forms bona fide.  Since then they have gone through the usual procedures, been interviewed by Canadian embassy officials and undergone medical tests.  In their applications to the Canadian embassy they indicated that they hoped that they would be joined at a later date by their families.  Now the Canadian embassy are refusing to process the <Col N="2504" /> applications without first receiving medical information on the families they left behind in Gdansk.  The Department of Justice are aware of this.</P>
    <P>In the case of three Cubans who applied for and received entry visas to the United States the Department showed great patience but for some reason in this case the Minister and the Department seem to be anxious to shift these people back to Gdansk.  I believe they still have refugee status and it is incumbent on the State to show some compassion to refugees. After all, there are Irish refugees in other countries and we like to see our emigrants being treated properly.</P>
    <P>We are aware that one of the reasons two of the men left is that there is compulsory conscription.  Both are practising Jehovah's Witnesses and it is against their religion to serve in the army.  Colleagues of theirs who have been returned in this fashion have had their passports confiscated or marked at the port of entry thus ensuring that they are not utilised afterwards.  I believe there will be persecution. I do not believe the transition has taken place.  We are rushing too quickly into these things.  Have the Russians left Poland?  If the Minister can tell me that there is not a Russian army in Poland, that he has a crystal ball and can see that there will not be persecution in the future, I will be happy.  The Minister is hoping there will not be persecution and I, too, hope democracy will develop in Poland and other countries.  The Minister must be aware, however, from the news in the last few days that there were riots in Romania and baton charges on crowds in Bucharest.  Everything is not yet settled in eastern Europe.  I am appealing to the Minister from a humanitarian point of view.  There is an interregnum. The Minister is very anxious to please the Polish authorities. It is quite right to encourage the Polish authorities to become a democracy but these poor unfortuante people were caught in midstream and now they will go back and never have an opportunity to leave Poland to seek better economic opportunities in Canada and the United States.</P>
    <P>What disappoints me most is that the <Col N="2505" /> Canadian authorities have not indicated either that there has been a reversal of their previous policy of not accepting Iron Curtain country applicants as bona fide and giving them almost free entry.  They did not convey that to me when I was in touch with them and the Canadian Baptist Federation who deal with refugees are also very disappointed.  I would appeal to the Minister to adopt a more humanitarian approach and to see that the Canadian embassy process these visas quickly.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank Deputy Carey for allowing me some of his time and to join him in supporting the four Polish people who are awaiting acceptance into Canada.  I want to make two points.  We should consider the major decision they had to take in deciding to go to Canada and their frame of mind when they left Canada and found themselves in Shannon.  They are people who made a genuine decision and got caught in unfortunate circumstances.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I ask the Minister to seriously consider what these people would have to face if they were to go back to Poland.  It is fine to say democracy reigns in Poland just because there has been a major blitz over the past number of months in relation to eastern Europe but we in this House know, and it is well known worldwide, that democracy does not take place overnight.  The institutions of democracy have to be built up over a length of time and eventually accepted and put in place.  Things are very unstable in Poland at the moment as they are all over eastern Europe.  There is a great deal of uncertainty there and the position those people will go back to is far more uncertain than it was even some time ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take these points into consideration in relation to these people.  It is nothing new to have refugees here and we should be seen to take a decent and social-minded approach towards them.  We must remember we are a country that can least afford to take a high-handed approach given that we are exporting hundreds of thousands of our people all over the world.  We know <Col N="2506" /> the trauma that many, particularly those who have gone to America as illegals, have gone through on being deported back to Ireland which is a very civilised democracy.  It is not so simple for these people.  It is a personal matter.  It is something very close to them and to the decisions they have made.  It is integral to democracy and democratic institutions.  I appeal to the Minister to show patience, to show caution and to show skilful judgment in this case and to allow due time to satisfactorily process this case to Canada or the United States.</P>

      <P>The four Polish nationals referred to arrived at Shannon Airport on 13 December 1989 on Cubana flight No. CU479 en route from east Berlin to Gander and Havana. The flight was diverted to Shannon because of weather conditions at Gander Airport.  The group applied for refugee status and they have also expressed a wish to travel to Canada.  I accept fully the concern of Deputies in relation to this situation.  I can assure them that there has been patience and caution.  I do not need lectures from either of them about a social-minded approach.  I secured the views of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and our own Department of Foreign Affairs in relation to the four applicants.  Neither the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees nor our own Department of Foreign Affairs supported the applications. In addition, the Canadian authorities have advised that they are not prepared to accept the people involved. Their applications were, therefore, refused.</P>
      <P>Arrangements were made for their departure on Tuesday, 23 January 1990. On 22 January the legal advisers obtained a High Court order preventing their removal from the State until the proceedings had been heard.  It is a pity the Deputies did not check their facts because on 24 April the matter was before the High Court and the order was struck out by mutual consent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 29, 52 and 209 together.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the problem of attacks on tourists is being given special attention and that there is close co-operation on this matter between them and Bord Fáilte and other tourist interests.  A number of measures have been taken by the gardaí to deal with the problem.  These include the deployment of additional Garda patrols, including gardaí on plain clothes duty in areas of high tourist interest. Arrangements have been made with various bodies, such as the Car Rental Council of Ireland, port authorities at Dún Laoghaire, regional tourism managers and the Irish Hotels Federation for the printing and distribution of leaflets which offer to tourists practical advice on such matters as car security and the safety of personal belongings.</P>
      <P>A new measure designed to help in tackling the problem is the provision of the new Garda office which opened on 12 March, 1990 in O'Connell Street, Dublin.  This serves as a centre for advising tourists on preventive measures which they can take to safeguard themselves and their belongings.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities are satisfied that the measures already implemented are proving to be effective and they have informed me that provisional figures for recorded attacks on tourists in the Dublin metropolitan area in 1989 show a decrease of 6.4 per cent as compared with 1988.</P>
      <P>The situation is being continually monitored by the Garda and the measures taken to deal with the problem are the subject of constant review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the question of night courts, because of the right of an accused to <Col N="2167" /> sufficient time to prepare a defence, obtain legal aid and brief legal advisers, I am not satisfied that setting up night courts specifically to deal with offences against tourists would serve any useful purpose.</P>
    <P>I appreciate fully the deep distress tourists feel when subjected to assault or robbery while they are guests to our country and I deeply resent and regret the damage to our good name and reputation that is caused by such happenings.  At the same time I think it is important that we preserve a proper sense of perspective on this matter.  Tourists, in practically every city in the world, are vulnerable and we must be careful not to project an unfair image of ourselves by highlighting unduly the most regrettable incidents that do occur here and giving the impression that these things do not happen anywhere else or happen only to a lesser extent than they do here.  Tourists have to play their part by being careful of themselves and their possessions.  We all want them to be secure and safe while they are with us and the Garda, and indeed the rest of us, will do all that can be done to bring that about.</P>

      <P>The Supreme Court decision, which consists of four judgments, is under examination and I am not in a position to indicate the steps that may be appropriate for me to take in relation to the matters concerned. In so far as new legislation may be involved I could not undertake to say, in the context of Parliamentary Questions, whether or not I may have proposals for legislative changes in particular areas. Any such proposals would be announced, in the ordinary way, only after Government approval.</P>
      <P>As regards the practical implications, I should point out that in so far as any conviction may be invalidated, the Supreme Court decision carries the implication that any complaint validity made in respect of an alleged offence, may yet be brought to trial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an implication in the Deputy's question that the Supreme Court has found that the Courts (No. 2) Act, 1988 is unconstitutional.  It is a fact of some significance that the Supreme Court did not so find.  I am satisfied, having regard to the background of this matter, that the promotion of his legislation was the correct and prudent course to take at the time.  A serious problem came to light and the legislation was the correct way to deal with it.  The advice at the time was that the 1988 Act ought to stand up to constitutional challenge, but I should point out that no guarantee was, or could have been, given that it would stand up <Col N="2169" /> or indeed that every order of the former district justice could be validated retrospectively &mdash; hence the specific provision in subsection (3) of section 1 of the Act which provides that any validation under the Act shall be subject to such limitation as is necessary to secure that it does not conflict with a constitutional right of any person.</P>
    <P>I should also like to correct the implication in the Deputy's question that the problem arose solely from a mistake made in the Department of Justice.  I think it is right that I should again state the facts of the matter as given in this House on 8 December 1988 &mdash; column 880 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>Mr. Mahon was appointed as a temporary justice of the District Court in October 1976 and as a permanent justice in May 1977.  He reached the normal retirement age of 65 years in January 1984.  He should, before that date, have applied for a continuation warrant but did not do so and a warrant was not made.  Normal practice is for the Department to remind a justice well in advance of the need to apply for a warrant.  A reminder was not given in this case, however, because of a mistake in departmental records.  Mr. Mahon first applied for appointment in April 1973 and in his application form he gave his year of birth as 1920.  This was recorded in departmental records. In January 1977, Mr. Mahon submitted a birth certificate which showed his year of birth as 1919 but the discrepancy was not noticed and the incorrect year of birth remained in departmental records.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>I accept that there is need for a Garda substation in Leixlip.  The Office of Public Works is experiencing continuing difficulties in securing suitable premises, on reasonable terms, for the planned substation, which will open as soon as suitable premises are found.  I am assured that every effort is being made to secure the required premises.</P>
      <P>This substation is the only new Garda station planned for County Kildare at present.  The new station will be a substation of Lucan Garda station.  The intention is that it will serve as the centre for patrolling of the Leixlip area, including foot patrols in the town.  Normal station services will be provided there in relation to such matters as production of driving licences and motor insurance certificates, certification of passport applications, etc.</P>
      <P>Apart from new stations, there are long-term plans to build replacement stations at Monasterevin, Rathangan and Ballymore Eustace.  No change in policing arrangements will be involved in the provision of these.  It is not possible at this stage to say when work will get underway on these projects.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42, 49 and 200 together.  Regrettably there was one death in prison in 1987, six in 1988, four in 1989 and two this year.  In my reply to Question No. 205 of 24 October <Col N="2173" /> 1989 I set out the causes of deaths in prison custody over the previous ten years where these had been determined by inquests.  There have been no further relevant inquest findings since the question was answered.  The circumstances of the deaths referred to in Question No. 49 have been investigated by the Garda and prison authorities.  However, as inquests have yet to be held into these deaths it would not be appropriate for me to make any further comment on the matter at this stage.</P>
      <P>The House has been informed on a number of occasions of the type of measures being taken to attempt to reduce the incidence of such deaths.</P>
      <P>Offenders who are identified as being at risk are given special attention by prison staff and by appropriate medical experts with the specific objective of minimising the risk of self-injury. Unfortunately, however, worldwide experience indicates clearly that there is no fail-safe way by which all potential suicide victims can be identified nor, indeed, does there appear to be any fail-safe, humanitarian way of ensuring that somebody who has been so identified will not eventually find an opportunity of taking his own life.</P>
      <P>In mentioning that prison suicides are a worldwide phenomenon, I do not suggest that it is therefore a matter that must be taken for granted or can be treated with complacency &mdash; far from it &mdash; but it does suggest that the search for effective solutions is far from being a simple matter.</P>
      <P>Reports of all deaths in prisons are examined by the relevant authorities to see whether the circumstances suggest any procedure or course of action that might usefully be introduced in an effort to forestall similar tragedies.  Each such death is the subject of public inquiry by way of inquest and full regard is had to any riders which may be added by inquest juries, with a view to their implementation if considered appropriate and practicable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last November, in response to the concern which deaths in prison understandably give rise to &mdash; and which I share &mdash; I established an advisory group to <Col N="2174" /> examine specifically the issue of deaths in prisons and to make recommendations.</P>
    <P>The group, which is chaired by a senior official of my Department, includes a governor and deputy governor, a psychiatrist, a psychologist, a chaplain, a senior member of the probation and welfare service and a representative of the Prison Officers' Association.  I have no doubt that the group fully appreciate the urgency which attaches to their task but, given the extremely complex and sensitive issues which have to be addressed, it is clearly vital that they have sufficient time to enable them to deal comprehensively with these matters over whatever period proves necessary.  While the group is not in a position to give a definite date for completion of their final report, I have asked them to let me have an interim report, which I expect to receive shortly.</P>
    <P>Given the measures I have outlined, and having particular regard to the fact that each death is the subject of public inquiry by way of inquest, I am not satisfied that the establishment of a public inquiry into the question of prison deaths generally would serve any useful purpose.</P>
    <P>Part of Deputy O'Keeffe's question relates to overcrowding and, since it is within the general context of a question on suicides, I take it as perhaps carrying the implication that there is a casual link between overcrowding and suicide.  Concern about accommodation pressures in prisons &mdash; whatever the context &mdash; is perfectly understandable.  There are, however, substantial difficulties, in practice, in sustaining a link between individual deaths and accommodation pressures.  While it is the case that the numbers being held at some of our institutions are in excess of what would be considered ideal, every effort has been made to maintain the quality of the regimes through, for example, preserving the level of out of cell time available to individual offenders.  But, irrespective of any accommodation pressures that may exist, the fact remains that offenders have committed suicides both in single-cell and in shared accommodation.  In certain <Col N="2175" /> cases the specific medical advice, in relation to individuals believed to be at risk, is that they should be in shared accommodation; in others, the medical advice is different.  What is beyond doubt is that the factors which predispose individuals to take their own lives, whether in prison or in the community &mdash; and it must be remembered that it is not simply a prisons issue &mdash; vary from case to case and, frequently, can be extremely difficult to detect.  The search for solutions, therefore, has to be multi-directional and expertly handled.</P>
    <P>With regard to prison accommodation generally, the most significant development in relation to the provision of custodial accommodation in recent years was the bringing into use last year of the new place of detention at Wheatfield which now accommodates about 235 offenders.  It is intended that it will be operating at its full capacity of 320 later this year as the required additional staff become available.  A new unit geared to cope with offenders with medical problems arising from infectious diseases is being provided at Mountjoy.</P>
    <P>One of the existing wings in Limerick prison is to be replaced by a new wing providing an extra 30 spaces.  In addition, the refurbishment of the St. Patrick's Institution complex is being undertaken, the aim being to provide accommodation there of a much higher quality than previously existed.</P>
    <P>The Women's Prison at Mountjoy which forms part of the St. Patrick's Institution complex will be completely refurbished as part of the works being carried out at the complex.  I have already indicated to the House that I am satisfied that this refurbishment represents the most effective way of improving the quality of the accommodation for women prisoners, at least in the relatively short term.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there have been calls for the closure of the Women's Prison. This is simply not a practical proposition because there is no other place available at the present time in which the offenders concerned &mdash; some of whom are quite serious offenders &mdash; could be securely <Col N="2176" /> accommodated.  The refurbishment of the Women's Prison, now, does not preclude the possibility that other solutions will be brought forward in the longer term and I would like to assure the House that in discharging my responsibility to provide better accommodation for women prisoners &mdash; something to which I am firmly committed &mdash; I shall be looking at solutions appropriate to the longer term as well as the short term.</P>

      <P>Detailed instructions in relation to the circumstances in which firearms may be used by members of the force in the course of duty are set out in the Garda Síochána Code.</P>
      <P>It is important to emphasise that firearms are issued only to members trained and proficient in their use; that firearms are issued primarily as weapons of defence; and that the members concerned must be fully familiar with the instructions governing the use of the firearm entrusted to them.  Broadly speaking, a firearm may be used by a member of the Garda Síochána only in circumstances where it is absolutely necessary in self defence or to repel a serious attack on other persons or on property.  The use of firearms would be justified only where the intention was to achieve a legal purpose and where all other means of achieving this purpose had been exhausted before firing.</P>
      <P>An overriding principle in all of this area is that no more force than is necessary should be used.

      <P>A programme for the modernisation of the Defence Forces transport fleet commenced in 1988.  The programme is based on the disposal of obsolete and unserviceable vehicles and their replacement on a phased basis by new vehicles.</P>
      <P>It is intended that about 130 new vehicles will be acquired during 1990 and that further vehicles will be purchased in subsequent years as financial resources permit.  While the overall number of vehicles will be reduced I am satisfied that the replacement programme will in any event substantially improve the operational efficiency of the transport fleet.</P>

    <P>The Defence Forces give assistance to <Col N="2184" /> the Garda Síochána in protecting movements of cash pursuant to their role of rendering aid to the civil power.

    <P>* The OECD secretariat say that the figures from Greece are based mainly on information about multilateral aid.  The 1986 and 1987 figures contain a small part of bilateral aid but the 1988 figure has none.  In the OECD view all figures are probably under-estimations.</P>

I underlined this priority in my Presidency programme address to the European Parliament in January and again when I addressed the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation on 7 February.  However, the Council (General Affairs), over which I preside, does not have direct responsibility for environmental matters.</P>

      <P>I propose to take these Questions Nos. 81 and 82 together.  The special session of the European Council on 28 April is being convened in order to deal with the implications for the Community of developments in Central and Eastern Europe, in particular the unification of Germany, the CSCE Summit and the future development of the Community itself.  The question of Lithuania is not on the agenda.</P>
      <P>The Presidency has made representations to the Soviet authorities, on behalf of the member states of the Community, regarding the political situation in Lithuania.  These representations set out the concerns of the Twelve regarding the situation, as reflected in their statements of 24 March, 4 and 21 April. Copies of these statements have been placed in the Library of the House.</P>

      <P>The question of democratic accountability in the Community of the future has come in for increased attention in recent times.</P>
      <P>This renewed interest in the functioning of Community institutions springs from the fact that the Community is about to enter a new phase of its development with the advent of negotiations on economic and monetary union.  The issue is further highlighted by the likelihood that other steps to enhance the effectiveness of the Community in a changing Europe are soon to be considered.</P>
      <P>The special European Council to be held in Dublin on Saturday next will consider various issues connected with the Community's future development.  Given Ireland's position as Presidency, I would not wish to prejudge the outcome of the European Council by speculating at this stage on how this vital debate about the Community's future will unfold.</P>

      <P>It is still too early to say what arrangements may be made to administer the Community of the future.  These, and related issues, will have to be examined in depth during the inter-governmental negotiations which are scheduled to commence in the second half of this year.  At this stage, it would be premature for me to comment on these issues which will be considered at the special meeting of the European Council due to take place on Saturday next.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 and 92 together.</P>
      <P>The superannuation schemes which apply to members of the Irish nursing service, in common with the schemes applicable throughout the public sector generally, provide that the service which is taken into account for benefit purposes comprises</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2193" /> (a)  service given in the employing organisation, plus</P>
    <P>(b)  service given in other organisations which is reckonable under the terms of the public sector transfer scheme or the local government transfer scheme.</P>
    <P>These transfer schemes, which are operated by my Department and the Department of the Environment respectively, provide for the transfer of service on a reciprocal basis between participating organisations.  Any organisation in the public or private sector, including organisations based in Britain and elsewhere is free to participate in these schemes provided it is prepared to accept the obligations of membership, including the liability to make contributions where necessary towards the ultimate cost of service transfers.  However, neither the British NHS nor any other British organisation has hitherto been willing to join the transfer schemes.</P>
    <P>In the absence of a reciprocal transfer agreement with the appropriate British authorities, it would not be appropriate to amend Irish public sector superannuation schemes to allow credit for service in Britain on a &ldquo;one-way transfer&rdquo; basis.  Such an arrangement would entail substantial additional costs for the Exchequer which could not be justified.</P>

      <P>Up to 31 December 1974 the foreign currency debt is valued at the exchange rates which applied when the debt was drawn down.  Thereafter the foreign currency debt is valued at the relevant end-year exchange rates.  For comparative purposes figures for 1975 are provided on both bases.</P>
      <P>In 1987 further changes were made in the method of calculating the national debt.  These changes arose from the elimination of circular transfers resulting from the enacting of the Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Act, 1987, and the incorporation, as a credit in the national debt statement, of liquid assets which were previously shown in the statement of capital assets in the finance accounts. The national debt figures from 1982 onwards are on this amended basis.  For comparative purposes figures for 1982 are also provided on the old basis.</P>
      <P>In the case of domestic debt funded by foreign investors comprehensive estimates are only available since 1984 onwards.  Non-resident holdings of Irish Government securities at end year since 1984 are as follows: 1984, £530 million; 1985, £890 million; 1986, £1,174 million; 1987, £1,800 million; 1988, £2,690 million; 1989, £3,883 million.</P>
      <P>The remainder of the information requested by the Deputy is set out in the following tables.</P>

      <P>Civil Service pensions are calculated and subsequently increased by reference to the rates of pay of serving officials.  At retirement, a civil servant's pension is calculated at 1/80th of retiring salary for each year of service.  Thereafter the pension is recalculated, on that same basis, with effect from the date on which subsequent salary increases are applied to the grade from which the civil servant retired.</P>
      <P>Under the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> salary increases were applied with effect from 1 January in each of the years 1988, 1989 and 1990, as follows: 3 per cent on the first £120 of basic weekly salary and 2 per cent on any amount of basic weekly salary over £120.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the normal practice, the pensions of retired civil servants were recalculated each January by reference to the revised salaries resulting from the increases under the programme.</P>

      <P>In this year's budget, I took steps to increase the incentive to use environmentally friendly motor fuels by reducing the tax on unleaded petrol by a further 5p per gallon and halving the tax on auto liquid petroleum gas.  Initial indications confirm that consumption of unleaded petrol is rising as a result of the budget changes.</P>
      <P>A number of environmental initiatives are being undertaken by the Office of Public Works.  The Office of Public Works, in co-operation with the Central Fisheries Board, have initiated a five year programme for development of coarse fishing on the Grand and Royal Canals for which a sum of £100,000 has been allocated this year under the Government's environment action programme. In addition the following projects are being undertaken: habitat study of Royal Canal west of Mullingar; improvement works at Grand Canal Docks, Ringsend, Dublin; planting of trees and the provision of seats along selected urban sections of the canals; re-opening of the Royal Canal; provision of pump-out facilities for cruisers on the Shannon and on the canals in co-operation with local authorities and Bord Fáilte; monitoring of water quality in Grand and Royal Canals; rehabilitation of fisheries after drainage construction works on the Boyne and Glyde rivers.  It is also planned to co-operate with the Central Fisheries Board in the provision of suitable fishery habitat in the Inny catchment; experimenting with general drainage maintenance practices to optimise the fishery potential; and co-operation with the Geological Survey on the study of peatland conservation.</P>

It will be expanded as finances permit to cover a much larger area and in this regard the upland area of the Powerscourt Estate <Col N="2205" /> comprising 2,500 hectares has been acquired.  I have also committed a sum of £2.1 million for a visitor centre for the park.</P>
    <P>A further 207 acres adjacent to the Wexford Wildfowl Reserve was purchased in March to increase the reserve capacity to preserve the Greenland white-fronted geese and other threatened species.</P>
    <P>Negotiations are completed for the purchase of an area of over 900 acres of blanket bog to extend the Knockmoyle-Sheskin nature reserve in County Mayo.</P>

      <P>VAT is a general sales tax which applies to the bulk of goods and services.  Medical equipment, instruments and appliances are generally liable at the standard rate of 23 per cent.  In the main, this expenditure is financed by the State where publicly funded hospitals are concerned.  However, VAT Refund Order No. 20 provides for a reduction in the rate of VAT to 10 per cent on qualifying medical equipment donated to hospitals.</P>
      <P>The refund scheme was established in recognition of the valuable work done by voluntary fund raising groups who raise significant amounts of money to finance purchases of specialised health equipment. I am satisfied that the scheme meets this objective successfully.</P>

      <P>The National Development Plan 1989-1993 (NDP) submitted to the Commission of the European Communities in March 1989 sets out the Government's policy in regard to regional as well as national development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prime objective of the plan is to promote the national and community aim of economic and social cohesion and to enhance our capacity to share fully in the <Col N="2211" /> benefits of the internal market.  The plan, however, has a strong regional orientation and has been designed to ensure that the benefits which will accrue will be dispersed throughout all the sub-regions.</P>
    <P>The community support framework (CSF) the Commission's response to the NDP adopted in October 1989 specifies the structural/development measures in the NDP which will be funded from the Structural Funds over the plan period and the level of assistance which will be provided.  This in turn will be implemented through a series of sectoral operational programmes which will be published as they are approved by the Commission.  The operational programmes will specify in more detail the particular development measures to be undertaken in each sector/development area.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of implementing the CSF, the working and advisory groups which were established during the course of the preparation of the NDP will be amalgamated into sub-regional review committees.  They will meet not less than twice a year to receive and consider progress reports and financial statements on current and planned implementation of development measures in their sub-regions. The review committees will be provided with an annual breakdown of expenditure of a structural nature in their sub-region which will form the basis against which progress on implementation can be assessed.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that at local level the physical planning needs of individual areas are set out in the development plan prepared under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts.</P>

      <P>The works are being carried out with funding voted annually by the Oireachtas for the Office of Public Works.

      <P>As stated in my reply to Questions Nos. 104 and 105 on 7 February, 1990, the impact of all hunting of wild birds is monitored and reviewed on an ongoing basis by the Wildlife Service of the Office of Public Works.  In this regard the primary consideration is to ensure that our populations of wild birds are not adversely affected by shooting or any other pressure having regard to the obligation to maintain their conservation status under the Wildlife Act, 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the populations of any species are threatened by any pressure, measures can be taken under the Wildlife Act to <Col N="2213" /> suspend or restrict shooting at national or regional level, or to impose bag limits, with a view to restoring populations to a satisfactory level.  This is the sole basis for the regulation and control of hunting under the Act.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 118 and 124 together.</P>
      <P>Donegal County Council has primary responsibility for coastal protection in the area.  Any activities which may be contributing to coastal erosion are a matter for the local authority in the first instance.</P>
      <P>In relation to the question of the barbed wire fence, the position is that the erection of any structure on State foreshore requires a lease or a licence from me under the terms of the Foreshore Act, 1933.  Having investigated the particular case, I have now referred the matter to the Chief State Solicitor's office for appropriate legal action.</P>

      <P>My Department is undertaking a comprehensive programme of environmental protection and improvement as part of Ireland's &ldquo;Green&rdquo; Presidency.  The programme addresses the problems we face on a number of fronts.</P>
      <P>A Foreshore Bill is being prepared to prohibit the removal of sand from our beaches and high amenity areas.</P>
      <P>The Sea Pollution Bill will end the indiscriminate disposal of ships' waste in the marine environment.  Port authorities will be obliged to provide reception facilities for the safe disposal of this waste when ships enter port.  The Bill will be circulated to Deputies shortly.</P>
      <P>In conjunction with the Wildlife Service, I have also launched an educational programme to highten public awareness about the damaging effects which can be caused to fish stocks and marine wildlife generally by carelessly throwing waste overboard.</P>
      <P>All dumping at sea of industrial wastes will be banned from 31 December, 1995. My Department has been in touch with the three Irish-based companies who are authorised to dump at present to effect an urgent phase-out of such dumping.</P>
      <P>To ensure that aquaculture does not threaten public health or the aquatic environment, recruitment of additional staff has commenced and a national inspection programme is at an advanced stage.</P>
      <P>Fifty-thousand pounds has been provided to help improve the water quality of Lough Sheelin, Derravaragh and River Inny.</P>
      <P>My Department has recently published a report on the incidence of fish kills in 1989 to highten public awareness of the problem.</P>
      <P>The central and regional fisheries boards will maintain and strengthen their valuable anti-water pollution programmes.</P>

      <P>The person named has not been refused any sheep subsidies in 1989 and 1990.  He did not apply for the 1988 ewe premium which was paid in 1989 and payment of the 1989 and 1990 premiums, for which he has applied, has not yet commenced.  The question may however, refer to the 1987 ewe premium scheme for which an application was submitted in January 1988 for 486 ewes.  At the inspection in June 1988, 460 ewes were presented of which 110 had already been presented and ear notched in another flock.  This meant that he did not maintain 486 eligible ewes for 100 days as he was required to do under the conditions of the scheme and accordingly premium was refused.</P>

      <P>As I indicated at the beginning of Ireland's Presidency of the EC Council, my first priority as President of the Council of Agriculture Ministers was to secure agreement on agricultural prices for 1990-91.  I am hopeful that the meeting of Agriculture Ministers commencing in Brussels today will result in a successful outcome of the prices negotiations.</P>
      <P>This year's prices proposals have in themselves a significant environmental flavour with measures for rural development proposed in many sectors.  These measures will contribute in a meaningful way to maintaining the rural environment.</P>
      <P>Conclusion of the prices negotiations will be followed by Council considering several environmental or &ldquo;green&rdquo; related proposals.  In particular I have in mind measures dealing with organic farming, plant health and animal welfare where much progress has already been achieved at the technical examination level during our Presidency.  Commission proposals are awaited on the important subjects of food quality and origin designation while some further rural world proposals are also awaiting presentation to the Council. It is my intention to advance these proposals to the maximum extent in the remaining months of the Irish Presidency.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that there is only one insurance company offering cover for public liability for fun fairs; his views on whether this is satisfactory from the point of view of competition; and whether the present level of premium being charged for fun fairs is reasonable in the light of the risks involved.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 24 insurance <Col N="2236" /> companies authorised to underwrite liability insurance, including public liability for activities such as fun fairs, in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The cost of any type of insurance is directly and substantially dependent on the frequency and level of claims.  I understand that insurers view public liability insurance for fun fairs as being high risk due to the claims experience they have had on this type of business.  Over the past number of years insurers have suffered large underwriting losses on their liability accounts.  These losses amounted to £18 million in both 1987 and 1988.  Faced with these losses insurers have had to exercise more selectivity in the type of risk undertaken.</P>
      <P>I understand that one insurer is providing policies covering public liability risks for fun fairs.  I am informed that insurers other than the one mentioned may offer quotes depending on the circumstances of a particular risk.  From a competition perspective it would, of course, be preferable if there was a wider choice of public liability insurance for fun fairs available.</P>
      <P>However, as the insurance supervisory authority, my primary and indeed statutory duty is to ensure that insurance companies maintain their statutory reserves and solvency requirements.  The acceptance or rejection of any type of risk is a matter for each individual insurance company to decide in the light of their underwriting experience.  No obligation can be placed on an insurer to quote in respect of a particular risk or to quote at any particular premium.</P>
      <P>I would add that an arrangement exists with the Irish Insurance Federation to assist in cases where difficulties are experienced in obtaining liability insurance. Before any case can be referred to the federation, it is necessary that at least half the market be approached without success.  Evidence of these approaches e.g. a letter from a broker together with a brief synopsis of the risk should be forwarded to the insurance section of my Department who will refer the matter to the federation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must emphasise that, while this arrangement has operated reasonably <Col N="2237" /> successfully, no guarantee can be given that cover will be forthcoming in every case.</P>

      <P>A Joint Labour Committee (JLC) was set up in 1964 to cover hairdressing in Dublin city and county, the Borough of Dún Laoghaire and the urban district of Bray and in 1977 a JLC was set up to cover Cork city.  Under the employment regulation orders (EROs) made by both committees, there is a provision for a four-year hairdressing apprenticeship. The EROs lay down minimum rates of pay and conditions of employment for apprentice hairdressers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An employer who wishes to employ an apprentice hairdresser in the Dublin and <Col N="2238" /> Cork areas must apply to the relevant hairdressing joint labour committee to register the worker &mdash; apprentices in the remainder of the country are not registered. A certificate of registration will them be issued to the employee.  On completion of the four-year apprenticeship, the certificate of registration is signed by the employer and the JLC will certify the completion of the apprenticeship. However, employers are not obliged to return registration cards to the JLC for certification when the apprenticeship is completed.</P>
    <P>Hairdressing is not a designated industry for the purposes of the Industrial Training Act, 1967, and as such FÁS do not register hairdressing apprentices. FÁS operate hairdressing training programmes of 26 weeks' duration.  Trainees complete a test at the end of the programme and a FÁS certificate is issued based on the trainee's performance. Some trainees enter for City and Guilds examinations.</P>
    <P>Apprenticeships are not governed by EC legislation.  However, there are on-going discussions on the mutual recognition of vocational training qualifications within the EC.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that FÁS currently have under review the whole approach to apprenticeship training in general.  A discussion document was issued in December 1989, which recommended significant changes in the apprenticeship system, including the introduction of a standards based system with qualifications being required to achieve recognition.  The needs of the hairdressing area will be kept in mind by FÁS in their review.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the main steps <Col N="2241" /> proposed for the environmental element of the Presidency of the EC are contained in the publication &ldquo;An Environment Action Programme&rdquo; launched in January 1990.</P>
      <P>In the broad context of that document the integration of environmental considerations in all policy areas is now in hands.</P>
      <P>Specific action taken to date in relation to my Departments activities is as follows:</P>
      <P>Ireland will accede to the Helsinki Protocol which requires that Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) emissions be cut by 30 per cent by 1993.  Regarding action by agencies under my responsibility, steps are being taken to ensure that the ESB will take the necessary measures to be able to comply with the requirements of this protocol. Arrangements are also in hand to enable the ESB to meet its commitments under the Sofia Protocol to stabilise NOx emissions at 1987 levels.</P>
      <P>An environment section to examine issues arising in connection with forestry and the environment has been set up in my Department.  Guidelines in relation to forestry development are almost complete. Further guidelines in relation to forestry, amenity and landscape as proposed in the environment action programme will be completed late in the year.  The normal consultation with county councils and the Office of Public Works where afforestation might affect their areas of interest are continuing.</P>
      <P>Measures under the proposed major energy conservation programme which has been allocated an additional £500,000 are being prepared and evaluated at present.  The programme will be launched as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The Radiological Protection Bill has been circulated and will be debated in the Dáil in this session.</P>
      <P>I have already taken steps as regards the protection of the Irish population from the hazards of natural radiation by setting reference levels of 200 becquerels per cubic metre for radon in dwelling houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the area of radiation safety a number of positive steps are being taken during <Col N="2242" /> the Irish Presidency.  After a lapse of 20 years, the Commission has agreed to recommence inspection of member states' environmental radioactivity monitoring facilities.  This is a major step forward in that the Commission have accepted their very important role in the promotion of nuclear safety.</P>
    <P>Following intense discussion, the Irish Presidency has got agreement to the five year extension of a regulation which restricts the importation into the Community of foodstuffs contaminated after Chernobyl.</P>
    <P>Draft directives on the protection of certain categories of workers and on transport of radioactive waste are under discussion and will be progressed vigorously during the Irish Presidency.</P>
    <P>My overall aim is to promote nuclear safety and I am taking every opportunity to do this during the Presidency.</P>
    <P>Arising from the regulations made by the Minister for the Environment in December 1989 in respect of environmental impact assessment it was necessary that two additional regulations be made by me, prescribing bodies to be consulted and the period for the consultation in relation to certain energy based developments.  These regulations were necessary for gas pipeline development and oil and gas developments.  The regulation for gas pipeline developments, entitled Gas Act, 1976 (sections 4 and 40A) Regulations 1990, S.I. No. 51 of 1990, was made on 1 March 1990.  The other regulation, for oil and gas developments, will be made in the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>Under our Presidency the Commission has recently prepared an important paper entitled <i>Energy and the Environment;</i> this paper will be the basis for political discussion at the next Energy Council in May.  This document is an important development in the progress towards a community consensus on this issue and we are leading the discussions at Council.</P>
    <P>My Department is actively involved in preparation of relevant material for international events such as the Bergen Conference and the Second World Conference on Climate Change.</P>

      <P>The new carer's allowance scheme, which replaces the prescribed relative allowance, involves a substantial increase, from £28 to £45 in the rate of the allowance for carers and a widening of the categories of persons in respect of whom an allowance can be paid.  It is estimated that in the region of 8,000 people will qualify for payment as carers under the new scheme.  These will include a large proportion of the 1,700 people in respect of whom a prescribed relative allowance is currently being paid.  They will qualify for the new allowance, at the increased rate of payment.  Persons currently in receipt of prescribed relative allowance who do not qualify for the new allowance will retain their existing entitlement.</P>

      <P>Payment of disability benefit is not generally made where people go abroad.  In the case of people going to other EC countries there are provisions under EC regulations on social security for migrant workers whereby payment is made where people move to other EC countries.  These regulations contain detailed provisions for medical certification for the purposes of such entitlements to be carried out on a reciprocal basis by the member states.</P>
      <P>Payment of short term disability benefit in other countries would pose problems of control and certification and would require reciprocal arrangements between the countries involved.  Disability benefit does not normally feature in reciprocal agreements on social security which usually cover pensions and other long term payments.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to the free schemes from my Department is available to elderly or permanently incapacitated persons who are receiving certain social security type payments and who are either living alone or with excepted persons.</P>
      <P>The current rate of annuities payable under the farmer's retirement scheme is not such as to preclude entitlement to old age (non-contributory) pension where the recipient has reached pensionable age and the annuity is the sole source of income to the household.  For example, a single farmer entitled to an annuity for £2,020 could still qualify for an old age (non-contributory) pension of £16 per week at current rates.  A married farmer whose spouse is also over age 66 and whose current annuity is £3,037 could qualify for an old age (non-contributory) pension of £26 each per week at current rates.  Persons in this situation would qualify for free schemes subject to the normal conditions.  Extension of the free schemes to persons not in receipt of social security type payments would have wideranging and costly implications and there are no proposals for such a change at present.</P>

      <P>The treatment benefits schemes were extended in October 1987 to include dependent spouses of qualified insured persons.  For the purposes of these and other benefits, a dependent spouse is defined as a person who is not in receipt of any social welfare health board payment in his or her own right and whose income from any other source is not in excess of £50 (gross) per week.</P>
      <P>By definition, a person who takes up employment, which yields an income of £50 or more per week, can no longer be regarded as a dependent spouse and, therefore, cannot avail of treatment benefits unless the normal statutory contribution conditions are satisfied on the basis of his or her own PRSI record.</P>

      <P>The Social Welfare (Availability for Employment) Regulations, 1989, enable certain unemployment assistance applicants to engage in a full-time second-level course of education and at the same time be deemed to satisfy the statutory condition of being available for work.  Claimants availing of the new arrangements continue to receive unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>Those eligible to avail of the new arrangements are persons aged 21 years and over who are in receipt of unemployment assistance at the long term rate. They must notify their local office in advance.  The scheme is confined to second level education at an approved centre leading to a recognised certificate such as the leaving certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An approved centre is any recognised educational establishment which offers courses at second level leading to a recognised certificate.  Accordingly, my Department would approve any suitable application to attend an existing school in County Meath which offers courses leading to a recognised certificate.  In addition to these arrangements, the vocational training opportunities scheme affords unemployed persons over age 21 who are in receipt of unemployment assistance the opportunity of participating in a full-time course of second-level education.  Participants on this scheme receive an allowance equivalent to the rate of unemployment assistance payable prior to participation.  The <Col N="2255" /> scheme, which is currently operating in twelve VEC centres throughout the country, does not include a centre in County Meath.

      <P>The Garda authorities are aware of the concern of local residents about crime in the north Clondalkin area.  Special measures, including extra patrols by the divisional task force, have been taken to deal with incidents of crime and vandalism and these have met with a good measure of success.  The Garda authorities are continuing to take all necessary steps to deal with the situation.</P>
      <P>Two members from Ronanstown station were assigned to community policing duties in the area earlier this year.  The Garda authorities consider that the scheme has been a success in building upon the already good relations between the local gardaí and the community and is effective in reducing local levels of vandalism and other law breaking.  They intend to assign additional members to community policing duties in the locality as soon as circumstances permit.</P>

      <P>This is primarily a matter for RTE.  RTE are aware of reception difficulties in the area of Carrigmourne, Thomastown, County Kilkenny.  They report that in the normal programme of coverage extension they would not be in a position to service this area with a transposer for a number of years. However, should the local community show interest in a self-help TV scheme, RTE will carry out a feasibility study and meet with representatives to discuss same.</P>
      <P>RTE are at present proceeding with tests for a self-help TV scheme for the Innistiogue area and in conjunction with this work they will do a preliminary investigation of the Carrigmourne area.</P>

The notification of the test appointment indicates that a test will not be conducted and that the applicant will forfeit his fee if the test vehicle is not in a roadworthy condition.

      <P>The results of the traffic counting programme operated by the environmental research unit of my Department on regional and county roads in the ten counties in question for 1988 (the latest year for which data are available) are set out in the following table.  Similar counts are available (for the same count locations) for 1980, 1986 and 1987.</P>
      <P>The traffic count was carried out by roadside enumerators who visually classified the traffic into the classes (bicycle, motorcycle, car, van, tractor, bus, rigid-truck, articulated-truck, truck and trailer or miscellaneous).  For each count location, the table lists the total number of each of these vehicles classes observed by the enumerator during the seven hour period 9 a.m.-1 p.m. and 2 p.m.-5 p.m. on the stated date and the total of these observations.  The right hand column lists the estimated AADT (24 hour vehicular volume on an average day) obtained by converting the seven hour volume to 24 hour volume using expansion factors obtained from information given by mechanical traffic counters.  The count locations are identified by their road numbers as listed in the local authority's road schedule or, in the case of counts in County Dublin, by road name.</P>
      <P>Since the count locations were selected as part of a sampling system designed to provide a single estimate of total vehicle miles of travel on all regional and county roads in the country and since separate sample frames were not set up for regional and for county roads, the counts listed in the table do not give reliable figures of the average traffic counts or the average volume of vehicles per day on regional roads or on county roads in individual local authority areas.</P>

      <P>I understand that the proposed new road would form part of the network of non-national roads.  Responsibility for undertaking any works on this network of roads, including the provision of the necessary finance, is primarily a matter for the local authorities.  They may use the discretionary grants for non-national roads paid by my Department to supplement expenditure from their own resources on such works.  The 1990 discretionary road grants for Kerry County Council amount to £3,023,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>State investment in non-national road improvements of major significance to the development of tourism, at regional or local level, may qualify for EC grant aid within the limits set in the Community Support Framework (CSF) adopted for Ireland for the five year period to 1993. The State investment involved in the case of such roads would be in the form of discretionary and/or special road grants. With regard to 1990, the local authorities have been requested to submit to the Department, by the end of next June, <Col N="2277" /> details of projects being assisted by these grants which they consider would be suitable for application for EC aid under the operational programme for roads and other transport infrastructure.  A draft of this programme, prepared in accordance with the CSF, has been submitted to the EC Commission.</P>

      <P>The Environment Council meeting of 22 March, at which I presided, agreed a number of important environmental measures.  These included the <Col N="2278" /> establishment of the European Environment Agency, a directive giving wide access to environmental information, two directives in the biotechnology area, an important resolution on waste management and a decision to extend the CORINE information programme. Policy debates took place on a proposal for vehicle emissions, the protection of the ozone layer and the greenhouse effect.</P>
      <P>In the months prior to the meeting, I had a series of discussions with the Commission, the Environment Committee of the European Parliament, various interested bodies and other Environmental Ministers to advance the business of the Council.</P>
      <P>I hosted a very successful informal meeting of Environment Ministers on the weekend of 21/22 April at which were discussed two important themes of European significance: Co-operation between the EC and Eastern Europe and EFTA; and the environment and the Single Market.</P>
      <P>The discussion on Eastern Europe laid the groundwork for a special meeting of EC Environment Ministers with their counterparts from certain central and Eastern European countries which I will host in Dublin Castle on 16 June and which will consider the possibilities for action in relation to the serious environmental situation in Eastern Europe.</P>
      <P>The next formal meeting of the Environmental Council will take place on 7 June and will deal with further environmental measures, particularly in the waste and water quality areas, and will prepare the community position for (i) the June meeting of the Contracting Parties to the Montreal Protocol at which a major revision of th Protocol should be agreed and (ii) the Second World Climate Conference next November.  Furthermore, the meeting of the European Council in Dublin in June is expected to agree a major Declaration on the Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am using the occasion of the Presidency to match our efforts at Community level with a comprehensive national <Col N="2279" /> environmental action programme (costing in the region of £1 billion) which I launched on 26 January, 1990.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 243 and 244 together.</P>
      <P>The Government's policy on accession to the Sofia and Helsinki Protocols is set out in the environment action programme announced earlier this year.</P>
      <P>The Sofia Protocol, which seeks to stabilize NOx emissions at 1987 levels by 1994, was signed by Ireland last May.  I understand that the project to install NOx reduction facilities at Moneypoint is underway and design work, discussions with manufacturers and ordering of the equipment are in progress.  I understand that the installation of all three units will be completed by 1994.  To minimise the cost of the major plant &ldquo;outage&rdquo; required, the ESB's timetable to instal the facilities concerned will take advantage of planned &ldquo;outages&rdquo; in the meantime such as for turbine inspection and overhaul.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Preparatory work to enable Ireland to <Col N="2282" /> accede to the Helsinki Protocol as seen as possible is underway.  The reduction in sulphur dioxide emissions required by 1993 will be achieved through the use of low sulphur coal and oil and, if possible, the continued use of natural gas for power generation and industrial uses.  If necessary, flue gas desulphurisation equipment will be installed at the Moneypoint power station.</P>

In anticipation of this, I have also authorised the authorities concerned to seek tenders for the provision of new sewer networks in both towns with a view to commencing work in the current year.</P>

My Department have, however, taken the following steps in order to assist local authorities in this matter: (1) a report providing advice on the inspection, assessment and rehabitation of masonry <Col N="2298" /> arch bridges, which constitute some 80 per cent of the bridge stock, was commissioned and circulated to local authorities in July 1988; (2) the Local Government Computer Services Board were commissioned in 1988 to prepare an appropriate data base system for storage and analysis of relevant information on old bridges including their age, architecture and structural condition and this has been installed by the local authorities; and (3) road grants have been provided in respect of the preservation of bridges.</P>
      <P>The question of bringing the antiquity and architectural merit of bridges to the attention of tourists would be a matter for the local authorities themselves and relevant tourism interests.

      <P>The brief will pay particular attention to a number of important issues including the availability of sites for secondary treatment; the need for tertiary treatment with a view to reducing nutrient levels; optimum locations of secondary treatment works; optimum route of pipeline to treatment works; options for treatment and disposal of sewage sludge other than by discharge to the sea; and consideration as to whether the effluent from Tramore Valley sewerage system and any other discharges in the immediate area should be treated in the proposed treatment works.</P>

      <P>While there is no prohibition on officers or employees of local authorities <Col N="2301" /> contesting local elections there are provisions affecting employment with a local authority while being a member of that or certain other local authorities.  Section 21 (1) of the Local Government Act, 1955, provides that no person shall hold any office of profit under or be employed for remuneration by or under any local authority while he is a member of that authority.  Section 21 (2) of the Local Government Act, 1955, provides for a prohibition in relation to a major office where the person concerned is a member of any local authority whose functional area is a within or is adjoining the area of the employing local authority.  Section 25 (1) of the Local Elections (Petitions and Disqualifications) Act, 1974, empowers me to designate by order an office or employment of a class, description or grade to which the foregoing section 21 (1) of the Local Government Act, 1955, shall not apply.  Two such orders have been made as follows: (i) Local Elections (Petitions and Disqualifications) Act, 1974 (Section 25) Order, 1974. S. I.

      <P>I am aware of research on the use of chlorine in the treatment of drinking water and the findings are kept under constant review.  I am advised that the controlled use of chlorine provides the most effective means of disinfecting water and maintaining protection from microbiological contamination throughout distribution systems.  In general, the treatment processes at public water supply schemes remove substances, including peat, which cause colour in water, and chlorine is used as a final treatment only when such reactive substances have been eliminated.</P>
      <P>The quality of drinking water is controlled by the European Communities (Quality of Water Intended for Human Consumption) Regulations, 1988, which set a statutory limit of 100 micrograms per litre for the presence of organo-chlorine compounds in drinking water. The regulations also provide that substances used in the preparation of water must not directly or indirectly cause a public health hazard and residual chlorine or other disinfectants used in the treatment of water must be monitored to ensure that this requirement is met.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>The food additives controlled by means of specific statutory regulations in this country are colouring agents, preservatives, emulsifiers, stabilisers, thickening and gelling agents, antioxidants, solvents, mineral hydrocarbons and cyclamate.  Broadly speaking the regulations established `permitted lists' of additives and, where appropriate, specify the conditions of use and the maximum permitted levels.  Any additive, belonging to any of the aforementioned categories, other than one included in such `permitted lists', is automatically prohibited for use or sale in this country.</P>
      <P>The regulations in question with the exception of mineral hydrocarbons, solvents and the sweetener, cyclamate, have the effect of implementing various EC Directives on food additives.  Such directives are regularly reviewed and updated to take account of scientific evidence as to the safety in use of and technological need for such additives.  On the basis of the results of these reviews, the following additives have been removed from the lists of permitted additives in this country.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Antioxidants:</i>&mdash;Diacetyl 5, 6-L Ascorbic Acid (Ascorbylediacetate) (E303).</P>
      <P>
        <i>Colouring Agents:</i> Fast Yellow AB (E105), Orchil or Orcein (E121), Solanthrene Blue RS or Anthragen Blue or Indanthrene Blue (E130), Black 7984 (E152), Burnt Umber (E181), Orange RN, Orange G, Violet 6B, Chocolate Brown FB.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Emulsifiers, Stabilisers, Thickening and Gelling Agents:</i> Ghatti Gum.</P>
      <P>In relation to this category of additives, I propose to introduce regulations soon which will ban the use of the following four substances in line with the provisions of EC Council Directive 86/102:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2308" /> (1)  lactylated fatty acid esters of glycerol and propane-1, 2-diol.</P>
    <P>(2)  polyoxyethylene (8) stearate.</P>
    <P>(3)  polyoxyethylene (40) stearate.</P>
    <P>(4)  dioctyl sodium sulphosuccinate.</P>
    <P>The particular additives specified by the Deputy are permitted for use in this country in accordance with the relevant statutory controls with the following exceptions &mdash; 129 (Allura Red AC), E236 (Formic Acid) and E238 (Calcium Fromate). Regarding the additive, 924 (potassium bromate), which is a flour improving agent, I should point out that while it is not currently regulated in this country, I propose to introduce regulations presently which will have the effect of banning its use.  This is on the basis of advice received from the expert advisory body on food safety, ie the Food Safety Advisory Committee.</P>
    <P>The use of additives in foodstuffs is kept under constant review by this expert body.  In the event of the committee expressing concern about the safety of a particular additive, appropriate action in the interest of public health and safety would be taken.</P>
    <P>In addition to the control set down in specific regulations, control over the use of additives is also exercised by my Department under the sale of Food and Drugs Acts and the Food Hygiene Regulations which provide for general protection for the public by prohibiting the sale of food which is adulterated, contaminated or otherwise unfit for human consumption.</P>
    <P>Statutory control in relation to foodstuffs generally is enforced by the health boards.  Each health board conducts planned food sampling programmes under which different foods are sampled and analysed on a regular basis.  Where a sample is found to be in breach of the statutory requirements, the public analyst issues a certificate on the basis of which prosecution proceedings may be taken by the health board.</P>

In forming this opinion the chief executive officer takes all relevant considerations into account including factors such as those referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>There are two major centres in the State where open heart surgery is performed &mdash; the Mater Hospital, Dublin and Cork Regional Hospital.  There have been no significant increases in the waiting list at Cork.  Due to a change in medical practice by the consultants concerned, and not any budgetary factor, there has been a reduction in the number of coronary artery by-pass grafts carried out at the Mater Hospital with a consequent rise in the numbers awaiting treatment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 327 and 328 together.  The maximum allowable number of students per class teacher in primary schools is 39 in the case of a single grade class group; 38 in the case of a class group with two consecutive grades; and 35 in the case of a multi-grade class group.</P>
      <P>The school authorities and in particular the principal teacher are responsible for the arrangement of classes to ensure that these numbers are not exceeded in any class group.</P>
      <P>The current average pupil-teacher ratio in national schools, based on the enrolments in September 1989 and the number of teachers currently employed is 27:1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A reduction by one unit in the enrolment figure for appointment and retention of teachers in national schools would <Col N="2328" /> result in approximately 500 additional teaching posts at an annual cost of £8 million.

      <P>The arrangements for the reallocation of teaching posts owing to the circumstances outlined by the Deputy are as follows:</P>
      <P>The panel regulations for national schools provide a system whereby an assistant teacher, whose post is being discontinued due to insufficient enrolment, may be transferred to a post in another national school.  The panel regulations are operated on a Diocesan basis and are incorporated in the Rules for National Schools under Rule 97.  A teacher whose post is to be discontinued at the end of a school year may opt to have his-her name placed on the appropriate panel for redeployment.</P>
      <P>The current panel arrangements for national schools are outlined in paragraphs 4 and 5 of Circular 8/90 issued in April 1990.  A copy of that circular is being forwarded to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>A redeployment scheme for lay teachers in Catholic secondary schools has been implemented since 1988 as a result of an agreement between the religious-clerical authorities of those schools and the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland.</P>
      <P>The agreement establishes agreed procedures by which lay teachers may be redeployed to full-time teaching posts within a 30 mile radius, where the number of teachers who may be paid incremental salary is required to be reduced in accordance with the regulations in force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2329" /> No arrangements exist for the redeployment of teachers from those non-Catholic schools where pupil numbers are falling.</P>
    <P>Negotiations on the introduction of a redeployment scheme for the community and comprehensive sector are taking place among the interested parties.  Pending agreement on the introduction of a scheme of redeployment no special arrangements exist for the reallocation of teachers from community and comprehensive schools where numbers are falling.</P>
    <P>My Department allocate teaching posts to VECs on a committee scheme basis and not in respect of individual vocational schools.  The teaching posts allocation to each VEC is based, <i>inter alia</i>, on pupil enrolments and can increase or decrease accordingly as enrolments in the committee scheme go up or down.  The allocation of resources, including teaching resources, to the various vocational schools is a matter for the CEOs and each VEC.  Each VEC is empowered to transfer vocational teachers between schools within its committee scheme.  This procedure is carried out as the needs of different schools may require.</P>
    <P>In addition to the measures outlined above in respect of the different sectors at second level, the Government have agreed that, in the context of demographic decline, where post-primary schools have surplus staff by reference to a 20:1 pupil teacher ratio such staff may be retained to the extent that such retention would be justified by the application of a pupil teacher ratio of 19:1.  This concession does not extend to fee-paying schools.</P>

      <P>When a school is closed and amalgamated with another, all the national school children in the district of the closed school are eligible for free transport to the amalgamated school.  An average of seven eligible children is required to warrant the continuance of this service.</P>

    <P>Where the school has been closed for a period of not less than seven years, my Department will consider allowing transport to the nearest school (where this is not the school of amalgamation) subject to the usual age and distance conditions governing eligibility under the scheme.

      <P>While there is no prohibition on employees of vocational education committees contesting local elections there are provisions affecting employment with a local authority while being a member of that or certain other local authorities.  A VEC is for this purpose regarded as a local authority.</P>
      <P>Section 70 (1) of the Local Government Act, 1925, as applied by section 26 (1) of the Vocational Education Act, 1930, states that a member of a local authority may not be employed by that authority or any other local authority whose functional area is within or adjoining the area of the employing local authority.</P>
      <P>Section 25 (1) of the Local Elections (Petitions and Disqualifications) Act, 1974, empowers me to make an order exempting certain offices or employments from the foregoing.  One such order has been made, i.e. Local Elections (Petitions and Disqualifications) Act, 1974, (Section 25) No. 3 Order, 1974 S.I. 137 of 1974 dated 15 May 1974.</P>

      <P>My Department fund a special project for pre-school children raised in a socio-economic disadvantaged area.  There are 103 children attending the school which is located at Seán McDermott Street, Dublin.  The project is known as the Rutland Street Project and has been in operation since 1969.  I understand that in 1987 the number of children attending pre-schools assisted by the health boards was some 7,200.  I have no information on the number of children being catered for in non-aided pre-school groups.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy on graduates up to and including 1989 is set out in the following table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that my Department recently sanctioned 95 additional <Col N="2346" /> permanent posts under the special scheme of teaching assistants for schools serving disadvantaged areas and 30 additional remedial posts.  In all in excess of 230 new appointments of teachers to permanent posts, in addition to appointments from panels, have been approved in the course of the current school year. Some boards of management have not yet filled posts recently sanctioned.</P>
    <P>From 1 September 1990 there will be a reduction of one unit in the enrolment figures for the appointment and retention of teachers in national schools.  It is estimated that this will result in approximately 250 additional teaching posts and the retention of a further 250 posts.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the Rules for National Schools when a vacancy arises in a national school, the board of management must fill the post from the diocesan panel.  The board of management may only fill the post by open competition if the panel is clear.  The chairman of the board of management of the school referred to by the Deputy was <Col N="2347" /> given permission to fill the post by open competition.  At that time my Department had been informed that a teacher on the panel had been offered, and accepted a post, in another school.  It subsequently transpired that this information was incorrect and the teacher was reinstated on the panel.  Two teachers who had appealed for an exemption from the panel regulations were refused by my Department and were also reinstated on the panel.  The board of management were informed that they could not proceed with an open competition as there were eligible teachers on the panel and were obliged to offer the post to one of the panel teachers.</P>
      <P>I understand that the board of management have now offered the post to one of the panel teachers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department are committed to environmental action relating to a number of transport modes and <Col N="2348" /> are particularly concerned to ensure improved environmental measures which benefit the tourism industry.</P>
      <P>Among the developments of note during Ireland's Presidency of the EC Council of Transport Ministers are the following: earlier this year, a joint working group representative of the EC and third countries was established to agree on common noise pollutant emission standards for an &ldquo;environmental friendly (green) lorry&rdquo;; and a joint working group is studying the medium- to long-term development of combined (rail-road) transport which is of particular benefit in reducing damage to the environment.  It is hoped that the working groups will complete their work during the Irish Presidency.</P>
      <P>In so far as tourism is concerned, I took the opportunity at an informal Council of Ministers of Tourism of the EC in Ashford Castle last month to impress on my colleagues the critical importance of the environment for tourism.  I am happy to report that my EC colleagues concurred with my views and the environment is now firmly on the agenda as an issue for future discussions of European Ministers of Tourism.</P>
      <P>As part of the programme of events in Ireland to mark the European Year of Tourism, I launched an environmental awareness and conservation competition earlier this year &mdash;&ldquo;The Toyota Irish Countryside Awards&rdquo;.  This competition which is being organised jointly by Bord Fáilte and the Irish Countrywomen's Association, seeks to redress environmental problems and damage to the countryside.  In addition, a special effort is being made this year to encourage a substantially larger number of entrants to the Tidy Towns Competition.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's question relates to a requirement in the tourism operational programme that applicants seeking European Structural Fund aid demonstrate that projects are, <i>inter alia,</i> in harmony with the local environment.</P>
      <P>Applications relating to facilities for visiting sportsmen will have to satisfy the administering agencies, Bord Fáilte or SFADCo, that facilities planned are environmentally sensitive and that arrangements are in place to ensure that all relevant protection measures are complied with.  In the case of hunters, this includes all controls imposed by the Wildlife Service of the Office of Public Works, which is the body charged with responsibility for wildlife protection.</P>
