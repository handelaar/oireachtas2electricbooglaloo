      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 12, 13 and 14.  It is also proposed subject to the agreement of the House, that (1) business shall be interrupted at 10.30 p.m. tonight; (2) the sitting shall be suspended today from 6.30 p.m. to 7 p.m.; (3) the proceedings on the Committee Stage of No. 12, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 7 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by the Minister for the Environment.  Private Members' Business shall be No. 28.</P>

      <P>The Workers' Party have no particular objection to sitting until 10.30 p.m. tonight.  However, in view of the fact that the Government have failed and neglected to restore the Broadcasting Bill to Second Stage to allow for a proper debate on it, as promised by the Taoiseach in the House last Thursday, we wish to record our opposition to the Order of Business in the absence of the Broadcasting Bill.</P>

What I would like to try to do, if you assist me, is to ensure that this investigation is completed as quickly as possible or that some statement will be made to remove the pall or cloud of suspicion which hangs over these officials.

      <P>May I ask the Tánaiste to be of assistance?  Will there be a Government statement?  The Taoiseach on a number of occasions has said the reason the statement was not being prepared or issued was that the agenda for the conference had not been completed. The agenda has now been completed. Will the Government circulate at least to the Foreign Affairs spokespersons their set of options in relation to EPU before we enter the debate tomorrow so that there will be a fruitful discussion?</P>

      <P>I see Deputy Howlin nodding his head.  There will be an exchange of statements on EPU, a full statement on the matter from the Government side and, I take it, from each of the political parties, and we will have all day tomorrow devoted to that purpose.  We can go no further than that. That is the essence of democracy.  There is before the Summit a full exchange of each party's views and, more important, of the Government's views on that matter to be heard and discussed in this House tomorrow.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Tánaiste, the time has been arranged.  It is unfortunate from our point of view that it is statements rather than a full debate, but the Taoiseach, through you, Sir, told this House the reason for the non-publication of a statement was the non-establishment of the agenda&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste's reply is extremely unsatisfactory.  Since the EC Summit in Dublin last April I have been raising in this House the necessity for us to debate the Government's proposals before the next Summit at the end of June.  We got indications from the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the Government were contemplating preparing such a paper.  The original intention was that we would discuss that paper tomorrow.  We are now having a debate without the paper so we are flying blind.  We do not know what the Government are going to raise at the EC Summit at the end of June and we have no means of knowing it.  All we did was give our opinions what the Government should do, but we do not know what the Government are going to do.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Water Pollution Bill is back before the House on Committee Stage.  It is some months since we last discussed this important legislation.  It is particularly appropriate as we enter the high fish kill season that this Bill should be before us. Perhaps the Minister would indicate the incidence of pollution so far this year and <Col N="2132" /> the incidence of fish kills, if she has that information.</P>
      <P>To some extent the roles of Government and this Opposition party are somewhat reversed.  I find myself addressing section 21 defending the original section in the Bill which the Government put through the Seanad against amendments put down by both the Government and Fine Gael.  Section 21 is very important because it is concerned with regulating and prohibiting certain agricultural activities in or near water systems.  The logic behind this is that certain types of agricultural activity, for example, the spreading of slurry, the spraying of certain types of pesticides or the use of certain types of fertilisers in some areas can cause serious water pollution and, secondly, that they cumulatively contribute to an insidious form of pollution which causes major problems.  In addition, there are problems associated with the location of slurry tanks, silage pits, etc., and the carrying out of certain types of agricultural activities near lakes and rivers.</P>
      <P>These types of activities do not cause the major discharges into rivers or lakes which would normally be detected by water pollution officers and prosecuted; they are the kind of activities which, if they continue over a period, contribute in a cumulative fashion to water pollution. The purpose of section 21 was to enable local authorities to make by-laws regulating those type of activities and to prohibit other types of activities, for example, to say that a particular pesticide cannot be used near or within a certain distance of a lake or river, certain kinds of fertilisers cannot be used or a slurry tank or silage pit cannot be located within a certain distance of a lake or river, all of which seem to be perfectly reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are now three positions on that proposal.  The first position is the original Government position which, so far as this debate is concerned, is the one I am arguing for and is the one contained in the Bill passed by the Seanad.  The second position is the new Government position <Col N="2133" /> which they arrived at after their negotiations with the IFA and which is now being articulated by the Minister of State. The third position is the Fine Gael position.  This is the undiluted original IFA position which is now being put by Deputy Shatter even though I suspect he does not believe it.</P>
    <P>Section 21 as it stands will enable local authorities to make by-laws and provides that they shall allow 30 days for objections to be made to them.  They will then be sent to the Minister for approval and will come into force on the approval of the Minister.  After that there is a procedure whereby they can be appealed to the Minister and if, having heard the appeal, the Minister is satisfied they have to be amended or annulled that can subsequently be done.  That proposal contained in the Bill which was passed by the Seanad seems to be perfectly reasonable.</P>
    <P>The new Government position, contained in the Minister's amendment, is that the by-laws should not come into force until after an appeal has been heard by the Minister, if an appeal is lodged. That is an exact replica of what happened in regard to the Air Pollution Act which caused it to be frustrated.  If we allow local authorities to make by-laws, somebody who lodges an appeal with the Minister can effectively frustrate the entire procedure for a very long period, as happened with the Air Pollution Act.  If a local authority become aware that farmers in a certain area are using a particular kind of pesticide which they know will cause considerable water pollution and they decide to make by-laws to prohibit its use in that area, even under the original proposal it will take some considerable time for that to be done.  Under the new Government proposal a farmer will be able to make an appeal to the Minister and effectively frustrate the local authority from making that by-law.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael position is even more extreme.  They propose that not alone should the Minister have to hear the appeal but that the by-laws should be brought before Dáil Éireann and approved by it before they are made. <Col N="2134" /> This would mean that even if there was a remote chance of a Minister for the Environment, with all of the responsibilities he has, of eventually getting around to making the by-laws or approving them they would still have to be brought before Dáil Éireann.  We know from experience, with the delays for example, in passing legislation, the chances this House would have of finding time to approve individual sets of by-laws for agricultural activities in certain areas.</P>
    <P>I have noticed over the five and a half months of the Green Presidency that the Minister for the Environment and the Minister of State have become very fond of using the term &ldquo;the precautionary principle&rdquo;, particularly when they are attending international conferences.  This section deals with the precautionary principle, identifies a source of pollution and proposes that instead of waiting until the pollution happens we should do something to try to prevent it from happening. Section 21 of the Bill, as passed by the Seanad, proposes to put into effect the precautionary principle in so far as agricultural activity and water pollution are concerned.  However, that principle has now been abandoned for the simple reason that before the last general election the IFA applied the heat to the Government and forced them to abandon the arrangements contained in the original Bill, to weaken the Bill and to provide for this appeal procedure to be implemented before the by-laws could come into effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to a document circulated by the Minister for the Environment before the last general election and which deals specifically with this section and the power of local authorities to make by-laws.  In that document the Minister said an amendment would be made to the Bill removing the provisions which would have required compliance with by-laws once they were made by a local authority but before the Minister had decided to confirm, modify or annul them.  That is the proposal contained in the amendment the Minister has put before us today.  He proposes amending section 21 so that the by-laws will not come into effect until the procedure of the appeal has been gone through. This will effectively frustrate local authorities from making by-laws which is what will happen in practice, it will negative the effect of section 21 as it was originally intended and will mean, in practice, that local authorities will have little or no power to influence or make regulations covering agricultural activities which they believe, from their experience, will cause water pollution.  This is a very retrograde step and will result in the continuing problem of water pollution and dead fish being hauled out of rivers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be very brief.  Fine Gael believe it has taken far too long to have this legislation brought before the House.  We regret that it has taken a number of weeks for the Committee Stage to be brought back into this House after the last occasion on which we discussed the Bill.  I want to make a general remark which I believe is relevant to our approach today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We regard it as essential to complete this Committee Stage today and to take Report Stage early next week so that this legislation can be enacted before the summer season starts.  I say this because of the appalling incidence of water pollution we had last year, 111 major water pollution incidents which resulted in more than 30,000 fish being killed.  This legislation was first published in January 1989 but due to its defects when originally <Col N="2136" /> published it has taken until now to get to Committee Stage.  We want to see this legislation on the Statute Book.  In so far as we are making amendments to this legislation that might bring it back into the Seanad, I urge the Minister to complete it today to get it back into the Seanad rapidly so that we can complete it next week and have it on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 21, I am somewhat amused by Deputy Gilmore's contribution. Deputy Gilmore wants to maintain a pretence that the only party in this House in any way interested in or committed to the environment is The Workers' Party.  That is not the reality. I am proud it was my own party who published the legislation establishing the Environmental Protection Agency and the comprehensive environment programme that resulted, some nine or 10 months later, in the Government producing a programme of their own.  My concern about section 21 is one I would have expected Deputy Gilmore to share. The section as originally drafted envisaged a local authority setting out by way of by-laws detailed provisions as to how farmers should deal on a day-to-day basis with agricultural problems on their lands. I agree with Deputy Gilmore that some of our problems in the area of water pollution are the result of some sections of the farming community behaving without regard to the impact on the environment and the pollution caused by the use of various fertilisers.  It is a principle of The Workers' Party that local communities should have the opportunity to make a direct input into local government policy matters.</P>
    <P>I would have expected Deputy Gilmore to recognise that nowadays the overwhelming majority of farmers acknowledge that they themselves have a vested interest in protecting the environment. It is not just in the interests of the community but in the interests of good farming that water pollution be minimised.  The type of incidents we have seen in past years as a result of people running piggeries and spreading fertilisers without taking into account the <Col N="2137" /> damage they were doing to nearby lakes and rivers are no longer tolerated by the overwhelming majority of farmers.  They recognise that the protection of the environment, of rivers and lakes, is consistent with good farming.  The farmer will not be thanked if he poisons a river and thereby affects his neighbour's cattle half a mile downriver.  What we are dealing with here is a small group of irresponsible farmers whom the various farming organisations are trying to persuade to start behaving responsibly in the context of neighbouring farmers and the community.</P>
    <P>Section 21 as originally drafted envisaged that the local authority would make by-laws which would become immediately operative.  When they were operative and when people could be prosecuted members of the farming community realised that there was something seriously wrong with the by-laws, something not practical in them and they did not provide the environmental protection that was required.  I do not agree with Deputy Gilmore that most of the farming community have a vested interest in preserving polluting techniques.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not my view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>His view seems to be that there is a majority of rogue farmers who want to deliberately disrupt the application of these by-laws and who produce spurious reasons to prevent them becoming operative.  The reality is that the overwhelming majority of farmers have a vested interest in ending pollution.  There is a possibility &mdash; and I would hope that Deputy Gilmore would agree with me on this &mdash; that officials in local authorities who present draft by-laws to their local authorities for approval may not initially always get it right, that the by-laws may not have enough protections in them or may lay down provisions that are impracticable in the context of running a farm. The Fine Gael amendments were designed to stimulate the Government well in advance into looking again at these sections so that when we come into <Col N="2138" /> this House we would be able to address the problems rapidly.  It was certainly never envisaged that we would wait for a Committee Stage debate in June 1990 to get down to the issue.</P>
      <P>I have no theological attachment to implementing word for word the amendments we proposed.  We proposed these amendments in February or March 1989 prior to the Second Stage debate in this House.  We felt it was correct, in the interests of ensuring that the correct by-laws were made with the necessary environmental protections, that the local authorities would be required to approve and publish them in draft form, rather than the by-laws instantly coming into force and the Minister having to amend them at a later stage.  The local authority would be required to bring them to the notice of the people living in the area so that they could express views on them to the Minister for the Environment who would, within a statutorily defined period, make the by-laws or have them amended.  That is what we are trying to achieve.  It would make little sense to have a situation where a local authority would make by-laws which were instantly legally enforceable, commence a prosecution on foot of those by-laws and, pending prosecution, the Minister as a result of recommendations made about the defectiveness of by-laws amends them.  Then there is the amended series of by-laws, perhaps removing the provision under which the prosecution was taking place, and a court is asked to determine the issue.  There would be a constitutional problem because the power of the Minister to amend the by-laws at a time when prosecution is pending is doubtful in a constitutional context because of a whole series of court decisions which says that the Government or the legislator cannot interfere to amend laws in a way that would affect a pending prosecution before the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The formula the Government initially set up under section 21, therefore, had a series of defects.  One was that if the by-laws would not provide sufficient protections they would nevertheless instantly become law before the Minister <Col N="2139" /> could propose amendments to them to make them effective.  It meant members of the local communities, farming and non-farming, who wished to see the by-laws firmed up in some way could spend some considerable time trying to get their point across to the Minister for the Environment before the by-laws would become effective.  It would mean that by-laws that became law, that perhaps were completely unrealistic in the context of ordinary farming practice but which if they were changed would not reduce the environmental protection they afforded, could become part of the legal system.  In the short term, it could have a dramatic impact on the ability of individual farmers to farm in ways that pose no environmental dangers but which have been made illegal under the by-laws.</P>
    <P>We want to get the procedure right and under the Fine Gael amendments there would be a more logical process.  The by-laws would be prepared in draft form, would go to the Department of the Environment and before they are approved would be published in the area.  There would be a limited time opportunity to make representations as to changes necessary.  Those changes would not necessarily water down the by-laws; they could result in them being firmed up substantially. After that, the by-laws would become law and prosecutions could take place under them.  That seems to be a logical system.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the decision by Fine Gael to publish proposals along those lines stimulated the Government into producing their own set of proposals. I might remark that this is the longest contribution I will make because I want to ensure that we complete Committee Stage today and in the light of that, I will not be pressing Fine Gael amendments to the section.  I will be formally withdrawing them, if necessary.  We will accept the amendments the Government have tabled to this section which we believe will result in a more workable formula.  The amended section will ensure that true legal protections will be in place without the problems I am concerned about arising.  This will ensure <Col N="2140" /> that local communities will have an opportunity to have a say in regard to the by-laws.  There will be a true local input to providing protection for local communities against water pollution.  Local communities, in the making of by-laws, will have an opportunity to make an input.</P>
    <P>I deeply regret the approach by Deputy Gilmore.  It seems to be designed, in farming jargon, to spread the muck around.  He seems to be suggesting that because my party, the main Opposition party, proposed changes to this measure, we are not as committed to resolving the problems of water pollution as other groups.  I should like to tell the Deputy that before he was elected to the House we had been working on this problem as we knew the types of reform that were necessary.  We want the Bill passed by the Dáil and the Seanad in its amended form before the House adjourns for the summer recess.</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact that the Bill has returned to the House. Obviously, there is a commitment on all sides to assist in the early passage of the Bill.  Like Deputy Gilmore, I want to avoid the introduction of a complicated system which would prolong the process of introducing by-laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government can assist in that regard by introducing a set of guidelines for local authorities at an early stage but local authorities have very limited staff to deal with water pollution.  The spreading of slurry presents difficulties for local authorities and, in certain instances, for farmers.  Under section 4 of the 1977 Act licences may be granted by local authorities to farmers spreading slurry on land that is over an aquifer, whether that aquifer is providing a public or private water supply.  To my knowledge no licence has <Col N="2141" /> been granted by a local authority for the spreading of slurry.</P>
    <P>The only practical method of disposing of slurry here is by spreading it on land. On the continent, where there are larger farming units, it is possible to treat it in slurry treatment plants.  To my knowledge, there is one such treatment plant here, in Bandon, County Cork where the methane gas is used as a source to produce power and the solid residue is used as a fertiliser for shrubs and so on. It is not practical at present to think in terms of farmers, particularly small farmers, erecting treatment plants.  It could be that an entire farm unit is on top of an aquifer.  That occurs where there is a lot of limestone on a farm.  It is almost certain that if land has limestone as a base rock there are aquifers present.  We must remember that when ground water is polluted by nitrates, it can take up to 200 years for that water source to cleanse itself, even after the source of pollution has been removed.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not deal with the problem of slurry.  We must dispose of slurry in some way and that may create serious financial problems for farmers.  Indeed, it may put some farmers out of business. In the UK, it is estimated that four million people are drinking water contaminated by nitrates and there is some evidence to suggest that that water causes stomach cancer.  The decision to introduce by-laws is a move in the right direction but the Minister should prepare guidelines for local authorities to help them in that process.  We should not forget that we have to deal with the problem of the disposal of slurry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to a statement by Deputy Gilmore in the House on 14 March, as reported at column 239, volume 397 of the Official Report.  Deputy Gilmore was referring to an amendment I had tabled to an earlier section and I should like to correct him. Deputy Gilmore stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On an earlier section in this Bill to <Col N="2142" /> which Deputy Garland had an amendment which would allow for a certain process of appeal to the Minister, Deputy Shatter made the point that that would lead to the politicisation of the legislation, and I agreed with him.</P>
    <P>I should like to state that that was a misinterpretation of my amendment No. 9 but I am sure it was not intentional. What I said in regard to amendment No. 9 was that at the moment there was no appeal from a decision by An Bord Pleanála not to grant an oral hearing in a water pollution licence case.  In that amendment I suggested that there should be an appeal against that decision to the Minister.  That is an entirely different matter.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputies Gilmore and O'Shea that the original section was a reasonably good one.  Of course, we must ask ourselves why the Minister and Deputy Shatter brought in amendments to change this section.  It is quite obvious that these changes were brought in at the behest of the IFA.  Any pressure group or business organisation is quite entitled to make representations to Deputies in this House &mdash; I have received many &mdash; and we should look at them very carefully. Nevertheless, I am most disappointed that in this case they have considerably weakened the Bill.  I can only suggest &mdash; I do not like doing so &mdash; that they have given in to the big stick of the IFA.  It is a sad day for the House and it is well that some of us are prepared to stand up and be counted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Deputies for their contributions to these amendments.  In particular, I should like to thank Deputy Shatter for agreeing to withdraw his amendments in favour of the official amendment as this will lead to speedy deliberations on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason the amendment is put forward in this form is that we want to have an effective, workable and fair by-law system.  I did not negotiate this amendment with the IFA, nor did I discuss it <Col N="2143" /> with them.  I can assure Deputy Gilmore that any documentation he has does not contain my amendment because nothing was agreed with the IFA.</P>
    <P>This amendment, which puts a time limit on when the Minister must make a decision, is, in all the circumstances, workable and fair.  Deputy Shatter referred to some of the difficulties and I should like to reiterate them.  There would be enormous legal difficulties if the Bill was to stand in its present form.  Any prosecution taken by a local authority after by-laws were established &mdash; and if those by-laws were subsequently annulled or amended by the Minister &mdash; would probably fall or would certainly be declared invalid.  Even if they were not they would cause enormous legal difficulties and complications in their interpretation. We must have a clear, precise and fair system.  I emphasise &ldquo;fair&rdquo; because if a local authority essentially represent only the rural area they might see a situation from a very different perspective than if they had to take on board a mixture of an urban and rural area.  If, for example, in an exclusively rural local authority area where there was a small scattering of urban houses, the local rural community decided that they did not want any of the householders to have animal pets because they posed a risk to farm animals and decided to bring in a system of by-laws prohibiting anyone in the immediate vicinity from having pets, surely people would regard that as an unnecessary, drastic measure?  Indeed, many rural communities might decide to do that.  Those of us who have a small scattering of agricultural activities in our area often get such complaints, from farmers in particular, about the huge difficulties which arise as a result of people keeping domestic pets.  I sympathise with them but the answer is not to simply ban them or to bring in a by-law which would totally prohibit them, they can be controlled in another way.  The same applies in relation to farm activities.  We must see the situation from a wider perspective and that is the job and the duty of the Department of the Environment and the Minister.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2144" /> These by-laws, made by the local authorities, will stand if a decision is not made within six months.  I was keen to ensure that a time limit would be put on the making of a ministerial decision, I know that because of time constraints, pressures and difficulties of one kind or another, it might often be the case that even if by-laws were made by local authorities, it could take a considerable time before they would be annulled, amended or confirmed.  There is a realistic time limit.</P>
    <P>In relation to the need and wish of farmers to see an unpolluted environment, I agree with Deputy Shatter's comments.  The farming community often get a very bad press in this regard. A small number of farmers vigorously oppose any legislation in the area of the environment &mdash; and I am amazed that they do &mdash; but they should realise that their own interests are served by the strongest possible environmental measures.  Our food industry, for example, which is worth £3.5 billion annually, accounts for one quarter of all industrial jobs and for 40 per cent of net export earnings at present.  It is a major industry and, if it is to grow and develop, it will only do so in the context of a clean, green and unpolluted environment. Farmers in particular and those in the agri-business sector generally have a vested interest in seeing that our country is clean, green and unpolluted.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Shea that the spreading of slurry is a major difficulty. The new Environmental Protection Agency Bill which will be published shortly &mdash; the birth is imminent as the gestation period is almost over &mdash; will contain provision in relation to that matter.  There will also be widespread provision for advice and guidelines in relation to matters of that kind to be conducted on behalf of or in conjunction with local authorities by the new agency. I agree with Deputy O'Shea that there is a need to issue guidelines to local authorities and that will be a matter for the Department if this Bill is passed before the Environmental Protection Agency is established.  If not, the agency will have <Col N="2145" /> a role in issuing guidelines, direction and assistance in the making of these by-laws.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the debate.  I am happy that the amendment is fair, equitable and practical in all the circumstances and that it will avoid many of the legal complications which could arise if the Bill stood in its present form. Deputy Gilmore asked about fish kills this year.  I do not have the statistics at present as they are collected by the fisheries boards and local authorities and then sent to the fisheries research centre of the Department of the Marine. However, I undertake to have my officials contact the centre this afternoon, or as soon as possible, to get the latest statistics and, if I get them before Committee Stage is completed, I will mention them.  If not, I will make them available to Deputy Gilmore and the other spokespersons if they are interested.</P>

      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister and the Department have taken on board our worries and difficulties in regard to the workability of the section as originally drafted.  They have also addressed our concern that the section may not have been as effective as it should be in the context of by-laws without being dealt with in this way.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that not only Deputy Gilmore but also Deputy Garland &mdash; who I think should know better &mdash; should be hung up on conspiracy theories about the Fine Gael Party; the Government parties can take care of themselves without the Fine Gael Party trying to water down measures in any way.  In the context of all of the parties in this House &mdash; and indeed well before Deputy Garland's election &mdash; we have been in the forefront of seeking major reforms of environmental legislation.  To be quite frank about it, Deputy Garland's contributions to debates on environmental matters since he came into this House have been somewhat pale in comparison with those of Members of my own party or, in fairness, with those of Members of the Labour and The Workers' Parties. Deputy Garland should be a little cautious in over-personalising his criticisms. I welcome the Minister's amendment to this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to prolong the debate but I do wish to place on record my opposition to amendment No. 35 for the reasons I indicated earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might refer to a couple of earlier comments by Deputy Shatter.  I do agree with him that the vast majority of our <Col N="2148" /> farmers have a concern about the environment, and do take as much care as they possibly can to protect it.  However, there is a difficulty, that, by and large, agricultural activity is not covered by planning legislation.  The only way in which agricultural activity can be controlled is by the making of the kinds of by-laws provided for in this Bill.  To listen to Deputy Shatter one would think that by-laws were being written by officials sitting in town and county halls who are remote from agricultural activity.  There are many farmers, and many members of the IFA &mdash; when they lobbied for changes to be effected in this section &mdash; who probably thought likewise.  Of course the reality is that by-laws are made by elected members of local authorities.  In any agricultural area it is safe to assume that a local authority would very often be composed of members of the farming community, many of whom may be members of Deputy Shatter's party. Therefore, far from some sinister process taking place in an office in a county hall, the making of by-laws is a democratic process.</P>
    <P>The difficulty with which we are faced here is that, by the time a local authority will have made the by-laws, will have awaited Ministerial approval and now will have awaited a further six months within which an appeal can be lodged, the agricultural activity which the by-laws may have been intended to address may already have taken place and the pollution occurred.  If the by-laws were intended to deal with, say, the spreading of a particular kind of fertiliser or pesticide at a particular time, that would be well and truly done before the by-laws could be made and any appeal heard.</P>
    <P>We have already had experience of legislation in respect of which individuals or interests have a right to appeal.  For example, the Air Pollution Act was frustrated by the exercise of such appeals.  It is not a case of a community deciding to appeal.  All it takes is one individual farmer &mdash; who may well be the greatest polluter in a given area &mdash; to lodge an appeal, and then there elapses a period <Col N="2149" /> of six months within which the appeal process has to be completed.</P>
    <P>I find the Minister's amendment strange, particularly given that her Department's research environmental unit published a booklet some time ago on farm waste and pollution which addressed the very problem about which I am speaking, this kind of continuous pollution arising from particular kinds of activity.  That booklet suggested an answer to the problem.  It was said that the Government were taking action on the matter, more recently by an amending Bill which, <i>inter alia,</i> proposes greatly increased penalties against those causing water pollution and additional powers for local authorities in dealing with pollution risks arising from agricultural activities. The Minister's amendment effectively undermines what the environmental research unit of her Department recommend as the solution to this problem.</P>

      <P>I am opposing the Minister's amendment for the reasons outlined by Deputy Gilmore and for other reasons.  In reply to Deputy Shatter I might say I did not seek to personalise this debate or to attack Deputy Shatter. I do not think it is of any interest to this House what I think of Deputy Shatter. Equally I do not think it is of interest to this House what Deputy Shatter thinks of me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not, I hasten to add, before I am accused of something else.  I fail to understand Deputy Garland's logic because, in the discussion we had a few minutes ago, he made a very strong case for the whole notion of having an appeals <Col N="2150" /> system.  In an earlier part of the Committee Stage debate he was concerned that, when An Bord Pleanála refused an oral hearing on a water pollution licence, an appeal could be made to the Minister because he believed people had a right to appeal.  If that logic is to be applied to this case he thinks everybody should have the right to appeal provided they are of the environmentalist persuasion but, if it is a farmer &mdash; as Deputy Gilmore said, even one farmer &mdash; that same right does not seem to exist.  I do not understand the logic of that.</P>
      <P>I believe that the amendment we propose is workable and will be effective.  As Deputy Gilmore suggested, it would not be in contravention of the ERU of my Department; that is total rubbish.  It does not prevent local authorities from making by-laws.  It simply ensures that the system of making by-laws is effective and workable. I do not think any local authority would thank us if they were to make by-laws, initiate prosecutions, and subsequently to involve themselves in long legal disputes because a Minister amended, annulled, or in some way changed, the by-laws originally made.</P>
      <P>I believe the amendment will be seen to be effective.  Even in advance of the passage of this Bill local authorities can be examining their areas to ascertain where they might initiate the making of by-laws.  Six months after the passage of this Bill, if particular local authorities so wish, they can make or confirm by-laws. That is not unreasonable since they did not have that provision heretofore.  To ask them to wait a further six months after the passage of the Bill does not constitute an unreasonable delay in all the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put a brief request to the Minister?  Clearly there are parts of the country in which such by-laws should be put in place.  Clearly this Bill &mdash; all being well &mdash; will be enacted in the course of this session.  I would request that the Minister's Department circularise local authorities to advise them before the summer period &mdash; when local authorities will go into recess for a couple <Col N="2151" /> of months &mdash; that their managements should bring before their local authorities a proposal for the making of by-laws to ascertain the views of local members on whether by-laws should be made under this provision.  This would be to ensure that, in those areas of the country where they are required, by-laws could be prepared over the summer months and put in place speedily when needed.  Very often what happens, after the passage of a Bill, is that it takes a number of months for the Department to circulate local authorities. If those local authorities are under staffed and over-worked, they do not get round to ascertaining what new obligations are imposed on them by the relevant legislation.  I make that by way of a constructive suggestion to ensure that, where by-laws are needed, they are put in place as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I would again like to refer to my suggestion of introducing guidelines to advise local authorities.  The Minister reacted positively towards this suggestion but she has said the guidelines may await the coming into being of the Environmental Protection Agency.  I suggest that is neither desirable nor necessary and I ask that she give an assurance that the guidelines will be with the local authorities at the same time as management are advised of the new legislation coming into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy has misunderstood me.  What I said was that obviously this would be a role for the Environmental Protection Agency when it is up and running.  In advance of that, and when the Bill comes into force we may well decide to issue guidelines from the Department.  I do not know if it is practical to do this at the same time as circularise them with details of the Bill as Deputy Shatter has suggested.  However, I will certainly look into the possibility of doing so as quickly as possible.</P>

The provision could be availed of to extend controls to a new industry discharging effluent to a different part of the combined drain, which was not declared to be a sewer under the original order or to revoke an order in the event of industry ceasing to discharge to the combined drain.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(7) In this section `sewage effluent' does not include domestic sewage being discharged to a combined drain and from the combined drain to a sewer.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment caters for a consequential change arising from the transfer of the definition of combined drain from section 22 of the Bill to section 2. It might be noted that the purpose of having a definition of &ldquo;sewage effluent&rdquo; which will apply to section 22 is to ensure there will be no change in the present licensing requirements of the 1977 Act in relation to domestic sewage which discharges eventually to a sanitary authority sewer simply because a combined drain was declared to be a sewer.  At present no licence is required for domestic sewage discharges to a sewer but a licence is needed where the discharge is made directly to waters.  The definition being included in section 22 will ensure that domestic effluent discharged to a combined drain which subsequently connects to a sewer will similarly not require a licence.  Where the discharge goes via the drain to waters, the necessary level of protection can be ensured under the licensing system operated under section 4 of the 1977 Act.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 43 will introduce an element of flexibility in relation to the length of the combined drain which is to become a sewer.  In some situations it may be appropriate to make an order in respect of the entire combined drain, while in others an order relating to a specified part of the drain may be sufficient to achieve the intended controls on the effluent discharges.  There may also be circumstances in which it is desirable to exercise control over individual industrial discharges to a combined drain which connects to a private effluent treatment works and to maintain the present licensing controls under section 16 (4) of the 1977 Act on the discharge from the treatment works when it goes to waters or to a sewer.  This amendment will make such controls possible where the sanitary authority considers them appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate there was a discussion on this issue previously and I do not want to reopen it, but I would simply like to explain why I am opposed to the Minister's amendment.  The amendment seeks to introduce what is known as the good defence provision to section 171 of the Fisheries Act, 1959. That Act is the main instrument which is relied upon by the regional fisheries boards in taking prosecutions for water pollution, in some cases against local authorities.  The reason regional fisheries boards rely on this Act is that they find that under the 1977 Act, which contains this good defence provision, it is too difficult to secure prosecutions against those committing water pollution offences.  I am informed that each of the regional fisheries boards would take between ten and 50 prosecutions per year under section 171 of the Fisheries Act, 1959.  I am further informed that it is difficult to secure a conviction under section 171 as it stands.  Cases can often be complicated, there can often be difficulties establishing who is the owner of the land or the property concerned, and there is often difficulty in proving the evidence that has been collected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister's amendment is passed and if section 25 (2) remains in this Bill, the regional fisheries boards will not be able to pursue prosecutions with the same degree of effect as they have been doing under section 171 of the 1959 Act.  Let me give an example.  We know of cases at present where regional fisheries boards bring local authorities to court as a result of the discharge of sewage into rivers and that they have secured convictions <Col N="2158" /> against local authorities for that reason. If this subsection goes into section 25, in practice regional fisheries boards will no longer be able to secure such convictions. In other words, the local authority will be able to offer as a defence the fact that they do not have the money to carry out the work, that they have a scheme prepared or whatever.  It would render the Fisheries Act, 1959, ineffective.</P>
    <P>I have received correspondence on this matter from some of the regional fisheries boards, as I am sure have other Deputies. For example, I have received correspondence from the Western Regional Fisheries Board and, with your indulgence, I would like to quote from it.  It states:</P>
    <P>At a recent Board Meeting, The Western Regional Fisheries Board expressed serious reservations regarding some provisions of the Local Government (Water Pollution) (Amendment) Bill, 1989.</P>
    <P>In particular the Board expressed concern at the amendment to Section 171 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, which was put down by the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>Heretofore, under Section 171 (i) (b) of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, it was an offence to throw, empty, permit or cause to fall into any waters any deleterious matter.  Under the amendment, the Board feels that it will be more difficult to prevent the discharge of deleterious matter into waters.</P>
    <P>Some years ago, there were moves to have Sections 171 and 172 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, repealed.  This was strenuously opposed by fishery boards and angling interests.</P>
    <P>The Board can indicate cases where, under the amendment put down by the Minister for the Environment, it would be possible for polluters to prove a good defence and so avoid conviction.</P>
    <P>I have received further correspondence from another board which point out that since the 1977 Act came into effect there <Col N="2159" /> has not been a single case taken on indictment, and the reason is that any case referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions was returned on the grounds of the defence provisions of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977.  In other words, the good defence clause which is built into the 1977 Act, and which the Minister is now proposing to extend to the 1959 Act, has been used quite successfully in preventing cases on indictment being taken under the 1977 Act and will, in the opinion of the regional fisheries boards, render ineffective the 1959 Act and their powers to take action under that Act.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the regional fisheries boards, even though they have had available to them the 1977 Act, have tended to rely on the 1959 Act when taking prosecutions because that Act did not include the good defence clause. What the Minister is doing is building into the 1959 Act the good defence provision, which is in the 1977 Act, which local authority officers, who are responsible for this area, and the regional fisheries boards will tell you is hindering the making of prosecutions.  I am opposed to the Minister's amendment and to subsection (2) of section 25.</P>

      <P>I would like to suggest means of dealing with this problem.  I have received similar correspondence to that received by Deputy Gilmore.  It seems the fisheries boards are concerned about this section.  It is clear that the approach adopted in the Bill is to provide a degree of uniformity between the local government water pollution legislation and the Fisheries Acts.  The Minister's <Col N="2160" /> amendment is in line with what we discussed in the earlier section &mdash; to continue the uniformity to move away from what I thought, and I think all sides of the House agree, was the wrong approach in the context of the defence provision.  We now have another problem.  The fisheries boards are very concerned, as Deputy Gilmore said, about prosecuting local authorities in certain circumstances which can be quite different from cases where prosecutions are brought against a corporate body or a private individual in the context of pollution.</P>
      <P>It was only in the last week to ten days that these problems were voiced by the fisheries boards &mdash; I presume Deputy Gilmore proposed a late amendment in response to those representations.  I took the view that because we discussed this matter in some detail the last day, we probably would not be allowed rerun the debate today.  In the light of the worries that have been expressed by the fisheries boards, would the Minister have discussions with them with a view to coming back to the House on Report Stage to ensure that we deal correctly with this provision as it operates under the Fisheries Acts?  The worst of all worlds would be for the House to divide on this amendment when it is only a week or ten days since the fisheries boards expressed their worries.  To adopt an approach that may not be right would prevent us from dealing with the matter on Report Stage.  That would be the worst of all worlds and it could give rise to the worst scenario.  It may be very well when the Bill returns to the Seanad that the Minister will take the view that she needs to address this issue. Instead of this Bill finishing in this term we may have the Seanad making a further amendment and returning it to this House.  Strictly speaking, procedurally, the Seanad is only supposed to deal with amendments made in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister and also to Deputy Gilmore that there is need to ensure that the worries expressed by the fisheries boards are resolved.  There has been very little focus so far in the debate on this Bill on the fisheries boards and their problems.  We have been dealing <Col N="2161" /> with local authorities and the general problem of water pollution, both industrial and agricultural.  We have only briefly addressed the problems which local authorities create from time to time and only recently we had another instance of a local authority being successfully prosecuted.  I invite the Minister to tell the House that in regard to this provision she will come back to it on Report Stage in the context of discussions with the fisheries boards.  I assume that the circular letter which I and Deputy Gilmore received was also circulated to the Minister.  If she did not get a copy &mdash; it is clear she should have received a copy &mdash; I, and I am sure Deputy Gilmore, would be happy to furnish her with one. In the interests of resolving this issue that would be a constructive way of proceeding rather than dividing on something today, of which the Minister has not been informed, and possibly making the wrong decisions simply because of numbers on either side of this House in the sense of numbers of Members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister does not withdraw her amendment I will be pressing my amendment very strongly.  This is another example of giving in to the vested interests.  It is nonsense for this Government to talk about doubling tourist numbers in the next five years when the best we can do in the way of water pollution legislation is this watered-down Bill.  This is another example of it.  I am glad at this stage that Deputy Shatter has, at least, made some effort to oppose the sections of this Bill because up to now it has been a very cosy debate between the two major parties in this House who are responding to the lobbies and the interest groups.  We all know who they are.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I am not in a position to withdraw the amendment because there is no amendment to withdraw. What we are discussing has actually been agreed and was consequential on earlier amendments.  Therefore, there is nothing to vote on.  However, that is a matter for the Chair's guidance later.</P>
      <P>I want to emphasise that I have not received the correspondence which the other Deputies seem to have received.  It is strange since this Bill was published in January 1989, or thereabouts, that it should take until now for the fisheries boards to make their representations. These provisions of the Bill were put in at the request of the Department of the Marine; the parent Department of the fisheries boards.  However, I would be concerned about the reservations expressed by the fisheries boards.  It is not my wish in any way to lessen the powers they have or to avoid anyone, regardless of who has been prosecuted, under our water pollution legislation.  I will examine the reservations &mdash; when I receive a copy of them &mdash; of the fisheries boards and perhaps we can discuss it again on Report Stage.  The matter we are discussing is part of the Bill as passed by the Seanad.  All we did earlier was to amend it somewhat.  The provisions of the Fisheries Act, 1980, were already referred to in section 25 of the original Bill which was passed by the Seanad.  So it was not a new amendment introduced on Committee Stage but rather one we simply changed somewhat.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their comments. In view of the fact that we will not have a vote as there is nothing to withdraw, I will examine the reservations of the fisheries boards' officers and will refer to it again on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am absolutely astonished at what the Minister has said that this section is going into the Bill at the request of the Department of the Marine. While the circular letters we have received have only been issued in the past <Col N="2163" /> ten days or so, I certainly had received representations previously from some of the regional fisheries boards.  It was made very clear to me that they had routed representations through the Central Fisheries Board and on to their parent Department that the defence provision that exists in the 1977 Act should not be extended to the 1959 Act as subsection (2) of section 25 is seeking to do.  I am absolutely astonished to learn that this is being done at the request of the Department of the Marine.  The regional fisheries boards are absolutely opposed to this.  They make the point very clear that if section 25 remains as it is in this Bill, the regional fisheries boards will not be able to prosecute local authorities or other people who are polluting our waters because they will be able to get out from under the prosecution by using the defence clause in the same way as they would under the provisions of the 1977 Act.  After all the ballyhoo about water pollution we will end up with a Bill which the regional fisheries boards, who have been the most vigorous in pursuing prosecutions, tell us is not enforceable.</P>
      <P>I do not recall a vote being taken on this issue at an earlier stage.  I agree with Deputy Shatter that if the Minister gives an assurance that the issue of whether the defence clause should be extended to section 171 of the 1959 Act will be looked at between now and Report Stage in the light of what the regional fisheries boards have said, then I will not press the matter. I did not think the Minister was absolutely categoric in her reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to clarify something. It seems to me that in the context of the letter we received that there was a little confusion on the part of the fisheries boards.  I think the Minister is confused as well and this might afford her an opportunity for some clarification.  We have in the Bill as it stands section 25 and subsection (2) which is euphemistically referred to as the good defence clause and we have the Minister's amendment No. 51 which seeks to replace the existing subsection (2) with the new subsection (2) which is along the lines of what we <Col N="2164" /> agreed earlier in the Bill.  We have the proposal that subsection (2) should be deleted altogether.  It would seem that we could very well today vote on something. The essence of it is not whether the Minister's subsection (2) or the existing subsection (2) is the better subsection but rather if we need subsection (2) at all or is there a problem in the fisheries legislation with it.</P>
      <P>The circular letter seemed to address section 25 (2) of the Bill and not amendment No. 51 in the name of the Minister. Although I suspect they do not have a different view, I do not know whether the fisheries boards have a view more or less favourable to the Minister's amendment to section 25 (2).  It may be that they regard the Minister's amendment as being better but probably would prefer if that subsection was not in the Fisheries Act.</P>
      <P>The Minister is wrong when she says that we cannot have a vote today.  If we want to have a vote today we can because the amendment seeks to amend the Fisheries Act whereas the previous amendment was to the Bill.  Having regard to the fact that the fisheries boards wrote to all the Opposition spokespersons, in fairness it was remiss of them not to write to the Minister.  It is quite obvious that the points they made to us should also have been made to the Minister.  Deputy Gilmore indicated that he has received representations about this matter from the fisheries boards but the first time they brought it to my attention was when they issued the circular letter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to bring back the amendment on Report Stage procedurally we have to have this discussion today, but I suggest that the Minister put in abeyance her amendment and retable it on Report Stage and that we, on this side of the House, put in abeyance the possibility of a vote against subsection (2) to enable her to have some contact with the fisheries boards.  I suggest that if the Department of the Marine are not communicating the correct detailed information to her, she might make direct contact with the fisheries boards.  I do not know whether the niceties of governmental responsibilities <Col N="2165" /> preclude her from doing so, but I put it to her that if the Bill goes wrong it is the Minister for the Environment or the Minister of State at that Department, and not the Minister for the Marine, who will be held responsible.  Therefore, in order to be helpful to the Minister and as we in the Fine Gael Party wish to ensure that the Bill is effective and works, I suggest that she would do no damage to her proposal or to the Bill if she were to leave in abeyance her proposed amendment until Report Stage and we on this side of the House leave in abeyance a possible vote against subsection (2) until Report Stage.</P>
    <P>I am not interested in making a political point where Deputies on this side of the House would troop through one lobby and the Government Deputies would troop through the other lobby with the Minister getting her amendment through, but when prosecutions go wrong in two years' time no doubt some bright person on this side of the House will stand up and harangue the Minister and say it was all her fault.  That would mean that the right legislation was not in place.  I am interested in having the right legislation in place and not in having a vote today as this would preclude us from dealing with it on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>Other than the issue of fines there is very little of substance left over for Report Stage.  Therefore, I invite the Minister to deal with the matter in this way so that we can come back to this amendment on Report Stage.  I also urge her to talk directly to the fisheries boards and not take the circuitous route with the boards communicating with the Department of the Marine who, in turn, will vet the communication and pass on their own distilled version to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, we could have a vote on the section but as I understand it &mdash; and I am subject to the guidance of the Chair &mdash; this amendment is consequential on a previous one and therefore cannot be voted on.  I have no objection to meeting the fisheries boards. I understand communication was made with them by way of a telephone call <Col N="2166" /> during the past few weeks.  I am interested in pursuing their reservations because I am not interested in weakening, nor would I be happy to weaken in any way, the powers they already have.</P>
      <P>We have to understand that it will not be impossible for them to bring a prosecution or to get a conviction.  The good defence does not prevent someone being prosecuted.  What it simply does is allow the people concerned to argue, to the satisfaction of the court that they have put the appropriate facilities in place, that they have used them but could not have foreseen that pollution would occur as a result of their activities.  I believe that that good defence will be interpreted by the courts in a reasonable and fair manner, but that does not mean that people cannot be prosecuted or convicted in the event of pollution occurring.  It simply means that if they put the appropriate facilities in place, use them appropriately and take all the necessary steps to avoid water pollution, but pollution occurs as a result of an accident, they would not be convicted as that would not be fair.</P>
      <P>However, in order to be helpful I will look at the reservations of the fisheries boards as they are the people who will have to implement the law.  They have been doing a very effective job in recent years.  Their job is a difficult one and, unfortunately, they have to deal with an enormous number of fish kills.  I would like to examine thoroughly their reservations and come back at a later stage if I feel this is necessary.</P>

      <P>We are trying to be helpful. No one is trying to achieve a concealed political victory or rush out of the House to say to the press that the Opposition have achieved a major victory. What we are trying to say to the Minister is that there is a problem here. In fairness to the Minister, the fisheries boards have been very late in articulating this problem but, in fairness to them, they articulated it before we dealt with the section.  As the Acting Chairman said, we can have a vote on the amendment. If there is a vote we will either vote in favour or against subsection (2).  It is my view that the Minister is not in a position to assert that she is dealing with this matter correctly.  I fear that if we vote on the matter now, between now and Report Stage the Minister may discover that some of the worries expressed on this side of the House are correct but because a vote had been taken nothing could be done about it on Report Stage. If the Minister or anyone on this side of the House tables an amendment the Ceann Comhairle will tell us that the matter was dealt with on Committee Stage and cannot be dealt with on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister is anxious to insert the new version of subsection (2) in the Bill <Col N="2168" /> she should leave it as a proposal and we should not have a vote on it now.  This would enable her to have discussions with the fisheries boards.  Let us assume for a moment that the fisheries boards are not agreeable to the new formulation and the Minister decides for whatever reason they are wrong in the case they are making, she can table the amendment on Report Stage when a vote can be taken on it.  She would have the opportunity on Report Stage to report to the House on the nature of discussions she had with the fisheries boards and advise the House why they are wrong.  It would then be a matter for us to make judgment.</P>
    <P>The Minister would do no damage to her approach if she postpones a vote on the subsection until Report Stage but she would do damage if she puts it to a vote now.  I am assuming that there are enough Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Members around the House to ensure that she wins the vote, but if the Minister discovers she is wrong where would we be?</P>
    <P>It has taken a year and a half to get it enacted since it was first published.  I do not envisage another Water Pollution Bill coming before this House for at least another five years and if we get it wrong we will be stuck with this mistake for five years.  There is no loss of face or political point scoring when I ask the Minister to ease our position.  I accept that the fisheries boards have been late in voicing their objections but I personally fail to understand why, in particular, the Western Regional Fisheries Board managed to express a view in a circular letter to all of us on this side of the House and the Minister did not receive a copy of their letter.  Perhaps there is a copy languishing in the Department of the Marine. Perhaps the senior Minister has a copy of it and in the ways of bureaucracy it has not come through the system in time for today's debate.</P>
    <P>All I am suggesting is that we do not divide the House on something we may look back on in some years' time as crucial in the context of ensuring not only that this legislation works in reducing water pollution but also that we do not <Col N="2169" /> diminish powers the fisheries boards have operated successfully in their own area since 1959.</P>

      <P>We have already made amendments to the good defence clause of the original Bill as passed by the Seanad.  Amendment No. 51 applies the same good defence provisions to the Water Pollution Bill as apply to the Fisheries Act and I think that is fair.</P>
      <P>If the Deputies want me to examine the possibility of removing a good defence altogether from the Fisheries Act, that is a completely different case.  Section 25 of the Bill as passed by the Seanad, the Bill we now have already, applies a good defence clause to the Fisheries Act, so it is not a question of having no good defence.  That has already been in the Bill and is already passed and I do not think Deputies are querying that.  If we are to have good defence provisions it is fair that we have the same provisions in both measures; otherwise I foresee many difficulties. However, I want to be helpful and I will hold over the amendment until the next Stage so that I can examine fully the queries and difficulties and see what the most effective way of pursuing this matter is.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 51b:</P>
      <P>In page 24, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) (i) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 10 (4) of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851, summary proceedings for an offence under the Principal Act, this Act or section 171 or 172 of the Act of 1959, may be commenced at any time within 6 months from the date on which evidence sufficient, in the opinion of the person by whom the proceedings are initiated, to justify the proceedings comes to such person's knowledge:</P>
      <P>Provided that no such proceedings shall be initiated later than 5 years from the date on which the offence concerned was committed.</P>
      <P>(ii) For the purposes of this paragraph, a certificate signed by or on behalf of the person initiating the proceedings specifying the date or dates on which evidence relating to the offence concerned came to his knowledge shall be <i>prima facie</i> evidence of such date or dates and in any legal proceedings a document purporting to be a certificate under this paragraph and to be so signed shall be deemed to be so signed and shall be admitted as evidence without proof of the signature of the person purporting to sign the certificate, unless the contrary is shown.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment provides for an extended time limit for prosecution of summary offences where evidence of offence only comes to light some time after the event.  At present, the time limit for initiating summary proceedings is six months, in all cases.  This six month limit will continue to apply to the vast majority <Col N="2171" /> of offences, most of which are detected within a short period of the incident. However, in certain types of cases, the pollution may not be detected for some time.  An example of the type of case involved might be where ground water was being polluted by agricultural effluent. In this type of incident, evidence of the offence might only come to light months or years later.</P>
    <P>This amendment will provide that the six month time limit will only begin to run from the time the evidence is discovered, enabling a summary prosecution to be taken, even though more than six months may have been passed since the offence was committed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 51c:</P>
      <P>In page 24, before section 28, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;28.&mdash;Where a person is convicted of an offence under the Principal Act, this Act or sections 171 or 172 of the Act of 1959 committed after the commencement of this section, the court shall, unless it is satisfied that there are special and substantial reasons for not so doing, order the person to pay to any local authority, sanitary authority or regional board concerned the costs and expenses, measured by the court, reasonably incurred by the authority or board in relation to the investigation, detection and prosecution of the offence, including costs incurred in the taking of samples, the carrying out of tests, examinations and analyses and in respect of the remuneration and other expenses of employees, consultants and advisers.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to allow local authorities, sanitary authorities and regional fisheries boards to <Col N="2172" /> recover the costs and expenses reasonably incurred by them in preparing for all prosecutions, whether summary prosecutions taken by those authorities or boards themselves, or prosecutions on indictment taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>As the section stands at present, it provides only for the recovery of costs and expenses incurred by these authorities when prosecuting summary offences.  It is considered desirable to widen the provision to provide for recovery from the person or body convicted of the offence of the costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the local or sanitary authority or regional board in preparing for prosecutions on indictment.</P>
    <P>The section should facilitate, and act as an incentive to, the enforcement of water pollution control legislation, as local and sanitary authorities and fisheries boards, who are experiencing financial difficulties, need no longer be constrained by considerations relating to the costs of actions and their overall financial situation.</P>
    <P>Costs will be recoverable from the person convicted of a pollution offence. The approach is in line with the-polluter-pays principle which we all have been advocating for some time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, could you explain why that amendment has been ruled out of order?  It is an amendment relating to <Col N="2173" /> section 2 of the Bill in which the Government seek to abolish the Water Pollution Advisory Council.  It seems quite extraordinary that in legislation designed to tackle the problems of water pollution a provision stuck ambiguously into the second last section of the Bill and which seeks in effect to take out the Water Pollution Advisory Council, a body the senior Minister, Deputy Flynn, definitely had no love for, should be ruled out of order.  It is the first time this House has had any opportunity to deal with whether we should keep in place the Water Pollution Advisory Council.  It seems to be taking away from the legislative function of this House to deny Members an opportunity to vote on the issue of whether the Water Pollution Advisory Council should be kept in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is out of order because it involves a potential charge on the Revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of that I understand the technical reasons for repealing other parts of section 30.  If we cannot discuss the amendment under which Fine Gael is seeking to preserve in being the Water Pollution Advisory Council I will address the issue in the context of the section.  We recognise that for technical reasons it may be necessary to have the other provisions contained in this section, but under that section the Government seek to abolish the Water Pollution Advisory Council.  We intend to vote against the section for that very reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 of the original Act requires the Minister for the Environment, following consultation with other interested Ministers, to establish by order a Water Pollution Advisory Council to advise on water pollution matters generally.  The council, either of its own volition or at the Minister's request, may make recommendations to the Minister on any matter relating to his functions or responsibilities concerning water pollution control and can advise on any matter referred to it by the Minister.  The section requires the Minister to keep the council informed of <Col N="2174" /> matters relating to the control of water pollution which are in his opinion likely to assist the council in performing its functions and requires the council to make an annual report to the Minister and, even more importantly, an annual report must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Since the 1977 Act we have had a Water Pollution Advisory Council in place.  Different people were appointed from time to time and it finished its term of office immediately prior to the 1987 general election.  When the new Fianna Fáil Government came into office they surreptitiously sought to remove the Water Pollution Advisory Council from the exercise of its functions.  The Minister for the Environment has an extraordinarily unexplained animosity to independent environmental organisations.</P>
    <P>In his first year in office he effectively abolished the Water Pollution Advisory Council by not appointing members to it, contrary to his statutory duty.  He was also responsible for taking out of operation An Foras Forbartha.  This Government have also failed to appoint members to the Wildlife Advisory Council.  The Fianna Fáil Government in their first year in office took out of operation a whole series of independent environmental bodies, either by way of statutory provision or executive decision.  One would have expected something different from this new Coalition, where the senior Minister has this unconcealed and unexplained animosity to all independent environment agencies previously established by statute.  We know the senior Minister does not like these bodies because of the powers they have, in this case the power to present an annual report to the Houses of the Oireachtas with regard to water pollution.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas was properly informed if the legislation was not right or was not being enforced by Government agencies or if local authorities or fisheries boards lacked the necessary resources to enforce the legislation.  The Water Pollution Advisory Council was no paper tiger. Apart from its annual report it produced a whole series of excellent reports on <Col N="2175" /> problems relating to water pollution, including a comprehensive report reviewing water pollution in Ireland generally. If the Water Pollution Advisory Council had been kept in place the mistakes in this Bill when published in January 1989 would not have been made.  The council could have been consulted on the provisions in the Bill.  Perhaps the Minister would have got the Bill right and it would have been enacted by now.</P>
    <P>Section 30 seeks to delete section 2 from the 1977 Act.  It is trying to give statutory form to the surreptitious piece of executive jiggery pokery that the Minister got up to.  It is an attempt to give some legality to the surreptitious abolition of the Water Pollution Advisory Council.  I deplore that.  I have no doubt the Minister will tell me the council is no longer required because the environment protection agency will take the work of the council.  I would remind the Minister that she has not yet even circulated a Bill to establish the environment protection agency.  There have been in excess of 40 press releases, Government statements and promises about the environment protection agency since Fine Gael published a Private Members' Bill in November 1989.  Statements have been delivered not only by the Minister of State present but by a whole panoply of Ministers, including the Taoiseach who promised this great green Presidency in January 1990. It is looking extremely green and frayed about the edges in the context of domestic legislative initiative.</P>
    <P>The Minister will probably repeat that it is hoped the Bill will be circulated before the end of this session.  That is code for saying that with a bit of luck it will be got through the various Government offices, the Cabinet and the Attorney General's Office before July. There is not a hope of its being debated before the autumn and the likelihood of its being enacted by Christmas is limited since it will have to go through the Seanad as well as through this House.</P>
    <P>At the minimum we should keep the Water Pollution Advisory Council in being.  This Minister has been given <Col N="2176" /> responsibility in the area of pollution generally, which means that the malign influence of the senior Minister in relation to the Water Pollution Advisory Council was removed in July last year. This Minister could since then have appointed members to the Water Pollution Advisory Council.  Members should be appointed to that body and allowed to operate and report to the Oireachtas on how we are doing and on the initial effectiveness of this legislation.</P>
    <P>If we see a Bill relating to the establishment of the environmental protection agency it would be appropriate for it to contain a provision where the Water Pollution Advisory Council would remain in place until such time as the agency was established.  It might then be appropriate that the Water Pollution Advisory Council be disbanded.</P>
    <P>It is singularly inappropriate that for the past three and a half years the Water Pollution Advisory Council has not been operating.  It would be singularly appropriate to have a specialist body, independent of the Department of the Environment and its Minister and independent of the Department of the Marine and that Minister, to have an independent look at the initial working of this legislation so that any problems can rapidly be addressed.  It is our intention to oppose this section.</P>
    <P>I do not believe it is correct to abolish this body.  I deplore the fact that the Minister for Environment has, by sleight of hand, since 1987, prevented this statutory body from operating and has failed to comply with his statutory obligations to appoint members to this body.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>As my amendment to this section has been ruled out of order, I, too, will be opposing this section which proposes the abolition of the Water Pollution Advisory Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When dead fish were being hauled out of rivers and lakes last summer, the Minister of State made different statements. On 7 August last year, one newspaper stated that though new laws to crack down on water polluters had been promised on 6 August by the Minister of <Col N="2177" /> State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Mary Harney, as the number of reported fish kills for 1989 looked set to reach record levels.</P>
    <P>This Bill is seriously diluted and will worsen rather than improve the situation. During the debate on an earlier section, the case was made for a Water Pollution Advisory Council and it was pointed out that there are defects in this Bill precisely because we have not had a council who could comment on it.  If we had such a council I do not believe we would have had the confusion about the views of the regional fisheries boards and the apparent bureaucratic breakdown which occurred between the regional boards, the central board, the Department of the Marine and, ultimately, the Department of the Environment in regard to the 1959 Act.</P>
    <P>The problem of water pollution cannot be simply locked into one piece of legislation; there are many dimensions to it. There are a number of Acts dealing with this matter, for example, the 1959 Act and the 1977 Act, and a number of EC Directives dealing with drinking water, etc.  There are a whole range of areas where the views of different specialists, interests, and so on need to be brought together in one single body so that we can have an overall approach to water pollution.</P>
    <P>The abolition of the Water Pollution Advisory Council will be a retrograde step.  I do not believe the environmental protection agency, which is now being offered as a panacea to everything which is wrong in the environment, is going to subsume the functions of the Water Pollution Advisory Council.  Even if we had an environmental protection agency already in place, there would still be a need for somebody to deal with the specific issue of water pollution in a comprehensive way.  That could be part of the functions of the environmental protection agency but it seems to be putting the cart very far in front of the horse to abolish the Water Pollution Advisory Council and then say &ldquo;perhaps when the EPA legislation goes through both <Col N="2178" /> Houses in two years' time, they can deal with the problem of water pollution&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Why not leave the Water Pollution Advisory Council in place?  If it is the view that bodies like the Water Pollution Advisory Council should be consolidated into the environmental protection agency, we could deal with that at a later stage.  It seems to be a totally retrograde step to abolish the Water Pollution Advisory Council and leave a vaccuum &mdash; there has been a vacuum in this area for the past three years &mdash; in regard to a body giving advice about water pollution. The legislation before us shows all the signs that there has been no Water Pollution Advisory Council in place over the past two years.  If such a council had been in place, some of the defects we have highlighted during the debate could have been avoided at an earlier stage &mdash; for example, the debate we had on the role of the fishery boards about half an hour ago could have been avoided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Shatter and Deputy Gilmore have spoken very eloquently on this matter.  I do not want to detain the House unduly, but I want to point out the very shabby way in which the Minister has addressed the abolition of the Water Pollution Advisory Council; she stuck it in at the very end of the Bill. This is no way to do business in this House and I will be opposing this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what Deputy Garland was talking about when he said I stuck this section in at the end of the Bill.  The last Water Pollution Advisory Council ceased to operate in December 1986, three months before the previous Government came into office. During those three months, the then Government of which Deputy Shatter's party were a member, did not seek to reappoint the Water Pollution Advisory Council.  I make that point because I believe it is appropriate in a debate of this kind to at least put the facts fairly and squarely on the table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not abolishing the Water Pollution Advisory Council, and if an environmental protection agency were not going <Col N="2179" /> to be set up I would not favour the abolition of the Water Pollution Advisory Council.  I hasten to add that I do not regard the environmental protection agency as a panacea for all our ills nor do I think that that is the way they should be perceived.  They will have a difficult job to do.  However, I believe they will have a significant part to play in monitoring and advising on a whole host of environmental matters.  They will have to ensure that all the advice is streamlined and comes from one organisation who have to look at the environment in its truest sense and not at water separately from waste, soil or air.  I am sure the Deputies do not believe the Government should establish an air pollution advisory council, a waste pollution advisory council and a soil pollution advisory council.</P>
    <P>Ireland is a small country with 3.5 million people and we have to streamline our operations to ensure they are efficient and effective.  We have to insist that whatever resources we can allocate to environmental protection &mdash; the more we can allocate the better &mdash; are efficiently and effectively used and managed.  It is for that reason the Government have decided to put an advisory council in with the environmental protection agency. This council will have a wide brief to deal with all aspects of environmental pollution and not just water pollution.</P>
    <P>We have enormous problems and issues to deal with both in terms of commitments coming from the European Community and the problems we have here in relation to waste, etc.  The advisory council will not deal exclusively with water pollution matters.  This body will be effective, have teeth, and will work in conjunction with the agency who will be monitoring and enforcing the law, taking prosecutions where necessary, and so on. They will have a much greater role allied to the environmental protection agency than if they were an advisory council on their own issuing reports to the Oireachtas.  I note many of the recommendations and reports in this area made in the past never saw the light of day.</P>
    <P>In regard to Deputy Shatter's comments on the environmental protection <Col N="2180" /> agency Bill, I am disappointed it has taken so long to introduce it.  However, it has been proceeded with with the greatest speed by my officials and me.  Unfortunately, these things take longer than one might wish but, as I have said, the gestation period is almost over and the baby will be born within a matter of weeks, if not days.</P>

      <P>When the Bill is published Deputies will see that it is effective and comprehensive.  As I said before, it will be the most major legislation in this area since the planning Acts of the early sixties.  I believe it will be perceived to be effective by the public and the organisations concerned.  There will also be a role, by way of an advisory council, for environmental concerns and organisations. I believe this is the most appropriate way to deal with the matter.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the co-operation we had this morning &mdash; I believe I have been more than reasonable &mdash; will not continue and the Deputies are going to insist on calling a vote on this section.  If that is the case, so be it, but I cannot accept the comments and the points made by Deputies Shatter, Gilmore and Garland on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to respond to one or two points.  Every time I hear the Minister talking about the Environment Protection Agency I realise that, apart from the amusement of it all, each successive statement makes it clear that the agency she now has in mind in the context of structures and powers is more and more aligned with the provisions contained in the Private Members' Bill that my Party published in November last.  I am delighted that she has now agreed that there should be an advisory council. She might go back and look at that Bill and she will discover that that was part of it.  It is now going to be an independent agency with prosecuting powers; that was part of it as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House on <Col N="2181" /> that but any drafting problems the Minister may have had with this Bill could well have been resolved if the Minister had accepted the Fine Gael Bill at Second Stage and tabled constructive amendments to it on Committee Stage.  Instead of not having a Bill circulated and no prospect of embarking on one until the Autumn, that Bill could now be part of the law and the agency could be up and running.</P>
    <P>It is worth commenting on the fact that the Minister did not offer any defence for the failure of her senior Minister to appoint members to the advisory council, other than suggesting, lamely, that the outgoing Fine Gael/Labour Government should have made appointments to it.  As she knows the previous advisory council was in office until 31 December 1986. Within two weeks of that a general election was called.  Can you imagine the howls of derision that would have gone up&mdash;&mdash;</P>

No matter who was appointed, that Government would have been accused of putting in their cronies and not allowing the Government of the day make appropriate appointments.  The Minister knows that well.  The Government did the right and honourable thing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, Sir.  It is responding to what the Minister said.  Section 30 of the Bill is abolishing section 2 of the 1977 Act which established the Water Pollution Advisory Council.  The Minister suggested that in some way it was the fault of the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition that appointments were not made. She knows well that that Government behaved honourably and correctly, when going out of office, in not making last minute appointments to that council and leaving it to the incoming Minister to make the appointments that he deemed appropriate.  I have no doubt that had there been appointments made the Minister would have been saying that the council was discredited because political hacks had been appointed by an outgoing Government.  The Government cannot have it both ways.</P>
      <P>The bottom line on this issue is that the Minister knows that at present we do not have an Environment Protection Agency and we will not have it in place before the start of next year.  Even that is an optimistic assessment.  The Water Pollution Advisory Council should be kept in place.  The provision in section 30 of this Bill, where the Minister tries to remove that council from its statutory position, is not a correct approach.  The Minister, if she was really serious about what she is at, instead of abolishing this Water Pollution Advisory Council would, in the context of the appalling fish kills that were taking place during the summer months of last year, have appointed new members to that council, reconstituted it and had it up and running and operating until such time as we debated in this House the provisions of the Environment Protection Agency Bill that the Government publish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that context we are opposing section 30.  I do not wish to bring any particular <Col N="2183" /> ill will to bear on this debate but let me, as an aside, say that Deputy Garland has been throwing around political torpedoes and grenades during the morning about Tallaght strategies and welcoming the fact that Fine Gael are opposing bits of this Bill, not having opposed others.  Let me point out that some six months ago I tabled an amendment to this Bill with a view to preserving the Water Pollution Advisory Council in being.  I welcome the <Col N="2184" /> fact that within the last 48 hours Deputy Garland has added his name to the amendment I tabled.  I feel it is worth pointing that out and putting it on the record of the House.  That said, I welcome the fact that there seems to be full support from all sides of the House for keeping the Water Pollution Advisory Council in place.</P>

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 31.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 53:</P>
      <P>In page 25, subsection (4), lines 21 to 25, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;on such day&rdquo; in line 21, down to the end of the subsection and substitute &ldquo;not later than 3 months after its passing.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I introduced this amendment because of the delay in bringing the Bill before the House.  The Bill was introduced in January 1989 and, presumably, it will be passed during this session but how long more will we have to wait for its provisions to be implemented?  How much time will be wasted on the Order of Business and in putting questions to Ministers about the introduction of the relevant regulations?  It could be a very long time.  During that time I wonder what the vested interests will be doing.  They will be asking for more time and more time.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Bill may not be implemented until next year but what will happen to our rivers in the meantime? There will be more and more fish kills, more and more pollution.  I have introduced a very reasonable amendment, that the Bill be fully implemented within three months of its being passed in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>My party are opposing section 31 of the Bill on the basis that it would give the Minister a general discretion as to when the Bill will become operative.  Deputy Garland is correct in saying that there is no guarantee it will become operative in 1990, indeed there is no guarantee that it will become operative in 1991 or 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Equally, as I said this morning, it is essential that the Bill is enacted during this session of the Oireachtas so that the amendments made here are dealt with in the Seanad because most incidents of pollution occur during the summer months.  Deputy Garland's amendment is incorrectly drafted because it would mean that the Bill would come into force not later than three months after its passing. It does not say when it would come into force but, under his amendment, the Bill would not become law until September or October next if it takes until the end of this month to deal with it in the Seanad.  We will be voting against the last section in the Bill unless the Minister <Col N="2187" /> is prepared to confirm to the House that she will table an amendment on Report Stage to delete subsection (4) of section 31.  If she is prepared to do that we will not call for a vote on that issue today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We must deal with the amendment in Deputy Garland's name before we proceed to the section.  Deputy Gilmore on the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>All Members are agreed that they would like to see this legislation in operation as quickly as possible.  In relation to the amendment and Deputy Shatter's comments on the section generally, if the Minister gave the assurance or a clear indication as to when the Government intend to give effect to the legislation it would make a difference.  I should like to see the legislation in operation as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is also my wish to ensure that this legislation is implemented as quickly as possible. Having gone through the difficulties associated with bringing forward this comprehensive legislation, obviously it will be implemented.  However, I have difficulties with the Deputy's amendment because the date on which Bills &mdash; or various parts of them &mdash; come into operation are left to the discretion of Minsters to avoid particular difficulties.  For example, section 34 (c) of the 1977 Act gave the fisheries boards authority under sections 171 and 172 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, to prosecute local authorities for sewage pollution but if there had been a fixed date for bringing the Act into being the provision would have been abolished and local authorities would have been above the law.  Very often particular aspects of Bills have to be put in place when other things happen and, for that reason, it is not desirable to fix a specific time for bringing the whole act into being.  Obviously, however, it is our intention to bring as much of it into operation as quickly as possible after it passes all Stages in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I ask Deputy Garland, for <Col N="2188" /> practical reasons, to withdraw his amendment because it is not difficult to make a provision in relation to this kind of provision.  I ask him to reconsider the time limit he wishes to impose.  The time limit in his last amendment was 1 April which has now passed and it may well be that if this Bill goes through the House and the amendments go back to the Seanad we will be able to implement most of the Act within or before a period of three months from today or from its passing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not understand Deputy Shatter's comment.  I should have prefaced my remarks by saying that of course if the Bill can be put into operation prior to the period of three months, so much the better.  However, my amendment is very specific, it says &ldquo;not later than three months after its passing&rdquo;.  I am not inclined to withdraw this amendment because I am not impressed by the Minister's response to this very serious matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Garland has his way it would read &ldquo;this Act shall come into operation not less than three months after its passing&rdquo; and it would provide no particular mechanism for saying when it was to come into force or what parts of it would come into force.  I do not know what legal effect that would have but it certainly would not say when the Bill should come into force.  I appreciate that Deputy Garland wants to make provision to ensure that the Bill comes into force within three months but he should have gone on to provide that if a ministerial order is not made bringing it into force within the three months period, it should thereafter automatically come into force. Unfortunately &mdash; and I am sure this is not deliberate &mdash; Deputy Garland has not got the amendment right and it will not work. My point is that this Bill should become operative this summer, not next September or October.  The Minister has not offered a scintilla of reasons for bringing individual sections into operation from time to time by ministerial order although it is necessary with some legislation.  The <Col N="2189" /> Department of the Environment or the Attorney General's Office automatically put this provision in every Bill that comes from their Department because they feel that perhaps the Minister might want to have second thoughts about one of its provisions when the legislation has been enacted.  The problem is that there is no guarantee to any Member of the House that any provision in the Bill will ever be enacted.  Legislation was passed in regard to mental health in 1980 which nobody has put in force.  The same provision was in the Derelict Sites Act and the Minister for the Environment agreed to delete that provision in the Bill at our request.  There is no reason for subsection (4) in this section.  I ask Deputy Garland not to put his amendment because it would not work.  If the Minister responds, we can complete the Bill.</P>

    <P>Tuigfidh an Teachta, mar sin, nach gnáth le mo Roinnse glacadh le foghlaimeoirí Ó na ceantair sin chun críche na scéime agus níl sé beartaithe an scéim a leasú chun freastal orthu.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá taithí imeallach agam féin ar chathair na Gaillimhe ó thaobh na Gaeltachta de, ach, de réir na rialacha atá ann anois, ní féidir linn bac a chur ar dhuine ar bith dul chuig na coláistí Gaeilge.  Is í an cheist a thóg an Teachta Higgins ná nach bhfuil deis <Col N="2191" /> acusan deontas a fháil chun dul chuig na coláistí samhraidh, ach, ar an láimh eile, tá daoine ina gcónaí sna ceantair sin agus tá deis acu cur isteach ar dheontais tithíochta, scéimeanna spreagtha na Gaeilge agus na deontais eile.</P>
      <P>Níl mé ag iarraidh bheith glic, ach is é an cinneadh gur féidir a ghlacadh ná na ceantair sin a thabhairt amach as an Ghaeltacht, mar, de réir na rialacha atá ann i láthair na huaire, ní féidir linn mórán a dhéanamh.  Anois agus arís is féidir cuidiú a thabhairt do dhaoine. Fuair beagnach scór duine sna ceantair sin cuidiú anuraidh os rud é go raibh eisceachtaí ann de bharr chúiseanna eis-imirce agus mar sin.  Níl bac iomlán ann ach, ag an am céanna, níl an oiread sin daoine ag fáil an deontais sin.  Ní féidir linn rud ar bith a dhéanamh i mbliana ach déanaim athbhreithniú leanúnach ar na scéimeanna éagsúla agus tá mé sásta sin a chur san áireamh.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 9 and 41 together.  The first election of representatives of personnel of the Permanent Defence Force is being conducted in accordance with rules laid down <Col N="2197" /> by the principal officer in charge of the franchise section of the Department of the Environment.  The rules were drawn up following consideration of submissions from individuals and groups of individuals within the Permanent Defence Force and of the views expressed by representatives of the teams set up in connection with the Gleeson commission and by representatives of PDFORRA.</P>
      <P>In the case of officers there are seven electoral divisions &mdash; four Commands, Air Corps, Naval Service and Army Headquarters &mdash; each of which will have five representatives except for the Curragh and Eastern Command which will have seven representatives each.  The elected representatives for each electoral division will elect one of their number to a national committee.</P>
      <P>In the case of NCOs and privates there are 48 electoral divisions in the various barracks throughout the country.  The larger divisions will each have 12 representatives with five for each of the smaller divisions.  The elected representatives from each electoral division will elect two of their members to a command committee.  There will be six such committees &mdash; four Commands, Air Corps and Naval Service.  Each of these committees will in turn elect two of their number to a national committee.</P>
      <P>The systems of election to be used are the single transferable vote, in the case of officers, and the &ldquo;at large&rdquo; system in the case of NCOs and privates.  In essence this latter system involves the placing of an `X' opposite each candidate of the voter's choice &mdash; the total number of `X's not to exceed the number of representatives to be elected in the particular division.</P>
      <P>I understand that the level of representation and the arrangements for the conduct of the election generally reflect the wishes of representatives of the personnel as conveyed to the franchise officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nominations closed on 7 June 1990.  A total of 87 nominations were received for the 39 representatives of officers.  In the <Col N="2198" /> case of NCOs and privates 591 nominations were received for 457 representatives. A ballot will be held in those electoral divisions where the number of candidates exceeds the number of representatives to be elected.  Ballot papers are being issued by the returning officers, who are military personnel.  Polling, which is in secret, will continue until noon on 26 June 1990.</P>
    <P>The returning officers will be responsible for the counting of votes.  Persons will be appointed by the franchise section of the Department of the Environment to observe the proceedings.</P>
    <P>In view of the extensive consultations and preparations which have been carried out I have every confidence that the elections will proceed as planned.</P>
    <P>When the representatives emerge at national level from the election I will meet them.  The detailed further arrangements to be made at that stage will then be worked out in discussions between them and representatives of my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Minister for the information he has made available to us, most of which has been available from public statements he has made outside the House.  Does the Minister accept that, apart from the role of the overall supervisor from the Department of the Environment, he has an active role to play ensuring that there is full support for what is happening at all levels within the Defence Forces and the Department and that stability will be maintained throughout the electoral process, given the high number of persons nominated and the number of positions to be filled, for example, at NCO level?  Will he ensure that there will be no undue interference in terms of mobilisation, transfer or assignment of duties until after the election has taken place, and that those people who have been appointed will be allowed carry out their duties without undue interference?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's interest in the matter.  I am taking steps to ensure that there will be a maximum <Col N="2199" /> turnout of Defence Force voters and that no obstacle will be placed in the way of any voter or of the conduct of the elections generally.  I am satisfied that we have set up a good organisational structure to achieve the objects expressed by the Oireachtas during the passage of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister happy with the idea of two different systems of election, the STV system and the at large system which he explained as putting an X opposite each candidate's name, but limited to the number of places available? Was the Minister asked for sanction of these methods of election before they were finally decided upon?  Does he see any difficulty with the at large system where there may be strongly different points of view among the people represented, or a majority on one side may monopolise the entire seats?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter I left entirely to the representatives concerned. As the House will appreciate, there were two separate series of discussions on establishing the elections and the election procedure one of which took place between PDFORRA who expressed the wish, in regard to their election for NCOs and men, for the at large system, namely, placing the appropriate number of Xs, limited to the number of people nominated for the position.  All the alternative options were placed before them by the franchise officer, Mr. Sexton, and his staff, and they opted for the at large system.  During the discussions with representatives of the officers, they expressed preference for the single alternative transfer, the STV, system of voting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I share some of the misgivings of Deputy Nealon with regard to the non-application of PR to the NCOs.  However, the Minister has dealt with that.  In regard to the scrutiny of the elections and the holding of the count, can the Minister indicate whether officials of the Department of the Environment under Mr. Sexton's direction will be taking possession of the votes once cast, or how will they be handled?  I understood the Minister to say that Army personnel &mdash; I presume they would be high ranking personnel &mdash; would issue the ballot papers.  Can he say what will be the fate of those ballot papers once they have been returned?  In regard to the count, will there be outside scrutiny, in particular media presence, at the count and at the announcement of the results?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the count the details have yet to be arranged, but as of now the two groups are happy with the position.  In the case of PDFORRA, the senior NCO of the military police, within a particular constituency as it were, will be responsible, and the officers have agreed to a similar type procedure in that a nominated officer will be responsible in each area.  Each group is agreeable to a military person of senior status, a person in whom they have confidence and who is not involved in the election, acting as returning officer right through the whole procedure.  If necessary, a local government official, nominated by Mr. Sexton who is the overall returning officer, with experience of elections and election counts will also be available.  I am thinking in particular of the count in this respect.</P>

No detailed examination has been undertaken yet but consideration will be given to the idea.  This is not a matter that can be decided off the top of the head in a yes or no fashion.  A lot of factors have to be taken into account &mdash; for instance, this is a high technology vessel; and the purpose to which it would be put by the Navy is another day's work.  It would not be suitable for basic Naval training.  A number of factors, including the uses to <Col N="2202" /> which it would be put, are being examined at present.

In general, the offer is available and there is goodwill on all sides.  We will sit down and discuss whether the vessel can be used by the Naval Service.  If it can be, well and good but that is a matter that must be discussed.  Whether we are receiving it as a gift or otherwise has not been made clear.</P>

      <P>The number of applications for cadetships this year is approximately 1,500.  While this is somewhat below the average number of applications received over the past three years, it is considered to be a satisfactory response and sufficient to enable all available vacancies to be filled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the number of applicants in 1988 was 4,000 more than the figure for this year, would the Minister not accept that this is a very poor response and indicates a lack of interest by our suitably qualified men and women?  How does he intend to raise the status and attractiveness of these positions?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It can be equally interpreted that it is a reflection of the general economic wellbeing of the country, that there are alternative areas of employment open to young applicants of that age.  The Deputy might take that positive interpretation.  While I agree that 1,500 applications is below the average it is still very high in relation to the number of posts that will eventually be filled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that the low wages and the low morale in the Defence Forces was a factor in recent years.  Perhaps it would have been prudent of the Minister to await the report of the Gleeson Commission before endeavouring to advertise positions.  Can the Minister outline the reasons females were debarred from applying for cadetships in both the Navy and the Air Corps? Would he not accept that this is a further discrimination against women and what action does he propose to take to rectify this unacceptable position?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>A programme for the modernisation of the Defence Forces transport fleet commenced in 1988.  The programme is based on the disposal of obsolete and unserviceable vehicles and their replacement on a phased basis by new vehicles.  I am satisfied that the replacement programme will improve the overall operational efficiency of the Defence Forces transport fleet.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that FCA training in the Eastern Command has not been halted.  I am, however, having the question of the current serviceability of vehicles assigned to the FCA examined and I will communicate further with the Deputy in the matter.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that there are now only three station wagons available for the entire FCA in the Eastern Command area from Dundalk in the North to Arklow in the South with 26 sub-units?  For the arms to be transported for use in training and for transport to the Permanent Defence Force personnel associated with these, the only transport now available are three station wagons where previously there were 26.  No new vehicles are being assigned to the FCA this year and all the new vehicles purchased are going to the Permanent Defence Force.  Arising out of that there is total frustration among the FCA and I have absolute knowledge that training &mdash; no matter what the Minister tells me &mdash; has been virtually abandoned except for the occasional goodwill in relation to Army trucks on a Sunday.</P>

If the redeployment of vehicles to the FCA within the Eastern Command is as necessary as the Deputy alleges certainly I will see to it that that is done.  The overall command has got a substantial allocation from the vehicles now available in connection with the modernisation programme we have initiated.  I agree with the Deputy that the FCA in the Eastern Command area should get their share <Col N="2206" /> of the allocation that is available to the overall command.

      <Quest>if he will give details of the current outstanding reimbursable entitlements from the United Nations due to this country in respect of the participation by personnel of the Defence Forces on peace-keeping organisations both in the Lebanon and Cyprus.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>The ten Panhard armoured personnel carriers which were recently returned to this country from Lebanon are at present undergoing technical examination to determine the refurbishment necessary to make them fully operational.  Pending completion of that examination, negotiations have not taken place as to the financial adjustments to be made with the United Nations.  Eight of the vehicles were purchased in 1973 and two in 1972.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As at 31 May, 1990 a total shortfall of about £18.1 million in reimbursable entitlements from the United Nations had accumulated in respect of participation by personnel of the Defence Forces in peace-keeping operations in Lebanon and Cyprus.  Of this amount £17.4 million relates to involvement in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon since May, 1978.  The remaining <Col N="2207" /> shortfall of £0.7 million arises out of participation in the United Nations Force in Cyprus which commenced in April, 1964.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not accept that the huge outstanding reimbursable entitlements from the United Nations to this country is totally unacceptable? What action has he taken to correct that position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have taken action through the Department of Foreign Affairs who have a permanent representative at the United Nations.  There are indications that the repayments will be expedited in the near future.  The deficiencies arose because of the lack of support from the two major powers &mdash; the Soviet Union and the United States. They have now agreed to meet their commitments and they are paying back, in the way of reimbursement, what they owe in very substantial sums.  The process of repayment mainly from these two powers has started; not repayment as such but dues they owe.  They owe the money to the United Nations and have refrained from giving that money over a long period of years for policy reasons regarding UN intervention.  That policy disagreement has been settled and they are now in the process of starting to reimburse what they have omitted to pay over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This payment by the two major forces has been outstanding for a number of years.  During that time have we continued to pay our share?  Is it envisaged that the cost of the return of the ten Panhard vehicles will be offset against the payment already due to this country?  The Minister said the actual details are not yet available but he must also take into consideration the age of the vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever sum is arising will be set against moneys which they owe us so that, in effect, it will cost us nothing in terms of payment now.  We will set that off against the debt which we are owed by the United Nations.  That is quite clear and has been agreed.  Of <Col N="2208" /> course there is a substantial balance outstanding but the two major powers, who refrained from meeting their obligations during the years, have now begun paying this.  This was the policy adopted by these two powers with regard to the United Nations peacekeeping operations but they have begun to remedy this matter in the light of the thaw which has taken place during the last 12 months.  They are now meeting their commitments which have been met by all other member countries of the United Nations.</P>

Can the Minister also say whether these issues will be reviewed in the light of the recommendations of the Gleeson committee?</P>

      <P>The Gleeson committee are considering this matter and we will look at it in the light of the recommendations made by the committee.  Submissions were made on this aspect to the committee.  We expect to have their report within the next month or so and when it comes to hand we will have to examine this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased that there is not a substantial number of applications before the Minister.  Reports in the media seem to suggest that 17 out of the 86 pilots have applied for permission to leave along with several air traffic controllers. Is the Minister aware that Air Corps personnel are angry at the failure to come up with a policy?  The Government will have to bring forward a policy not only on this matter but also on recruitment. It seems the Minister, given what he has said this afternoon, has adopted a <Col N="2213" /> willy-nilly approach to his matter but that is not the way to deal with this problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only approach I am going to take is to examine each application on its merits but the first requirement and prerequisite is to meet the needs of the Air Corps.  Once I am satisfied as to the strength being maintained at pilot level, engineering level or any level, I can consider each case on its merits.  The more fundamental problem concerns the term of appointment, terms of service and so on, and the commission have heard submissions about that, and that matter is crucial to this.  As of now, they are there under certain terms of service for certain periods of time, and they knew they were being recruited on the basis of their contribution to the Air Corps and they were appointed accordingly.  When they apply to leave the strength of the Air Corps is the first consideration, naturally. That is why we make the appointments in the first instance.  After that other factors are taken into consideration.  I have been taking a flexible view on this, taking all considerations into account, and have allowed certain applications to go through, which is a new departure.</P>

Evaluation trials of the weapon established that there was no significant accuracy variation in the use of the standard weapon by personnel who are predominantly left-handed.

Will he clarify his suggestion that there is a standard right-handed weapon?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This property is considerably more valuable now because of designation, which I welcome, but there are parts of the building which, by virtue of their historical and architectural quality, would require in a civilised country <Col N="2219" /> to be preserved or conserved.  That imposes a commercial constraint on their ultimate use.

It has been the regular practice over the years to take any suspicious device of any kind discovered at Shannon to that area for investigation and explosion.  The rifle range is a recent addition and there is just one farmer objecting in respect of the rifle range. The explosives operations are accepted. There is a distinction between the two.</P>

      <P>A proposal for a financial contribution towards expenditure incurred by member states for the purpose of surveillance of fishery resources was adopted by the Fisheries Council of the EC on 27 November 1989.  The EC contribution will relate to eligible expenditure incurred by member states from 1 January 1991 to 31 December 1995.

      <P>It has been agreed in principle that we do get assistance of this kind and a claim has, of course, been lodged with the EC since March 1988.  In November 1989, the Fisheries Council adopted a decision providing for substantial funding for fisheries surveillance in member states.  It is under that heading we have made our application.  There is a budgetary allocation under EC funds in general for the Community and we are trying to get a slot in there.  At present we are examining what would be suitable for us in that respect and we will be submitting a programme to the EC for funding very shortly, following on the Government decision of 23 January that this should be done.  This programme is currently being prepared by the Department of the Marine who are the moving party, as it were, to the Commission. Everything is ready to roll in this regard. The programme being prepared by the Department of the Marine for EC approval is expected to be ready by November 1990 when we will have full approval of the exact money that will be made available for the precise type of aircraft surveillance, etc.  All this work is in train.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 35, 37 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>The Naval Service have seven patrol vessels two of which the LE <i>Orla</i> and LE <i>Ciara,</i> were acquired in late 1988 and went into operational service in January 1989.  Naval Service vessels are taken out of service from time to time to allow for crew leave, scheduled maintenance and other contingencies.  It would be undesirable for operational reasons to disclose detailed information as to the number of Naval Service vessels at sea or in port at any time.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the manpower and resources available are adequate to enable the Naval Service to effectively discharge its functions.  In this regard in late 1988-early 1989 100 recruits were enlisted.  To date in 1990 116 recruits and ten technicians have been enlisted.</P>
      <P>Following the adoption by the Fisheries Council of the European Communities of a decision providing for substantial funding for fisheries surveillance in member states, the Department of the Marine, in consultation with the Department of Defence and other Departments, is currently preparing a programme for submission to the European Commission for funding for maritime surveillance equipment.  I spent some time on that matter when dealing with the previous question.</P>

Can the Minister give an indication of the number of fish involved in those 13 fish kills?  It is still early in the year.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek to reintroduce the amendment we had on Committee Stage. At that Stage the Minister said he would be prepared to look at the amendment <Col N="2257" /> before Report Stage, although on that day he was not prepared to proceed. When speaking on Committee Stage I gave the reasons I felt strongly that the amendment should be included, mainly on the grounds of the information received.</P>
      <P>When the Minister was introducing the Bill he said that the population projections reinforced the need to define the responsibilities of health boards and nursing homes and he said that the census revealed that 382,000 people are over the age of 65 years of which 143,000 are over 75 years of age; that the latest projections suggest that the number of elderly will increase slowly up to the year 2000 and rapidly after that, and that we will have a population of 414,000 elderly people. One has to take cognisance of those figures when talking about a nursing homes Bill.  The Minister agreed to look at this again on Report Stage.  For example, in the Health (Homes for Incapacitated Parents) Act, 1964, it is stated that incapacity means incapable of looking after oneself by reason of (a) old age, (b) physical infirmity or physical injury, defect or disease or (c) mental infirmity or a mental handicap.  A similar provision is contained in the Bill but there is no definition of old age.  I appeal to the Minister to accept my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. I have reflected on this matter since our debate on Committee Stage and I have come to the conclusion that the absence of a definition of old age and of a dependent person is a shortcoming.  Elderly people might not be dependent because of any infirmity but may be dependent because of their social conditions.  They may not have a family to look after them or may not have sanitary services in their home.  It is well known that many of the people who are in State geriatric homes are there because of social conditions. Their presence there does not relate necessarily to their ill health or infirmity. The section should be extended to meet that shortcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2258" /> I understand &ldquo;old age&rdquo; to mean a possible debilitating state accompanied by certain social circumstances. Such a person must be considered vulnerable. The purpose of the Bill is to protect the vulnerable and for that reason I am calling for support for the amendment. It is important to point out at this stage that a number of the amendments tabled by the Minister meet many of the points raised on Committee Stage.  I welcome that and I was pleased to see such a positive response from the Minister.  It is unfortunate that progress was not made on this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">

      <P>Like Deputy Yates I will be supporting Deputy Sherlock's amendment. It is interesting to note that the Irish Nursing Homes Association are happy with the amendment.  There is no doubt that many elderly people go to nursing homes not because they are ill but because they want social support, company and security.  I was disappointed that the Minister on Committee Stage said that the definition of a dependent person includes elderly people.  I do not think that is so and I should like to ask the Minister to reconsider this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. A dependent person is a person who requires, as the subsection states, assistance with a range of daily activities by virtue of any reason, whether it is physical or mental infirmity.  The definition of old age should be added to the subsection. There are people who require assistance not because they are infirm or mentally feeble but because they are aged.  A cogent and clear case was made on Committee Stage to include the definition of old age in the Bill.  That was broadly supported by the Opposition and the Minister seemed impressed enough by the arguments.  I am very gratified that many of the points made by this side of the House on Committee Stage have been taken on board by the Minister.  I am grateful to the Minister for listening attentively to what was said and for modifying many of the sections in accordance <Col N="2259" /> with requests from this side of the House. The important definition should include the fundamental definition of old age which has been encompassed in other legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I promised on Committee Stage, I have given considerable thought to whether to accept this amendment.  The issue is whether to include old age as a sufficient condition to being a dependent person under the Bill.  The Bill defines a dependent person as someone who requires assistance with the activities of daily living because of physical infirmity or injury, defect or disease or mental infirmity.  If an elderly person requires assistance of this kind, it is because they are physically infirm or injured, or mentally infirm, not merely because they are old.</P>
      <P>My legal advice is that the addition of old age as proposed in the amendment would not bring any additional category of persons under the scope of the Bill. In other words, no category of elderly person will be excluded from the scope of the Bill if this amendment falls.  I am satisfied that it is undesirable to equate old age with dependency in the way suggested by the amendment.</P>
      <P>Members of the House may be aware of the work of the Age and Opportunity Committee in organising the national week on aging which is now an annual event.  Let me quote from some of the literature of the committee:</P>
      <P>Life does not end at 65.  Many of us need to be reminded of this because we have negative images of being old. We often forget that most people remain healthy, energetic and capable of participating actively in society long after they have reached the age of 65. This time of one's life can be a time of opportunity and personal satisfaction for those who use their talents and experience to the full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Age and Opportunity Committee are spearheading a movement to change the way we think about old age.  Old age need no longer be associated with <Col N="2260" /> dependency, disease and disability.  The typical elderly person is healthy, energetic and is as capable of contributing to society as his or her younger neighbour. Deputy Sherlock has not moved beyond Shakespeare's description of old age as, &ldquo;second childishness and mere oblivion, Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything&rdquo;.  On this side of the House we prefer Longfellow who said, &ldquo;For age is opportunity, no less than youth&rdquo;.  Perhaps I can invite Deputy Sherlock, in Browning's words, to, &ldquo;Grow old along with me!  The best is yet to be.  The last of life, for which the first was made.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think it is appropriate to accept the amendment.  We have given a lot of thought to this because modern thinking is that we should get away from the term &ldquo;old age&rdquo;.  The legal advice to me is that to include &ldquo;old age&rdquo; in this section would not bring in any new category of person. Therefore, I reject the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed at the Minister's response.  He seems to disregard old age.  He mentioned on two occasions that the term &ldquo;old age&rdquo; should not be used but we are well aware of the substantial growth in the number of nursing homes throughout the country and that all the people who live in them do not suffer from an illness or a disability. It is for that reason that I am taking issue with the Minister.</P>
      <P>At present a high percentage of the persons accommodated in nursing homes are not suffering from physical injury, disease or infirmity.  However, because provision is not made for them by the health boards, their relatives are forced to have them admitted to such a nursing home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will be talking later about a subvention being paid to such nursing homes and I can see that this trend will take us down a certain road.  The Minister said that he has a programme in train for the care of the elderly, home nursing and so on, and that that is why he will not accept my amendment.  Consequently, people who require care and attention beyond what can be provided by their families do not, when medically examined, fit the <Col N="2261" /> criteria laid down in this section of the Bill.  This must not be allowed to happen and I intend to press this amendment. The Minister has had plenty of time to examine it but he is obviously sticking to <Col N="2262" /> the same line of argument.  A nursing home Bill must include provision for the elderly and those who have reached old age.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo; `prescribed fee' means a fee set at such a rate as to merely meet the cost of processing applications, taking one year with another,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an amendment I had tabled on Committee Stage which sought to set some limit to the fees that might be prescribed in relation to this Bill.  I was seeking to establish as a point of principle that the fees would be no greater than the cost of processing the applications taking one year with another.  I was seeking to ensure there would be uniformity between each health board in relation to the level of fees for inspection, fees for renewal of registration and fees for registration of proprietors of nursing homes.  I feel this amendment is necessary on the grounds of reasonableness as to ensure that CEOs of health boards would not seek to take advantage of the opportunity presented by the new homes having to pay fees on registration for the first time.  I think uniformity is important and the fees should be set at a reasonable level.  That is the basic argument for my amendment. I am not seeking to set in concrete the level at which the fees should be set, whether it be £50 or £100 but as a point of principle it should be no more than the cost of processing the applications.  This is reasonable and I ask the Minister to accept my amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage I said I would discuss the level of fees for registration with the Irish Private Nursing Homes Association.  I repeat that assurance now.  It is very important that the level of fee should be reasonable.  I do not think it is desirable that fees should be too high because the cost will be passed on in the form of higher charges to patients, their families or the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it would be a good idea to include Deputy Yates' amendment in the Bill because it might force a Minister to set a higher fee than he would otherwise set.  I do not know if the Deputy has calculated the cost of processing applications for registration, but if one adds the cost of the professional staff's time involved in the inspection and monitoring of homes applying for registration, the cost might very well be considerable.  If we accept the Deputy's amendment, the Minister would be forced to have a much higher fee than one would wish and that one would have if the amendment was not accepted.  I would prefer if the fees were discussed with the nursing home owners.  I have no doubt that we will <Col N="2265" /> reach agreeemnt with the majority of homes on what is a reasonable fee for registration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is reasonable in that it is trying to set down guidelines which will be taken into consideration by health boards, in particular. Surely the Minister is not suggesting that the level at which the fee is set would mean that he or the health board would be at a loss in processing the applications.  Of course, account will have to be taken of the cost of processing applications.  If the Minister is not accepting Deputy Yates' amendment, do I understand that, after the discussions with the Irish private nursing home owners, a guideline will be set down by him which will be in operation in all health board areas so that there will be uniformity throughout the country?</P>
      <P>A problem we have all had as legislators is that individuals in the service tend to apply different regulations.  This has happened.  Under the 1970 Act, CEOs have interpreted some sections in a certain way and the Minister's attention had to be drawn to the anomalies that had arisen.  We are anxious that reasonableness would apply and that the fee would be reasonable and this amendment would have addressed that point.  It would have set down a guideline as to how the fees should be set.</P>
      <P>The Minister has assured us that he will discuss the procedure with the Irish Private Nursing Homes Association and guidelines could be set so that all health boards will be charging the same level of fees.</P>

      <P>I regret the Minister cannot accept this amendment.  I feel that his commitment to consult with the Irish Private Nursing Homes' Association may only be a token gesture because after consultation he may do what he likes.

      <P>In page 2, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo; `records' shall mean all records excluding clinical and financial records;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals with the definition of records.  Records are not defined in section 1 of the Bill at present and I am seeking to do so because section 6 (2) (g) <Col N="2267" /> on page 9 of the Bill, as amended in Committee states:</P>
    <P>prescribe requirements as to the records to be kept in nursing homes and for the examination and copying of any such records or of extracts therefrom by officers of health boards,</P>
    <P>If these records can be examined freely by health board personnel, copied and taken away, we need to be very careful that private and confidential matters should be excluded from that type of consideration.  The personal details of patients should be excluded as well as the personal financial arrangements of proprietors.</P>
    <P>My amendment is a prudent and discreet insertion which seeks to place a definition where there is none at present. Any assurance the Minister may give in regard to what records provided in section 6 of the Bill means, has no real relevance if it is not defined in the Bill. As we can see in section 1, which deals with interpretation, there is no such definition laid down.  For those reasons it is important that amendment No. 3 be included in the Bill.</P>

      <P>As I have previously dealt at some length with this amendment on Committee Stage, I do not intend to accept the amendment at this Stage.  At present nursing homes are not required, nor is there any intention to require them, to make their financial records available for inspection.  Under the present regulations, clinical records may be inspected only by a medical practitioner in the service of the Minister or the health board or by the patient's general practitioner. The draft nursing home regulations which were circulated recently repeat this provision. As I have said, it is not the intention that there should ever be an inspection of the financial records of a private nursing home or that such records should be made available for inspection. The medical records are governed by the regulations and indeed by the draft regulations which have been circulated recently.  Therefore, I do not accept that it is necessary to include this amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 3, line 18, after &ldquo;board,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;except for a geriatric home run by a Health Board or the Department of Health,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a matter of some importance.  It deals with the institutions exempted from the legislation.  At present, it is proposed to exempt an institution managed by or on behalf of a Minister of the Government or a health board.  I think it was Deputy Ryan who asked the Minister the last day under what regulations are State, health board or departmental geriatric homes covered, but I do not think the matter was properly replied to.  Therefore, I am tabling an amendment which was discussed in detail on Committee Stage but was not actually tabled.  Of course, we will exempt prisons and other types of hospitals but public homes, <Col N="2269" /> equivalent to nursing homes, that happen to be in the public domain should not be excluded.  This new amendment seeks to delete section 2 (1) (a), which would mean that a geriatric home run by a health board or by the Department would not be exempt.  I am seeking to ensure that the same standards apply in the public as in the private sector.  It is very important at a time of such financial stringency, cutbacks and staffing shortages that there is protection for this vulnerable section of the community.  This matter was not properly dealt with on Committee Stage.  The Minister simply referred to institutions other than health board geriatric homes.  There must be equality and there must be protection for the elderly, many thousands of whom are in such geriatric homes and deserve this protection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting this amendment I would again ask the Minister to take on board what we in the Labour Party, and indeed the other Opposition parties, have been endeavouring to enshrine in the legislation.  I hope we get a definite reply from the Minister.  On Second Stage and Committee Stage when I asked under what legislation or regulations an institution managed by or on behalf of a Minister of the Government or a health board is covered, he said that as far as he was concerned they were already subject to a statutory and publicly accountable system for management. The Minister referred to Members of these Houses.  Eastern Health Board officials and visiting committees.  He touched on the whole area rather than making a specific statement in relation to the regulation in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have commended the Minister on the great progress he has made in this important area.  It will be many years before we come back with more legislation in this regard.  The Minister is excluding, in this legislation, institutions run on behalf of a Minister of the Government or a health board and therefore he is setting identified standards for private nursing homes, but when it comes to the <Col N="2270" /> institutions mentioned in the amendments he is saying there is public accountability. This provision is necessary.  As I said on previous stages, the people running these institutions fear they will not have the finance necessary in the years ahead to meet the minimum requirements as outlined in this Bill.  The Bill will not meet their needs unless the Minister is prepared to consider the points made by the Opposition.</P>
    <P>The Minister made it very clear, on Commitee Stage, that he was not prepared to take our views on board, but I hope he will now take this amendment on board and ensure that there will not be a two-tier health service.  It is important that this provision be enshrined in the Bill.  I am asking the Minister to clearly outline the legislation or regulations under which these homes are being run and controlled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>One finds it difficult to comprehend a situation where the Minister would find grounds &mdash; I doubt very much if he could &mdash; for excluding a geriatric home run by a health board.  As has been pointed out by Deputy Ryan, in the past three or four years we have had many serious complaints which may be difficult to quantify.  Nevertheless, serious problems did arise.  These can arise from inadequate staffing levels and carelessness in administration; it does not happen very often but it can happen.  I do not think the Minister can rule out for geriatric homes the same type of regulations as are being applied to the nursing homes.  In relation to the care of the elderly and of people who require nursing, care and attention above and beyond what can be provided for them in their own home, in every institution where they are being cared for there should be regulations governing the standard of care.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt about the sincerity of the points made by the other Members but it would be a fundamental error to include in a Bill, which is primarily aimed to create a set of standards in private sector operations, the suggestions that have been made.  I have listened to Deputy Ryan and to Deputy Sherlock and I believe they are sincere but equally they should accept the sincerity of people on this side of the House.  In this regard nobody wants to create a situation where, to use the terms of Deputy Yates' amendment, a geriatric home run by a health board or by the Department of Health is anything less than of the highest standard. I am a member of a health board, as I am sure other Members are also, and one of the issues which is frequently the subject of specific attention by Members from all parties and from the professionals in the health boards is the matter of standards.  Because this matter is dealt with in that way there is a distinct difference between a state sector home, be it a geriatric home, a nursing home, or whatever and there is a forum in which the interests of the members of the public who find themselves in those homes can be ventilated.  This is a forum where the members of all the professions in the health boards can give their views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not suggesting that the Deputy who has moved this amendment or the other Deputies who have spoken or the members of the health board are not vigilant in those matters but it is because of that vigilance that this amendment is not prudent and in the context of a Bill which has a very specific focus would not be the best way of specifically recording in legislation the very sincere concerns which have been expressed in that regard. I share those concerns and I share the view that we should ensure that the highest possible standards apply in this area.  I believe there is a set of institutional arrangements whereby any decline in standards can not only be ventilated but vindicated and supported by members of health boards.  It would be imprudent to have this type of regulation of State owned homes imported into a <Col N="2272" /> Bill which has very specific and a very fine tuned set of objectives.</P>

All of us are aware that over the last number of years, because of cutbacks and restrictions on budgeting &mdash; particularly in the community care area, both in the community and in institutions, long stay geriatric and welfare homes &mdash; over and beyond the control of staff at all levels, from the matron to the nursing staff and others, they have had difficulties in maintaining the standards they set for themselves on our behalf.  We are now asking the private sector to adopt the same standards as we set down here for the public sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the basis of this amendment we are reversing the procedure on the basis of equity.  We want to make the playing pitch equal &mdash; those are the words used by Government when they are legislating for the private sector as opposed to the public sector.  We are suggesting that any standards set down in any sector should be the same for others including the public sector as the patients in these institutions, whether long stay geriatric patients, welfare home participants or in whatever other public institution, are expected by law under the provisions of the 1970 Act to contribute 75 per cent or more of their incomes, whether they be social welfare incomes, added incomes from the forestry service, county council pensions or otherwise.  They are paying into the public sector for a service and it is appropriate that we ensure that the standards we require of private institutions in this Bill are required also of public health institutions.  This is an excellent Bill and subvents the patient rather than the bed.  That is proper and I congratulate the Minister on it.  In so doing we are assisting people to avail of private nursing home accommodation.  There is no difference in seeking that accommodation in a public home, welfare or geriatric, because fees are required in that instance also.  It is appropriate for <Col N="2273" /> the patient's sake that the standards should be the same in all cases.  There is no ideological imbalance in that argument.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment tabled by Deputy Yates because, like my colleagues, I believe the same protection should be given to a patient whether confined to a private nursing home or to a public hospital.  While we can assume and be assured that good standards do apply in our public hospitals, this legislation is for the future. Because of cutbacks in the past two years the standard of care in some areas, unfortunately, had to be trimmed.  When we are introducing legislation such as this it is important that we ensure that the same standard of care is available for patients irrespective of where they find themselves. That is why it would be of benefit to this legislation to include this amendment as tabled by Deputy Yates.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputies that we want the very highest standard for our elderly in all residential institutions, let them be privately run nursing homes or State hospitals.  What we we are talking about here is a system of registration as to who should register and have inspections.  It is not appropriate that a health board who own a particular hospital should register that hospital and inspect it in accordance with this Bill. Deputies realise that it is possible to set up a private nursing home and not register it so that a health board may never know about it and, consequently, there may be no way of insisting that standards will be maintained.  The legislation will ensure that nursing homes are registered. The health boards are aware of the residential homes for the elderly they run and provision has been made to ensure that these homes are properly inspected. Indeed, as I said on Committee Stage, Members of the Opposition are also members of health boards and there is no question of any member of a health board, regardless of which side they come from, trying to hide something they <Col N="2274" /> believe is necessary to improve standards.</P>
      <P>We also have visiting committees which are made up of the elected members and professional people of the health boards. Once or twice a year they visit each home in their area to ensure that standards are maintained.  Deputies regularly submit questions to the Minister of the day and in this way the Minister is held accountable for the standards obtaining in nursing homes.  The Minister also has the power to send an inspector to look at the homes and, if necessary, initiate a public or local inquiry into a particular home by a health board if he so wishes.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ryan asked what was the basis for section 83 of the 1970 Health Act. I fail to understand why Deputy Yates included a reference in his amendment to geriatric homes run by the Department of Health as no such homes exist.  I do not think it is necessary, nor would it be appropriate, to include the amendment for the reasons I have given.</P>

      <P>On a point of information, section 6 sets out the regulations in relation to food, hygiene, staffing and so on, in private nursing homes.

Perhaps he can inform me of the appropriate Act or regulations.</P>

      <P>Under this legislation, there is a responsibility on health boards to ensure that nursing homes maintain a certain standard.  If they were to send one of their inspectors to inspect one of their own homes, how could we be sure that he would apply the same standards to that nursing home as are applied to other nursing homes?  That is a reflection on the people working in health boards.  The <Col N="2276" /> health boards will decide what is a reasonable standard.  We will lay down regulations in relation to food for example, and I have no doubt the health boards will ensure that these standards are applied in their own homes.  I am satisfied from my visits to homes around the country that an extremely high standard is maintained in health board institutions which compares very favourably with the standards maintained in private nursing homes.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because you seem to be frustrated about this matter but I asked the Minister a very specific question. I asked him to specify the legislation. Is it the 1970 Health Act or the 1954 Health Act?  He just gave me an assurance that all is well, that health board personnel are fine people and that everything is in order.  I take it that no such regulations exist.  I think that is the point Deputy Ryan was trying to make. It is clear that no regulations, compatible with those laid down in section 6 exist.</P>
      <P>I take the Minister's point that nursing homes will have to be registered but there is a great need to ensure that regulations which</P>
      <P>(a) prescribe requirements as to the maintenance, care, welfare and wellbeing of dependent persons while being maintained in nursing homes,</P>
      <P>(b) prescribe requirements as to the numbers, qualifications and availability of members of the staff, ...</P>
      <P>(c) prescribe requirements as to the design, maintenance, repair, cleaning and cleanliness . . . of nursing homes ...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>apply to health board homes.  I have visited health board geriatric homes which could well do with more than a lick of paint.  Indeed, we have heard some horrific stories of plaster falling off walls <Col N="2277" /> in psychiatric homes.  I am in correspondence with the Minister about the transfer of patients from a unit in the Eastern Health Board area and the Minister has conceded that the conditions prevailing are less than satisfactory.</P>
    <P>We are not decrying health boards but rather dealing with legal requirements. The Minister could have said that as there are no such requirements at present he intends to propose an alternative schedule which would stipulate that these regulations <Col N="2278" /> will apply elsewhere but he has refused to do so.  I intend to press the amendment.  There is a gap in the regulations and it is not adequate to say this matter will be dealt with in the normal process of democracy in the health service. Requirements should be laid down. No unit within the health service should be above the law if this is perceived to be the best type of law that we need to protect elderly people.</P>

    <P>Section 2 (1) (h) provides that premises in which a majority of the persons being <Col N="2282" /> maintained are members of a religious order or priests of any religion should be excluded from the requirements of the Bill.  There has been some disagreement on this matter.  The Minister is proposing in amendment No. 9 that the exclusion should apply only to institutions where a subvention is not paid.  At this stage I am in favour of pressing amendment No.8 because I do not think elderly persons in institutions maintained by religious persons which may go on fire should have any lesser protection than people in other institutions.

      <P>The amendment in my name arises from our debate on Committee Stage.  A number of Deputies were not happy with the exclusion of all religious homes caring for persons, the majority of whom are members of a religious order or priests of any religion.  Representations were also made to me on behalf of religious communities, making the case that a number of religious homes specialise in offering nursing care to priests or members of religious communities and that these homes would like to be included within the scope of this Bill.  In particular, they do not wish to be excluded from any subventions to which their patients would be entitled if they were being cared for in a registered nursing home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2283" /> On the other hand, there was agreement that it would not be right to include all religious communities caring for dependent members within the scope of the Bill.  I gave an example of this during Committee Stage when I said it would not be appropriate to insist that the Carmelite monasteries should comply with the standards of comfort to be laid down in the new regulations.  We are not obliging families caring for their elderly relatives to comply with these requirements and we should not require religious communities who have taken a vow of poverty to comply with them.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 9 and substitute amendment No. 48a to section 7 provide that the home run by a religious community caring for dependent persons who are in receipt of a subvention from a health board shall be defined as a nursing home and will have to comply with all the requirements of the Bill.  These amendments provide the right balance between facilitating those religious communities who specialise in providing nursing home care to priests or members of religious orders and excluding those communities who care for their elderly members within the rules of their religious founders.</P>

In these circumstances I am prepared to extend the period of registration to three years.  If I were to extend the period for any longer than that I believe it would weaken the role of encouraging nursing home owners to maintain standards without constant inspection and monitoring by the health boards.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, my name is to this amendment also.  It is a case of great minds thinking alike &mdash; I put down my amendment without realising the Minister had put down a similar amendment.  Like the Minister I was happy with the two year period at the time but as a result of representations I received from nursing home owners I felt three years was a more reasonable period.  I also felt that the five year period and the four year period proposed by Deputy Howlin were too long.  The magical number of three years is the one and I support the Minister's amendment.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's change of heart on this issue.  I believe this will give more permanence to major investments which have to be made by nursing homes.  Therefore, I support amendment No. 10 and will withdraw amendment No. 11.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party thought the magical number of years should be <Col N="2285" /> four.  We proposed a period of four years in amendment No. 12 because there is a major capital investment involved in bringing nursing homes up to standards and health boards will have the power under this Bill, to ensure that standards are maintained.</P>
      <P>In view of the strong lobbying of the private nursing homes that two years was too short we felt that four years was a reasonable length of time for a nursing home to be registered if it maintained its standards.  On the last occasion when we dealt with this the Minister was adamant that it would be retained at two.  He has gone some way towards a compromise by suggesting three years.  We will therefore withdraw our amendment No. 12 in favour of the Minister's.  We hope that this will be kept under review.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 11 and 12 not moved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 37, to delete &ldquo;an&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;a serious&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a matter which we debated last week on Committee Stage and, on reflection, I am still not satisfied about it.  It relates to the circumstances where registration could be refused to the proprietor of a nursing home.  One of the circumstances in which a proprietor could be refused registration is if &ldquo;the applicant or the registered proprietor, as the case may be, or the person in charge or, as the case may be, proposed to be in charge of the home has been convicted of an offence under this Act or the Act of 1964 or of any other offence that is such as to render the person unfit to carry on or, as the case may be, to be in charge of the home&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has to be interpreted by a health board and we could have a situation where someone who did not have a gun licence, did not have a dog licence or did not pay his television licence could be found to be an unsuitable person to be in <Col N="2286" /> charge of a home.  I think only a finite series of offences should debar someone from being a registered proprietor.  Not being a legal person myself, and having reflected on this, perhaps a better word than &ldquo;serious&rdquo; could be inserted.  The Minister would have access to much better legal advice than I would.  The fact that the Act says &ldquo;any other offence&rdquo; could be interpreted to mean that a person who was prosecuted for not paying a television licence or who got a parking ticket could lose his registration or a third party objecting to a nursing home being established could take a case to the District Court.  The only defence the Minister had the last day was that a justice or a health board would not interpret it in such a way that a minor offence would render the person unfit, so we have to take the Minister's word for it.  This is not what the law is about.  The Minister's opinion or mine is not what is at issue.  The law is supposed to be clear and precise.  That is what we want so that the courts can interpret it with clarity.  I am not saying my amendment is the answer to this but I am certainly not happy that the provision should be put in those loose terms.  It could result in vexatious appeals by third parties.  We should close off that opportunity and say what we mean thereby ensuring that justice is done in the administration of these registrations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a wide-ranging debate on this section on Committee Stage.  The Minister has reassured us that if people are unhappy about the application of particular sections they can have recourse to the District Court.  We have argued that once a person providing this kind of service has to go to court at all their reputation is immediately tarnished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Yates is concerned about the inclusion of the words &ldquo;any other offence&rdquo; and as to how it would be interpreted, and wanted to amend it to read &ldquo;a serious offence&rdquo;.  The Minister on the last occasion said that it would of course <Col N="2287" /> have to be a serious offence before somebody could be precluded from registering. I understood that he had confirmed that guidelines would be laid down by way of regulations to cover the points made by Deputy Yates.  Perhaps the Minister would confirm that that is the way he wants to approach this.  Possibly that is the correct way to legislate in this area without becoming too technical or ending up in court with every section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>My reason for rising on this is to seek clarification.  The section refers to the person in charge of a home having been convicted of an offence under &ldquo;this Act&rdquo;.  Deputy Yates refered to convictions under other Acts.  It also mentions the Act of 1964.  Is it not intended to repeal the Health (Homes for Incapacitated Persons) Act, 1964, or is that the Act we are referring to?  If that is so, is it the intention under this Nursing Homes Bill to repeal that?  Why then is there reference to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a certain confusion creeping into this debate.  With respect to Deputy Yates I think this amendment is incorrect or out of order. If he looks at the Bill as amended in Committee he will find that the word &ldquo;offence&rdquo; appears in lines 37 and 38.  He is proposing that &ldquo;offence&rdquo; in line 37 be amended whereas I suspect he means the word &ldquo;offence&rdquo; in line 38 because the word &ldquo;offence&rdquo; in line 37, as Deputy Sherlock points out, refers specifically to offences under the Act whereas the &ldquo;offence&rdquo; in line 38 refers to &ldquo;any other offences&rdquo;.  That is the first point I would like to make.</P>
      <P>The second point is that Deputy Yates said today that he wants to amend this to read &ldquo;a serious offence&rdquo;.  I do not think there is any legal definition of the word &ldquo;serious&rdquo; and for that reason I suggest the word &ldquo;indictable&rdquo; would fill the Bill. I accept the spirit of what Deputy Yates has said.  We are endeavouring to reach a consensus on this.  While I am not a legal expert I suggest that the use of the word &ldquo;indictable&rdquo; would be the answer to our problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The parliamentary draftsman has advised that it is very difficult in drafting legislation to distinguish between a serious and a not so serious offence which might disqualify a person from being a registered proprietor or a person in charge of a nursing home.  The amendment we accepted on Committee Stage considerably tightens the section. We removed the words, &ldquo;in the opinion of the board&rdquo;.  I was surprised to hear Deputy Yates suggest that a person who did not have a current TV licence or gun licence might find himself or herself excluded from being the proprietor of a nursing home on the basis that the board might consider them to be serious offences.  Section 4 (6) (b) (ii) states:</P>
      <P>(ii) the applicant or the registered proprietor, as the case may be, or the person in charge or, as the case may be, proposed to be in charge of the home has been convicted of an offence under this Act or the Act of 1964 or any other offence that is such &mdash; this is very pertinent &mdash; as to render the person unfit to carry on or, as the case may be, to be in charge of the home.</P>
      <P>Nobody in their sane senses would suggest that a person convicted for not having a television licence or a gun licence would be guilty of an offence that would render them unfit to be in charge of a nursing home.  The new section has been considerably tightened up by the amendment we accepted on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I should like to tell Deputy Ferris, who raised a question about guidelines, that we can elaborate on what is in the Bill but I am satisfied that its provisions are clear in stating that a person has to be guilty of an offence that would render him or her incapable of being in charge of a nursing home.  We can elaborate on that provision in the regulations because, obviously, we want common sense applied and I have no doubt that common sense will prevail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sherlock suggested that the 1964 Act is being repealed, and that is correct, but convictions under that Act will stand.  Deputy Garland suggested <Col N="2289" /> that we should consider replacing the word &ldquo;serious&rdquo; with the word &ldquo;indictable&rdquo; but I do not think that would get us out of the dilemma.  In fact, if we change the word we might be creating a bigger dilemma because some indictable offences may not render a person fit to be in charge of a nursing home.  The best advice to me is against including the word &ldquo;serious&rdquo; on the basis that it might create bigger problems than we have.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that an appeal may be made to the District Court against an unreasonable decision of a health board.  That should ensure that health boards will be particular.  They will not want to be going to court to defend a bad decision.  They will want to ensure that they apply common sense when implementing the provisions of the Bill.  I am satisfied that the section, as amended, meets our desire to ensure that decisions are well based.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point made by Deputy Garland that in line 38 &ldquo;any other offence&rdquo; should read &ldquo;a serious offence&rdquo;. For that reason I intend to withdraw the amendment.  However, I am not satisfied with the Minister's assertion that the words &ldquo;any offence&rdquo; could not mean offences A, B, or C.  Any assertion could be made by a solicitor in court.  I am concerned that this matter is put beyond any doubt in the regulations.  The clear intentions of the House should be implemented.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 10, after &ldquo;registration&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I argued in favour of a similar amendment on Committee Stage.  I did not resubmit all the amendments I tabled on Committee Stage but I have tabled the ones I considered were not dealt with adequately by the Minister.  Subsection (8) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2290" /> (a) A health board may&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) at the time of registration or subsequently attach to the registration conditions in relation to the carrying on of the nursing home, concerned&mdash;</P>
    <P>That is an open-ended power.  The subsection continues:</P>
    <P>and such other matters as it considers appropriate having regard to its functions under this Act,</P>
    <P>The powers envisaged are too broad.  I have no doubt that the vast majority of health board officials will be reasonable in their approach to this provision.  The intention of the Oireachtas is that unreasonable conditions should not be attached to the running of nursing homes. However, we should be bold enough to specify that in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It could happen that an over-zealous health board official &mdash; we come across them from time to time &mdash; might feel it appropriate to include conditions that would not be reasonable and that a reasonable person would find unacceptable. The only way that would be vindicated would be by appealing the decision to the District Court.  That would be inappropriate.  I have no doubt that the Minister's intention is that only reasonable conditions should be attached to the running of a nursing home and that in practice most health boards will only attach reasonable conditions but we should spell them out in the regulations.</P>
    <P>There is a fear among some owners of nursing homes that giving this broad power to a health board might put them in an invidious position.  It is a fair request to ask the Minister to include the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; in the section.  I do not think its inclusion will detract from his intentions. It will give people further confidence in the Bill and will protect those who are genuinely running nursing homes for the benefit of the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I considered this suggestion since Committee Stage and I do not propose to accept the Deputy's amendment.  I understand that the owners of nursing homes are concerned <Col N="2291" /> about the implications of conditions which may be attached to registration but, as Deputy Howlin pointed out, the boards can be expected to be reasonable in the conditions they lay down.  If, for example, an official decides to impose a condition that is not reasonable, there will be plenty of opportunities for an applicant before he goes to the District Court to deal with the matter.  For example, the matter could be discussed with the official concerned or with more senior officials or the CEO of the health board.  Our experience over the years is that a practicable approach is adopted. For example, that is the position in regard to the food hygiene regulations.  The interests of the public are protected and every effort is made to ensure that a high standard of hygiene is maintained.</P>
      <P>A person who purchases a premises can discuss the regulations with the officials concerned.  A reasonable view will be taken.  Between the legislation, the regulations that will follow and the guidelines we will ensure that health boards will be clear on what is reasonable in terms of conditions.  I am satisfied that it is not necessary to include the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Minister does not see fit to include this word because we are not at variance in what we seek to achieve.  He seeks to ensure that only reasonable conditions are attached to such registrations and I also wish to ensure this.  If that is the intention, I do not understand why we cannot simply state it.  It is a frustration which frequently occurs in dealing with legislation in this House that the objective cannot be clearly stated for fear of X, Y or Z.  If it is our belief the health boards will act reasonably in all cases, why not just put in such a requirement?  There should not be a difficulty in doing that. We certainly would not stand over unreasonable conditions and perhaps the Minister will explain further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He talked about other levels of discussions and about talking to the health official concerned.  There is not much point talking to an unreasonable health <Col N="2292" /> board official, such people exist although I grant they are rare exceptions.  The next course of action is to take up the time of the chief executive officer but I do not think that he should be involved in each application in the region of his responsibility which may cover five or six counties. What is the difficulty in enshrining in the legislation the objective shared by the Minister and me, that only reasonable conditions can be attached to the registration of nursing homes?  That will placate the genuine fears of people who run nursing homes and who want to comply with the terms of the Bill.  Their legitimate fears should be allayed and I am surprised that the Minister will not accept this very minor amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 6, line 15, after &ldquo;homes&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;directly relevant to the care of dependent persons&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is similar to that tabled by Deputy Howlin as it seeks to have an element of fair play and to curb over-zealous officials.  The conditions laid down by the health boards should be relevant.  Subsection (8) (a) (ii) states that different conditions should be attached to the registration of different nursing homes.  These conditions should not be about the colour of the paint on the walls, the size of the entrance or car parking facilities, they should relate to the people we are seeking to protect.  This would improve the Bill without changing the Minister's intent.  It is an important amendment which I have resubmitted on Report Stage and I ask the Minister to accept it.</P>

      <P>This amendment is unnecessary.  We dealt with it on Committee Stage and subsection (8) (a) (i) states that a health board may &ldquo;at the time of registration or subsequently attach to the registration conditions in relation to the carrying on of the nursing home concerned and such other matters <Col N="2293" /> as it considers appropriate having regard to its functions under this Act&rdquo;.  There are two safeguards, one is that the condition must relate to the carrying on of the nursing home and the other is that it must be appropriate having regard to its functions under this Act.  Therefore, the safeguards are already in subsection (8) (a) (i) and it is not necessary to include the amendment proposed by Deputy Yates.</P>

      <P>In page 6, line 28, to delete &ldquo;it considers necessary&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;is relevant to the application&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a very important amendment. Subsection (10) (a) states:</P>
      <P>A health board may request an applicant for registration or, as the case may be, a registered proprietor or an applicant for a declaration under subsection (4) to furnish it with such information as it considers necessary for the purposes of its functions under this Act.</P>
      <P>This again relates to the individual opinion of what is necessary by a health board official.  It does not say whether every official in the eight different health boards will be of the same opinion regarding what is necessary.  It is vital to delete &ldquo;it considers necessary&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;is relevant to the application&rdquo; because &ldquo;what is necessary&rdquo; is a subjective matter but &ldquo;what is relevant&rdquo; is not.  In relation to seeking information, it is important that this is narrowed down in the interests of good law, clarity and good administration.

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to extend the length of time within which a nursing home may be legally carried on when, for whatever reason, the registered proprietor ceases to be the registered proprietor.  For example, if the registered proprietor of a nursing home died the person carrying on the nursing home in the meantime henceforth will have four weeks rather than two weeks in which to apply to the relevant health board to be the new registered proprietor. I accept the point made on Committee Stage that, for example, two weeks following a bereavement is too short a timescale within which to expect relatives to organise the re-registration of the home.</P>

If the Minister has accepted the principle of what is at issue then why do different timescales appear in the Bill?

      <P>Listening to the Minister's remarks on his amendment I have to agree with him.  The reasoning behind his argument, in fact the very words, are those I used on Committee Stage in arguing for the amendment I had submitted then, now the Minister's amendment.  I am very grateful to the Minister not alone for accepting the amendment but for arguing it in the same terms as I argued for it on Committee Stage.  Needless to say, I have no difficulty in accepting the Minister's amendment now.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge that it is important, in debating legislation &mdash; when there is a considered view expressed on this side of the House &mdash; that it would not be seen in any way as a loss of face to take on board a useful, positive suggestion from the Opposition benches.  I agree with the Minister that in the past, various Ministers have not found it possible, even in the face of logic and good argument, to accept amendments from the Opposition benches.  I contend that is a bad way of making laws.  My experience of Committee Stages of the few Bills dealt with in this session, with both the Minister and his Minister of State &mdash; in particular on the Child Care Bill, 1988 &mdash; has been of an absolutely clear, co-operative venture, endeavouring to devise the best possible legislation at the end of the day; that is as it should be.  It would be my hope that we will continue in that vein.</P>

It is necessary that there be a longer period than two weeks in which to allow application for the new registration.  Section 4 (13) (b) reads:</P>

      <P>I am not sure that 21 days represents a suitable timescale in that regard.  The import of Deputy Yates's amendment is to increase the timescale to &ldquo;one clear month&rdquo;.  If I recall correctly our discussion on Committee Stage, I think the difficulty the Minister had was a lack of definition of a clear month.  I do not have that difficulty; I understand a month to be a month.  I am not overly worked up about that aspect.  The more important amendment, with which I heartily agree, has been agreed by the Minister.</P>

      <P>I would have the same difficulty about a time scale of four weeks or a month.  I would contend that, in practice, one month constitutes a much clearer period.  For example, if one serves a notice on, say, 2 May &mdash; giving one clear month's notice &mdash; quite obviously that expires on 2 June, whereas if one starts talking about four weeks someone has to calculate how many weeks there are, which is not always that easy.  Also, if we are to accept Deputy Yates's amendments Nos. 18, 21 and 22 &mdash; in <Col N="2298" /> which he has stipulated &ldquo;one clear month&rdquo;, then we should be consistent. From my reading of legislation I understand it is quite normal to use the term &ldquo;month&rdquo;; sometimes the term &ldquo;calendar month&rdquo; is used.  Whether that would help to clarify matters I do not know.</P>

      <P>I regret to say that the Minister has created an illusion of accepting something, which clearly he is not, in my amendments.  I am disappointed at that.  If he is prepared to double the time scale in the case of his amendment it is disappointing that he finds himself unable to accept the time scale laid down in my three amendments, that is moving from 21 days to 28 days, or even &ldquo;one clear month&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is important because these are permanent decisions being taken.  There should be a reasonable interval of time to allow people gather their wits about them to make the proper types of submissions. Furthermore, I do not think it obstructs the processing of this Bill.  I am disappointed but I will not waste the time of the House by insisting on a vote.  On that note of dissatisfaction I will withdraw amendments Nos. 18, 21 and 22 in my name.</P>

      <P>I might point out to the Deputy that there is nothing sinister in there being a difference.  For example, in Deputy Yates's amendment the 21 days refers to the time within which a person can appeal to the relevant health board to have the case reviewed.  The 21 days takes effect only from the time the person is notified of the refusal.  It is a question of ensuring that we protect the rights of the people in the nursing home.  If a health board refuse to register a nursing home, in order to protect the people in the nursing home the period should not be too long.  I contend that three weeks from the time the person is notified of the refusal is sufficient to do justice to the applicant and, at the same time, to protect the people resident in the nursing home.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2299" /> Amendment No. 18 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 7, lines 37 and 38, to delete &ldquo;and the person in charge of the home&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>While this amendment was tabled on Committee Stage it was not debated because of the time difficulties, so I am glad to have the opportunity to raise it again.  Section 4 (15) of the Bill, as amended in Committee, states:</P>
      <P>Where, in relation to a nursing home, there is a contravention of a condition of registration, the registered proprietor and the person in charge of the home shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My difficulty lies with the &ldquo;person in charge of the home&rdquo;, and who that person is.  If the proprietor is on holiday, is it the person who is in charge on that day or that week?  Is it a registered manager of a nursing home?  Could it be a nurse, a general practitioner, or a member of the domestic staff?  There is no facility anywhere in the legislation to clarify who the person in charge is and when it is relevant that they be in charge. This is a recipe for chaos and is a recipe for proprietors evading the law.  A proprietor who could be guilty of an offence could well say that he was not there on that day and it was so and so's fault, and some scapegoat could be found to rescue the proprietor.  The law must be clear on this point.  The proprietor is the person who is registered and is the person who is responsible and if there is a breach in the conditions the person who must pay the penalty is the proprietor.  Who is in charge and how many people could be in charge are all subjective items which could open a Pandora's box of confusion in trying to deregister somebody.  I think that legal opinion would be invoked in District Court appeals on this point and it would be better to delete the reference in this subsection to the person in charge. For example, if people are found drinking after hours in a public house, the proprietor cannot claim that somebody else <Col N="2300" /> was in charge and plead innocence.  The licence is endorsed and repeat offences can lead to the loss of a licence so I do not see why we are making a distinction in this Bill between the proprietor and the person in charge.  The same applies for hotel licences and all other different forms of law.  If we are going to presuppose different management structures in this Bill, it will lead to chaos.  This is a flaw in the legislation.  It is wrong.  It is important that we clarify it in the interests of protecting the patient &mdash; ensuring that the proprietor is the named person responsible at all times &mdash; and ensuring that some innocent employee would not be made a scapegoat in unfortunate circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. I do so from the principle that responsibility shared is responsibility diluted.  If this Bill, when enacted, is to work, there needs to be somebody clearly designated as the responsible person with total responsibility for implementing the provisions of the Bill and the regulations to be drawn up under it.  That person has to have clear responsibility and there can be no doubt about the person's responsibility. The corollary of that is that there is no doubt about their culpability if there is a clear breach of the regulations or the terms of the Bill.  It is a mistake to have dual responsibility in this regard.  The proprietor must be clearly responsible. Proprietors must know that once this Bill is enacted they will be responsible and there is no way in which they can pass the buck, whether they are absentee landlords, are away on holiday or have other cause for absence; they are responsible and must ensure that the home is run properly at all times.  Once this is made abundantly clear to them, we will have a much higher standard.  The concept of degrees of culpability: that those on the job have a degree of responsibility while owners have other responsibilities is a way of dividing responsibility.  The intention of the Bill to have the highest possible standards will suffer as a result of that.  I am sorry we did not have time to discuss this point on Committee Stage <Col N="2301" /> because if we had had time to discuss it, the Minister might have reflected upon it and had good news for us when he came back on Report Stage.  Unfortunately this is the first time we have reached this important amendment.  Notwithstanding the time factor on Report Stage, I ask the Minister to think again about this. This subsection waters down the responsibility of the person clearly in charge, the owner, and this will cause sufficient confusion and be a sufficient smokescreen to allow some people to think they can cut corners and get away with breaches of the regulations in this regard.  I support the amendment and I hope the Minister can accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment very strongly.  Surely the registered proprietor should be responsible if there is a breach of regulations.  We talked a great deal about the regulations and conditions and so forth and the licence granted to the proprietor.  It would be a travesty of justice if one were to say that the person in charge of the home shall be guilty of an offence.  The person in charge is likely to be a paid official carrying out his duty as laid down by the employer but the conditions and regulations governing nursing homes is entirely a matter for the proprietor.  For that reason I support the amendment.</P>

      <P>I have listened to what the Opposition speakers have had to say on this and I am not convinced by the arguments they have raised.  The wording is quite clear, &ldquo;the registered proprietor and the person in charge of the home ...&rdquo; It does not say &ldquo;or&rdquo; the person in charge of the home.  If the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; had been used I would certainly disagree with it.  It is quite clear that the section as it stands does not dilute in any way the power to prosecute the proprietor but it merely widens the net to include the person in charge, who may in fact be the real villain of the piece.  I think it is far safer to leave it as it is.</P>

      <P>While we all want to <Col N="2302" /> achieve the same objective, that is that all homes are registered and maintain the very highest standards, it is a question of whether that can be done better by identifying one person as being responsible or identifying two as being responsible. I am satisfied it is necessary to identify two people because there could be a situation where the registered owners of the nursing home was abroad or could not be found and I believe we must place a responsibility on the person in charge to ensure the regulations are complied with.  At present under the existing 1985 regulations, the owner and the person in charge are responsible for complying with nursing home legislation and in my view this should be the same in respect of registration.</P>

      <P>The Minister gave a very brief reply to a matter that was not debated on Committee Stage.  As a result of what the Minister has said, we have entered into a new situation, now there are clearly two people involved, the proprietor and possibly somebody else.  A whole series of questions arise out of this. Is there to be a separate register of those in charge?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear that I support the Labour Party's motion of no confidence in the Minister for Justice and Minister for Communications, <Col N="2303" /> although I should point out that if the Labour Party had got it right last Thursday, we would have even more reason to vote no confidence in this Minister as we would know more of that he has in mind in relation to broadcasting. In that regard it is my belief that there is only one clear and consistent element in the policy of this Minister.  He wants to do irreparable damage to RTE by hook or by crook, but there the clarity ends. He is not sure how to go about this infamous and vengeful enterprise.  In the space of a couple of weeks, he has come out with one scheme after another, each one worse than the one that went before it.  So far the Minister has twice been publicly supported by the junior Government party, only to be denounced within the space of a couple of days.  It will soon be time for the cock to crow a third time and I wonder if we will hear a third denunciation by the Progressive Democrats. Will they even be here tonight? Will any of them be here tonight or have the mould breakers finally turned to jelly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government clearly have no confidence in this Minister.  He has been accused publicly of cutting corners.  Ministers have told him privately &mdash; some not so privately &mdash; that he has got it wrong. It is now commonplace to hear Fianna Fáil backbenchers, Progressive Democrat Senators and even Progressive Democrat spokesmen in exile publicly denouncing what this Minister is doing. There are divisions in the Government and there are divisions in Fianna Fáil about what this Minister is attempting to do.  Everything he has touched so far has gone wrong.  This latest and most naked act of revenge has gone wrong.  It has been a disaster for the Government, a disaster that will dog them for the rest of their lives, however long or short that may be.  If Members of the Government have learned anything at all from this fiasco it must surely be that they need to read very carefully and with very great suspicion anything that this Minister puts before the Cabinet.  They will have learned that they should approach everything he says and does with distrust in <Col N="2304" /> their hearts and alarm bells ringing in their ears.  They should refuse to accept anything from him that is not written.  In those circumstances, we have to ask, how they can possibly continue to work with him.</P>
    <P>Look at the record.  This Minister has not tackled in any real sense the many problems that beset our prison system. He has not dealt adequately with the many problems of HIV -positive prisoners. He has clearly failed to understand the flexibility offered by the design of Wheatfield Prison and he is not using that prison in a way that will most effectively deal with the problems in the prison system.  He has failed totally to understand the need to improve management and decision-making structures in the Garda Síochána, in spite of the fact that the Garda Representative Association, the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors and senior Garda officers have consistently offered him pertinent and well-considered advice.</P>
    <P>The Minister has utterly failed to explain his extraordinary action in obliging the RTE authority to sell Cablelink to Telecom Éireann, an under-bidder among a group of potential buyers, all of whom thought they were on a level playing pitch.  It is clear that other members of the Government shared, at least temporarily, the real concerns we have on this side of the House with the Minister's unprecedented approach to the issue.  It has been a very curious approach.  The Irish taxpayer loses out because of what the Minister has done. The Government have left themselves open to the possibility of legal claims by the prime bidder, who have already said they are considering legal action.  If they were misled, other bidders may take the same view and consider taking the same course.  If the primary bidder had been allowed to purchase Cablelink, the Irish economy would have a net addition of £100 million of foreign investment rather than a simple transfer between one State company and another, which is what is on the cards at the moment.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann do not seem to have got a great deal so far out of this.  The <Col N="2305" /> interest cost to Telecom Éireann of this purchase is reported to be about £4.5 million.  Their share of the profits of Cablelink is reported to be about £1.2 million.  Telecom Éireann already have substantial borrowings, guaranteed by the State, and here we are going to add more to that with further exposure to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The activities of the IDA and even CTT have been damaged because the Minister has ensured that while there is an apparently competitive bidding situation, he is going to step in, completely distort the whole procedure and decide, for reasons he has not explained, that some under-bidder is going to be the one who wins out.  That is going to damage the confidence of outside business interests in the way the Irish economy and substantial sectors of it are being handled.</P>
    <P>Indeed members of the Government seem to share these very serious concerns. The Minister for Industry and Commerce went to the trouble of publicly vetoing the decision made by the Minister pending an examination by the Fair Trade Commission.  The same Minister for Industry and Commerce later, and just as publicly, backed down from that position, allowed the sale to go ahead and covered himself by announcing a set of conditions that he surely could have written out for himself in the beginning, before going to the extraordinary lengths of publicly vetoing a decision by a colleague. The Minister for Industry and Commerce has not explained his action at all, and the rest of us here are forced to ask if agreement on the sale of Cablelink to Telecom was the price the Progressive Democrats had to pay for getting concessions on the Broadcasting Bill.  If that was so, they have paid out and used up their political credit for nothing since it is very clear that Fianna Fáil would have extracted the same meagre, unsatisfactory concessions from the Minister if the Progressive Democrats had kept their mouths shut.</P>
    <P>This is the Minister who wanted to retain for himself the power to issue broadcasting licences, but that went <Col N="2306" /> wrong.  He was forced to back down from that and was obliged to set up a commission. This is the Minister who sold the virtues of MMDS.  Like many thousands of people around the country, I got a very glossy brochure in the post one day, with lovely pictures of the landscape of Ireland, saying how MMDS was going to resolve all the problems.  What happens now?  The Minister is saying that MMDS has to be supplemented by UHF.</P>
    <P>Everything this Minister has done so far has gone wrong and all the indications are that what he is still planning to do will go wrong also.  This, for example, is the Minister who wants to deliver TV3. I am told he is now advising some of the potential bidders that they should concentrate on Dublin and the east coast for at least three years.  Why?  Does the Minister believe that TV3 will be uneconomic or that it will not work, or, has he got some mad scheme up his sleeve for a TV4?</P>
    <P>This Minister would have a hand in delivering on Fianna Fáil's 1987 promise of Teilifís na Gaeltachta.  That has gone wrong.  Nothing has happened, yet the Minister should know that there is a national campaign on this issue.  It is very well informed, it is very well researched and there is now no belief either in his ability or in the Government's ability to understand the real meaning of the campaign or to deliver on their promise.  The Minister has not admitted that the current shape of his plans for TV3 cut directly across the possible options for Irish language TV broadcasting.  That is either because he is making a vain attempt to hide the fact or, perhaps, he simply does not understand it.</P>
    <P>He has failed to do the two jobs he was given in this Cabinet.  It is time for this House to recognise that.  It is time for the Government and the Taoiseach to act on what they already know and to take this Minister off the playing pitch completely.</P>

      <P>During the course of the debate on this motion <Col N="2307" /> kind tributes have been paid to me by my colleagues, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I want to thank them for their support.  Many other things, neither kind nor justified, have also been said about me and I am glad of this opportunity to say my piece.</P>
      <P>I propose to turn first to my stewardship of the Department of Justice portfolio.  The work of this Department impinges very directly on the lives and well being of all our citizens and on it depends, to a great extent, the preservation of some of their most fundamental rights &mdash; their rights to personal safety on our streets and in their homes, the safeguarding of their property and the protection of their rights under an adequate legal system.</P>
      <P>I have been described, disparagingly, I need hardly say, as a part-time Minister for Justice.  Well, let me review for you some of the achievements in this extremely wide and important area for which I have been responsible, in the period of 11 months since I was appointed.  I will turn first of all to the Garda Síochána area.  Since taking office as Minister for Justice in July last, one of my top priorities has been to ensure that the gardaí are equipped and deployed so that the ordinary citizen can live in peace and security, and to this end my objective has been to have as many gardaí as possible out on beat duty on our streets where they are most needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last November I announced one of the most powerful crime fighting packages ever put together in aid of the Garda Síochána and the Garda Síochána have willingly acknowledged this.  I have, since then, acted with determination to ensure that the various elements of the package are quickly implemented to ensure that maximum benefit is got from it.  This package consisted of four main elements: first, the recruitment of 250 clerical staff so that gardaí can be released from office work to perform the work of preventing and detecting crime for which they are recruited and trained; second, 200 extra promotions in the Garda Síochána for the <Col N="2308" /> purpose of strengthening Garda management; third, an extension of the retiring age, to 60 years, for gardaí.  This extension, will, it is estimated, retain about 250 members in the Force, and fourth, an accelerated Garda recruit intake to ensure that the 1,000 Garda recruits being taken on become available for duty at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>Apart from this package, I have ensured, with the approval of my colleagues in Government, that adequate funding has been made available in the current year to provide for Garda needs in the form of vehicles, technical equipment, radio equipment, computers, overtime, etc.</P>
    <P>I have given active encouragement and support to the Garda Commissioner in extending the community policing concept &mdash; when I took up office as Minister gardaí were involved in 50 such projects in the DMA &mdash; there are now 91 projects and this system of policing, which has been found to be very effective, is set to expand further in the near future.</P>
    <P>While speaking of DMA matters, I should refer to my support for the opening of a new Garda office in Upper O'Connell Street which is open to the public until midnight each night and is providing a most useful and welcome public service in the city centre.  I should also mention that I made funds available &mdash; with the approval of my Government colleagues &mdash; so that extra gardaí could be on duty in our city centre streets in the weeks leading up to Christmas.</P>
    <P>As evidence of the success of what I have been doing, I can quote from the following letter of appreciation, received very recently from the Dublin City Centre Business Association, which for a long time has been campaigning for extra policing in the city centre:</P>
    <P>Dear Minister, I write to you on behalf of the members of this Association to congratulate you on your recent remarks stressing the positive results of &ldquo;on street&rdquo; policing.</P>
    <P>Our members appreciate your efforts and ever increasing results since you became Minister for Justice.</P>

      <P>Before concluding my comments on the Garda side I want to congratulate the Garda Síochána on the excellent work they are doing and particularly on some outstanding successes which they have had in recent months.  They can be assured of my wholehearted support whether this be by way of providing them with the resources they require to carry out their duties or by defending them from the unfair and unjustified attacks that are made on them from time to time from quarters from where they should least expect it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I now turn to prisons.  Since taking on responsibility for Justice, I have taken quite a number of initiatives which provide, I believe, clear evidence of my commitment to the implementation and further development of policy in this area.  As part of the policy of developing a more humanitarian approach to the administration of sentences, I extended the Christmas release arrangement last Christmas to offenders whose release was not contemplated prior to this &mdash; this was a resounding success.</P>
      <P>Again, related to the administration of sentences, I set up the &ldquo;Sentence Review Group&rdquo;.  This put in place, for the first time ever, arrangements whereby the Minister for Justice can have the benefit of independent advice in relation to the administration of long term sentences. This incidentally was recommended by the Whitaker Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tragedy of deaths in custody has also been an issue of particular concern to me.  Even though this is a recognised worldwide problem I was not prepared to leave it at that.  I assembled a group <Col N="2310" /> of people, expert in this whole area, to advise me in relation to this problem and I understand that they have now produced a number of interim recommendations. I shall be considering their report as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Over a number of years there has been criticism at the absence of a medical director for the Prison Service.  I addressed this long standing problem and the House will be glad to know that I will be making an offer of appointment to this post in the next few days.</P>
    <P>Another concern to which I have given priority is the problem of how to deal with prisoners who are suffering from communicable diseases, including HIV. In this sensitive and complex area, I have taken what I believe to be the most responsible approach in bringing together the best experts available, from within and outside the Prison Service, to advise me.  In the meantime, I have given the go ahead for the construction of a special unit in Mountjoy to accommodate people suffering in this way.</P>
    <P>In addition to the Mountjoy unit, work has commenced on the total refurbishment of St. Patrick's institution.  This will include the complete refurbishment of the women's prison.  Overall this year £8 million has been provided for prison building and maintenance works &mdash; clear evidence, I say, of my strong commitment to up-grading our prison accommodation.</P>
    <P>Finally, since I took up office, the transfer of prison staffs and prisoners to the new Wheatfield Prison has been proceeding as planned.  This prison is now three-quarters occupied and will be fully in operation by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>Not a bad list of achievements, I submit, for my 11 months in office.  I can claim also many other achievements in relation to other aspects of the work of the Department of Justice &mdash; as my time for speaking on this motion is limited, my references must be brief.</P>
    <P>For example, my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, was kind enough to refer to my participation in the Anglo-Irish Conferences, some of which in recent times created new records in terms <Col N="2311" /> of duration.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs is the captain of our team on these occasions &mdash; I will say only that I played my part, in particular in relation to the vital security issues which invariably come up at these meetings.</P>
    <P>On the law reform side, I have been responsible for the following legislation. I piloted the latter stages of the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989, through the Oireachtas.  The passing of this Act, apart from any other benefits, removed an obstacle to ratification by Ireland of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which duly came into force for Ireland on 8 March 1990.</P>
    <P>As a complement to the crime fighting package to which I have already referred, I piloted through these Houses the first of what I expect will be a series of Bills reforming the criminal law.  I refer to the Larceny Act, 1990, which brings the law on handling stolen property and the possession of articles for use in larceny, burglary and so forth up to date.</P>
    <P>The Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990, introduces new and important controls on the carrying of dangerous weapons and greatly strengthens the hands of the gardaí in dealing with this problem.  The Criminal Justice (No. 2) Bill, 1990 is the Bill published at my instance, to abolish the death penalty and was passed by this House yesterday. There has, as Deputies know, been a general welcome for this enlightened proposal. There is a need for it to be clearly seen that while we are abolishing capital punishment we are no less concerned to protect the lives of those who are in the front line in the fight against subversives and criminals.</P>
    <P>Other Bills before the Oireachtas include the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Bill, 1990, the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Bill, 1988, the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Bill, 1989 and the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) (Amendment) Bill, 1990.</P>
    <P>My intervention with the Law Society last August on the issue of entrance to the professional law school for training solicitors, was a factor in their subsequent <Col N="2312" /> decision to greatly expand the intake of students by exempting Irish law graduates from sitting the competitive entrance examination.  There will be about 400 admissions to the society's law school in the current year as a result of the changes, compared with an average intake of about 150 in recent years.</P>
    <P>These then are some of the points of my record of service for 11 months as Minister for Justice and I have no qualms at presenting it to this House or to the wider public outside.  The Deputies sitting opposite me in this House include a good few &mdash; a couple have spoken &mdash; who spent a good deal longer than my 11 months in the Office of Minister for Justice or Minister of State and I venture to say that they had not as much to show at the end of their tenure as I can boast of today.  I will welcome any comparison or challenge on this that any of them care to make.  I am not afraid to say that I am proud of my record to date and let me say also that it is my firm intention to keep up the good work of the Department with the same momentum with which I have started out.</P>
    <P>I will finish my Justice report with a quotation from a letter I received within the last week in relation to the abolition of the death penalty.  This letter was from the director of the Irish Section of Amnesty International, an organisation from which I suspect Ministers for Justice worldwide do not normally expect or get much praise.  It says:</P>
    <P>As a Minister who does what he actually says in the time specified, I have great admiration for your ability to get things done, and I don't mind if you &ldquo;broadcast&rdquo; it.</P>
    <P>That bring me neatly to the Communications area.</P>
    <P>In relation to Communications let me say at the outset that I welcome this opportunity to outline the major developments that have taken place and the objectives achieved under my stewardship as Minister for Communications. I believe that the past three years, since <Col N="2313" /> I took office, have been the most innovative and progressive in the developments that have taken place.</P>
    <P>The most serious and critical problem I had to address on taking up office was, of course, that of putting a legal framework in place to accommodate the manifest demand that existed for alternative choice in the broadcasting sector.  This was parallelled by the need to close down the pirate radio stations to restore order to the airwaves.</P>
    <P>The sheer size and difficulty of the problem, in both political and administrative terms, was compounded by the legacy I inherited as a result of the total inactivity of the previous Government. The failure of the previous Government over their five or so years in office to address the problem led to a serious undermining of the law generally and created a sense of pseudo-legitimacy about the pirate situation which made the task I faced much more difficult.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding those difficulties, we quickly and effectively faced up to them with a set of coherent objectives and policies. We created through the Radio and Television Act, 1988, the necessary regulatory framework which would allow the Irish public to create its own multiplicity of choice in the broadcasting area.  At the same time through the Broadcasting and Wirleless Telegraphy Act, 1988, almost overnight, we did away with the pirate radio problem that had become endemic in this country.</P>
    <P>These changes have constituted the most radical and progressive measures in the broadcasting area since the foundation of the State.  They are in line with, and indeed in some respects are more innovative than, similar developments in other European countries.  Yet, they are geared to responding to the particular circumstances of this country, an essential element of which, for example, is the emphasis on seeking to create new and additional sources of news, information and current affairs in broadcasting to offset the multiplicity of external services to which we are going to be exposed in the years ahead.  They are equally geared <Col N="2314" /> towards attaining the other elements of the Government's broadcasting policy which include ensuring that Irish broadcasting becomes a growth industry in line with the growth of broadcasting seen in other European countries; ensuring as far as possible that Irish broadcasting remains the mainstream Irish viewers' and listeners' choice; bringing new investment and higher productivity into Irish broadcasting; creating new secure employment in the sector and providing a seed bed for the growth of an independent audio-visual industrial business in this country.</P>
    <P>The idea of establishing a national independent radio service as well as a new independent television service was particularly radical and yet is a logical and, indeed, essential element in the effective achievement of the policy objectives I have outlined.</P>
    <P>Progress in the practical implementation of the 1988 Act has been impressive by any standards.  Already the national radio service has been established as well as 18 local services with three more due to start shortly.  Negotiations on the franchise for the TV3 service are well advanced and I would be optimistic about seeing the service on steam in the next year.  This activity has given rise so far to employment of some 600 and I have every expectation that more employment will be created in the period ahead both in direct sector employment as well as in downstream employment.</P>
    <P>The new legislation which I have brought before this House is all part of a process of creating an environment in which the development of the whole media sector &mdash; electronic and print &mdash; can proceed in a fair, competitive, highly efficient and productive manner, thereby strengthening the totality of the whole sector.</P>
    <P>Much has been made in the course of recent discussion about the impact of the proposed measures by RTE.  In particular various motivations have been ascribed to my actions to the effect that either I personally, or the Government of which I am a part, or indeed the Fianna Fáil <Col N="2315" /> Party, is somehow out to &ldquo;get&rdquo; RTE on some sort of grudge basis.  I want to refute such allegations unequivocally.</P>

      <P>As an illustration of the Government's even-handedness and indeed their commitment to the RTE service, let us look at the various new developments that have taken place in RTE since I took up office.  These include additional hours of broadcasting requested by RTE to enable them to provide their new lunch-time news service on RTE 1; additional broadcasting hours to enable RTE 2 television to commence transmission at 3 p.m. daily; additional broadcasting hours for Raidio na Gaeltachta; additional hours of broadcasting requested by RTE to enable the Radio 1 service to operate later into the night and additional broadcasting hours for the FM3 service and for the Cork local service.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition, and notwithstanding the constraints on the Government's public capital programme in recent years generally, RTE was given approval to proceed with its first major new capital project for many years comprising a new library and major new studio accommodation at Donnybrook. These are not the acts of a Government that do not appreciate the importance of the role of RTE in society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As in all spheres of Government and public administration our objective is always first and foremost to serve the public interest.  I believe the policy objectives I have outlined for the broadcasting sector meet that criterion.  As I was at pains to express in my opening statement on the Broadcasting Bill, the process of transition from monopoly or dominant control to competition &mdash; and of creating the conditions where that competition is fair to all parties &mdash; is a difficult one, particularly for the monopoly service. <Col N="2316" /> Naturally therefore, RTE are expressing concern about the proposals and naturally they do not want anything done to prejudice the privileged, and in the competitive context, unfair position of dominance they have in their sector.</P>
    <P>Let us remember that we heard such expressions of concern before.  When multi-channel viewing through cable systems began to emerge in a significant way in this country through the late sixties and early seventies there were all sorts of dire predictions from RTE about its possible demise in the face of challenges from the much more wealthy external services.</P>
    <P>Yet, RTE was more than capable of responding to the challenge of the external services and, indeed, I would suggest that much of the improvement we have seen in the RTE services in the past five or six years is in large measure attributable to such competition.</P>
    <P>Likewise, RTE was to the fore in resisting any change to its domestic monopoly position in the radio broadcasting sector through the late seventies and eighties and was responsible in part for the paralysis that afflicted the then Government. This again was a manifestation of a lack of confidence in their ability to meet a new challenge &mdash; a lack of confidence which was totally unwarranted.</P>
    <P>I repeat again, therefore, that our policies and proposals are not motivated by some perceived notions of grudges.  They are based on a coherent and logical process of creating competition in the broadcasting domain, a policy with which all the major parties in this House agree, and one which I believe will strengthen the overall broadcasting sector in this country in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to the claims being made that my current proposals will result in major job losses in RTE.  When I met the RTE Authority earlier this week I pointed out to them that over the past five years their income had increased quite dramatically.  In 1985 their income was £85 million and they had 2,367 employees.  In the year 1988 they had an income of £112 million and 2,250 employees and in the year 1989 they had <Col N="2317" /> an income of £122 million and 2,247 employees.  The effect of my proposals will return them to approximately the 1988 income level of £112 million within which they could clearly sustain current levels of employment.  In this context, talk of large-scale lay-offs as a consequence of current proposals is totally unwarranted and can only be seen as scare tactics.  I therefore asked the Authority to look again at all aspects of their costs and operations with a view to adjusting to the new broadcasting environment without major staff reductions of the kind being mentioned.</P>
    <P>I accept that this latest challenge which RTE must face is a difficult one but I have every confidence that they can rise to this challenge, just as they have to the various other challenges I have mentioned. I believe RTE will remain the pre-eminent broadcasting organisation in this country, that they have and will continue to have a vital role in both informing and reflecting the values of our society, and that they will do so as effectively in the new competitive environment as they have done in the past.</P>
    <P>Another area where I have been very conscious of the national interest has been in relation to the sale of Cablelink. In the first instance I want to emphatically refute allegations made in this House last night and again tonight that I forced RTE to sell their shareholding, or any part of it, in the cable company.  There is absolutely no foundation to that allegation and I want that clearly on the record.</P>
    <P>The decision to put Cablelink on the market was one taken solely by the RTE Authority and I had no hand, act or part in that decision.  I was of course informed, as a matter of courtesy, by the then Chairman of the Authority of the Authority's intentions and I had no difficulty with their proposal.  Indeed the initial decision of the Authority was essentially a market testing exercise aimed at gauging the extent of the interest in the system and determining its real market value.  I think it is true to say that the Authority themselves were quite surprised at the extent of the interest in the system but more <Col N="2318" /> particularly at the value put on it by the various bidders &mdash; a value that could never have been really estimated otherwise than by the approach taken by the Authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="A Deputy A Deputy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As to the suggestion that I forced RTE to sell the system at below the market price, this again is a totally unfounded allegation.  I was not involved in any way in the bargaining process between Telecom and RTE and there is no question but Telecom paid the market price for Cablelink and met all the other conditions of sale set out by RTE and their external financial advisers. The RTE Authority were happy to accept the bid by Cablelink for half of their shareholding &mdash; as was the other shareholder, Allied Combined Trust &mdash; I am also supposed to have some influence there &mdash; who also sold their shareholding to Telecom at the same price.</P>
      <P>In contrast to some of the Members opposite I am very happy with the decision by RTE to sell their shareholding to Telecom Éireann.  It is no secret that I favoured such a decision and I am proud of that fact because, in my view, retaining this valuable asset in Irish ownership was very much in the national interest and in the best interests of Telecom, Cablelink and their customers.  The best one can say about some of the comments from the Members opposite is that they have no perception of the revolution taking place in the whole communications sector.  They fail to understand the changing international regulatory environment, the convergence that is taking place between the means of distribution of various types of communications ranging from voice, telex, data, broadcasting and video signals, or how, in the context of such development, the concerns being expressed about creating competition in the communications sector can not alone be met but, indeed under EC policies such as the &ldquo;Open Network Provision&rdquo;, can be greatly enhanced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2319" /> The suggestion last night from Deputy Bruton that Telecom might not have the power to become involved in the cable business &mdash; which is an integral part of the country's communications infrastructure &mdash; borders on the preposterous.  The company have all the necessary powers under section 14 (3) of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, as well as under section 2 (14) of their Memorandum of Association to acquire the necessary shareholding in Cablelink.  To contend that the fact that Cablelink is not going into foreign ownership is a missed opportunity to create competition in the telecommunications sector is to express a lack of real knowledge of how competition in that sector is going to evolve.</P>
    <P>I repeat that I fully support the sale of 60 per cent of the Cablelink shares to Telecom, that this will be recognised in time as a most prudent and far-seeing move on the part of both RTE and Telecom Éireann.  It is a decision that I as the Minister responsible for regulating both the cable and telecommunications industry support and to which I will be giving my full assent.</P>
    <P>The success of Telecom Éireann, since I assumed responsibility for Communications matters, speaks for itself. The report and accounts of the company for the year ended March 1987 showed a net loss of £8 million.  That situation has been totally reversed.  The company's accounts for the year ended March 1990 will be published shortly and will show the excellent result of profits after tax of £75 million.  The company have succeeded in wiping out their accumulated losses and this year will pay a dividend of £30 million to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The financial success of the company has benefited customers through the very substantial reductions in telephone and data charges which have been introduced since 1988.  Reductions were introduced on cross-Channel calls as well as on calls to most European countries, North America and some other countries.  In fact, telecommunications charges have been reduced by over 17 per cent in real terms.</P>
    <P>I have no intention of following Deputy <Col N="2320" /> Dick Spring down the path of personal smear politics, which he engaged in here last night.  In my political career it has been my experience &mdash; and I am in this House a long time now &mdash; that those who indulge in vindictive personal abuse are sooner or later, normally sooner, rejected by the Irish people.  However, in the light of his own and his party's ministerial performance from 1982 to 1987, I am somewhat surprised that Deputy Spring should have the temerity to propose this motion.  Certainly, he knows all about no confidence.  From fairly early on, as every electoral test from the autumn of 1983 showed, there was no public confidence in the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government, no confidence in the Labour Party performance in Government, and, most unfortunate of all, no confidence in the country.  Deputy Spring bears a major share of responsibility, as the Leader of the Labour Party, for the total economic paralysis of the mid-eighties, which saw the dole queues reach a quarter of a million, a doubling of the national debt, and zero economic growth, the worst performance in Europe.</P>
    <P>In the mid-eighties the ideological blinkers of the Labour Party contributed to paralysis in decision-making in virtually every area of economic policy-making. When Deputy Spring was Minister for Energy, offshore exploration and development for oil and gas ground to a complete halt, because of insistence on draconian conditions which made it totally unattractive to commercial companies. I had to put that situation right and a second gas field is now ready to be developed.  While I am on the subject of energy, let me say that I inherited from Deputy Spring as Minister for Energy the Dublin gas debacle.  One of the first decisions I had to recommend to Government was the taking into public ownership of Dublin Gas.  The conditions of the gas pipes in Dublin at the time were so bad that people were in fear of their lives and justifiably so.</P>
    <P>In the broadcasting sector it was the same story.  For over four years local radio failed to get off the ground, because <Col N="2321" /> of the Labour Party's insistence on public ownership and control of the airwaves. In the meantime, of course, the pirate radio stations flourished in defiance of the law.  Indeed, since we are on the subject of confidence in Ministers to govern, allow me to quote from page 166 of the diaries of a Cabinet colleague of Deputy Spring after a late-night Cabinet discussion in 1985 ended in disarray.  She went home and wrote in the diary: &ldquo;How can we govern?  The whole Radio Bill has been sick-making.  It has been a mess from the beginning&rdquo;.  The attitude of Deputy Jim Mitchell, the Minister at the time, was that he was not going to &ldquo;fall out&rdquo; with anybody over the Local Radio Bill.  As a result nothing happened.  As I said earlier, Deputy Spring knows all about no confidence in a Government.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party, like others in this House, are fond of prattling at every opportunity about pluralism.  Why should the principle of pluralism not apply to the broadcast media?  The principle of a State monopoly of the airwaves is no longer defensible in this day and age, and is difficult to reconcile with the system of pluralist democracy.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party would surely be the first to admit that the RTE broadcasting monopoly has been open to abuse. Specifically, I recall five years ago when Deputy Spring as a Coalition Minister threatened RTE with a withdrawal of support for the principle of public service broadcasting because of alleged political bias against the Labour Party.  Deputy Spring wrote letters to RTE in June 1985 expressing his anger, indeed his sense of betrayal, at the treatment of his party by RTE at that time compared to The Workers' Party.  The word &ldquo;betrayal&rdquo; is an interesting one, as it suggests that RTE public service broadcasters should favour those political parties who support the RTE monopoly, and that if they do not, then the monopoly should be reconsidered.</P>
    <P>The best remedy for the abuse of monopoly is not letters or complaints, but the promotion of vigorous commercial <Col N="2322" /> competition.  Such competition has benefited Aer Lingus.  Why should the creation and sustaining of pluralism in the broadcast media not benefit RTE?</P>
    <P>It is impossible at this stage to discern any coherent philosophy behind the cacophony of opposition from Fine Gael to any and every measure I have proposed to level the playing field in relation to media.  Only a little while ago we heard a lot about a new style of politics, a new model of constructive opposition.  Indeed on the Sound Broadcasting Bill on 10 February 1988 Deputy Jim Mitchell piously stated as reported at column 1691 of the Official Report: &ldquo;The nonsensical behaviour that has been a feature of this House for the last 10 years, with Opposition recklessly opposing, should be ended for all time.  That is the approach I will advise my party to adopt.&rdquo;  So much humbug.  The last ten days are the surest sign that Fine Gael have lost their way, and that opposition for them is now reduced to a question of who can shout the loudest.</P>
    <P>I have tried, in the time available to me, to outline my policies and accomplishments in the areas of Communications and Justice for which I am honoured to hold the office of Minister. I have set out my record for my past 11 months in Justice and three years in Communications.  It is one on which I have no fears of being judged by any panel of fairminded jurors.</P>
    <P>On the first of January 1978 I got my first Government appointment &mdash; Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I have had the honour to be appointed to other ministries since then &mdash; Environment, Energy, Industry and Commerce and now my present dual portfolio.  I have never given less than 100 per cent conscientious commitment to the performance of my duty in any of these ministries.  Always I have tried to use whatever talents I may have to progress the matters that are my responsibility, for the betterment of all our people.  And I have done it without fear or favour, malice or ill-will towards any individual or sectional interest.  The precepts I have set out have been my guiding <Col N="2323" /> principles in this post and they will be for as long in the future as I have the honour of holding public office.</P>

      <P>On behalf of The Workers' Party I rise to support the motion of no confidence in the Minister for Justice and Minister for Communications. On 23 February last I issued a public statement calling on the Taoiseach to relieve Deputy Ray Burke of one of the two minsterial portfolios.</P>
      <P>Before I proceed, I should say that I wish to share my time with Deputy Gilmore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that satisfactory? Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I called on the Taoiseach to do this because of what I described as the growing chaos within the areas for which he had responsibility &mdash; Justice and Communications.  On reflection I was being generous to Deputy Burke and clearly under-estimated his political malevolence and his capacity to do damage to the public interest.  Events of the past few weeks have shown quite clearly that Deputy Burke is quite unfit to hold any ministerial office.  Probably <Col N="2324" /> not since the dramatic events of May 1970 has there been such a compelling case for relieving a Government Minister of office.</P>
      <P>Perhaps nothing better sums up Deputy Burke's approach to the political process than his action in deliberately collapsing the debate on the Broadcasting Bill.  It is not unprecedented for a Second Stage debate on a Bill to end prematurely because of the absence of a speaker.  It is, however, unprecedented in my experience in this House for a Government Minister to instruct one of his own backbenchers who was offering to speak to sit down so that the Minister could take advantage of the temporary absence of the next Opposition speaker to terminate the debate.  This was done by Deputy Burke despite the fact that this was a controversial Bill of major public importance, his knowledge that many Members wished to contribute to the debate, and the clear assurance given by the Taoiseach last Thursday morning that every Deputy who wished to contribute to the debate would be allowed to do so.  There would be no guillotine, however contrived.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burke is a member of that school of politics where the cute stroke is far more important than any political principle, and indeed where the only political principle seems to be &ldquo;What is in it for me, and my political supporters?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste, Deputy Lenihan, speaking in the debate last night said the Government stood collectively behind Deputy Burke.  If that is so, they must also stand collectively indicted for the actions of the Minister, for his gross mishandling of the Justice portfolio, for his crude attempt to gut RTE, for his outrageous attempt to rescue the Government's political supporters in private radio stations from the results of their own commercial mismanagement and misjudgment, and for his determination to ensure that the Michael Smurfits of this world in TV3 will not have to face any real competition from RTE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the attention in recent weeks has, naturally enough, focused on the Minister's actions in the Communications <Col N="2325" /> area.  Before dealing with that area however, I want to look at his record in the regard to his other portfolio, Justice. Since being appointed to this office the Justice area has been characterised by collapsing public services and an alarming increase in deaths of persons in custody.</P>
    <P>Two important State boards for which the Minister has responsibility, the Civil Legal Aid Board and the Garda Complaints Board, are in chaos.  The chairman and two members of the Legal Aid Board were forced to resign out of frustration and most of its law centres have been unable to offer anything even approaching an acceptable level of service to the public.  More than ten years after the Airey judgment in the European Court of Human Rights forced a reluctant Government to move, the most vulnerable in our society &mdash; battered wives, deserted spouses, single mothers, the poor and the unemployed are still denied reasonable access to the protection of the courts.</P>
    <P>The Garda Complaints Board is in a similar position, and because of lack of resources has not been able to process any new complaints for more than six months.  The situation is so bad that at the end of April the chairman of the board was forced to say that it should be either properly funded or abolished.</P>
    <P>Most tragic of all is the continuing death toll in our prisons, due mainly to the appalling conditions in our penal institutions, while the recommendations of the Whitaker report remain largely unimplemented.  Let me remind the Minister and the Government who stand so squarely behind him of the suicide toll in our prisons during his short 12 month period of office: Thomas Cash, Arbour Hill, 4 October 1989; Joseph Cawley, Mountjoy, 14 November 1989; John Patrick Buckley, 26 December 1989; 18 year old Sharon Gregg, Women's Prison, Mountjoy, 6 March 1990; Edward Doran, Mountjoy, 4 April 1990.</P>
    <P>I am not, of course, suggesting that the Minister has any personal responsibility for these deaths.  There have been similar deaths during the terms of office of other <Col N="2326" /> Ministers.  But Deputy Burke has ministerial responsibility for the toleration of the sort of conditions which make these deaths inevitable and which condemn other prisoners to die, unless they are tackled, and tackled rapidly.  This, rather than RTE should be the target of the Minister's attentions.</P>
    <P>There are other areas deserving of the Minister's attention which have been largely ignored.  Despite substantial evidence of a worrying level of corruption in the planning process in the Dublin area and the concern expressed by the elected representatives and members of the public, the Minister has scorned requests for a public inquiry into these allegations. There is at least a <i>prima facie</i> case of a major conspiracy involving some elected representatives and a handful of officials to subvert the entire planning process in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>Everyone is aware that a Garda inquiry has been in progress for some time. Everyone is also aware, given the nature of the allegations, it is unlikely, despite the best efforts of the Garda involved, that a standard police inquiry will get to the bottom of the affair.  Only a sworn public inquiry could do that job.  The Minister has, for reasons that we can speculate on, dismissed that request.  His refusal is all the more significant given his intense interest in planning matters during his long political career at national and local levels.</P>
    <P>However, it is in his dealings in recent weeks with RTE that the Minister for Communications, Deputy Burke, has been seen at his worst.  The Minister seems to relish his image as the &ldquo;Rambo&rdquo; tough guy figure of this Government, who is sent in to sort out those who have, in some way, offended Fianna Fáil.  The relationship between any political party and the national broadcasting service should not be a comfortable or cosy one. All of the political parties in this House, including The Workers' Party, have had their differences and their disputes with RTE, but the relationship between Fianna Fáil in office and RTE has been characterised by threats, bullying and intimidation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2327" /> Those who know anything about politics or the broadcasting area, know of the threatening phone calls from Ministers and the Government press secretary over programmes they do not consider to have been sufficiently flattering to the Government. Everyone knows, as Deputy De Rossa said during the debate last week, that the Minister and the Government press secretary have been boasting for some time that they would wreak revenge on RTE for their role in exposing some of the more grotesque activities of Fianna Fáil under the leadership of the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey.</P>
    <P>The advent of commercial broadcasting was the opportunity they were waiting for to both snare RTE and to repay the generosity which many of those involved in commercial broadcasting had shown to Fianna Fáil at election times in the past.  This was the aim of the Broadcasting Bill, as originally published. However, the Minister for Communications, Deputy Burke, and his colleagues seriously underestimated the level of support among the public for RTE and for their high broadcasting standards, and were forced to go through the motions of appearing to compromise and modify their stand.</P>
    <P>The decision to drop the original proposal to make up to 25 per cent of licence revenue available for commercial broadcasters was part of this strategy, but the compromise and modification by the Minister was a mirage.  It is true he dropped the proposal on the licence fee, but he then simply decided to impose the same crippling penalty on RTE by a different method.  The decision to so severely restrict RTE's capacity to take advertising is likely to result in an even greater drop in revenue than would have resulted from the original Bill.  On the Minister's own admission this will cost RTE a minimum of £12 million per year.  This can only mean a deterioration in the quality of programmes and a huge level of job losses.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the ultimate intended beneficiary of the Government's move is TV3: if Century can be helped, all the better but TV3 is the real prize.  The <Col N="2328" /> ironic thing is, as everyone in the advertising industry has pointed out, there is no guarantee at all that the advertising revenue taken away from RTE will go to either TV3 or any of the commercial radio stations.</P>
    <P>Advertisers follow the audience.  They will go to the medium that offers them best results.  That is why RTE have done so well and Century have done so poorly. It is all linked to programme quality. Good programes deliver audiences which deliver advertisers who deliver revenue. Having capped RTE's advertising the most likely scenario is that the diverted revenue will go to what advertisers consider to be the next best option &mdash; UTV, Channel 4, HTV and Sky, all of whom have significant audience levels in this country.  With the diverted revenue will go jobs, not just in RTE but in the advertising industry and the production companies. The Minister clearly considers this to be a minor price to pay to satisfy Fianna Fáil's vendetta against RTE.</P>
    <P>What of the role of the Progressive Democrats in all this &mdash; the party who promised to bring new levels of honesty and integrity to the political system? They have disgraced themselves once again.  I note that throughout the debate this evening they have not graced this House to listen or to give any support to the Minister for Communications.  On their own admission, we are asked to believe that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, and the Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, did not really realise the significance of the original Bill when it came before the Cabinet. They did not notice what was involved.  They had missed the consequences of it for RTE and if they realised what was in the Bill they would have called a halt.  If this is true then the two Progressive Democrat Ministers clearly qualify for the roles of Dopey and Sleepy of this Cabinet.</P>
    <P>It is far more likely that they did indeed recognise the significance of the Bill but that, take their fellow Fianna Fáil Minsters, they totally underestimated the public reaction to their proposals.  The original Bill and its revised version show <Col N="2329" /> all the signs of being the offspring of the marriage of Fianna Fáil's determination to settle scores with RTE and the Progressive Democrats revulsion at the idea that anything owned by the people could be successful or possibly operate profitably.</P>
    <P>The treatment of RTE by the Minister for Communications has been appalling and that has almost been matched by the contemptuous way in which he treated the Members of this House last Thursday. He has proven to be an inept and incompetent Minister for Justice and a bullying and loutish Minister for Communications. He has shown himself unfit to hold Cabinet office and, therefore, we have no hesitation in supporting this motion of no confidence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>For a number of years before my election to this House last June I served as a delegate to the RTE group of unions.  As a trade union official who represented some of the staff employed by RTE I was involved, in the negotiation of productivity agreements over the past number of years and I saw, close up, RTE prepare for competition.  I was with RTE staff when they agreed to major changes in work practices and employment conditions and I saw staff numbers reduced from 2,373 in 1979 to 2,071 today.</P>
      <P>Despite this reduction in staff, RTE succeeded in putting on air a second television channel of international standard and the 2FM radio service.  As the outgoing chairman of the RTE Authority stated in the recent annual report of the company, over the past five years total television hours have increased by 24 per cent, home productions in televsion have increased by 37 per cent, total radio hours have gone up by 31 per cent, there has been a 17 per cent increase in TV multichannel market share and a whopping 40 per cent increase in productivity.  All this has been achieved with a reduced staff and no increase in the licence fee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Government Ministers who spoke last night would have us believe that these fine results are attributable to the inspired <Col N="2330" /> guidance of the Minister for Communications but I know they are due to the committed hard work of RTE staff, to those who work a 14-hour day with no overtime, to those working on short-term contracts &mdash; these people are now terrified that these contracts will not be renewed &mdash; to the spirit of enterprise and the work ethic so much talked about by this Government, but which ends up being punished rather than rewarded.</P>
    <P>Workers who make such a contribution might well expect a share in the profits they have generated but when it comes to profitable State enterprise the Government have a different concept of profit-sharing &mdash; for this Government profit-sharing means that if RTE make a profit they must share it with their competitors and not with the workers whose efforts have produced it.  Because I was at the operating table while RTE were being pared to the bone, I know there is no more fat to be trimmed and that the Government's proposals will result in 400-500 job losses directly in RTE, in the loss of hundreds of other jobs in film and video making and ultimately in a reduction of programme making and the possible closing down of some RTE channels.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Communications's proposals go through, in a couple of years' time the debate in broadcasting will be about the closure of Network 2, 2FM or even Raidió na Gaeltachta and why RTE are making a loss.  The public memory can be short, and the Minister, Deputy Burke, may be depending on this.  After all, who now remembers that B &amp; I was once a profitable company until, among other things, a Fianna Fáil Government forced it to buy ships it did not need from Verolme Dockyard in advance of two Cork by-elections in 1979? Who can remember that Irish Shipping was once a profitable company until it too suffered from Fianna Fáil political interference in its commercial affairs? The Minister is not levelling the playing pitch; he is denying to RTE the right to compete at all.</P>
    <P>This issue, however, is about more than the transfer of resources; it is also <Col N="2331" /> about censorship, about the Government's wish to dictate to the broadcasting media how they should cover news and what they should examine.  Other Deputies have referred to the Minister's expressed threat to get even with RTE, but it is wider than that.  For some years the Taoiseach, his handlers and his Ministers have been peddling the message that any RTE news coverage or current affairs programme which criticises the Government is some kind of Workers' Party plot.  By sheer repetition they have succeeded in creating an image that RTE is crawling with members of The Workers Party.  They have had some success.  The <i>Sunday Business Post,</i> for example, a quality newspaper for which I have great respect, recently editorialised about what it called Workers' Party propaganda emanating from Radio 1 and the two television channels.  It is time we had an end to these wild generalisations and addressed specifics.  Both Minister Burke and the Taoiseach are fond of mentioning &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; as an example of excessive Workers' Party coverage.  I have examined the &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; record.  In the past three months &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; has interviewed Workers' Party spokespersons on only three occasions, which is hardly excessive.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil intent on raising the McCarthy-ite ogre of The Workers' Party is not simply to keep Workers' Party spokespersons off the airwaves, although that is an added bonus but to send a signal to the news and current affairs sections of RTE that the Minister is watching and listening, and if he is sufficiently displeased with what he hears and sees, that he can get even.  This is part of a thought out, calculated and deliberate strategy designated to intimidate professional journalists and programme makers from carrying criticism of Fianna Fáil orthodoxy. What is good for Fianna Fáil, their friends and financial backers is automatically good for the country.  By sheer repetition the Taoiseach and his Man Friday have had some success.  The self-censorship climate is palpably obvious on certain issues.  Constant telephone calls from the man behind <i>Il Duce</i> are an <Col N="2332" /> attempt to get RTE to speak with <i>uno voce</i>, the Fianna Fáil voice.  The Government have a lot of power over RTE.  They can replace the RTE Authority just as they did two weeks ago: the entire authority was replaced with one exception, Mr. John Carroll.  The Authority now comprises, as Deputy Spring said last night, Fianna Fáil loyalists seasoned by a couple of Progressive Democrat appointees.  Minister Burke's continued confidence in Mr. Carroll speaks volumes.</P>
    <P>At one stroke the Government are striking terror into RTE and making the rest of the broadcasting media, and indeed the print media, somewhat dependent on the spin off advertising revenue which results from RTE's capping.  One does not have to legislate for censorship.  One can silence one medium and make the rest beholden to one simply by directing advertising revenue.  Money talks, as the Minister knows only too well.</P>
    <P>Minister Burke is no longer Minister for Communications, he is now the Minister for Censorship.  He is not just Minister for Censorship.  Not even in a South American dictatorship is the Minister for Censorship and the Minister for Police and Prisons all rolled into the one person. Like other Deputies I have been disturbed by the less than compatible combination of the Justice and Communications portofolios.  Even if the occupant of the post was an expansive liberal, the secretive, confidential ethos of the Department of Justice and the necessarily open, informative demands of Communications would sit uneasily together.  But when the Minister behaves in the gung-ho manner we have seen over the past year, then it is clear that Justice and Communications are in conflict.  Let me give an example.  For the past 18 months the Garda have been investigating allegations of corruption in the planning system in Dublin, including Dublin County Council of which Minister Burke was chairman for almost two years.  I know that the Garda investigation has ground to a halt because the <Col N="2333" /> whole planning area is far too complex for the limited resources available to the Garda and, indeed, because it is known that the Minister himself is less than enthusiastic about the investigation in the first place.</P>

      <P>It is no smear.  Where is the public inquiry?  I, and other Deputies, have called for a public inquiry into the issue.  Who is responsible for setting up public inquiries?  None other than Minister Burke himself who, not surprisingly, refuses to establish a public inquiry.  So where does the Minister for Communications fit into this?  The print media have given the issue a lot of attention, but is it not remarkable that RTE have avoided it?  For example, I recall that when I and some of my Party colleagues raised the Dublin planning scandal during the debate on the Planning Compensation Bill last February, RTE did not cover the story until the following day when it had already appeared in the print media.  The Dublin planning scandal is just the kind of issue which, in the absence of a public inquiry, and with a Garda investigation which is going nowhere, is crying out for good investigative television journalism.  The Guildford Four might still be in prison but for good television journalism.  The truth about planning corruption in Dublin will remain a mystery until it is exposed to public view, but the climate of censorship and fear which is being fostered by the Minister for Justice and Minister for Communications and the Government is hardly conducive to the production of a documentary on Dublin's planning process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a Government Minister with so much power behaves as Minister Burke has over the past year he frightens people.  When RTE staff see their income capped, their Authority replaced and menacing threats made about their programming, they fear for their employment and for their careers.  That is hardly <Col N="2334" /> conducive to good independent broadcasting. Over the course of the past year my colleague, Deputy McCartan, has pointed out that it is not compatible for one Minister to hold the portfolios of Justice and Communications.  He has pointed out that the demands of these offices, particularly in a situation where there is no Minister of State, are such that at the very least the Taoiseach should relieve Minister Burke of one of these portfolios.  Those demands have not been met.</P>
    <P>The events of the past couple of weeks, the treatment of RTE &mdash; and notwithstanding what the Minister has said this evening &mdash; the neglect of the state of policing in this country, the treatment of this House in relation to the debate on broadcasting, all point in one direction only and that is that it is time for the Minister, Deputy Burke, to go.  The Tánaiste here last night complained that the motion of no confidence in the Minister for Justice and Communications had been placed so soon.  As I see it, if this Minister continues to behave in the way that he has over the course of the past year, and particularly over the course of the past number of weeks, if he continues to display the hard-man, macho-type approach to the two sensitive portfolios that he holds, then the motion of no confidence that we are debating tonight may well be the first of many motions of no confidence in the same Minister.</P>

      <P>If proof were needed that this debate has been shrouded in bitterness and distortion one needs only to reflect on the comments of Deputy Gilmore here tonight.  This issue has been addressed by the Opposition with a hysteria which has little to do with sincerity and less to do with the truth. All of the Minister's proposals have been opposed in a mean and vindictive way inside this House and, significantly, in some well defined areas outside it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real motivation of some of the Members who contributed to this debate has nothing whatsoever to do with broadcasting policies.  Innuendos bearing no relation to facts or broadcasting have <Col N="2335" /> been thrown about with abandon.  The nod and wink were used in a mean and vindictive fashion.  Even the members of the IRTC, headed up by one of the country's most distinguished jurists, were not spared.  However, after all is said and done, the credibility and integrity of the Minister, and the IRTC, have been heightened rather than damaged.  I depend on the common good sense of the great Irish people for that.  The Minister has spared no effort towards ensuring equity and fairness in Irish broadcasting.</P>
    <P>RTE is a fine station and we can all be proud of it but it occupies a monopolistic position in the marketplace.  Monopolies are, for the most part, undesirable and have been singled out for special attention in the Treaty of Rome.  It is an irrefutable fact that no independent station could hope to compete with a competitor financed by both advertising revenue and licence fees from viewers.  It also goes without saying that the print media is similarly at an unfair disadvantage.  If we want independent radio, if we want independent television, and if we want our print media to flourish, indeed, if we want competition, we must have fair competition.  It is a fact of life that monopolies tend to abuse their position.  On the other hand, fair competition has always been the life of trade.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks, and disappointingly so, some of Ireland's best known broadcasters have used their privileged and trusted positions in RTE to launch attacks on the Minister's policies.  This would have been all very well if there had been somebody there to give the other side of the argument on the public airwaves but that facility was not provided. Natural justice demanded that there should have been such a facility.  Regardless of the Government in power, this is a dangerous road to go down and it strikes at the fundamental principles of justice and fair play.</P>
    <P>Politicians are often criticised for their reluctance to change their minds once they have adopted a particular view.  It is true that many people in our profession regard it as a perceived sign of weakness if they move, even slightly, from a <Col N="2336" /> position which they have taken.  It is, of course, nothing of the kind.  It shows strength of character, rather than weakness, to listen to the opinions of others before making a final decision and surely that is the essence of democracy.  This miserable Opposition have continually accused us of being totally arrogant and inflexible and yet when the Government showed themselves to be flexible we heard nothing but taunts of &ldquo;embarrassing U-turn&rdquo; or &ldquo;humiliating climb-down&rdquo;. The Government, and the Minister in particular, have shown that they have the courage to listen to reasoned argument and to make changes accordingly if these are seen to be sensible. What we are not prepared to tolerate is a personal vilification from people who were incapable of introducing a broadcasting Bill of any sort, let alone amend it.  The Tánaiste has already outlined the speedy and decisive way in which Deputy Burke has transformed something that was chaotic, dominated by pirates, into the present broadcasting environment with many fine stations throughout the country, properly licensed and providing the variety and service that we sought for so long.</P>
    <P>The situation we have now reached was best summed up by the <i>Irish Independent</i> editorial of 8 June which stated that the modified Bill was to be welcomed as a mature response to the wishes of the Irish people.  It said the Bill was sensible legislation which should now be enacted without further pusillanimous posturing by RTE and their political allies.</P>

      <P>The Minister has shown the type of courage and strength of character that I have spoken of.  For this he deserves nothing but praise.  He is admired by every Member on this side of the House and, I suspect, by many on the opposite benches.  He has been hounded from pillar to post in recent weeks.  He has taken it on the chin from Opposition and vested interests alike for trying to be fair.  He has shown that, unlike his <Col N="2337" /> detractors, he is not afraid to drag Irish broadcasting into the 21st century, however reluctant some people may be in their hitherto cosy and unchallenged positions.  He has been an outstanding advocate for his party and his country. He has nothing to be ashamed of and everything to be proud of, both at home and abroad.  I strongly urge the House to treat the motion with the contempt it so richly deserves.</P>

      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy Spring.  The presence of so many members of the Government in the House last night, and again tonight, is an indication of how seriously the Government are taking this Labour Party motion of no confidence in the Minister, Deputy Burke.  The choice of speakers in his defence, the Tánaiste, Deputy Lenihan, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Collins, is confirmation that the Government are under pressure as a result of what has happened in recent days following the introduction of Minister Burke's Broadcasting Bill and his subsequent abdication on Thursday last.  Given the very demanding and onerous duties of any Minister, and add to that the fact that both Ministers concerned are now actively involved in their own respective election campaigns, is further confirmation that a siege mentality now prevails within the Cabinet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste, drawing from his vast experience, did his utmost to divert the attack from his colleague.  He first attempted to discredit my party leader, Deputy Spring, and then Deputy Michael Higgins.  It is worth noting, however, that this counter-attack by the Tánaiste was on the tenor of the contributions rather than on the content.  The Tánaiste went to some pains to point out to the House that the Government subscribe to a system of collective responsibility and that the motion before the House was one of no confidence in the Government. &ldquo;We stand by Minister Burke&rdquo;, the Tánaiste said.  All I can say about &ldquo;standing by Minister Burke&rdquo; is that, despite the assurances of the Tánaiste, some of his <Col N="2338" /> colleagues were standing well back, namely the Progressive Democrats.  They adopted a similar role tonight and are conspicuous by their absence from the Chamber.  They did not offer even token support for their beleaguered colleague. Their absence is quite understandable having been led into this quagmire by the Minister and, obviously, they do not feel obliged to offer any defence on his behalf.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats need to advance some explanation following the acceptance at the weekend by the chairman of their party of the amended Bill. His welcome for the amendments, which will ensure the demise of RTE, by way of capping of advertising as against parting with licence fees, is like offering a condemned man the choice of method of execution.  The end result would be the same; the only difference is in the degree of pain the condemned man will have to endure.  The Tánaiste went on to say that the Minister had a reputation for getting things done and I do not dispute that.  I have no doubt that many people in RTE will agree with that statement.  Where disagreement arises is in regard to what he has done, what he is about to do, how he will do it, the reasons he is doing it and who will benefit from what he is doing.</P>
    <P>It is certainly not in the interests of RTE or the Irish taxpayer.  Having watched the Minister at close range for the past three years I consider that he did a good job in getting rid of the pirate stations.  I regret to say, however, that he did not complete the task.  As yet, the much lauded commission of the Minister's creation has not yet granted licences to the many community-based broadcasting organisations who have applied to them for a licence.  The one exception is a station based in the Minister's constituency, at St. Ita's mental hospital, Portrane in north county Dublin.  The Minister owes the House an explanation as to when this licence was granted and why no decision has been made on the other applications before the commission.  Once again, we have an illustration of the Minister's concept of a level playing pitch.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2339" /> The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Collins, come to the defence of his ministerial colleague.  Once again, we had the voice of experience coming in to support his colleague.  Again, we had the counter-attack with the Minister for Foreign Affairs accusing the Labour Party of misusing parliamentary procedures.  He stated that motions of no confidence were a device that should be seldom used, and I agree with that view.  However, what is the Opposition to do when the Minister used a parliamentary device that should never be used rather than responding to a debate?</P>
    <P>The manner in which the Minister for Communications terminated the Second Stage of the debate on that occasion set many precedents.  First, it must have set a record as the shortest response to any debate given by a Minister since the foundation of the State.  Second, the manner by which he achieved that distinction. His callous directive to one of his backbenchers, Deputy Callely, who, compared to the Minister, is a mere fledgeling in terms of parliamentary experience having only served 11 months in the House.  That hapless young man was ill-equipped to cope with the demands placed on him by the Minister whose only concern was self-preservation. The closing of ranks and the display of comradeship which was in evidence in the House last night, and again tonight did not extend to Deputy Callely on that occasion.  Will Minister Collins not agree &mdash; I appreciate that he is on State business outside the country &mdash; that this was a flagrant breach of parliamentary procedures about which he claims to be concerned?  I hope that Deputy Callely will recover from the setback and that he will never again be subjected to the kind of abuse visited on him following last Thursday's débacle in this House.</P>
    <P>Parliamentary democracy, having reached its nadir in this House by the actions of Minister Burke, has the resilience to recover from the mauling which it received at the hands of the Minister in whom we are now expressing our lack of confidence in his ability to perform the task entrusted to him in the name of the <Col N="2340" /> people.  The problem which now confronts the House has it origins in a speech made by Minister Burke in response to a Private Members' motion tabled by Deputy Jim Mitchell on 29 May last.  In that speech he rejected out of hand the idea of a broadcasting review body which was the central point in the motion.  He then proceeded to explain to the House how he intended to dismember RTE and scant reference was made to any other section of the motion.</P>
    <P>Minister Burke ensured that RTE did not die intestate.  The Independent Radio and Television Commission were to be the executors of the RTE estate and Century Radio were to be the main beneficiaries.  Since then, the Minister has changed his mind on the apportionment of the estate with the approval of his Coalition partners.  At this stage it would be honourable to withdraw this ill-conceived legislation.</P>
    <P>During the ongoing debate on broadcasting, there have been continual references to the monopoly enjoyed by RTE and several speakers on the Government side referred to it tonight.  Has anyone in this House ever asked why they have a monopoly?  The answer is very simple; the monopoly arose from the fact that we would not have had a radio service for over 60 years if the State had not become involved.  As usual, the private sector dragged its heels as it did in the case of the ESB, CIE, Bord na Móna, Telecom Éireann and An Post.  Now that we have a State sector firm which can be efficient and profitable the Minister feels he has a right to intervene and disburse these profits among his friends without any dividend or payment going to the taxpayer who provided the service in the first instance.  This is misappropriation of a State asset and an abuse of power by Minister Burke.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the effect of RTE on the print media sector, indeed, I am beginning to think that Deputy O'Donoghue has a vested interest in the <i>Irish Press.</i>  It is claimed that dual funding from licence fees and advertising is giving an unfair advantage to RTE.  This is a spurious argument, as newspapers also <Col N="2341" /> enjoy dual funding from sales and advertising and, unlike RTE, do not have restrictions on the amount of advertising in any particuar issue.  If there is a demand for increased advertising space, newspapers are free to publish a supplement.</P>
    <P>The Century experience has proved beyond doubt that there is not sufficient business to maintain a third national radio station.  This now poses the question of the wisdom of the introduction of a third TV channel.  The Minister should make a statement in this House spelling out his intentions for the future of Network 2 because I fear that they could be faced with the same threat facing 2FM in radio.  I do not agree with other Members that the option now is for TV3.  I believe the Minister intends to suppress and cannibalise Network 2 and hand it over to the private sector.</P>

      <P>In the few minutes available to me, I wish to make a number of points specifically in relation to the Tánaiste's remarks last night and echoed by the Minister this evening in relation to the accusation that we had behaved in an hysterical manner and that this is all about smear tactics and a smear campaign. The Tánaiste, in particular, appears to have a very short memory in relation to contributions made in this House down through the years by very senior members of the Fianna Fáil Party. I stand over everything I said last night because my remarks were within the rules of parliamentary debate.  The motion of no confidence in the Minister for Communications and Justice was not put down lightly, it was tabled on very justifiable grounds.  It relates to his performance &mdash; or lack of it &mdash; in his portfolios in the recent past and over the last number of years.  It relates to the conduct of his public office which must be distinguished from his personal and private life and there was no reference to the latter.  They are different and must be kept separate. It is very important that they are kept separate at all times within parliamentary democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2342" /> The matters to which I referred last night concerned public policy and interest, in which the public take a great interest.  Three senior Ministers, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Justice and Communications have failed miserably to either reject or deny the charges which I levelled in this House last night.  I can only arrive at one conclusion &mdash; either the charges are rejected or they stand. The charges I made last night stand in this House and will stand in future.</P>
    <P>We will be pursuing three areas, to which I referred last night, in the coming months and they are all directly within the area of responsibility of the Minister for Justice.  His colleague, Minister Flynn, did not demur when the charge was made by Deputy Quinn in this House in relation to fraud and corruption in the planning process in County Dublin.  That area must be pursued in the public interest.  There is also the question of the Government settling a case which they were defending for millions of pounds. The Government's case was that fraudulent practices were being engaged in by an exporting company yet the Government settled with millions of pounds of taxpayers' money.  That matter must be clarified to the satisfaction of the public.</P>
    <P>There is also the continuing scandal and failure of the investigation into the merchant banking scandal, despite prosecutions outside the jurisdiction.  Despite fraudulent banking practices nothing has been done and all these areas relate to the portfolio held by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister's conduct prior to last Thursday in relation to broadcasting has been quite amazing, if not farcical.  In the first instance he intended to issue the licences himself but he could not do so because he did not have a majority in the House and he had to change his mind. On changing his mind, it was to be self-financing, it would support itself in the free market.  However, the Minister was wrong and he had to come to this House looking for money because it was a failure. The Minister's presentation in relation to MMDS was colourful in the <Col N="2343" /> first instance but he has now had to reverse that presentation.</P>
    <P>In relation to Telefís na Gaeltachta, promised by Fianna Fáil &mdash; and perhaps one of the last opportunities to preserve the language &mdash; the Minister, by his actions in relation to the Broadcasting Bill, has now ensured that Fianna Fáil, despite their lip-service over the years to the language and to the Gaeltacht, are putting the final nail in the coffin of any aspiration to preserve the language for a small section of the community.</P>
    <P>The Broadcasting Bill, as framed, is the death knell of any aspiration the country has to preserving the language. The opportunity the Minister got in Private Members' time to announce his attack on RTE was grasped by him.  It was said by many speakers in this debate that the Minister, on his very first night of appointment to Communications, told RTE that he would get them in due course.  The Minister did not deny the accusation and in the absence of such an denial it must stand.  We can take it that the Minister informed senior officials in RTE that the first chance he had he would get RTE and he has pursued that course ever since.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach assured us that the House would have a full opportunity to debate the Broadcasting Bill.  When I refer to the Broadcasting Bill I am talking about the original Bill, not the one on which the Minister spoke last week, which we have not yet seen, which is quite an unusual procedure in this House. The Taoiseach assured us on the Order of Business on two days that we would have a full debate on the then Government policy.  However, it became tangled in an unholy mess over the weekend and the Progressive Democrats in the House &mdash; where they are seldom seen &mdash; and outside the House, where they are more prominent, decided that they were not happy because &ldquo;the Minister had cut corners&rdquo; as the Minister for Industry and Commerce said.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile the Minister for Industry and Commerece &mdash; in the course of negotiations which took place by way of passing meetings in corridors &mdash; made <Col N="2344" /> concessions.  There are questions to be answered &mdash; and it is regrettable they were not answered in the course of this debate &mdash; as to the role or the non-role played by the Progressive Democrats in this whole farce.</P>
    <P>Why has the Minister for Industry and Commerce refused to publish the report of the Fair Trade Commission in relation to the transfer of shares to Cablelink about which he made a big song and dance some six months ago?  At that time he was intervening to stop the sale of Cablelink shares.  He referred the matter to the Fair Trade Commission.  From my inquiry in the Library this afternoon I learn he is now keeping that report confidential. He has the knowledge; he has the reservations; the rest of us are to be denied that knowledge.  I call on the Minister for Industry and Commerce to publish the report of the Fair Trade Commission. Let us see what they recommended; let us see what reservations they have about the sale of Cablelink which is &mdash; whether or not it is denied in this House &mdash; the teeing-up of Telecom Éireann for a privatisation launch.  Given that the Minister for Communications said two years ago, in 1988, that Century Radio would be standing on their own two feet and since he will not even deny that a privatisation launch has been set up, it would not surprise me were he back in this House within a year or two &mdash; if he is still in office &mdash; launching the privatisation of Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>Indeed in relation to the conduct of the Progressive Democrats in this whole debate perhaps it is time for them to pack up their tents and leave.  Either they will participate in Government or they will not; they will either conduct their business behind Cabinet doors, with collective responsibility, or they will not. Perhaps that is too much to expect from a party founded on an off-the-cuff remark on the part of their Leader, the Minister for Industry and Commerce &mdash;&ldquo;up the Republic&rdquo;.  Now it is very much: &ldquo;down with the Progressive Democrats&rdquo; because they are not participating either in this House or in Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2345" /> The Minister himself said he was prepared to put his record in office, in ministerial portfolios, before the people.  If there was a procedure under which the people of Ireland could vote tomorrow <Col N="2346" /> on the Minister's attempted bailing out of Century Radio then the taxpayers would vote no confidence in the Minister.</P>

On Report Stage we cannot have an exchnage of views but I would like to ask the Minister about the register and if it is his intention that on the register of proprietors there would be a reference as to whom the person in charge might be; how interchangeable that is; the regulations that will apply in relation to it.

      <P>In page 7, line 41, to delete &ldquo;the District Court&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;The Minister for Health&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes that the Minister for Health as opposed to the District Court would deal with appeals.  We discussed this matter at some length last week and I would like to ask the Minister if he has given any further consideration to bringing uniformity into the code of appeals by giving the Minister for Health this role.  People concerned are not used to appearing in court, which involves expense, delays and uncertainty, and I would ask the Minister to reconsider this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated on Committee Stage, this role is more appropriate to the District Court.  The fact that it is the District Court that would be involved would ensure that the health boards would be particularly objective in reaching their decision because they certainly would not want to go into the District Court to fight a case unless it was absolutely necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>

      <P>In page 8, line 13, after &ldquo;notification&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;the nursing home shall be treated as if the decision had not been made and, if the decision was to refuse an application under paragraph (a) of section 4 (12) for registration, be treated as if it had been registered and the registration had attached to it any conditions attached to the relevant registration that had ceased by virtue of subparagraph (i) of the said paragraph (a),&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a drafting change to clarify the position of a nursing home which a health board has decided not to register or reregister and which does not lodge an appeal against the decision.  Under this section a health board will be able to specify a phasing out period in which alternative arrangements can be made for the patients.  A health board cannot specify a date that is less than 21 days from the date of decision, as this is the time allowed to a nursing home owner to lodge an appeal.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2351" /> In page 8, line 41, after &ldquo;homes.&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;The Minister may consult with relevant caring and professional organisations in the preparation of these regulations.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister said last week that this amendment is unnecessary.  While that may be the case now by virtue of the fact that there has been consultation on the present regulations, I would like to copperfasten the legislation so that in the future if there is a major change in the regulations, which would not have to come before this House, there be an opportunity for consultation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I put down a similar amendment on Committee Stage and the Minister's reasoning then was that the regulations already had been drawn up and that extensive views were sought in the drafting of the regulations.  Perhaps the regulations will stand the test of time and will never need to be amended but this is a safeguard that I would support. It is a very desirable objective that all concerned would be consulted and have their views taken into account and it is important that that principle be enshrined in the legislation, even if it was never to be used.  As the principle already has been accepted by the Minister and indeed used in the drawing up of the draft regulations which will become operable once this Bill is passed, I do not see why the Minister would not accept the amendment proposed by Deputy Yates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>While I have sympathy with Deputy Yates's amendment, it is rather meaningless because it uses the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  With respect to Deputy Yates, it could hardly be maintained that the Minister would not consult with relevant, caring and professional organisations.  In other words, if this amendment is not adopted and if the Minister decided &mdash; I hope he will do so to consult with the relevant caring and professional organisations before making the regulations, I do not think <Col N="2352" /> anyone could come along afterwards and say he is not empowered by the Bill to consult.  If the amendment is to have any force, the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; would have to be used instead of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier in the debate this evening the Minister quoted from the Irish Private Nursing Homes Association and referred to the fact that consultation had taken place.  The amendment is reasonable and I support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>On this occasion and indeed on the occasion of the 1985 regulations a number of organisations, including the health boards, the Irish Private Nursing Homes Association, the Irish Nurses Organisation and the Conference of Major Religious Superiors, were consulted and their views were taken into account in finalising the draft regulations. As Deputy Garland has pointed out, if the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is inserted it would not commit the Minister of the day to consult. It just says he may do that.  In the past, Ministers have always consulted and I am satisfied that they will continue to do so.  After all, this is non-contentious legislation in which we want to do the very best we can for the people in nursing homes.  I am satisfied that Ministers will consult with the appropriate organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister cannot give a commitment in relation to future Ministers because he will have no control over the situation.  In order to safeguard the interests of these relevant organisations who feel vulnerable in relation to changing regulations, the question should be put.</P>
      <P>Question &ldquo;That the amendment be made&rdquo;, put and declared lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 46 and 47, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2353" />&ldquo;(b) prescribe requirements as to the maximum fees which may be charged for the care of dependent persons while being maintained in a nursing home,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Having considered the matter very carefully and following a lot of consultation, I thought it necessary to resubmit this amendment. On the last occasion I made reference to sections 26 and 54 of the Health Act, 1970.  If that is to be the criterion by which the provision is made then it is very vague.  Section 26 (1) states:</P>
    <P>A health board may, in accordance with conditions (which may include provision for superannuation) as may be specified by the Minister, make and carry out an arrangement with a person or body to provide services under the Health Acts, 1947 to 1970, for persons eligible for such services.</P>
    <P>Indeed, section 54 does not clarify the position to any greater extent.  It states:</P>
    <P>A person entitled to avail himself of in-patient services under section 52 or the parent of a child entitled to allow the child to avail himself of such services may if the person or parent so desires, instead of accepting services made available by the health board, arrange for the like services being provided for the person or the child in any hospital or home approved of by the Minister for the purposes of this section, and where a person or parent so arranges, the health board shall, in accordance with regulations made by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, make in respect of the services so provided the prescribed payment.</P>
    <P>At present the subvention varies in my constituency of Cork.  I am aware that the Minister has in his possession representations from the public relations officer for the Cork Association of Nursing Homes.  He has written because of the fact that there was a difference in the <Col N="2354" /> amounts paid to institutions providing a service in the Cork area.  Unless the subvention is stated clearly as to what the maximum fees might be there could well be a situation where the standard of service being provided would be lower.  At present there is much concern regarding the inadequate subvention and that that would result in homes lowering standards. The current level of subvention ranges between £45 and £54 per week. The State pension brings the average elderly person's income up to £95 per week and the families must pay the difference. On the last occasion I emphasised very strongly that families cannot afford to pay.  Following the enactment of this legislation private nursing homes will be providing for people with full eligibility. It is desirable and it is imperative that the fees being laid down should be prescribed in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment in the name of Deputy Sherlock.  It impinges on a crucial aspect of the Bill which is the only aspect that will remain unsatisfactory once this Bill passes through Report Stage &mdash; that is the whole area of support for people in nursing homes.  We will deal with that specifically when we reach section 7 but, unfortunately, any effort we make to provide adequately for dependent people will, no doubt, be ruled out of order, as happened on Committee Stage on the basis that our Amendments would constitute a charge on the State.  At least, the amendment before us allows us in a circuitous way to comment on this issue, which will be the core of the Bill.  There is no use having first rate, grade one quality nursing homes that simply are not available to people who need them because of finances. The amendment envisages that it would be possible under the regulations to prescribe requirements regarding the maximum fees which may be charged for the care of dependent persons.  That would allow some control over the operation of nursing homes as commercial <Col N="2355" /> undertakings.  If I recall correctly, the Minister's attitude on Committee Stage was that there should not be public interference with what is a commercial activity.  This type of commercial activity dovetails so critically into the overall care provision of the State that fundamentally the State and, indeed, the Minister for Health has a responsibility to provide for the care of elderly people whether they are in nursing homes, boarded out or in geriatric hospitals or wherever.  I do not think the Minister can simply abandon any group even if they are not under the direct care of the State.  The whole reasoning behind this Bill is to provide an adequate framework in terms of quality for the private sector nursing homes. We should examine the fees aspect as well so that the private sector cannot overcharge for private care and that the State would have some direct role in determining what is fair and reasonable in this regard.  For those reasons I hope the Minister will consider favourably the amendment put forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I profoundly disagree with this amendment and the whole philosophical basis on which it is being put. The fact is that it is adding a layer of bureaucracy and there is enough bureaucracy in this Bill.  It is nonsense. This is an effort at levelling down, not levelling up.  If a nursing home wishes to make a substantial charge to those wealthy people who can afford to pay it, so be it.  I would be totally opposed to this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with Deputy Garland. If someone is in a nursing home for a number of years they can become a captive consumer.  They may have established a dependency on that nursing home.  I would not like to see anybody subjected to over-charging.  At a minimum I would like to see stated in the regulations the possible maximum fee that might be charged.  There should not be elaborate policing mechanisms but <Col N="2356" /> there should be some check and balance on the system so that people would not be ripped off and over-charged.  In those circumstances I support amendment No. 27.</P>

      <P>As I said on Committee Stage, I do not think it would be appropriate to lay down in legislation the fees which a private nursing home may charge.  My own view is that the market is and will be the regulator of nursing home fees.  I do not believe there will be a monopoly.  There will be a number of homes, as there is already in Dublin and throughout the country, in business.  Resolutions such as this could be detrimental to the future of nursing home care.  The position will be monitored in that the health boards will be making a subvention to the nursing homes and will obviously be interested in what they are charging.  That is something that can always be kept under review by way of regulation.  It would not be appropriate to have it enshrined in the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister on this occasion is acting as if the Dáil is deliberating and will enact legislation which has to do with private nursing homes that will cater for people who can afford it. The Minister is wrong in that and will be proved wrong because experience shows that more and more nowadays the health boards have to rely on the availability of beds in private nursing homes.  The question of subvention will be very much part of that and consequently the fees <Col N="2357" /> charged will have a bearing on what subvention is paid.</P>
      <P>Is there any reason the Minister should not agree to prescribe the fees which may be charged for the care of a dependent person for whom accommodation is sought in a private nursing home?  As I have said <i>ad nauseam</i>, the reason there has been an increase in the number of private nursing homes is that during the past four or five years the State has failed to provide an adequate number of beds. Indeed, the number of beds available has been reduced, and drastically reduced in certain areas.  Because of this families have been put under great strain.  We should not forget also that many old people fear what is going to happen to them and are wondering if their families will be able to afford to pay for accommodation for them.  In many cases they will not be able to.  As a result, this fear in the minds of the elderly may send them to an early grave.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that a person with such a fear may be told, having been recommended by a health board geriatrician, that they have to wait for between eight and 12 months before they get a bed.  In the case of a person who needs care and attention above and beyond what can be provided by their own family, the family may have no option but to seek accommodation for them in a private nursing home.  It is both desirable and imperative that the Minister prescribe in the legislation the fees which may be charged, as that is the only way to settle the matter.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(c) prescribe requirements as to the recreational and therapeutic facilities provided in nursing homes,&rdquo;.</P>

I do not think anything more needs to be said on the subject other than that I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 6 is the most important section in the Bill in that it lays down regulations aimed at the protection of the elderly.  However, I feel there is one omission and that is that the section fails to acknowledge that the quality of an elderly person's life depends not only on the quality of the residential care provided but also on the provision of services, such as chiropody and physiotherapy services, dental care and ophthalmic care and so on, by the home or in conjunction with the health board. The arrangements made for elderly people in public beds should be the same as those made for those in private nursing homes who fall under category 1.  There should be an obligation on health boards and private nursing homes to provide such facilities as they greatly improve <Col N="2359" /> the quality of life for the elderly and complement the services already being provided.  We should not insist that the nursing home should have to provide these services on their own but there should be access to these services.  We should not put people into nursing homes and then forget about them.  We must pay attention to the quality of their lives, which depends to a great degree on the provision of these ancillary services.</P>
      <P>What I am suggesting is not all that different from Deputy Sherlock's amendment which relates to therapeutic facilities. Because of this I would have no objection to the inclusion of amendment No. 28.  In relation to the Minister's amendment, I do not think it meets the need for extra services and I would like him to inform us what is the purpose behind the inclusion of the words &ldquo;at the option of such owners&rdquo;.  It would seem that the provision of such services should not be optional for the owners of nursing homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed this matter on Committee Stage.  As Deputy Yates said, we should ensure that the legislation is as comprehensive as possible to protect the interests of old people in private nursing homes.  The Minister has gone a long way towards achieving this but a glaring gap was highlighted on Committee Stage in relation to the therapeutic and health facilities which are required for elderly people.  The Minister may feel that a private nursing home is not a health board institution and therefore they should not be required to provide these vitally important support services for the residents. It needs to be recognised however, that not only should there be requirements as to the quality of food, bedding and open space, there should also be requirements as to ancillary medical support services such as chiropody and ophthalmic care.  People being cared for in private nursing homes should have access to such facilities as of right.  The argument <Col N="2360" /> is a very strong one and I fail to understand why the Minister, who has so generously accepted so many other arguments made by this side of the House on other sections, has not taken this one on board. It is extremely important that he should do so.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage I argued strongly in favour of monitoring the ethos of nursing homes.  There are nursing homes who see the taking in of elderly people as, primarily, a commercial or profit-making enterprise, and the ethos of those nursing homes may not be in keeping with the best interests of the elderly people concerned. Like every other Member of this House, I have met elderly people who find it very difficult to complain.  Some of these can be very miserable and unhappy in a nursing home where the ethos is not pleasant.  If there was regular interaction with a member of a health board, such as a chiropodist, they would have the opportunity to talk and interact with a caring person.  While catering for the medical needs of the person, we would also get an overview of or an insight into the ethos of the nursing home.  This would be of help in ensuring that people do not end up feeling unhappy.  This has happened in the past.  For those reasons and given the strength of feeling on this aspect of care for the elderly expressed on Committee Stage, I strongly support the amendment.</P>

      <P>I have given a great deal of thought to the points raised by the Deputies on Committee Stage, particularly Deputy Yates's point at that time dealing with services such as physiotherapy, chiropody, dental services and ophthalmic services in nursing homes.  I want to meet the Deputies as well as I can on this.  My amendment really covers the issues raised by Deputy Yates and by Deputy Howlin here tonight.  It goes further because it allows the Minister by regulation to specify the health services which must be available to dependent persons in nursing homes.  While I believe <Col N="2361" /> the services Deputy Yates is anxious to see included should be available, if we were to write them into the Bill it might well defeat the purpose of the exercise, that is to ensure that whatever range of services are appropriate to the elderly would be available to them.  I believe this can be included in the regulations and the 1985 regulations.  I commended my predecessor, Deputy Barry Desmond, for the regulations when he was Minister for Health.  They were very comprehensive and they indicated the way all parties in this House wish to go to ensure that we maintain a very high standard and high level of care in nursing homes.  Those regulations and the new regulation already meet the provisions of the amendment in the names of Deputy Sherlock and Deputy Garland.  Those regulations provide that every nursing home shall ensure that facilities are provided for the occupation and recreation of patients.  That really deals with the points raised by Deputy Sherlock and Deputy Garland in regard to recreational facilities. It also deals with the need for appropriate medical care by a medical practitioner of the patient's choice or acceptable to the patient.  Therefore, the therapeutic needs in terms of the medical needs and the other health service needs are catered for in the amendment I have tabled on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>At the option of such owners the health boards may provide the services.  For example, the owner might not be in a position to provide a chiropody service but they would be able, in conjunction with the health board, to have the health board provide such a <Col N="2362" /> service.  That is merely, if a service is to be provided, to ensure that either the nursing home owner or the health board will provide it.  It will be at the option of the owner if they are not in a position for very practical reasons to provide it themselves.</P>
      <P>The terminology in respect of the health boards concerned is &ldquo;specified health services&rdquo;.  The specified health services will be in the regulations and in my view it is a broader terminology than identifying specific services which may well defeat the purpose of what Deputy Yates, Deputy Howlin, Deputy Sherlock, Deputy Garland and myself want to achieve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept what the Minister stated as indicating in any way a serious intention of making such provision. I am sure the Minister will have got a copy of a report on private nursing homes for the elderly in the Bray area which was issued some time last year. That report says that any form of mental or physical therapy seems to be totally lacking in these homes, with patients being reduced to almost vegetable status, and one visiting doctor stated that in many of the homes absolutely no attention is paid to helping the patients pass the day.  More often than not they are left purely to their own devices.  That is the kind of situation we want to correct by including this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred continually on Committee Stage and again on Report Stage to regulations.  Is he saying the regulations he is talking about are statutory instruments arising from the legislation, or does he propose a statutory instrument that gives legal effect to these matters?  His amendment is to insert: &ldquo;require the provision by the registered owners of nursing homes or, at the option of such owners,&rdquo;.  If we are concerned about recreation or the whole range of therapeutic services that might be provided should such a provision be &ldquo;at the option&rdquo;?  There is a definite need to have <Col N="2363" /> a provision as proposed in amendment No. 28.  There must be prescribed requirements of recreational and therapeutic facilities.  I am pressing my amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Regulations are to be set out for the holding and conducting of interviews where the health board have reasonable cause to believe that a person in a home is not receiving proper maintenance or <Col N="2365" /> care.  It is provided that there will be interviews and examinations of dependent persons being maintained in the nursing home.  I am all in favour of a thorough investigation but I do not see why it should extend beyond patient and staff.  There might be other parties who could be vexatious or could have an axe to grind.  These inquiries should be directly related to patients and staff.  The amendment more accurately covers what is there already and is a more concise wording. I would ask the Minister to consider this as a tidying-up of the investigation process.  I hope he will clearly set out a code of practice to be followed by inspectors. I said earlier that there should be a complaints procedure established so that anyone could have a complaint processed and considered.  That was rejected by the Minister but I hope these improvements will be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>A variety of amendments are being taken together.  I am not quite certain about the import of the initial amendment.  I do not find any difficulty in the Minister's drafting regarding the holding of investigations where there is cause for concern that residents are not receiving proper maintenance or care, or proper medical or other treatment.</P>
      <P>My amendment is designed to ensure that residents or staff should have the necessary interviews conducted in private. Representations were made to me on this point by people who deal directly with elderly people in nursing homes. They have expressed the strong view that there are occasions, particularly when complaints are being investigated, when elderly people, who are vulnerable, are intimidated by staff.  It must be specified that any interviews or discussions necessitated by an investigation should take place in private.  That is a reasonable request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Yates refers to interviews of patients and staff.  I would dispute whether &ldquo;patients&rdquo; is the appropriate word.  The <Col N="2366" /> two sections of the Minister's draft are comprehensive.  If there is to be an investigation anybody who is party to the complaint should have the right of audience. If evidence is required to substantiate the complaint it should be heard in private.</P>
    <P>I strongly support Deputy Yates's views regarding the code of practice.  It is important that people who are vulnerable, dependent by definition, should have a clear bill of rights that would be easily vindicated without fear of harassment or intimidation.  We have to be careful to make sure that those fundamental rights and dignities are afforded people in their old age.</P>

He wants the word &ldquo;examinations&rdquo; taken out, which effectively means that a medical officer from the health board would not be in a position to examine a patient or, for example, to see if a person had bed sores.</P>
      <P>Regarding Deputy Howlin's amendment, I do not think it is necessary to put in the word &ldquo;private&rdquo;.  It would be a matter for the inspector, a director of community care, to express the view that he wanted to interview a patient and it would be normal to be given the measure of privacy necessary.  It is inherent in the present position and if necessary it could be written into the regulations or the code of practice.</P>

      <P>In page 9, line 29, after &ldquo;inspection&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;by two officials of the Health Board&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have received a submission from the Irish Private Nursing Homes' Association, which states:</P>
      <P>A clear, consistent and written protocol of inspection is necessary so that Health Boards and Nursing Home Managements are quite clear as to the demands of legislation and the implication of specific infringements.  Providers of such essential services for the elderly require a much clearer understanding of the issues than that which might obtain in relation to pubs, fast food outlets and other leisure facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Basically what is at issue here is the need to have a clearly established legal procedure for investigations and inspections which would be carried out by two health board officials and the establisment of a code of practice so that such investigations and inspections would be carried out uniformly throughout the country. After our debate on Report Stage last week I spoke to some nursing home proprietors who referred to difficutlies they are having with one administrator in a certain health board area.  The people who will be dealing with this legislation at the coalface would like these issues to be set out in clearly established and explicit regulations.  Amendments Nos. 38 and 39 are important in this respect because they propose the clarification of the procedures in cases where there are disputes.  The dictates of justice and fair <Col N="2369" /> administration mean that these points should be included in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

It was felt that two officials would have complementing skills in making a determination and for that reason I support amendment No. 38.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 39 proposes that the Minister should introduce a code of practice for the inspections outlined in this section.  It is important for everybody to know the ground rules so that those who are carrying out the inspection &mdash; the officials of the health board &mdash; will know what is required of them in clear terms and the proprietors of nursing homes will know what is acceptable and what has to be presented.  This will be helpful in implementing the legislation because everyone will be clear on what has to be done, the interests of the residents of nursing homes will be protected and the proprietors of nursing homes will know exactly where they stand.  In addition it will help health board officials, who will not be obstructed in their duties and who will know exactly their rights and obligations.</P>

There may be reasons health boards have different standards.  Perhaps the Minister will comment on this point.</P>

      <P>The draft code of practice dealing with the implementation of this Bill recommends, where possible, that two persons from the health board should carry out inspections.  I believe very strongly that the proposals in amendments Nos. 38 and 39 are best dealt with in the context of the draft code of practice.  We have drawn up a draft code of practice which will be available for circulation next week.  In addition, a small expert group, which includes representatives of the Irish Private Nursing Homes Association, will meet before the end of this month.  I am satisfied that the place to set out how the inspections shall be carried out is in the draft code of practice and not in the Bill at this stage.</P>
      <P>In regard to the point raised by Deputy Garland, I think everybody in the House would agree that we want to ensure that nursing homes maintain the highest standards and that these are uniformly enforced throughout the country.  The code of practice will ensure the uniform application of this legislation.</P>

      <P>It is important that requirements by the health board be made in writing to avoid possible future disputes.  We have all had people come into our clinics to say that they were told certain things by a certain official but when asked if they had anything in writing to back it up they had not, and verbal utterances have no meaning whatsoever.  It is important again to have clarity.  I do not think it would be a major imposition if the Minister were to accept this in the same way as he accepted private interviews in a sensible way.

      <P>I do not propose to accept the amendment because it could cause difficulties in enforcing the nursing home legislation.  For example, the amendment could be construed as meaning that a health board would have to give a nursing home notice of an inspection or that a health board would have to put in writing a request to see staff records, which must be maintained under the regulations.  Such a situation would undermine the value of inspections and I <Col N="2374" /> consider it reasonable that any requirements of the health board following an inspection should be made in writing. Again the issue can be dealt with in the code of practice.  I believe it is important, and I am sure the Members of the House would consider it important, that the inspectors should have the right to visit a nursing home without giving notice in writing of their intention to do so.  I believe that is in the interests of the dependent persons who are in the nursing homes.</P>

      <P>In page 10, line 41, before &ldquo;, the health board&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;which shall be completed within 30 days of receipt of an application&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Because amendments Nos. 49 and 51 are out of order, I would like to give notice that on this amendment I will cover the matters at issue.  I would like the Minister, in his one contribution, to make a clear statement to the House.  We are irreconcilable in our view of the shabby way this amendment, No. 48, has been delayed.  I instanced a case last week where there was a six month delay and talked about my total dissatisfaction with the subvention.  This whole question of subventions needs to be radically improved.  The present situation is arbitrary and confusing.  The Minister is being less than frank here in saying what his intentions are in regard to the subvention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to say specifically how many different grades of subvention he intends to introduce after the passing of this legislation and what he envisages those levels of payment will be. Will there be two, three or four?  Will there be one or two?  What will be the <Col N="2375" /> rate of payment?  I would ask the Minister to be quite explicit because people are depending on these.  The relatives of these people cannot afford to pay the cost of these nursing homes.</P>
    <P>The cost of staying in a nursing home after the passage of this legislation is likely to increase because of the increased standards that will be put in place.  There is an unacceptable delay in the processing of subventions.  People who were certain they were going to receive them find that they did not.  Therefore I will be pressing this amendment No. 48 to a vote.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to seriously review the policy in relation to subventions. Deputies Howlin and Sherlock and I have outlined the situation time and time again.  There have been closures of geriatric and long-stay beds and this means people are depending on nursing homes whether they like it or not.  The geriatric assessment committees are putting people into nursing homes.  There has been no new approved home since 1980. This Bill will resolve that problem.  We have moved from &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to &ldquo;may&rdquo; and I do not accept that means that everyone will get a subvention.  Previously that has not been the case.  I would ask the Minister to at least clarify his understanding of the subvention in terms of the number of grades and the rates of payment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be an inappropriate vehicle but because of the way we work in this House we have to discuss an amendment to deal with what we want to get at, which is section 7, the core of the Bill.  We had a long discussion on it on Committee Stage and, unfortunately, the amendments I put down were out of order.  I did not bother resubmitting them, therefore, because they would be out of order now as they would put a charge on the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The logic of the argument I made at that stage remains as valid tonight as it was last week, when my amendments Nos. 50 and 51 were adjudged to be out of order.  There are two things happening. <Col N="2376" /> There is a mushrooming of private nursing home care, which is not a bad thing in itself.  Unfortunately, the cause of it is a bad thing.  The cause is the systematic withdrawal of State care, the closure of geriatric beds.  It is a positive thing to enact this Bill because it provides a framework of shelter and protection for people in private nursing homes.  What I am dreadfully afraid of, however, is that there would be a category of people who will simply have no provision for their old age.  They will not be able to find a geriatric bed in what used to be the old county home because the pressure on those is too severe, and they will not be able to afford a private nursing home. The Minister knows as well as I do the anguish of individual families and elderly people who literally have nowhere to go and they struggle along in impossible situations in overcrowded families doing tremendous psychological damage to two or three generations of the family at the same time because there is no other option.</P>
    <P>If there were to be 1,001 new private nursing homes established, all of five star quality, if a whole category of people simply cannot afford to get into them, we have done nothing.  This is the flaw in this Bill that I referred to earlier.  This is a flaw because there is a category of people who will be excluded from the provisions of this Bill.  They will not be covered by State provision and they will not be able to afford private nursing homes.  It is imperative that the Minister provide for those not, as he has done in this section, in a half-hearted way where the health board, who are already squeezed for money, have the option of giving a proportion of support to people who are residents in nursing homes.  It is simply not good enough.  It is the crucial failing in this legislation.  We will enact it and it will be great for those people who are in nursing homes but it will do nothing for that whole category of people who are excluded.  I could speak for a long time on this but I will constrain myself to <Col N="2377" /> underscoring this as the most serious flaw in this otherwise excellent legislation. Will the Minister promise to look again, when preparing the regulations and funding for health boards, at the need to make proper provision for people in that category?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree wholeheartedly with what Deputy Howlin said.  The question of the fee and the subvention are inter-related.  I dealt with the question of subvention and I do not propose to say anything more about it but if the Minister is serious about introducing proper legislation governing nursing homes and accommodation there for elderly people, it is inevitable that a regulated subvention should be payable by health boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of disappointment to me that, having been through Second Stage and Committee Stage, Deputy Howlin believes that the increase in the number of nursing homes is due to the withdrawal of geriatric beds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some truth in that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I was surprised to hear that because if one looks at Dublin, where the largest proportion of the population lives, one will see that there has been an increase in the number of nursing homes because of the very good care our people get and the very good health services we have.  Thank God that, because of that, people are living longer. The proportion of elderly people in our community is increasing.  People are living longer and we should recognise that that is the reason we need more places on top of those that are provided by the health boards.  The Government recognise that and allocated an extra £5 million in the budget to provide extra services for the increased number of elderly in our population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to accept the amendment because health boards will be expected to deal with applications for a subvention very promptly.  I am prepared <Col N="2378" /> to include in the code of practice a reasonable time within which boards should carry out assessments, but I am not prepared to put such a time limit in the Bill. There may be very good reasons that an assessment cannot be carried out within one month of the receipt of applications. For example, the family doctor may be on holidays or the patient may have died after the receipt of the application for assessment.  In such instances, if we accepted the amendment, the health board would be required to complete the assessment within 30 days.  We are very anxious to ensure that the investigation of any application is expedited but the correct place to have this enshrined is in the code of practice and not in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates asked me about the subvention and I should like to tell him that it will be targeted at those who need it. In my view, contrary to what Deputy Howlin has said, there is an enlightened approach to applications.  There will be at least three categories, and possibly a fourth.  There will be the mildly disabled, the moderately disabled and those in need of care and attention and, perhaps, an extra category for those with Alzheimers disease.  The thrust of the legislation is to ensure that the resources available are targeted at those in need on the basis of means and, secondly and very importantly, on the degree of care they need.  The subvention will increase according to the degree of care a person needs.</P>

      <P>This is the crunch issue <Col N="2379" /> because quality care nursing homes are out of the reach of many people.  A person's pension is about £50 per week and we are talking about nursing homes that cost £120 plus per week.  If we are serious about making this good quality of care available to people, adequate resources must be made available by the Government. Health boards must be obliged to <Col N="2380" /> provide assistance.  The Minister has had an opportunity to make the discretionary aspect of funding from health boards obligatory but he has not done so.  The State is failing in its obligations and I must press my amendment.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Sale of Cablelink.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>First I should like to <Col N="2387" /> thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me the opportunity to raise this very important issue, which has caused very considerable public debate and disquiet. The decision by the Minister to allow the sale of Cablelink to a company which was not successful at tender raises some very serious issues, particularly for him as Minister.  His change of mind on this issue lays him open to the accusation that was made earlier in the day that it was a trade off by him for a rethink by the Government on the Broadcasting Bill, 1990.</P>
      <P>This decision runs completely counter to everything the Minister for Communications and his party have stood for and indeed their partners in Government claim to have stood for.  They have all consistently campaigned against political interference in the tendering processes. They have also campaigned consistently against the notion that political pressure should be brought to bear on State boards to reverse decisions they have taken. There is an onus on the Minister of State to tell the House whether the advice of the Attorney General has been sought on whether the Government have exposed the taxpayer to a legal claim by Pactel &mdash; as has been indicated in the media.  Their tender was originally accepted by RTE but was overturned in favour of another company.  I ask whether any future tender will be taken seriously by this Government if they are going to overturn the results of the competition entered into in good faith by different parties for the purchase of the company.  This seriously damages our international reputation for propriety in the handling of our commercial affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should now tell the House the compelling reasons why Telecom should be the successful purchaser over the heads of the competition?  If there are genuine public policy reasons I would ask why these were not known at the time the Minister for Communications approved the original tender procedure.  I would like to believe it was just another case of <Col N="2388" /> bungling by the Minister for Communications and nothing more suspicious, but I was far from convinced by his earlier performance this evening when he dealt with this issue.  I believe the Minister has been quite economical with the truth when he said RTE was only engaged in the market testing operation at the time.  It is well known that RTE first tested the market, as he said, but they then appointed a special sub-committee for substantive negotiations with a limited number of companies that had come through the initial testing period. The Minister had made it clear to all those involved that he had no predisposition to Telecom.  As a result, the procedure was gone through by RTE, and the sub-committee selected Pactel as being a significantly better company than the other contender, Telecom Éireann. The RTE Authority endorsed that view. They took the view that Pactel were superior in management; had a greater intention to upgrade the system; offered the possibility of opening new markets to RTE as their partner, and were better for the consumer.  All these points were taken into account when the RTE Authority reached their decision.</P>
    <P>Earlier in the day the Minister for Communications said he did not force the RTE Authority to sell their shareholding to Telecom Éireann &mdash; that may be technially true but I would ask the Minister for Communications if he were here why the RTE Authority took the decision to sell to Pactel and, subsequent to having a meeting with him on 19 July, reversed that decision.  That is the truth of the matter and while the Minister may be technically accurate in saying that he did force them, he certainly brought considerable political pressure to bear.  As I have said, if there were genuine public policy reasons, which the Minister seems to think there are, why Telecom Éireann should be the successful contender, he should have known those at the outset and should have made them conditions of sale when RTE sought tenders.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2389" /> The Minister for Industry and Commerce has always advocated the expansion of competition in all sectors of industry, I believe he is open to the notion of competition in telecommunications. Why does the Minister now believe that the existing telecommunications monopoly should be extended to control of the Cablelink network as well?  Is it not just one protectionism for that monopoly? Everyone knows that the cable network could develop competitive services and give the consumer a choice in certain areas of telecommunication services. I believe it was a pre-emptive move to stifle potential competition in telecommunications in Ireland and I believe the Minister should have taken this into account when he examined the question of whether this represented fair trading in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The truth is that Ireland would gain from a more competitive telecommunications network.  Ireland could develop as a centre for telecommunications services in a free competitive market if we could seize on the major international opportunities for value-added network services.  These are massively growing sectors in Europe.  It is forecast they are growing at the rate of 15 per cent per annum and they will double as a proportion of GNP in about ten years' time.  This is a growth sector, which Ireland could have seized.  Instead of promoting a system which is competitive and having open access, we have gone backwards in this regard.  Telecom Éireann are taking over Cablelink, which offered the potential for alternatives.</P>
    <P>The Minister's conditions attaching to the sale of the company to Telecom are half-hearted recognition by him of the way in which competition is being undermined by his decision.  The Minister has said there will have to be open access on the cable network but that belies the fact that Telecom Éireann have refused to allow open access on their own core network in the telecommunications sector. <Col N="2390" /> He has asked Telecom to invest in this sector, but when RTE examined this issue they plainly recognised that the alternative offer was willing to develop the cable network by an investment of three times the amount Telecom Éireann were willing to invest in it.  The Minister has also required that they be at arms length, which is only a fob to give a feeling there will be competition in the market. Telecom Éireann will be the controlling interest in the cable company and we cannot expect there will be true competition between a company that is 60 per cent controlled by Telecom Éireann and the parent company, Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister's recommendation to go ahead with this sale, subject to these conditions, is a very poor decision and I ask the Minister to say publicly that he will publish the report of the Fair Trade Commission on which this decision was based.  I, like others, went to the Library believing that we would get the opportunity to see what the Fair Trade Commission had said about this decision and that we would be able to judge for ourselves the sense of the Minister's decision.  Apparently this report will not be made available to us and I cannot but think that a bad decision has been taken.  It has been hamfisted from the very start.  There was no proper consideration of the public policy issue at the beginning and now we have a rushed decision on competition law and this House is not going to get proper access to assess the facts.</P>
    <P>What is the position of the ordinary consumer?  What mechanisms will be put in place to protect him from excessive charges by the new super monopoly in the area of telecommunications and cable television?  As far as I can see, there will be none.  As things now stand, Telecom Éireann are unique in that they are exempt from consumer law and are not answerable before the courts for failures to the consumer.  I fear we will have a <Col N="2391" /> non-competitive market with poor services for the consumer and poor forms of redress for him.  I would like to see the full report of the Fair Trade Commission so that the Members of this House can be party to the decisions and assess whether the Government are making a decision which is in the best interests of the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House will be aware, the action by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in relation to Cablelink Limited arises under his functions under the Mergers, Take-Overs and Monopolies (Control) Acts, 1978 and 1987.  This legislation sets out to control take-overs and mergers involving any two or more enterprises, at least one of which carries on business in the State, coming under common control, and where they exceed certain financial thresholds, as defined in the 1978 Act.</P>
      <P>Where a merger or take-over is proposed which falls within the scope of the Acts, notification of the proposal to the Minister for Industry and Commerce is obligatory.  A merger or take-over cannot be concluded until the Minister has stated that he does not propose to prohibit it either absolutely or conditionally, or, in the absence of such a statement, until a period of three months has elapsed from the date of notification, or from the date of receipt of such further information as the Minister may require</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal whereby Bord Telecom Éireann will acquire 60 per cent of the issued share capital of Cablelink Limited with RTE retaining the remaining 40 per cent, was notified under the Mergers, Take-Overs and Monopolies (Control) Acts, 1978 and 1987, on 25 January 1990. Further information was requested on 5 February 1990 and the notifying parties responded on 8 March 1990, with the effect that the three-month timescale for the Minister's consideration of this proposal expired on 7 June 1990.  Under the <Col N="2392" /> Acts, the Minister for Industry and Commerce has discretion, initially, to approve a proposal without further investigation, or to refer it for investigation to the Fair Trade Commission, who are obliged to investigate every proposal referred to them and report to the Minister for Industry and Commerce on their investigation. The commission's report must state their opinion as to whether the proposed merger or take-over would operate against the common good in respect of the critera set out in the Schedule to the Act.  Following the preliminary consideration of the matter, including consulting with the Minister for Communications, the Minister decided on 27 April 1990 to refer the matter to the Fair Trade Commission for investigation in relation to the scheduled criteria to the 1978 Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister received the report of the Fair Trade Commission on 23 May 1990. The commission, following their extensive investigation, came to the conclusion that the only area where concerns under the legislation arose related to competition and the interests of the consumer in the future provision of interactive services. The Minister has power, under the Mergers, Take-Overs and Monopolies (Control) Acts, 1978 and 1987, if he considers that the exigencies of the common good so warrant and after consultation with any other Minister of the Government appearing to him to be concerned, to make an order prohibiting a proposed merger or take-over either absolutely or except on conditions specified in the order.  After very careful consideration of the Fair Trade Commission's report, the Minister decided that the exigencies of the common good did not warrant the making of such an order.  The Minister sought and received written undertakings from Telecom Éireann which, he is satisfied, adequately meet the concerns identified by the commission.  The Minister also sought and received an assurance that Cablelink would be operated at arm's length from Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2393" /> The undertakings given by Telecom Éireann were as follows: that Cablelink Limited will be operated at arm's length from Telecom Éireann, that Cablelink management will continue to be separate from Telecom management and that Telecom's involvement and reporting relationship will only be through their representation on the Cablelink board; that Telecom's general approach will be to support whatever optimum level of investment is needed to underpin Cablelink's future development and viability, particular regard being had to the interests of its customers.  In this context, Telecom will support a higher level of investment than currently committed in the upgrading of the Cablelink network, <Col N="2394" /> including the provision of interactive text services, should further detailed review by the board and management of Cablelink confirm this to be commercially viable; that Telecom will support the provision of access on a fair and non-discriminatory basis to the Cablelink network for the purpose of providing any interactive text services by independent third parties licensed by the Minister for Communications.  The Minister is satisfied that these assurances represent the optimum solution in the interests of the common good.  It has never been the practice to make publicly available, in the context of deliberations of this kind, reports of the Fair Trade Commission.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.45 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 14 June 1990.</P>

      <P>Air Corps Dauphin helicopters have been conducting operational training missions from the deck of <i>LE Eithne</i> on an ongoing basis since October 1986. However, since the Dauphins were acquired it has been necessary to concentrate on training helicopter crews so as to attain the highest possible level of skill and expertise in search and rescue operations in the Atlantic night environment. Because of this requirement, it <Col N="2230" /> has not yet been possible to locate a Dauphin on <i>LE Eithne</i> on a permanent basis.</P>

      <P>In general, a person becomes entitled to child benefit in respect of a qualified child from the month following the child's birth.  Where a claim is not made within three months of the child's birth, regulations provide that the benefit can only be awarded from the month after the date of receipt of the claim.  This is to ensure that claims are submitted promptly.  However, where there are special circumstances for the delay in submitting a claim, consideration is given to awarding the benefit from the earlier date.  No explanation has been received for the delay from the person concerned. The administration of the system for the registration of births is a matter for the registrar-general and the question of the introduction of a system on the lines mentioned would depend on the development of computerised systems in the general register office which operates under the Department of Health.  This is currently under consideration.</P>

      <P>It is not the practice for Ministers for Justice to make statements to the House about individual Garda operations except in singular instances where the circumstances are so exceptional that such a course is deemed appropriate.</P>
      <P>In this case I consider it right that I should place on record that the implication contained in the question is completely without foundation.  The chief executive officer of St. Michael's House, in fact made a point of writing to the local Garda superintendent to express thanks to the Garda Síochána for their prompt response to all requests for assistance, for their general vigilance and the extra supervision provided and for their support, encouragement and understanding throughout the difficulties which the residents and staff at St. Michael's House had to contend with.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that Garda service which attracted such a tribute from the people concerned should be so misrepresented by the Deputy.  It is a matter for the St. Michael's House authorities to decide what arrangements would best serve the interests of the residents.</P>

      <P>The standard entitlements of prisoners in relation to accommodation and general treatment are set out in the Rules for the Government of Prisons, 1947 to 1983. The standard of cell accommodation provided for prisoners ranges from single cell accommodation to dormitory type accommodation, some details of which are given in the Annual Reports on Prisons and Places of Detention.  The quality of the accommodation provided is continually being upgraded and this year £8 million has been provided for this purpose.</P>
      <P>With the exception of a small number of prisoners, who for security reasons or for their own safety have to be confined in segregated accommodation, all prisoners in closed prisons are unlocked at about 8 a.m. each day and with the exception of meal breaks remain out of their cells until about 8 p.m. which is lock-up time.  More liberal arrangements apply in the open centres.</P>
      <P>All prisoners receive a change of underclothing &mdash; generally twice a week. All prisoners are enabled to wash daily and shower at least once a week.</P>
