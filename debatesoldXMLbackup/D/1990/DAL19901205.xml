    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 69:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1094" /> In page 119, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(3)  A person having been an officer of a company, declared insolvent or wound-up without fully discharging its debts during the previous ten years, shall be required to make application to the court for a certificate of fitness prior to becoming an officer of any other company.  The applicant must satisfy the court that his conduct as a company officer previously does not make him unfit to be concerned in the management of this different company.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;[Deputy Rabbitte.]</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>When my party put down this amendment initially the Bill was very different indeed and, as Deputy Seán Barrett said on the last occasion, it is really very difficult at this stage to pore over amendments as they relate to the previous format of the Bill and the Bill we now have.</P>
      <P>Essentially, the thrust of the amendment is to require that any person who had been an officer of a company which had been declared insolvent or wound up without fully discharging the debts of that company should be required to make an application to the court for a certificate of fitness.  This was designed to tackle the disgraceful syndrome which has been too prevalent in Irish business in recent years where companies which had been wound up or declared insolvent because of manifest negligence or worse on the part of officers, directors or whatever of that company, have been enabled to start up again within a matter of months or a short number of years without any regard to the damage that had been inflicted as a result of their negligent &mdash; or fraudulent stewardship &mdash; of their previous company's affairs, including serious damage to creditors, usually the loss of employment for the workers in the enterprise and so on.  Notwithstanding all that, it is perfectly feasible under the law as it stands for such directors to start up again, even in the same business, with impunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I concede that the Bill has been <Col N="1095" /> changed fairly significantly.  I know that the argument has been advanced by others on Committee Stage that this amendment seeks to make officers of the company &mdash; or presumes &mdash; that officers of the company which went into insolvency are somehow criminally liable.  I accept that but it is not necessarily the case; companies become insolvent for reasons that have nothing to do with fraudulent or criminal conduct on the part of officers of the company, but purely because of trading circumstances. It does not at all presume on my part that, to have been associated with a company which went into insolvency, is somehow to bear criminal responsibility or to be otherwise responsible in any pejorative sense for that company's insolvency. However, the syndrome to which I referred is a phenomenon with which we have been all too familiar and the purpose of this amendment is to require the officer to make an application to the court for a certificate of fitness.  In that circumstance there should not be any question because, in the overwhelming majority of cases where no responsibility rests with the officer, it would simply be an automatic process.  However, in some of the more celebrated cases about which we all know, the court would then have the opportunity to make their decision and the possibility of some of these people slipping through the net &mdash; which still exists &mdash; would not arise.</P>
    <P>I know that the Bill as now reframed imposes a number of &mdash; what the Minister described on Committee Stage &mdash; modest conditions which had not been there previously. The Minister's opinion is that that is sufficient but I continue to hold the view that it is not and that it is still possible for rogue directors, without any regard to the implications of their past transgressions, to get through the net. The only way to get over this is to require them to make application to the court for a certificate of fitness.  In the overwhelming number of cases that process would be automatic but in the kind of situation I outlined, the court would <Col N="1096" /> obviously have the opportunity to make their decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte is correct in saying that the Bill has been improved somewhat in relation to dealing with rogue directors and there is agreement and consensus on all sides of the House that we should no longer tolerate individuals who endeavour to defraud the public by closing down businesses today and opening up others tomorrow.  We should go as far as we possibly can in dealing with that matter but, in a free enterprise society, there will always, unfortunately, be closures on a voluntary or involuntary basis.  Although that is the case the last thing we should do is to discourage people from opening up again because they failed once.  We must separate people like that from what is considerd improper and unacceptable behaviour on the part of individuals who deliberately set out to defraud others or carry out their business in such a reckless manner that they endanger other people's livelihoods.  We should say loudly and clearly that we have no time for that sort of practice and that the law will be further amended, if necessary, to deal with that situation.</P>
      <P>However, we should also make it quite clear that we accept, for bona fide reasons, that people will fail in business but that failure should not be regarded as a stigma on the person for the rest of his life.  Many people have started in business, failed and started again who are very successful today and that is the way commercial life will always continue.  The spirit of that built into our legislation should always be the criterion on which we judge matters.  For that reason I would not support the amendment tabled by Deputy Rabbitte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the thinking behind the amendment in the name of Deputy Rabbitte but I am inclined to agree with Deputy Barrett.  One aspect of the amendment that strikes me is that the term &ldquo;officer&rdquo; is not defined.  Does Deputy Rabbitte intend that the definition of &ldquo;officer&rdquo; which appears elsewhere <Col N="1097" /> in the Bill should cover what he is trying to incorporate into it now, and if so what part of the Bill where &ldquo;officer&rdquo; is referred to does the Deputy wish to incorporate? Does the Deputy wish to have some other definition of officer in this context?  We all know that the term &ldquo;company officer&rdquo; could include people in relatively minor management positions in companies.  It would be horrendous if people in relatively minor positions in companies which through no fault of theirs went into liquidation had to go to the High Court to make an application to become a director of a future company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is defined in section 156. It gives a fairly narrow definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>All right.  Under the Bill as it stands an officer in respect of whom a disqualification order is sought can be disqualified unless he proves to the court that he acted honourably and responsibly. Once the application is made all that has to be established is that the company became insolvent.  The onus then shifts onto the officer to establish that he was honest and acted responsibly.  Otherwise, he would become a restricted person for the purposes of the definition in the legislation.  In view of that it is not necessary to go as far as Deputy Rabbitte is seeking to go, although I can understand the thinking behind his amendment. The Deputy is probably thinking of where a company becomes insolvent and there is not an application by anyone to make an officer of that company a restricted person.  If a company becomes insolvent and an application is made to have an officer of that company restricted, that officer will have to prove he acted honestly and responsibly, otherwise he will be restricted.  It is not necessary to cover what I imagine Deputy Rabbitte had in mind when he drafted his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must control fraud by directors and officers in companies but we must not make it dangerous to become an officer of a company, so that somebody who becomes a director of a company that happens to become insolvent is treated <Col N="1098" /> like some sort of leper who must go to the High Court to become a director of a company at some time in the future. The Deputy's objective is noble and in theory, in debate, we could find arguments in favour of it but with regard to ordinary commercial life, it is not real. Deputy Rabbitte should not press his amendment.</P>
    <P>There are considerable changes and improvements in the Bill in relation to the restriction of company officers and disqualification in the case of fraud.  The proposals before us in that regard represent a considerable and radical innovation and improvement in the law.  Until we see how this works out, it goes far enough as it stands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no hesitation in supporting this amendment.  It strikes a note that is different to anything else in the Bill and it is quite important.  I know that during the progress of the Bill, and in the earlier parts of section 157, the question of disqualification arose where there has been fraud or dishonesty.  That is clear enough and nobody will dispute that, but the question arose as to whether the matter should end there, or should go further.  That is the issue that is raised in Deputy Rabbitte's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am inclined to look at it in this way; the right to have the protection of limited liability is a privilege which is not to be abused or to cause tremendous difficulties for a lot of people, as frequently happens.  It is meant to be there for genuine business and commercial purposes. When a company go into liquidation and do not pay their debts, which happens all the time, there are serious problems and consequences for a lot of <Col N="1099" /> innocent people.  Leaving aside the question of fraud or dishonestly, in the ordinary evolution of business activities when companies go into liquidation members of the public, working people are left in the lurch.  They are owed money by the company which they will not get.  Their money will have gone down the drain.</P>
    <P>Many people lose their livelihoods as a result of a company going into liquidation and not paying their debts.  Employees of companies can be left without substantial amounts of wages by a company going into liquidation.  It is a very serious business and many ordinary people are ruined by it.  One has to look at the position of protecting innocent members of the public.  It is wrong to describe a director who would be affected by this amendment as a leper or anything like that.  It is not a question of leprosy.  It is a question of a person taking the advantage and the privilege of liability and his company ending up in trouble and in liquidation. If that person was the only one affected there would be no problem but a wide spectrum of people in the normal course of events will be affected by an insolvent liquidation.</P>
    <P>A person may come forward even assuming that he was bona fide and honest in the extreme, after a failure which affected a lot of people, many seriously, and want to have another go.  He may admit that he did not get it right the last time, say he was sorry about the people who lost their savings or livelihood and express the hope to do better this time. He may make a go of the business on this occasion.  Are we to say to that person to carry on with impunity and get going again for the couple of hundred pounds it costs to set up a new company.  I do not think we should.</P>
    <P>Some independent body must have a look at the position before giving the licence to this person to get up and, perhaps, wreak the havoc on other innocent members of the public which he or she wreaked on the previous occasion.  The appropriate body to do that would be a <Col N="1100" /> court which would have a look at the position, and at the person, to try to discover if something has changed and whether the second venture has any better prospect of success than the first. If the court considers that things have changed and that there is a prospect that things will be different the individual can be told to go ahead and set up a new business and be a director of it.</P>
    <P>One must remember one salient fact. It is not a question of saying that if such a person may not become a director again without leave of the court that that person is deprived of setting up in business again.  It is not a question of bringing in this amendment and saying that a person who wants to set up in business again will not be able to do so, he will be debarred doing so.  There are ways of setting up in business other than by taking advantage of the device of limited liability.  For example, there is nothing to stop the person setting up in business in his own name.  Many fine people do that and they do not seek the cover and protection which limited liability gives them.  They set up business in their own name and carry on successfully or set up partnerships, or limited partnerships without limited liability.</P>
    <P>The concept of limited liability is to protect oneself against the business going wrong and against personal liability.  The person adverted to in the circumstances contemplated by this amendment will have had a chance and failed.  It is not a question of putting blame on the person but of trying to provide protection for innocent members of the public, people who deal with companies, who supply companies or who work for companies. Their interests have to be considered as well as the interests of the director who sets up, fails once, and wants to set up again and so on.  Do we not have to think about the innocent members of the public and consider what protection they may require?  It is wrong to think of it in terms of attaching blame to a dirctor, blaming him, putting some mark of Cain on him or calling him a leper and so on.</P>
    <P>It is not a question of that but rather of saying if he wants to have a second go <Col N="1101" /> he must justify himself because he has had his chance and failed and as a result people suffered.  If he is given the freedom and impunity to get going again people may suffer again.  He may have learned from the first experience and decided to do an even bigger operation with a wider spectrum of people suffering very badly in their livelihoods or their means.  The amendment is fair enough.  I do not see anything wrong with it.  It is reasonable and fair and, even in the context of the legislation, as amended, it is not inappropriate as a necessary protection for members of the public who deal with companies.</P>

      <P>This amendment is identical to amendment No. 198 which was tabled by the Deputy in the Special Committee and for the reasons which were given then &mdash; and which I will now summarise &mdash; I am not able to accept this amendment.  My biggest problem with this amendment is that it implies that if a person has been involved in an insolvency he is somehow guilty of something since otherwise he would not have to demonstrate his fitness to be a director again. However, I have always been at great pains to stress that we should not regard involvement in an insolvent company as a crime necessitating some form of absolution or restriction.  All we are saying in the Bill is that if a person is involved in an insolvency the court can be requested to make a declaration that any company with which the person subsequently becomes involved should have to meet a number of modest conditions mainly to do with its capitalisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that we have now specifically provided a role for the courts rather than have the automatic restrictions applied to directors of insolvent companies as was originally proposed in the Bill.  However, we have provided in the Bill for the type of cases where the director concerned is guilty of, for example, some kind of improper or dishonest behaviour.  For example, section 149 (2) and (3) which, between them, require the liquidator of an insolvent company to report to the court cases <Col N="1102" /> where he thinks the involvement of a director concerned in any other company might jeopardise the interests of that other company or its creditors.  In such cases we are giving the court a very wide discretion to make whatever order it thinks fit to meet the circumstances of any particular case.</P>
    <P>Section 157 (2) will allow the court to have regard to a person's conduct while a director and will enable the court to make the disqualification order against him when it thinks his conduct makes him unfit to be involved in a company.  I should point out that the court would not have to wait for a specific application to be made to it before being able to consider this.  Subsection (2) clearly allows the court to make a judgment on the matter of its own motion in any proceedings before it.</P>
    <P>To summarise, the Bill as it now stands already contains provisions which will deal adequately with cases where a director of an insolvent company was in some way culpable in connection with the insolvency.  More importantly, however, the Bill does not regard involvement in an insolvency as something implying guilt in itself nor would I want that to be the case.  For these reasons I again reject the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's response.  I said earlier that the section was improved but I should have said also that it was improved from my perspective, because my amendment was carried on Committee Stage. However, the Minister was successful in excising it on the last day.  I am referring to the penalty the court may apply, that it could make a disqualification order as it thought fit and for whatever period it thought fit.  On Committee Stage I was successful in persuading the Special Committee to add, &ldquo;or may require him to carry liability for any outstanding debts to the new company.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1103" /> I saw that as an alternative to disqualification and also an opportunity to tighten up the Bill.</P>
    <P>That was excised the last day when the Minister pleaded that it was merely the lack of diligence on the part of his backbenchers that allowed it through.  There is a necessity, for the reasons which Deputy Taylor and I have outlined, to persist with this amendment.  Deputy O'Dea will accept that the earlier part of his broadside against it in terms of the definition of &ldquo;officer&rdquo; does not stand.  Section 156 defines the term for both this Chapter and Chapter III.  It is restricted to the secretary and director of the company. Section 157 (2) states:</P>
    <P>Where the court is satisfied in any proceedings or as a result of an application under this section....</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Dea pointed out, that presumes there will be proceedings and that the court has the opportunity of making a decision on the basis of an application made to it.  In my experience as a trade union official that facility has not always been provided in court.  There have been circumstances, especially in cases where the workforce were affected as distinct from creditors who would have the financial resources to prosecute an action, where the company collapsed and the workers simply did not have the resources to take a court action.  In those circumstances the remedy suggested in subjection (2) would not apply.  There has been a number of such cases.  I have been involved in a number of cases where I believe it suited the directors to contrive an insolvency and they started up again subsequently.  It suited the overall corporate interest at that time to contrive an insolvency and the workforce were got rid of because they did not have the resources to take any action, even if the law enabled them to do so, which in my view it did not adequately, at the time. Those workers lost their jobs and those directors set up a new company without any regard to the hardship inflicted on the workforce in that circumstance.</P>
    <P>Although I concede that the Bill, as <Col N="1104" /> reconstructed, greatly tightens up that situation &mdash; I hope we see this in practice &mdash; it will permit the rogue director to circumvent its terms in the kind of circumstances I have suggested.  Deputy Taylor has suggested an additional circumstance where the protection of limited liability can be avoided or not availed of and the terms of the Act can be circumvented by the former director setting up in a personal capacity.</P>
    <P>I am not seeking to suggest that because a person was involved with an insolvency he is automatically guilty of an offence.  That is not the purpose of my amendment.  I accept that businesses fail and that sometimes they fail for reasons which have nothing to do with a lack of competence or fraudulent intent on the part of the directors.  I am not suggesting that but the facts of the matter are that businesses also fail for reasons of fraudulent intent, negligence, incompetence, etc.  The only things one can assume about a person associated with an insolvency where the debts have not been discharged is that that person is guilty of having been associated with a failed company.  That in itself is not an offence and in a situation where this amendment requires a person to make application to the court for a certificate of fitness that would be dealt with automatically and routinely.  It will only apply in a situation, like some of the celebrated cases we know of, where directors have, with impunity, shut down a company almost overnight and opened up again without any regard to the damage inflicted on the public, on creditors who were defrauded or on workers who were thrown out of their employment.  When we are revamping company law in the first major way since 1963 we should make it as effective and difficult as possible for such rogue directors to function.  For that reason I should like to persist with my amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 69a:</P>
      <P>In page 121, to delete lines 21 to 38, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;160.  &mdash;(1)  Subsections (2) and (3) apply to any person who acts, in relation to a company, in a manner or capacity which, by virtue of being a person to whom section 148 applies or being subject or deemed to be subject to a disqualification order, he is prohibited from doing.</P>
      <P>(2)  Where any consideration is given by or on behalf of a company for an act done or service performed by a person referred to in subsection (1) while he was acting in a manner or capacity described in that subsection, the company shall be entitled to recover from him, as a simple contract debt in any court or competent jurisdiction, the consideration or an amount representing its value.</P>
      <P>(3)  Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a person referred to in subsection (1) acts, in relation to a company, in a manner or capacity described in that subsection, and</P>
      <P>(b)  the company concerned commences to be wound up&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  while he is acting in such a manner or capacity, or</P>
      <P>(ii)  within 12 months of his so acting, and</P>
      <P>(c)  the company is unable to pay its debts, within the meaning of section 214 of the Principal Act,</P>
      <P>the court may, on the application of the liquidator or any creditor of the company, declare that such person shall be personally liable without any limitation of liability, for all or any part of the debts or other liabilities of the company incurred in the period during which he was acting in such a manner or capacity.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I looked again at section 160 I noted that before an action could be <Col N="1106" /> taken against a person under subsections (1) and (2) the person concerned would have to be convicted of an offence under section 158.  However, such people will already have been declared by the court to be subject to restrictions under section 148 or will have been disqualified under Chapter II.  I would not wish the right to take a civil action in these circumstances to be subject to the successful outcome of criminal proceedings under section 158.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 69a will, accordingly, remove this limitation.  Thus subsection (1) of the amendment provides that subsections (2) and (3) will simply apply where a person acts in a capacity or manner from which he is prohibited either because he has been declared to be subject to the restrictions under section 148 or that he is disqualfied.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 70:</P>
      <P>In page 123, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  The registrar of companies shall keep for public inspection, a register of all officers of companies declared insolvent or wound up without discharging debts during the previous ten years.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1107" /> I want to press this amendment.  As the Ceann Comhairle has already said, this matter has already been discussed and to some extent it is related to amendment No. 69 which, having regard to the configuration of the House, I did not see any point wasting time having a vote on if only the Labour Party and The Workers' Party were supporting it.</P>
    <P>The thrust of this amendment is similar to amendment No. 69.  The remedy may be less drastic, though from the point of view of other colleagues in the House, I am not sure of that, in that all it seeks to do is to cause the registrar to retain for inspection a list of officers of a company associated with insolvency without discharging debts for the period of ten years stipulated.  The term &ldquo;officer&rdquo; is as defined in section 156 as it relates to Chapter III and has a very narrow definition relating only to a company secretary, director or shadow director.  It seems only prudent that if there are proper records in the Companies Office that this information be available to any member of the public or any prospective company who might be considering taking on board former company directors who had been previously associated with an insolvency without discharging indebtedness.</P>
    <P>Elsewhere in the Bill it is anticipated, as I think it reasonably can be, that those directors will be taken on board elsewhere. We have already dealt, in discussing amendment No. 69 with the matter of how, in certain circumstances, rogue directors can get through the net notwithstanding the tightening up we have seen here.  If a list had to be kept by the registrar then any new company doing its business prudently would have the opportunity of inspecting that list and making up its mind on the basis of merely discovering the fact that the person concerned was associated with an insolvency without discharging debts in the past. That may imply no more than adverse trading conditions but if it implies more than that, then the prudent directors of the new company would only have themselves to blame if they took on board a <Col N="1108" /> director who was likely to add to their difficulties in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party will be supporting this important and worthwhile amendment.  Deputy Rabbitte, who moved it, put his case on the basis of knowledge for prospective companies which might want to take on to their board of directors a person who had previously been associated with a company which went into liquidation on grounds of insolvency.  I would put it on an additional basis.  Members of the public might be contemplating dealing with a company which would have on its officer board a person who had been a director of a failed company.  Are members of the public not entitled to have that information readily available so that they would know who they are dealing with?  One could contemplate a situation where a person was about to get involved in some business arrangement or to advance credit to a company and had to decide whether to deal with this company.  The names of the directors reveal nothing as to the business record, creditworthiness and so on of those directors.  If people had recourse to a register to see whether any of these directors had previously been involved in failed companies, causing losses to members of the public, that would help them reach a decision. Members of the public are entitled to such information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would such a register be any different from the register of bankruptcies which is held in the Four Courts and dates back to 1922?  There is nothing wrong with that; it is right and proper.  There is no great difference in this case.  The register would only record the fact that a particular person had been a director of a company which went into liquidation on grounds of insolvency.  When a person who is about to deal with a company discovers this information, it is for him or her to decide what weight or force to attach to that information.  They are entitled to know since it is already a public matter.  If a company goes into liquidation, creditors and employees incur losses and this is a matter of public <Col N="1109" /> record.  It does not necessarily imply dishonesty or fraud but simply records the fact that it happened.</P>
    <P>The amendment seeks for a limited period of only ten years that it should be possible to find out the record of persons one is dealing with, and whether they have an untainted record or a record of failure.  Is there anything wrong in that? I do not see that it would present any great problem to the Companies Office in these days of computerisation.  The Companies Office has been, or is about to be, fully computerised and liquidators are recorded there.  It would be a simple matter to set up a register which would be a tremendous help to individuals and companies in embarking on important transactions.  It would perhaps become routine before entering an important contract to have searches made to see with whom they are about to deal and what their record is.  I cannot see any objection to that.</P>

      <P>There is a fear that we might run away with ourselves here.  I have listened to Deputy Taylor and Deputy Rabbitte talking about people who fail in business and the need for information.  The reality is that we spent months endeavouring to make absolutely certain that people who traded fraudulently or in an improper fashion would be dealt with fairly by the law.  We equally want to ensure that persons who are innocent are kept innocent.  What about a small company which goes into liquidation as a result of a rogue director of another company defrauding them?  Is the director of that small company which is forced into liquidation to have his name plastered around for ten years as if he were some sort of rogue or evil person? Is he to explain his position to everyone who says he was a director of an insolvent company?</P>

      <P>Section 164 of the Bill states:</P>
      <P>Where a court&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  makes a disqualification order;</P>
      <P>(b)  grants or varies relief under section 157 (8); or</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 70 was grouped, for discussion purposes, two weeks ago with Government amendments Nos. 68w and 70a.  The House accepted amendment No. 68w and in principle amendment No. 70a.  Both of these amendments go a long way towards meeting the point made in amendment No. 70.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Barrett's sentiments in this regard.  Nevertheless it should be pointed out that there is a gap in the sense that a person may not be disqualified unless legal proceedings are taken and a person may not be restricted unless an application is made or unless proceedings are instituted which would allow the court of its own volition to apply a restriction.  Amendment No. 70 in the name of Deputy Rabbitte could give rise to a grave injustice. Let us suppose for example that a company go into liquidation and an application is made to have a restriction order imposed on one of the directors; all the applicant need establish is whether the <Col N="1114" /> company went into liquidation.  The onus of proof would then be shifted on to the officer or director to prove that he acted honestly and responsibly.  Let us suppose that he could prove that he acted both honestly and responsibly, would it be right, fair or reasonable that his name should appear on a list for ten years with no information on the list as to whether he established before the court, with the onus of proof on him, that he acted honestly and responsibly?  That is a situation we should not create under our laws.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not convinced by the arguments which have been brought forward, and apart from amendment No. 69, where, admittedly there was a very specific imposition which some people would regard as unreasonable, I cannot appreciate how it is unreasonable to require the registrar of the Companies Office to keep a list for inspection.  Not everyone wanders in off the street to the Companies Office and, notwithstanding what the Minister has said, it is my information that even if someone were to wander in today the records are still hopelessly out of date: I am advised of this by trade union researchers and other people.  As Deputy Taylor said, there could be a very compelling reason why one would need to inspect a list such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barrett said we are running away with ourselves and went on to condemn those who speak about &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo; and &ldquo;extreme centralism&rdquo;.  I do not recall anyone mentioning in this debate either of those dimensions, but why should there be this discrepancy in relation to the ethical standards which should apply to one side of business as compared to the other side?  If I fail to <Col N="1115" /> discharge a debt in respect of my washing machine my name could appear in <i>Stubbs Gazette</i>, even though I might be otherwise a law-abiding citizen.  Why is that matter not a source of outrage?  If I apply for many kinds of employment which are advertised every day in the newspapers, my record will be gone into, references will be required, references will have to be advanced and my prospective employer will go back over that with a fine toothcomb.  If my name accidentally appears in <i>Stubbs Gazette</i> this could cost me the job.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but we have already dealt with a number of instances where that might not arise.  However, where the court has been seized of the matter all it says is that the prescribed officer of the court shall require the registrar of the Companies Office to be furnished with particulars of the order, relief of conviction at such time and in such form and manner as may be prescribed. If the Minister can disabuse me I look forward to hearing from him but it does <Col N="1116" /> not seem to say in what manner or how the Companies Office shall codify that information or whether it will be available for inspection, in the kind of circumstances Deputy Taylor suggests, by somebody contemplating entering into a commecial transaction or who for whatever reason wants to inspect the files to see if the information is there or not.  I also instanced a situation where a new or different company may be seeking to take that director on board.</P>
      <P>Funnily enough, Deputy Barrett ought to mention the term &ldquo;civil rights&rdquo;.  I think he is right, that it is a question of civil rights and civil liberty.  I cannot for the life of me begin to understand why it has been suggested that this stigma should apply to somebody in this set of circumstances. If his involvement in the insolvency is entirely innocent where is the problem?  The facts will bear that out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>If one looks at the Official Report one will see that on Committee Stage the Minister himself rejected absolutely the term &ldquo;blacklist&rdquo;. For example, there are directives from the EC on disclosure of company information which regrettably, because of their parameters, their size and so on, exclude most Irish companies.  This is merely a question of access to information that people considering entering into a commercial transaction might require, or indeed that companies considering taking on board a financial director from a company that had failed before might require.  It seems to me that that would be a major decision if one were about to appoint a financial director, with previous business experience and so on.  If one were to discover his <Col N="1117" /> name was on a list associated with an insolvency, when debts were not discharged, it would be very prudent, in the interests of the workers and creditors of that other company, that he would have an opportunity to check out that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an important question involved here.  I am not happy that the Minister &mdash; who gave an undertaking on Committee Stage to take on board the thrust of this amendment if not its precise <Col N="1118" /> wording, and said he would come back to it &mdash; has adequately answered the case.</P>

      <P>(3)  The registrar shall also remove from the register any particulars in relation to a person on the expiry of five years from the date of the original notification under section 164, or such other period in respect of which the person concerned is deemed to be subject to a disqualification order, unless the registrar has received a further notification in respect of that person under this section.</P>

      <P>In page 125, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>(3)  (a) A receiver shall not sell by private contract a non-cash asset of the requisite value to a person who is, or who, within three years prior to the date of appointment of the receiver, has been, an officer of the company unless he has given at least 14 days' notice of his intention to do so to all creditors of the company who are known to him or who have been intimated to him.</P>
      <P>(b)  In this subsection&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  &ldquo;non-cash asset&rdquo; and &ldquo;requisite value&rdquo; have the meanings assigned to them by section 28 of the Companies Act, 1990, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  &ldquo;officer&rdquo; includes a person connected, within the meaning of section 25 of the Companies Act, 1990, with a director, and a shadow director.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment arises from the Special Committee debate on an amendment tabled by Deputies, Seán Barrett and John Bruton.  What the Deputies were after was that a receiver should not be able to sell company property to any former directors of the company who were &ldquo;disqualified persons&rdquo; under Part VII without the approval of the court. The Minister of State, Deputy Harney, eventually agreed to have the whole area looked at in the context of similar issues which had been raised by the Deputies on Part VI, in relation to management buy-outs from liquidators.  The House will recall that the Minister tabled an <Col N="1121" /> amendment to Part VI to address the problem there, and this amendment is similarly framed.</P>

      <P>I welcome this amendment. It is another attempt to make certain that those who behaved improperly in business should not be able to buy back assets very easily from either the liquidator or the receiver.  It is another attempt to discourage people from fraudulent practices in business.  This is part and parcel of what both Deputy Bruton and I were trying to achieve during Committee Stage.  I welcome the fact that this amendment will not make it more difficult to sell back to the famous rogue directors any assets of the company without proper notice being given.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 70c:</P>
      <P>In page 126, to delete lines 1 to 13, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>170.  &mdash;The Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion after section 320 of the following section&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;320A. &mdash;Where, in contravention of section 319 (1) (b) and section 320, a statement of affairs is not submitted to the receiver as required by those provisions, the court may, on the application of the receiver or any creditor of the company, and notwithstanding the provisions of section 320 (5) (inserted by section 169 of the Companies Act, 1990), make whatever order it thinks fit, including an order compelling compliance with section 319 and section 320&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 169 and 170 in the present text of the Bill address the problem which <Col N="1122" /> often arises in receiverships, where directors fail, or neglect, to comply with the obligation in those sections to provide the receiver with a statement of the company's affairs within 14 days of his appointment.  Although it is also an offence for a receiver to fail to send on this statement to the Registrar of Companies within two months of the appointment, receivers can, in effect, pass on the blame to the directors who did not give them the statement in the first place. The Bill sets out to address this by, first, increasing &mdash; in section 169 &mdash; the penalty for directors who fail to give the receiver the statement of affairs and, second, if the directors fail to prepare the statement, by requiring the receiver to prepare it himself.  While the professional bodies representing receivers objected strongly to this approach, we have maintained the proposals up to now.</P>
    <P>During the Special Committee debate, various alternative approaches were suggested, and it was finally agreed to have the provisions reviewed again before the Report Stage.</P>
    <P>Recognising that the principle aim of section 170 of the Bill is to make sure that statements of affairs are actually prepared, I am proposing, in this amendment, to replace the existing section 170 by one which would give the court the power to force defaulting directors to comply with their obligation to give the receiver the statement.  I think, on reflection, that this will be a better way to ensure the timely production of statements of affairs in receiverships.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  Notice of such proceedings shall be served on the receiver and on the person who appointed him not less than 7 days before the hearing of such proceedings and, in any such proceedings, the receiver and the person <Col N="1123" /> who appointed him may appear and be heard.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputies Barrett and Bruton objected to the wide scope of this section which they felt should at least specify some sample grounds on which a receiver might be removed from office.  The Minister of State, Deputy Harney, maintained however that there was, no need for this, not least that exactly the same provision existed for liquidators since 1963 without apparent problems in section 277 (2) of the 1963 Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State did, however, agree to including a reference in the section somewhat on the lines of section 173 (3) of the Bill and that is what this amendment does.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>As the House will be aware the provisions of Part IX of the Bill were overtaken by events in August this year and the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, effectively enacted the provisions of Part IX of the Schedule.  Part IX is, however, still in the Bill and we now have to do something with that.</P>
      <P>The overall approach I propose to take to this matter is to allow the provisions of the 1990 Act to stand, to delete Part IX in its entirety from the Bill but, at the same time, to avail of this opportunity to make some amendments and adjustments to the 1990 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thus, the first amendment to part IX before the House would delete Part IX of the Bill in its entirety, except the title thereof, and what we would be left with is lines 22 and 23 on page 127, namely, &ldquo;Part IX, Companies Under Court Protection.&rdquo; If the House is agreeable to this approach, the next two amendments would then insert two sections into the &ldquo;space&rdquo; left by the removal of Part IX so <Col N="1124" /> that Part IX of this Bill, when enacted, will finally consist of just those two sections.</P>

      <P>Let me put a query to the Minister on this rather unique legislative situation in which we find ourselves arising from the extraordinary events of last summer.  Was consideration given to incorporating the amendment Act of August this year into this composite Act rather than carrying out the excision that is proposed here?  Is it the considered advice that this is the best way of doing it?  The Government did tell us at the time that in advancing a Companies (Amendment) Bill they were doing so for genuine reasons not pertaining to any particular company, that it was to have general application and so on.  Now we know that it was introduced for a very specific reason, dismembering the substantive Bill we have here.  Would it not have been a tidier arrangement to incorporate it into the main Companies (No. 2) Bill with whatever changes that would require?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the remarks of Deputy Rabbitte.  The position is that this Companies Bill was brought forward as a consolidating comprehensive measure of company law and is very important as such.  In many areas of our legal system we have these scrappy arrangements under which there are a multitude of Acts going back over the years with amendments and insertions and endless complications.  The idea of having, finally, one consolidating comprehensive measure that would have had everything in it up to date for once would have been something very much to be desired from the practical point of view of practitioners, lawyers, accountants and so on.  We now find that we will end up without that, with the August Act in place and perhaps further amended here again with further cross-referencing and so on being necessary.  It is a pity that we could not have incorporated the whole <Col N="1125" /> lot into this one consolidation measure fully up to date so that practitioners could have taken this Act as company law in Ireland as it stands, comprehensive at this time.  Maybe it has to be that way but it is regrettable that we find ourselves in that situation.</P>

      <P>The points made by Deputies Rabbitte and Taylor are quite appropriate to this section but we have decided that it would be more appropriate to bring forward the procedure we are suggesting in this case.  Naturally we have the advice of the parliamentary draftsman and I am quite satisfied that bringing forward amendments is the best method.  I agree with Deputy Taylor that they would have to be read in conjunction with the Act; but it is not a consolidation Act as such.  Deputy Rabbitte may not be aware, so I will remind him, that there are four companies under examination at the moment, not one.  The 1990 Act is being used and will be used not just for one company but for many companies.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 70 (f):</P>
      <P>70f.  In page 146, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>208.  &mdash;(1) The Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, is hereby amended as follows:</P>
      <P>(a)  by the substitution in section 3 (6) for &ldquo;14 days&rdquo; of &ldquo;3 days&rdquo;,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1126" /> (b) by the insertion after section 5 (2) (f) of the following paragraph:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(g)  no order for relief shall be made under section 205 of the Principal Act against the company in respect of complaints as to the conduct of the affairs of the company or the exercise of the powers of the directors prior to the presentation of the petition.&rdquo;,</P>
    <P>(c)  by the deletion in section 8 (3), of &ldquo;, or past director,&rdquo;,</P>
    <P>(d)  by the insertion in section 8 (3), after &ldquo;Act&rdquo;, where it secondly occurs, of &ldquo;and `director' includes any present or past director or any person connected, within the meaning of section 25 of the Companies Act, 1990, with such director, and any present or past shadow director&rdquo;,</P>
    <P>(e)  by the insertion in section 8 of the following subsections:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(5A)  Without prejudice to its power under subsection (5), the court may, after a hearing under that subsection, make any order or direction it thinks fit, including a direction to the person concerned to attend or re-attend before the examiner or produce particular books or documents or answer particular questions put to him by the examiner, or a direction that the person concerned need not produce a particular book or document or answer a particular question put to him by the examiner.</P>
    <P>(5B)  Section 23 (1) of the Companies Act, 1990 shall apply for the purposes of this section.&rdquo;,</P>
    <P>(f)  by the substitution in section 10 (1) of &ldquo;Any&rdquo; for &ldquo;Where an order is made under this Act for the winding-up of the company or a receiver is appointed, any&rdquo;,</P>
    <P>(g)  by the substitution, for section 16 (i), of the following:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1127" />&ldquo;(i)  his opinion as to whether the facts disclosed would warrant further inquiries with a view to proceedings under section 297 or 297A of the Principal Act (inserted by the Companies Act, 1990), or both,&rdquo;,</P>
    <P>(h)  by the insertion in section 23 (5) (b), after &ldquo;Government&rdquo; of &ldquo;, a local authority&rdquo;,</P>
    <P>(i)  by the insertion in section 24 of the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(12)  Notwithstanding subsection (4), or any other provision of this Act, where the examiner forms the opinion that the company will be able to survive as a going concern, nothing in this Act shall prevent the examiner from including, in a report under section 15 or 18, proposals which will not involve the impairment of the interests of members or creditors of the company, nor the court from confirming any such proposals.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>(2)  Section 244A of the Principal Act (inserted by section 123 of the Companies Act, 1990) and section 137 of the Companies Act, 1990, shall apply to a company under the protection of the court as they apply to a company being wound up, and any references in those sections to a liquidator or provisional liquidator shall be construed for the purposes of this subsection as a reference to an examiner.</P>
    <P>(3)  Sections 32, 33, 34 and 35 of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, are hereby repealed.</P>
    <P>The amendment I have tabled would do two things: it would return to certain issues which were raised in the special committee and on which I promised to reflect and it would make certain technical adjustments to the 1990 Act arising solely from the duplication of certain provisions in that Act and in Part VI of this Bill.  If the House bears with me I will go through the various aspects of the <Col N="1128" /> amendment.  It is a long statement but it is necessary to place it on record.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of the amendment proposes to reduce the period, after a receiver has been appointed to a company, within which an application for the appointment of examiner can be made from 14 days to three days.  While the view of the Special Committee was that seven days might be a more appropriate period, the original 14 days period was, in the event, adopted in the 1990 Act.  However, having reflected further on the matter, and listened most carefully to comments in the meantime in the context of the 1990 Act, I am now prepared to go considerably further and the amendment will reduce the period involved to three days. This will give considerable comfort to receivers who will now be much more certain of their position as well as requiring company managements, and their creditors, to make up their minds within a shorter period whether to apply to the court under the 1990 Act.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) addresses a detailed issue which was the subject of a lengthy debate in the Special Committee and has to do with the wording of section 180 (4) of the Bill, now section 5 (4) of the 1990 Act.  Following that debate I agreed to reflect further before Report Stage.  The present position is that by virtue of section 55 of the 1990 Act the shareholder cannot, at any stage, apply to the court for relief under section 205 of the Principal Act in respect of anything that happens while the company is under the protection of the court.  What paragraph (b) does is add a new paragraph to section 5 (2) to the effect that for so long as a company is under protection no action may be taken by shareholders under section 205 in respect of anything done by the directors prior to the appointment of the examiner.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (c) and (d) of the amendment are designed to widen the possible scope of inquiry under section 8 (3) of the 1990 Act and are effectively consequential on amendments accepted by the House to section 10 of the Bill.  They are, therefore, technical adjustments to <Col N="1129" /> the 1990 Act.  The main idea behind the two paragraphs is to ensure that full information can be obtained in relation to bank accounts operated not just by directors but by people connected with them within the meaning of section 25 of the present Bill and by shadow directors who may not be actually connected as the term is defined.</P>
    <P>The first part of paragraph (e) of the amendment would insert a new subsection (5) (a) into section 8 of the 1990 Act and is also identical to an amendment already accepted by the House to section 10 of the Bill.  As in the case of section 10 it addresses the situation where an examiner fails to get information or responses to questions and reports the matter to the court.  The court's only remedy is to treat the matter as one of contempt.  Under section 8 of the 1990 Act the court could not, for example, direct that the person concerned need not produce documents or whatever or direct that the person should answer the questions asked by the examiner.  It would seem important that in addition to contempt the court should have these powers and that is what this amendment provides for.</P>
    <P>The second part of paragraph (e) of the amendment would insert a new subsection (5) (b) into section 8 of the 1990 Act and is designed to protect legally privileged information in the same way as section 23 (i) of the Bill does for investigation under Part II.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (f) addresses a possible gap under section 10 of the 1990 Act.  Section 10 allows the examiner to certify certain liabilities if he thinks the incurring of them is vital for the survival of the company. The most obvious interpretation of section 10 (1) is that liabilities so certified are to be treated as expenses properly incurred for the purposes of section 29 thus giving the creditors concerned a kind of super secured status.  However, it is also possible that such status would only arise where in the words of section 10 (1) an order is made for the winding up of the company or a receiver is appointed. There are however other situations for example, where the court makes some <Col N="1130" /> other order short of winding up or receivership. In these cases the creditors' certified status might not apply leading to at best considerable uncertainty and at worst a refusal by crucial creditors to keep supplying during the protection period.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (f) of the amendment will therefore delete the opening clause of section 10 (1) and make it clear that certified liabilities under that section have absolute security under section 29.  This is identical to the first of the amendments tabled by Deputy Barrett and his amendment is, therefore, unnecessary.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (g) of the amendment as well as subsections (2) and (3) are what I would call tidying up provisions arising from the enactment of the 1990 Act and were foreshadowed by four amendments to Part VI of the Bill which the Minister introduced the last day.  Sections 32 to 35 of the 1990 Act correspond generally to sections 123, 135, 136 and 137 of the present Bill but there is no point in having two parallel sets of provisions so paragraph (b) of the amendment, as well as subsections (2) and (3), will incorporate the necessary adjustments in the Bill arising from the passage of the 1990 Act.  In view of the proposals to delete, among other sections, section 35, the second of the amendments tabled by Deputy Barrett will not now arise.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (h) of the amendment is new and would add local authorities to the definition of &ldquo;State&rdquo; in section 23 (5) (b) of the 1990 Act thus enabling a local authority to agree to a compromise or scheme of arrangements drawn up by an examiner in the same way as the Revenue Commissioners are entitled to.  This is in response to the arguments brought forward in the Special Committee by Deputies Bruton and Barrett in particular. I was present at that meeting of the Special Committee and recall the discussion that took place.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (i) of the amendment addresses an important issue identified in the Special Committee, that is, that the whole system is set up on that basis that a rescue plan will necessarily involve shareholders and creditors accepting less <Col N="1131" /> than their full entitlements.  However, it was pointed out that all a company may need to survive and restore the confidence of its bankers is a change of management. The company may not even be insolvent at the stage we are now talking about.  Indeed, the company may improve their trading performance during the period of protection and may actually be solvent again by the end of that time, although some changes may still need to be made and sanctioned by the court.  I want to make it clear that where the examiner finds that the company are able to continue without the interests of any creditors or members being impaired but which may, for example, involve changes in management, the examiner can so report to the court and the court can confirm such proposals.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that my introduction to this amendment went on at some length but I feel it will be of benefit to the House in considering it.</P>

      <P>I would remind Deputies that we are discussing amendments Nos. 70 (1) and 70 (j) in the name of Deputy Sean Barrett.  Those amendments can be spoken to in conjunction with amendment No. 70 (f).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the most important parts of today's discussion because we have had the opportunity of seeing how this legislation is working. There are obvious difficulties, some of which are being addressed here today.  In relation to the part of the amendment dealing with section 3 (6) I am glad to see that the Minister has reconsidered the point made in the Special Committee.  It seemed inappropriate that a court shall not give a hearing to a petition under section 2 if a receiver stands appointed to the company the subject of the petition and such receiver has stood so appointed for a continuous period of at least 14 days prior to the presentation of the petition&rdquo;. We all felt that was too long a period. Things happen very quickly when a company is put into receivership and I am <Col N="1132" /> pleased that we are now reducing that period from 14 to three days.</P>
      <P>In relation to section 10 of the 1990 Bill, I have put down amendment No. 70 (i).  It became obvious during the course of the Goodman issue that where the Irish banks wanted to fund part of the operation of the business there were difficulties about the examiner being able to guarantee that the sums advanced while the company was in receivership would be treated as expenses.  The section as it stood stated quite clearly that &ldquo;where an order is made under this Act for the winding up of a company or a receiver is appointed, any liabilities incurred by the company during the protection period, referred to in subsection (2), shall be treated as expenses properly incurred, for the purposes of section 29, for the examiner&rdquo;.  That clearly stated that only moneys that had been advanced while the company was in receivership could be guaranteed if the company was subsequently wound up or a receiver appointed.  That appeared to be totally contrary to the whole spirit of the legislation under which an examiner was being appointed so that the company would not be wound up or put into the hands of a receiver.</P>
      <P>One of the main difficulties with the legislation will be the provision of finance to the examiner to enable him to carry on the business during the period in which he is examining the company.  No company can survive without moneys being made available to them.  I tabled the amendment so that section 10 would guarantee that any liabilities incurred by the company during the protection period would be treated as examiner's expenses, provided of course that they are properly incurred.  That would be a vast improvement in the legislation and should make it easier in future for examiners to get funds while the company is under the protection of the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the main areas of concern in this legislation is the fact that when an examiner is appointed the same management remain in place.  Again we can learn a lesson from the Goodman affair. Where an examiner is appointed and the <Col N="1133" /> same management remain in place, this can cause extreme difficulties, particularly for the lending institutions.  I have an amendment down in that regard and we will be dealing with it later.</P>
    <P>The last point I want to make relates to section 35 which the Minister is proposing, in this amendment, to delete.  I am raising this matter because I am not happy with the wording used in section 35.  If we were to agree with the Minister's overall amendment here I do not know whether we could still deal with the point I now wish to raise.  Section 35 (1) refers to where on the application of an examiner of a company it can be shown to the satisfaction of the court that any property of the company of any kind whatsoever was disposed of either by way of conveyance, transfer, mortgage, security, loan or in any way whatsoever whether by act or omission, direct or indirect, and the effect of such disposal was to perpetrate a fraud of the company.  I propose to change the word &ldquo;effect&rdquo; to &ldquo;intent&rdquo;.  I am strongly advised that in all other legislation which includes a similar provision the words used are &ldquo;the intent of such disposal was to perpetrate a fraud&rdquo;.  I do not know how one can say the effect of such disposal was to perpetrate a fraud.  Surely where fraud has been committed there must have been an intent to commit the fraud.  I am asking the Minister if he can facilitate my amendment No. 70j in the overall amendment that he is now proposing.  I would like to hear his reasons why the words &ldquo;the effect of such disposal&rdquo; are used instead of &ldquo;the intent of such disposal&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I hope this legislation, the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, works.  I believe that everything possible should be done to prevent companies going into liquidation.  The legislation has been used in the Goodman case but we will not know how good or bad it is until that whole issue is dealt with.  There are certain glaring weaknesses, one of which relates to who controls the company while the examiner is in place.  I believe there will still be conflict between management and the examiner.  Who will give the money to the examiner to keep the <Col N="1134" /> business running?  The amendment we are proposing to section 10 would improve the Bill but there is always a concern that if we are going to give further moneys to a company who are in difficulty already we might not get our money back.  The real test of any legislation is whether the examiner is able to do the job knowing that, first, he has the wages to pay the staff while he is there; and, secondly, that he has money to purchase goods to keep the business trading. I hope the amendment we are proposing to section 10 will improve that position further.  I will deal with the rest of the matter when we reach amendment No. 70h.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I too hope that the 1990 legislation works.  In the aftermath of the dissolution of Fóir Teoranta it is all the more important that it works.  The Minister for Finance advanced as one of his main reasons over the last year or so for the dissolution of Fóir Teoranta that when the chapter 11 type system was imported to Irish law there would not be any necessity for Fóir Teoranta.  That is one reason, in addition to the reasons which Deputy Barrett advanced, for hoping that the Act works.  However, I am still not satisfied, even at this late stage of our discussions, that the point raised by some business sources in relation to their concern about the whole examiner process has been adequately answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument has been made in some business quarters that the chapter 11 process is not suitable for importation to Irish company law in as much as circumstances in the United States are completely different, namely, that most, if not all, American companies tend to raise their capital on the domestic market whereas, in Ireland, any substantial enterprise, as we have recently seen, would not be able to raise the necessary capital on the domestic money market and would have to raise their money in London or somewhere else.  International financiers, following the enactment of this process, will be more cautious about lending money to major Irish companies <Col N="1135" /> because of the manner in which they can be &ldquo;stayed&rdquo; under the chapter 11 process. I should like the Minister to deal definitively with that point.</P>
    <P>I continue to hold the view that it would have been neater and more desirable to have repealed the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, and incorporate the relevant sections in the consolidating Bill. I look forward to reading in the Official Report a long statement written by the Minister, all of which, I confess, whatever about my colleagues, I could not grasp.  It is interesting that, so shortly after the enactment of the Companies (Amendment) Bill, 1990, we already find it necessary to make some improvements in that situation.  I am not saying that those improvements should not be made, I specifically agree with some of them, for example, the reduction of the days from 14 to three as specified because of what we have seen.  We had the opportunity of watching the process in action and, therefore, we are enabled to come forward with measures which tighten up that process.</P>
    <P>Does it raise questions about other new concepts enshrined in this Bill which we have not had the opportunity to see invoked and in practice?  I should like the Minister to deal with that point.  We watched the situation in the Goodman Group in the full glare of publicity and, so far as I can judge, the measures brought forward here are merited and will improve the process.  However, it is not always that we are in a position, some three or four months after an Act has been passed, to amend it as we are now, purely accidentally, because we extracted that Act from the main Bill at the time.</P>
    <P>I am not sure of the argument in amendment 70j tabled by Deputy Seán Barrett for the deletion of &ldquo;effect&rdquo; and the substitution therefor of &ldquo;intent&rdquo;.  I would have thought that the important thing is the effect of what has been done and, in law, that is much easier to determine than the intent.  I would have thought the legislation is safer with the inclusion of &ldquo;effect&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the broad thrust of the Minister's amendment No. 70f which contains desirable changes, the necessity of which were demonstrated on Committee Stage and, indeed, by some of the events since.</P>
      <P>I particularly welcome paragraph (a) of the amendment where the period for which a receiver can be in existence before a person has to make an application for the appointment of an examiner is reduced from 14 to three days.  The very nature of a receiver's responsibilities, office and duties is to the particular creditor who has him appointed and it would be undesirable if a person in that position continued too long in an atmosphere of uncertainty and doubt. The sort of activities in which a receiver is expected to engage by the person who seeks his appointment means that a long period of receivership, with the possibility of it coming to a sudden end, is a contradiction in terms.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, it is desirable that an examiner can be sent in even though a receiver has been appointed.  If that was not the case it would enable the people who are generally the most powerful creditors of a company, such as a large financial institution which have a fixed charge on the fixed assets of the company, to make a pre-emptive strike to prevent the possibility of an examiner being appointed.  It is a question of balance and the reduction from 14 days to three got the balance right.  I had some misgivings which I expressed at the Special Committee about the length of time for which the receiver would be in office in an atmosphere of doubt and uncertainty but that has now been satisfactorily resolved.  I thank the Minister for bringing forward this amendment.  I also thank the Opposition Deputies who contributed and made that point on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (b) of the Minister's amendment states that no order for relief shall be made under section 205 of the Principal Act against the company in respect of complaints as to their conduct of the affairs of the company or the exercise of the powers of their directors prior to the <Col N="1137" /> presentation of the petition.  Section 205 of the Companies Act, 1963, gives minority shareholders the right to petition the court if they feel that the powers of the directors are being exercised in a manner oppressive to them or in disregard of their interest as members.  It is my recollection that the company is the proper defendant in a section 205 action. I should like the Minister to clarify, when replying, whether a section 205 action can be brought against somebody other than a company.  For instance, can it be brought against named directors?  If so, it would seem that the wording of paragraph (b) of amendment 70f does not achieve the very desirable objective we all want.  However, if the company is the proper and only possible defendant we are achieving the objective.</P>
    <P>The amendment refers to an order for relief being made.  Will the Minister clarify whether proceedings could be instituted under section 205 while an examinership is in progress?  I take Deputy Rabbitte's point about the way capital is raised by Irish companies because of the relatively small size of the economy.  The introduction of this legislation may give rise to foreign financiers being more cautious.  It is more likely than not that it will give rise to greater caution on the part of potential foreign lenders.  However, this is again a question of balance.  We must balance the admitted beneficial effects of this legislation against any possible attitude that other people might adopt.  On balance, we are doing the right thing.</P>
    <P>The potential benefits to the economy from this legislation will outweigh any inhibitions that might arise in the minds of foreign financiers in relation to lending to Irish companies.  Deputy Barrett referred to the testing of legislation.  The best way to test legislation is to see it work.  Grave misgivings were expressed by many people as to whether the part of the legislation dealing with the examiner was workable.  Now we see it working and the indications to date are that it is working quite well.</P>

It will lessen the power of the large financial institutions who tend to send a company to the wall in pursuit of their own selfish interests.  That should be controlled.</P>
      <P>Deputy Taylor referred to consolidation and I agree with him in that regard from the point of view not only of practitioners but of people who will be studying company law for accountancy examinations, law examinations, business studies and so on.  It is desirable to have this in one Act which can be easily referred to but I do not know if there are some technical or legal difficulties about this arising from the fact that cases are being considered by the courts.  With that minor reservation I welcome the amendment.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to strongly consider the possibility of consolidating this legislation. Our laws are complicated and scattered enough without people having to look to three or four different pieces of legislation.  Not only have we a separate Act dealing with the examiner, but that legislation is amended in the legislation which deals with every other aspect of company law.  That will cause difficulties particularly for students.</P>

      <P>Deputy Barrett's interjection referred to the fact that two companies involved in the examiner's procedure have been wound up.  I assume <Col N="1139" /> the Deputy would not regard that as any criticism of the procedure.  One would have to say in all certainty that those companies would have been wound up anyway.  It was never advocated that the new procedures would save every company that got involved in them.  They would save one company or two or 5 per cent of companies, but whatever is saved is profit and must be welcomed and we should be grateful for it.  There is clearly a need for this type of procedure.  It is regrettable that we did not have this years ago and perhaps more jobs would have been preserved.  We were very slow in bringing in this procedure as we are slow in bringing in innovative procedures.  This has an important role and such procedures have played an important role in other countries.</P>
      <P>I have some concern about the way we have gone about the whole issue.  The kind of legislative procedures that we have been involved in on this issue starting with the 1990 Act and then this pseudo consolidation measure incorporating amendments to the earlier Act of this year, at best can be described as clumsy, inept legislation which is totally unsatisfactory.  What we are doing in this amendment, and Deputy Rabbitte commented on the length and complexity of the Minister's introductory speech, is introducing what ought to be an amending Bill in itself.  We are presented with this amending legislation after a very short period, without having the facility of a Committee Stage to deal with these amendments which really warranted a Committee Stage in themselves because of their degree of complexity.  To deal with this in this Bill as a single Report Stage amendment is not a proper and effective way in which to legislate.  For that alone some criticism can be fairly levelled at the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation has been in operation for a very short period.  It is too soon to set about amending it at this stage.  Some may be important and desirable and I have no objection to any of them in particular, but it would have been more satisfactory <Col N="1140" /> to allow the 1990 Act run for a while before assessing it and bringing in an amending Bill to bring it up to date and to deal with any gaps that might show.  I have no doubt that within the next six months or a year further difficulties and deficiencies will arise in the 1990 Act which will require further attention and we will be adding to this piecemeal scrap-heap arrangement of building up a body of law on a new subject instead of having it cleanly incorporated in one consolidation measure.  That is the main thing that troubles me about this.</P>
    <P>The examiner procedure will not cause undue difficulty for Irish companies when it comes to trading abroad or raising loans.  When foreign companies want to do business with Irish companies, they will do it in their own interests.  It could even be argued that foreign companies might look favourably on the fact that there was such a procedure in place because, as Deputy O'Dea rightly pointed out, all too often one finds one greedy predator company, mindful only of its own position, paying no regard to the broader spectrum of need of the company or the good the company is doing, or its potential to manufacture, to preserve jobs and so on.  Such a company will go into liquidation or receivership for its own selfish ends.  The examiner procedure raises the possibility of defusing any such attempt.  Many companies dealing with Irish firms would look with favour on the fact that the procedure was there. It may bring about a fair result in the broad spectrum of creditors and people dealing with companies.  I would not be too concerned about it.  It is a long overdue and welcome provision.</P>
    <P>The reason I say we may be a little premature in tabling amendments at this very early stage to the 1990 Act is that we see already in regard to the Goodman Group some difficulties arising in connection with arriving at an agreed plan to preserve the company.  There are threats by one or two of the minor banks, who are involved to a relatively insignificant extent in the overall picture, to throw a spanner in the works, cause great difficulties and, perhaps, put the company <Col N="1141" /> in a prejudiced position.  It may well prove to be necessary to do something about that in amending legislation.  It is too soon to say but it is certainly a matter that will have to be looked at.  We should not allow a small minority interest to cause chaos, disruption, dissolution or liquidation of an important Irish company for their own selfish reasons or to use what muscle they have, as a small player in the game, to put the company off its correct path of reinstatement to fulfil an important role in the country.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions.  Regarding Deputy Barrett's point in relation to amendment No. 70j, he has rightly pointed out the difference between the effect of a fraud and intent to defraud.  However, the intent is not the overriding consideration here.  After all fraud is fraud. Section 35 of the 1990 Act proposed that where a fraud was proved in any case it was irrelevant whether it was intended.  With any new legislation there will inevitably be a settling in period while the new procedures are tried and tested. I take the view that we are lucky to have this opportunity to make some adjustments to the 1990 Act.  This is a unique opportunity and it is right that we should avail of it to make amendments to the 1990 Act.  I make no apologies to Deputy Taylor in connection with this issue because it was raised in the Special Committee, as Deputy Barrett has pointed out.  We had a very detailed examination of all aspects of this section. Since we debated the earlier Bill at the special sitting during the summer recess, we have had an opportunity of assessing the situation.  I am pleased we have the opportunity now to bring forward the amendments which I hope will improve the 1990 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been pointed out by Deputy O'Dea that there may be a need for consolidation of the Acts involved.  He said there may be a difficulty for students of company law in relation to the intricacies of joining together the 1990 Act and the Bill we are debating today.  I am <Col N="1142" /> sure eminent lecturers, such as Deputy O'Dea, will relish the opportunity to provide all the detailed information which is readily available to him to his students.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, before the Minister leaves that will he tell us &mdash; because everybody in the House is interested in this &mdash; why he is satisfied that this is the best way of dealing with the 1990 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the reasons. I am also satisfied with the response I have received.  The parliamentary draftsman, and our legal advisers, have indicated that the procedure we are adopting is the best method.  There is no ulterior motive in adopting this procedure as opposed to the procedure suggested by Deputies Rabbitte and Taylor. Their suggestion to incorporate the 1990 Act into this Bill was considered but that would have involved difficulties.  The 1990 Act is now in place and there is no uncertainty about it.  We are amending sections of the 1990 Act which, hopefully, when it goes through the Seanad and becomes law, will be read in conjunction with the Bill we are discussing.  On the advice of the parliamentary draftsman and the legal advisers the procedure we have adopted is the correct procedure.  I hope that will satisfy Deputies Rabbitte and Taylor.  The 1990 Act is in place.  It has been passed by the Legislature, <Col N="1143" /> signed by the President, and has been acted on already.  We have amendments to incorporate in it and this is the appropriate way to proceed.</P>
      <P>Regarding the point made by Deputy O'Dea in relation to section 205 of the 1963 Act, our understanding is that the defendant in such an action is not necessarily limited to the company concerned although that would usually be the case. Under that section there is the possibility that someone could take an action directly against an individual.  In relation to other points raised by Deputy O'Dea, section 53 of the 1990 Act would prevent any proceedings being taken except by leave of the court.  Another point raised by Deputy O'Dea and Deputy Taylor concerned the consolidation of the Acts to which I have referred already.  It would be convenient if we were in a position to do that.  I hope that is something that can be done in the long term but, at this stage, we are satisfied we are adopting the proper procedure.</P>

      <P>I do not see how it would make any grave difference to legislation if the word &ldquo;effect&rdquo; was substituted for by the word &ldquo;intent&rdquo;.  If somebody intends to commit fraud that can be proved but if it has to be proved that the effect of something has led to fraud it will also have to be proved that the intent was there.  I would bow to Deputy Taylor as a lawyer to guide me on this point but I am advised that it is unusual to use in legislation the wording &ldquo;the effect of such disposal was to perpetrate fraud&rdquo;.  I have been strongly advised that the proper wording should be &ldquo;the intent of such disposal was to perpetrate fraud&rdquo;.  I understand that is the wording used in most legislation.</P>

      <P>The explanatory note to section 35 of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, refers to the power of the court to order the return of assets which have been improperly transferred. We are not talking about imposing a fine on anyone.  The Bill deals with whether the effect of such disposal was to perpetrate a fraud on the company, its creditors or members.  Therefore, the assets <Col N="1145" /> would have to be returned to the person involved.</P>
      <P>We can argue about the wording but the concerns referred to by Deputy Barrett are covered by the term &ldquo;the effect of such disposal was to perpetrate a fraud on the company, its creditors or members&rdquo;.  I am satisfied from the advice which has been given to me by my Department and the parliamentary draughtsman that this wording is proper in the circumstances and that the wording proposed by the Deputy would not have any beneficial effects.  We want to retain the word &ldquo;effect&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 70g.</P>
      <P>In page 146, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>209.&mdash;(1)  The Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, is hereby further amended as follows:</P>
      <P>(a) by the substitution for section 2 (1) (b) of the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b)  no resolution subsists for the winding up of the company, and&rdquo;,</P>
      <P>(b)  by the substitution in section 4 (5) (f), for &ldquo;company&rdquo;, of &ldquo;body corporate&rdquo;,</P>
      <P>(c)  by the insertion after section 5 (2) (f) of the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(h)  no set-off between separate bank accounts of the company shall be effected, except with the consent of the examiner, and in this paragraph `bank account' includes an account with any person exempt by virtue of section 7 (4) of the Central Bank Act, 1971, from the requirement of holding a licence under section 9 of that Act,&rdquo;,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(d)  by the insertion in section 11 <Col N="1146" /> (5), after &ldquo;towards&rdquo; of &ldquo;discharging&rdquo;, and</P>
    <P>(e)  by the insertion of the following section after section 36:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;36A.  &mdash;Proceedings in relation to an offence under section 11 (6), 12 or 30 may be brought and prosecuted by the registrar of companies.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>(2)  Section 30 (3) of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, is hereby repealed.</P>
    <P>This amendment deals with &ldquo;new matter&rdquo; not adverted to in the Special Committee, but which has struck me since these matters were last considered by the House.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (a) of this amendment would replace the wording in section 2 (1) (b) of the 1990 Act by the previous wording in section 177 (1) (b) of the Bill, since I am advised that it could cause problems in practice.  It would, therefore, seem preferable to return to the idea we had in section 177 (1) (b) of the Bill, in other words that an examiner should not be capable of being appointed once an actual resolution to wind up has been passed.  Paragraph (a) of the amendment proposes, therefore, to revert to the wording of section 177 (2) (b) of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) of the amendment would involve a relatively minor change to section 4 of the 1990 Act, but one that could come in useful in a future case.  The effect of the change would be to enable a relationship to be shown under section 4 (5) (f) between two Irish companies whose parent was registered abroad &mdash; technically, this could not be done under the 1990 Act as it stands.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (c) of the amendment is intended to tackle the means by which certain creditors, particularly banks, could effectively by-pass the restrictions imposed by section 5 (2) of the 1990 Act.</P>
    <P>I am referring here to the practice of &ldquo;set-off&rdquo;, whereby clients who operate separate accounts agree to the bank using the funds, in credit, in one account to offset shortages in others on an automatic basis and without any necessity to seek <Col N="1147" /> approval from anyone, court or otherwise. This kind of practice might not actually be &ldquo;frozen&rdquo; under any paragraph of section 5 (2), and this is what paragraph (c) of the amendment seeks to rectify.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (d) of the amendment would make a minor, but possibly important, amendment to section 11 (5) of the 1990 Act.  Section 11 is based on section 15 of the UK Insolvency Act, 1986, and my attention has been drawn to an error in the wording as between the last clause of subsection (4) and (5) &mdash; unlike the UK provision, the word &ldquo;discharging&rdquo; is omitted from subsection (5).  Paragraph (d) of the amendment would rectify this error.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (f) of the amendment would allow the registrar of companies to bring and prosecute summary proceedings for offences under section 11 (6), 12 or 30 of the 1990 Act, which involve relatively minor contraventions, and subsection (2) of the amendment would consequentially repeal section 30 (3) of the 1990 Act, which currently allows the registrar to prosecute an offence under that section alone.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 70h:</P>
      <P>In page 146, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1148" /> 208.&mdash;The Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, is hereby amended by the insertion in subsection (1), after `examiner', where it firstly occurs, of `or at the time of presentation to it of a petition for the protection of the court under this Act'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As I said before, one of the main difficulties I see in the legislation regarding the examiner is that he will have to go back into court on numerous occasions to get the agreement of the court to do various things.  One of the principal powers the court should have from day one is, if it sees fit, to transfer control of a company during the period it is in examinership to the examiner.  The Bill as presently drafted provides that the examiner may go back into court and the court may then transfer responsibility from management to the examiner at that time.  We should give the court the power from day one to transfer control of a company to the examiner by inserting in section 9 of the 1990 Act the words &ldquo;or at the time of presentation to it of a petition for the protection of the court under this Act&rdquo;.  This would mean that when the court was hearing the case on day one it could decide that, in addition to court protection being granted to the company the examiner should be given control of management of the company in question.  This amendment would strengthen the legislation in the long term.</P>
    <P>A lot of mystery surrounds the procedure whereby a company is put under the protection of the court and an examiner appointed, but the exact same management remain in the company.  All sorts of problems may arise in the future not necessarily in regard to breaking the law but making it more difficult for the examiner.  We have to look at the way we do our business because companies will always be looking for finance and people will form an opinion as to the type of environment in which they do their business.</P>
    <P>It is questionable whether the same management should be in place while a company is under the control of the court <Col N="1149" /> and an examiner.  I do not want to mention the Goodman affair but eventually a change had to be made.  One can read behind what is written in the newspapers. It would have been far better if the court had been able to give complete and absolute discretion to the examiner to run that company during the four months when investigations had to be made and arrangements put in place.  Such a provision would strengthen rather than weaken the legislation.  It would reduce cost by obviating the necessity to go back and forth to the court seeking agreement. We requested this on Committee Stage but the Minister was not in a position to agree.  We are not saying that this should be done, rather that it should be possible for the court if it thinks fit to transfer control of the company to the examiner. This is peculiar legislation.  Everybody is being told that they cannot do anything until the court decides, having considered the examiner's report, the creditors having made sacrifices and so on.  There are peculiar provisions in that the majority of a class of creditors can make the decision.  While this legislation could protect jobs, many people could also suffer.</P>
    <P>The examiner may be called into the company at the request of the owner of that company and the creditors.  His name is put forward by the person seeking the protection of the court, which could be the company owner.  He is seen as working for the same owner and when it is all over the owner receives back the company and creditors could lose as a result.  I have always had doubts about an examiner going in and being expected to do various things required by law, while at the same time he has been nominated by the person who owns the company. It would be far better if the court could give the examiner the control of the company at the outset until he had finished the job.</P>
    <P>In a different set of circumstances the examiner can work with the person or group who sought the protection of the court in the first place.  Those who were drafting this Bill possibly thought that the appointment of an examiner might <Col N="1150" /> be a disincentive to seek court protection. I can understand that thinking because there is a certain logic to it.  We must start by encouraging companies to seek the protection of the court by getting an examiner in at an early stage.  There are other circumstances where it is in the public interest that the examiner should also be given responsibility for the running of the company from the outset.  The amendment gives the court the option, if it sees fit, to give the examiner control of the company.  I would ask my colleagues to support this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the amendment would be to enable the court to give the examiner the power to take full control of the company from the date of presentation of the initial petition.  I would be reluctant to agree to this amendment for a number of reasons.  I want all the parties mentioned in section 2 to be prepared to use the Companies (Amendment) Act.  Directors of a company are, after all, closest to the company's affairs and ought to be the first to know if the company is heading for the rocks.  Thus in many cases it is the directors who ask a bank to appoint a receiver.</P>
      <P>If I accepted the amendment directors would clearly see that the first thing a court might do is remove them, in certain circumstances.  I suggest that they would be very reluctant to present a petition if by so doing they would effectively be removing themselves from the management of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second problem with the amendment is that when the petition is presented the information available to the court, particularly from independent sources, would be unlikely to be of any great use, if indeed there would be any available.  This contrasts with the present text of the Bill where at least the examiner will have some time to assess the position of the company.  In the third place, the whole concept of the examiner could best be linked to a doctor who examines a patient and prescribes a remedy.  If the examiner is to be caught up in managing the company from the <Col N="1151" /> start it reduces his scope to perform his primary task.</P>
    <P>I wonder if this amendment is necesary. Section 9 provides that where the examiner considers that he ought to have full power to run the company he can apply to the court on the grounds listed in subsection (2).  We are not limiting the time within which the examiner can go back to the court.  In some black and white cases he could go back to the court the day after his appointment.  Any of the paragraphs of subsection (2) apply.  The amendment is unnecessary.  On the other hand, it could be damaging for the prospects of saving the company if we were to put any discouragement in the path of the people we want to encourage to make applications to the court in the first place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see certain merit in what Deputy Barrett is saying and in the thinking behind this amendment.  The Minister, Deputy O'Malley, expressed concern on Committee Stage about the constant references to the court throughout the Bill.  We must give credit where it is due.  A very helpful amendment was proposed by Deputy Spring to reduce costs where the Circuit Court was the appropriate court of reference when a company is below a certain size.  That will have the effect of removing costs to some extent.  If the examiner is not to have total autonomy and the court must become involved at a number of stages while the examiner is in place, there must be some provision for reference to the court.  The question is whether the legislation is drafted in such a way that the court must be referred to too often.  This is important in the light of costs and the size of companies here relative to companies in the United States where the Chapter 11 procedure has been in operation for some time.  It may be that when we see this in operation we will be able to find some way to reduce the number of times the examiner has to refer to the court for guidance in the performance of his functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated that one of the arguments against Deputy Barrett's <Col N="1152" /> amendment is that it would discourage directors from availing of the examinership procedure.  I would not go all the way with that argument&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because the directors may be faced with Hobson's choice &mdash; with an examiner, a receiver or a liquidator taking over from them because the situation had become so hopeless.  The real objection to the amendment is that the application to put a company into examination is <i>ex parte</i>, akin almost to a <i>habeas corpus</i> application in another branch of law, it is an emergency application and would be made <i>ex parte.</i>  Only the minimum amount of information will accompany the application.  It is not that it would not be right sometimes for the court to appoint the examiner with total control or as manager from day one&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I will discuss that matter with the Deputy if he wishes.  There is no point writing provisions into our legislation which would give the court the power to prejudge issues.  In retrospect, one might say that an examiner should have been appointed as the boss from day one but, there is no point writing laws which give the court the right to make decisions of this sort having regard to the fact that the information available to it on the day the application is made would be so scanty that they would be in no position to make that decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment <Col N="1153" /> on the basis that in all probability there would not be many instances where the court would be required to operate it. However, there could be the occasional case where it would be necessary not only to appoint an examiner but also to vest powers in the court.  I think we can have sufficient confidence in our judges and in the judicial system not to exercise that power except in exceptional cases.  I do not believe that this power would in any way discourage directors from seeking to avail of the examination procedure if they were minded to do so.  In any case this would be a very major step for any company and they would only take it if they were at their wits end and in considerable difficulty.</P>
      <P>One could envisage a circumstance where it is obvious that the assets are about to be dissipated, jobs about to be lost, moneys about to be done away with or that all sorts of nefarious activities are going on, that the court would say they will exercise this exceptional power in those exceptional circumstances.  I cannot see any possible harm in this.  If, as Deputy O'Dea has said, there is a scarcity of information no court would take such a serious step because they are cautious and rightly so.  They are very cautious in the orders they make and the steps they take.  We could confidently leave this matter with the court to decide whether they have sufficient material which would persuade them to make such an order.</P>

    <P>It is true that the examination would be carried out on a one-sided basis, <i>ex parte</i> as Deputy O'Dea put it.  That is perfectly true but at the same time there would be nothing to stop a judge saying that, having considered carefully such an application he is not going to make an order, that he requires further information to help him make up his mind and that he is putting the case back until Thursday when the directors or creditors will come back with the information he requires.  If the judge sees that queer things are going on in the company, he may decide that it would be too late to put things off for a few weeks.  The object <Col N="1154" /> of the legislation, namely, to save companies, could perhaps be lost and dissipated if the court is not given this power.</P>
    <P>To suggest that we should deny the court this power, even for use in exceptional cases, is to display a lack of confidence or trust in our judicial system and judges.  To suggest that a court, for some outlandish reason or on insufficient evidence or material, would make such an order displays a lack of confidence in the Judiciary which is totally unwarranted. They are very careful and cautious people and know what is required and what the score is.  They would not make such order lightly and it is a pity that the absence of such a power, for use in exceptional cases, would on occasion dissipate the object of this legislation, which is to preserve companies.</P>
    <P>Delays can be extremely dangerous. Delays of even a week in the affairs of a company on a slippery slope could be disastrous and indeed could tip that company over the edge.  There could be nothing left to save if the court does not step in on an emergency basis and secure the power in the hands of the examiner and save it.  Why should we not consider it?  It is not unreasonable to anyone that this should be used in exceptional cases and I think we could have every confidence and place our trust in the Judiciary to only exercise it where it was warranted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I tend to agree.  The power we are talking about here is an exceptional and emergency measure.  It is not impossible to envisage an instance where this power would be necessary to confer on the judge hearing the action. It is not as if the judge is compelled, on presentation of the petition, to make the order to vest total control in the examiner. Surely it would depend entirely on the merits of the case.  If the merits of the case are such, the process could be undermined if the judge did not have the power to make the decision there and then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, on previous amendments, we dealt with what the Minister <Col N="1155" /> referred to as the &ldquo;set off&rdquo; where it was possible to have separate bank accounts as a method of circumventing responsibilities not envisaged when the Bill was enacted last August.  I presume there are other instances where a judge may come <Col N="1156" /> to the conclusion, based on the information, that it would be desirable there and then to give the examiner full control. The amendment is a reasonable one and, like Deputy Taylor, I doubt if it would be abused by the Judiciary.</P>

      <P>I beg your indulgence, Sir, to express my appreciation to all those who participated in the passage of this very significant Bill. I should like to thank Opposition Members, Deputies S. Barrett, Carey, Rabbitte and Taylor, and Deputy O'Dea and others, the present Minister for Finance who introduced the Bill in 1987 and, indeed, the Minister for Tourism and Transport, Deputy Séamus Brennan who participated in the debate as Minister of State.  On behalf of the Minister I should like to express thanks to all and particularly Deputy Cowen, Chairman of the Special Committee, on having brought this Bill to such an advanced stage.  Finally, I should like to thank all of the officials who participated in the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to avail of the opportunity to thank the officials of the Department of Industry and Commerce who were very patient over a long period, who did a great job in assisting us put this Bill through the House.  I thank the Minister for accepting a large number of amendments tabled by Deputy J. Bruton and myself, and my colleagues who served on the Special Committee.  It is a great pity we do not utilise the committee system more often for this type of legislation. However, that is understandable when one considers the amount of work and effort put into this Bill, with practically no attendance on the part of the media and without the availability of the broadcasting service to that Special Committee. There is a major weakness there. This legislation and its huge effects on industry and business in the future should have been more broadly known by the public at large.  It is a sad reflection on the way this House has gone that unless you have something very sexy to say you have less chance of getting a line in the <Col N="1159" /> paper.  I always thought the media were there to report to the public important things that were happening in both Houses of the Oireachtas, but I was rather shocked at the insignificant coverage this massive legislation got at the Select Committee and the lack of broadcasting afforded to it both on Committee Stage and when we dealt with it in the House.</P>
      <P>I hope sincerely that Irish industry, business and employment will grow as a result of the efforts that have been put in over the last three years in passing this legislation.  Again, I thank all concerned who helped to bring it about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his very kind words.  My own involvement in this Bill was miniscule in the extreme, and I am well aware of that, in comparison to many of the other Deputies who were involved on Committee Stage and here in the House.  Really it arose only when I was appointed my party's spokesman on Industry within the last couple of weeks.  Nonetheless, I was happy to come in here for the last session or two and make some contributions to the best of my ability with the intent, let me say, of trying to be helpful, not to seek publicity as was suggested here this morning.  As has been said, a Companies Bill is not the sort of measure that attracts any great degree of publicity.  It is an excellent piece of work that this very long, difficult and complex measure has been finally passed and adopted by Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for Industry and Commerce for his courtesy, and I want to acknowledge the extraordinary volume of work put into this very substantial legislation by the officials, requiring very considerable technical competence.  I agree with Deputy Barrett that it would be a pity if the experience were to undermine the value of the Select Committee idea.  Notwithstanding the fact that they may not always have proceeded as quickly as they could, the Select Committee were ideally <Col N="1160" /> suited to teasing out what is probably going to be one of the major pieces of legislation enacted by this Government and this Dáil.  I am proud to have been associated with it throughout the period of the Select Committee.  Especially I would like to acknowledge the contribution of the officials.</P>

I understand it is being returned to our museum in Cavan town, when it is built. I am talking about a replica on the site where it was found.  It would have importance for tourism.  The Taoiseach was in that region recently and saw the great work being done there, and I understand he appreciated it.  It is not too much to ask.  I am not referring to plastic or this modern material.  I am talking about a <Col N="1161" /> stone replica made by local craftsmen.  I can arrange that if the Taoiseach gives the go ahead.</P>

      <P>I was happy to commit this country to the declaration of the Paris Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe which states that we will promote social justice and progress and further the welfare of our peoples and that we recognise in this context the importance of effective measures to address the problems of unemployment.</P>
      <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> provided the basic effective formula for creating employment.  Under it, there was a net increase of some 70,000 jobs in private industry and services over a three year period.  This contrasts with the previous six years when there was a net decrease of 38,000 jobs in private industry and services.</P>
      <P>We are currently negotiating with the social partners a possible new programme for economic and social progress.  If these negotiations are successful, we will be able to continue to have a competitive economy growing at a fast rate, the only basis on which employment can continue to expand as it has over the past three and a half years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Taoiseach for his elaboration in relation to the statement that was made in the House last week.  It would appear from the Taoiseach's reply that the only plan that the Government have relates solely to the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and its continuation.  Is it to be taken that after <Col N="1162" /> last week's CSCE meeting there are no plans for international co-operation in response to the serious unemployment situation in Europe?  Likewise, in regard to the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the continuation of that, I am sure the Taoiseach is aware that congress and the unions have stated that without tax reform there will not be a second programme. Can the Taoiseach assure this House that there will be tax reform in the forthcoming budget?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to preempt the discussions at this stage, but the Deputy can be assured that every attempt will be made to reach agreement with the trade union partners.</P>
      <P>On the other question, I would just mention to the Deputy that we have the National Development Plan and the Structural Funds, which is a major contributor to economic development and expansion in itself and from the point of view of making the economy more efficient, productive and competitive. There are not at this stage, though I would hope that they will evolve, any specific mechanisms or programmes under the CSCE process itself but as the Deputy knows, the CSCE process is now in a developing state and, as a result of the Paris Summit, we hope it will grow and evolve into many different areas.  As yet, however, I would not think we could count on that particular process for employment generation either here or in Europe generally, except in so far as it will help to create the security and stability which are essential for employment creation.</P>

      <P>Given the forecast by the ESRI in relation to growth for next year, can the Taoiseach inform the House if he now accepts that the job targets as set by the Government will seriously diminish on the basis of the ESRI targets and if the Government will be taking some steps as a consequence of the now perceived reduction in growth in the economy?</P>

      <P>Relationship.  The policy is quite clear.  Dublin Airport is quite capable of handling all the traffic in the capital now and for a considerable time to come.  There is provision for a second runway at Dublin Airport should the expansion of air traffic require it. There is no need, from the point of view of aviation policy, to have another airport like Baldonnel near Dublin city.  There is need for the Air Corps to have their headquarters at Baldonnel and to have an operational base there.  We would be reluctant to interfere with that unless it was necessary.  The combination of a civil and military airport is never very satisfactory.</P>

      <P>The statistic quoted by the Deputy is an estimate published by Dublin Chamber of Commerce in their February 1990 report, &ldquo;Corridor to Competitiveness&rdquo;. They estimate that some 125,000 units of unitised freight whose natural market is the Central Corridor travels via the Northern Corridor.  I accept this figure as a reasonable estimate.  I would point out to the Deputy that it relates to both imports and exports.</P>
      <P>This diversion of traffic is attributable to a number of interwoven factors which operate in favour of the Northern ports, including shipping costs, frequency and capacity of shipping services, port charges, lower costs of Northern Ireland hauliers and so on.</P>
      <P>We have begun to tackle some of these problems through a major programme of investment in transport infrastructure agreed recently with the EC in the context of an operational programme on peripherality. This will be published shortly. In addition, the Government in conjunction with Irish export interests, are continuing to press the EC for assistance in financing mobile asset investment to offset the cost disadvantages which our unique peripherality and island nation status imposes on Irish exporters.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that port charges in Larne are 30 per cent lower than they are in the Republic and ferry costs in the Republic are 204 per cent higher than they are in Northern Ireland?  Something of the order of 125,000 containers are collected as far south as Cork each year, moved up North and via Larne, Warrenpoint and Belfast shipped across the Irish Sea and on to London at a cost that is more economic than using the central corridor through Dublin.  In view of that, and of the loss of £56 million to the Exchequer, would the Minister consider that it is long past time for reports?  It is time for action.  It is time an investment was made in Dublin Port and that they were made get their costs down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no increase in the rates for freight in Dublin since 1 April, 1988 and a cut of almost 40 per cent in cargo dues for driver accompanied roll on/roll off vehicles has been in place since 1 January, 1990.  I share the Deputy's analysis of the problem and would welcome, as I always have, hearing from him on some specific <Col N="1169" /> solutions.  A new dual carriageway is due to commence in 1993, partly in tunnel form from Whitehall to Dublin port.  That will be a £100 million roadway and over £1 million is to be spent on the existing rail link within Dublin Port.  In the Northern corridor in Larne, there are 17 daily sailings compared to eight sailings from Dublin.  I have asked SKC in the access study report to advise on how best to get more capacity on the Irish Sea.  I am aware of the lower vehicle excise duty that pertains in the UK.  I am sure no one has a magic solution for our higher rates of indirect tax but I would welcome ideas on this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Port charges in Larne are 30 per cent cheaper.  Dublin Port had to borrow £17 million since 1975 whereas Larne received £4.2 million from the EC and a further £1.3 million from the British taxpayer by way of grant.  That militates against Dublin Port.  The Government should come to the assistance of Dublin Port and ask the EC to assist them in the same way they assisted Larne.</P>

      <P>It is not just investment in Dublin Port.  There is investment, as I pointed out, in roads and railways.  It is the frequency of sailings which has to do with the financial state of shipping companies.  As the Deputy knows, I am considering options for B &amp; I at the moment and I want to deal with that matter sensitively and as quickly as possible and take into consideration all the views put to me.  It is not just Dublin Port that is affected.  I have already pointed out to the Deputy that Irish hauliers have to pay higher excise duty, and there are additional costs involved in that operation.</P>

Does he accept that, for instance, an operator in the midlands exporting a container to London can save 12 per cent per container by sending it through the circuitous route of Northern Ireland rather than through the central corridor, which is more logical?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 13 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>The report prepared by the Dublin City Centre Business Association is being considered by the working group which I set up to assess and report on the feasibility of rail and busway options for the former Harcourt Street railway line and the Tallaght area.  I expect to receive the report of the working group shortly.  I would like an opportunity to study the report before commenting in detail on the possible options.  It is already clear however that a bus option utilising the existing Harcourt Street alignment and involving links to Tallaght is the more attractive proposition, having regard to the limited level of resources likely to be available for public transport infrastructure development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department are represented on the Dublin Transportation Review Group and are actively involved in the work of the group.  CIE are also represented on the group.  I can assure the Deputy that the importance of cost-effective and efficient public transport services is being fully taken into account by the group in the course of their work.  The report prepared by the Dublin City Centre <Col N="1172" /> Business Association is also being considered by this group.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may be aware of the concerns of the group who produced this fine report, the Dublin City Centre Business Association, one of which is that Dublin city is being choked to death.  Is the Minister aware that unless immediate action is taken, Dublin city will fall into a lengthy period of economic decline as a result of the chaotic transportation system?  The association feel that a light rail rapid transport system is what is urgently needed.  Is the Minister aware that Dublin City Council have discovered that there is negative buoyancy in valuations in Dublin city, that the rateable value of property in Dublin city is declining?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Byrne has made his point effectively.  A long series of questions of this kind is not in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am young enough to be intrigued by the phrase &ldquo;negative buoyancy&rdquo;.  The report I received from the Dublin City Centre Business Association is an excellent one.  They dealt not only with public transport but also with the administrative structure behind it, the need for a data base, the need for investment in the system, improvement in the standard of taxis and a whole range of other proposals which they felt would bring the city centre of Dublin back to life.  The various Departments to whom the report has been sent are considering those proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the amount of traffic in the city at present is unacceptable.  On the other hand it demonstrates that economic activity in the city is perhaps not as poor as the Deputy suggests.  It is certainly not a desert area but is active, thriving and lively.  What I am anxious to do within the resources available to me is to provide <Col N="1173" /> a practical transport system, but my resources are very limited.  I am considering &mdash; I know the Deputy has views on this &mdash; the potential for private investment in the transport system.  State funds are simply not available, nor are European funds, to build the kind of glamorous 21st century transport systems that are being proposed at present.  We would be talking of hundreds of millions of pounds, which the Exchequer simply does not have.  I do not think we need such a glamorous system immediately. There is a question down from Deputy Mitchell, which I will deal with later, about an underground system.  We are not at that stage of public transport in this country.  We have to work within our resources and whatever resources I can raise from the private sector.  I am considering options as to how to raise those funds and invest in a bus-based system which is the most practical system at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that a bus-based system would not be attractive to the commuter?  The reason there are so many cars entering the inner city is that there has been a lack of support for public transport by bus? The Dublin City Centre Business Association are quite right in arguing that in order for the city centre to survive, given the growing competition from places like The Square in Tallaght, we must have an attractive public transport network to bring the commuters into the inner city. The association argue most strongly &mdash; this is the international trend&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If I can organise the funding &mdash; I am working on that &mdash; it is possible to have busways linking Tallaght with Harcourt Street and Leopardstown with Harcourt Street.  The busway system would not compete directly with traffic.  Secondly, when we get EC clearance, we will be investing up to £20 million on the Clondalkin railway line, a rail link which will have eight new stations.  That line will be linked to Tallaght by bus from Clondalkin.  We will put four new stations on the Maynooth route which will link with the suburban area there.  I have not ruled out the light railway transport system.  I will sit down with the Deputy or his party and day and work out exactly how we might fund such a glamorous project.  The Deputy should be under no illusions about investment in public transport.</P>

      <P>I do not begrudge the subsidy to CIE as we have to keep the system moving.  However, we must all realise the big money involved, it is £2 million per week or £100 million per year. Given the current budget deficit, we are probably talking about one-third of it. When we demand more investment in public transport we must remember that a great deal of money has already been put into it.  I have laid out definite plans, which will take more money, and I will see how I will organise the company on a practical basis.</P>

      <P>Examination of the various tender proposals submitted to my Department for the new ferry service to the Aran Islands is at an advanced stage and I expect to be in a position to make an announcement on the matter shortly.</P>

Has a decision been made as to where the service will be sourced and the point towards which it will be directed?

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The kind of service I have in mind is that laid down in the advertisement my Department placed in the newspapers, in invitation to tender. We asked for a vessel which would have a small passenger complement &mdash; we envisaged about 45 or 50 people &mdash; operating between Galway city and the Aran Islands.  We asked for tenders to be submitted on the basis of either roll on-roll off or load on-load off operations and we asked the tenders to include an indication of the infrastructural improvements they would require.  We also pointed out that <Col N="1177" /> the service should be suitable for the conveyance of general cargo, motor vehicles, refrigerated foodstuffs and livestock.  We also invited tenderers to have regard to the scheduling of sevices so that there would be a minimum of three sailings per week all year round to the three islands, Inishmore, Inishmaan and Inisheer, with a higher frequency in the summer.  We pointed out that the contract would be awarded on the basis of meeting that criteria.  We received about ten tenders &mdash; certainly seven very serious ones with one from as far away as Australia, or perhaps it was Canada.  The service will be sourced in Galway city.  I asked officials of my Department to visit the islands to have discussions with all the interested parties and I understand that they had discussions with leading members of the co-operative.  I am happy that we have had full consultations with people on the islands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Did any of the tenders deal with a service which would include a combination of service with buses from Rossaveal?  When will the Minister take the decision and is he aware that, following the placing of the advertisement in the newspapers, a number of groups, individuals, companies and indeed the co-operative, have expressed dissatisfaction at what they felt was the preempting of the decision by the form of the advertisement?  Will he also indicate how the option he favours will be a significant advance on the <i>Naomh Éanna</i> in service in the fifties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I visited the islands over the summer to satisfy myself that we are doing the right thing.  The contract will be formally awarded within two weeks.  Some of the companies who tendered expressed a preference for Rossaveal and put forward proposals based on that.  Generally, in my view &mdash; and that of the Government &mdash; our responsibility is to provide a very good vessel.  I understand that the top tenderers recommended that a new vessel should be purpose built for the weather and seas in that area.  If the boat is built it would solve <Col N="1178" /> many of the current difficulties which also existed when the <i>Naomh Éanna</i> was in service.  As the Deputy knows, the <i>Naomh Éanna</i> is 30 years old and had come to the end of its life.  This new service will be a permanent State service from Galway city to the three islands operating all year round and will be designed for all the items I mentioned such as refrigeration, cattle, etc.  It will also hold 50 passengers.  I engaged marine consultants to advise me and they said it would be a good core service.  There will be  many  disappointed  companies because, as the Deputy is aware, there is substantial rivalry in regard to this matter which is why I have engaged excellent professionals to assess the tenders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 28 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neither I nor my Department have any reservations about money being invested in upgrading the Dublin to Belfast rail link.  Indeed, I have, on previous occasions, indicated my support for the Dublin-Belfast rail project, provided that an adequate level of EC funding can be made available.  The EC Commission and the UK authorities also recognise the <Col N="1182" /> importance of the Dublin-Belfast rail link.</P>
    <P>As part of my efforts in relation to the project, I have been in regular contact with the Northern Ireland authorities and the EC Commissioner for Transport and there have also been ongoing contacts at senior level between officials of my Department, the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment and the EC Commission.</P>
    <P>The project has been discussed at meetings of the Anglo-Irish Conference where it was agreed that the possibility of securing EC aid for the project should continue to be pursued vigorously.  In this context, I am pleased to announce that as a result of our efforts at meetings of the Council of Ministers of Transport, the project has recently been accepted as a project which can be considered for financial assistance under the EC's newly established Transport Infrastructure Fund.  However, it is a matter of some disappointment that the level of aid available for projects from this source is less than what we had hoped for.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the EC Operational Programme on Peripherality, due to be published shortly, provides for a detailed study of the costs and benefits of the proposed upgrading of the Belfast rail link to be carried out jointly by my Department and the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment.  The purpose of the study is to complete a full assessment of the project's potential contribution to the improvement of passenger and freight services within the island as a whole, with the possibilities for EC assistance for the project being examined in the light of the outcome of the study.</P>
    <P>Draft terms of reference for the study, agreed between my Department and the Northern Ireland authorities, are now being considered by the EC Commission. It is expected that the study will commence shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his very detailed reply, but it does not really add up to much.  Most of us on this island aspire to a united Ireland and the <Col N="1183" /> inexorable running down of this line is another nail in the coffin of that aspiration. Would the Minister not agree that this matter must not be reduced to a question of pounds, shillings and pence? Would the Minister agree that employment as far away as Waterford would be affected if the line were to close?  Would he further agree that in the event of closure, goods and passengers would have to be transported by road, with the many environmental problems attached thereto and, finally and most importantly, would he agree that the closure of this line would be a major propaganda victory for the IRA?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the project to upgrade the Dublin-Belfast rail link and I am working vigorously to try to ensure that it is kept open.  I have to deal in pounds, shillings and pence because that is what it takes to upgrade the line.  In that regard I am very pleased that under this new fund, the Transport Infrastructure Fund established under the Irish Presidency, this project was accepted as an item which will be considered for funds.  I will work vigorously to ensure that the project is funded from that source or from any other I can locate.</P>
      <P>There was no proposal of which I am aware to close the line.  I attended the Anglo-Irish Conference some months ago where I raised with the UK representatives the question of the line, and the British Government, the Northern Ireland authorities and ourselves are at one on how to proceed from here.  We are talking about a major investment.  All sides are committed to it.  Now, it is a matter of how we get on with the project and locate the funding.  It is simply a matter of funding and how soon we locate that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said a number of times that he is committed to keeping the line open and upgrading it, but I have yet to hear a satisfactory explanation as to why the availability of regional funding has not been taken up by the Minister.  Commissioner Bruce <Col N="1184" /> Millan has indicated that regional funding up to something like £13 million was available.  Why has the Minister's attention been directed to the Transport Infrastructure Fund which, as I understand, will only provide about £3 million this year, when one cannot get funding from the European Community?  Why is the Minister going for the Transport Infrastructure Fund rather than the Regional Development Fund and how does he expect the balance of 75 per cent of the funding required to upgrade the line to be acquired when it will not be available from the European Community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I had explained this before but I will try to explain it now quickly.  The European Regional Development Fund under the operational programme provides a total of about £18 million under the heading of public transport.  That has been allocated to update the Clondalkin line which the Deputy's colleague is interested in and spoke about earlier.  When Mr. Millan was referring to these matters he was obviously leaving it to the Irish Government to indicate within that £18 million how they wished to proceed.  The Clondalkin line is an important line, a communal line that must be gone ahead with.  We are still completing the socioeconomic study on it but it must be gone ahead with.</P>
      <P>Since this new fund, the Transport Infrastructure Fund, is a sort of crossfrontier fund, a cross-border fund, to link up regions, it makes a lot more sense to use that fund.  We could have had the option of allocating the £18 million to the Belfast line in which case we would not have been able to proceed with the Clondalkin one.  This strategy gives us an opportunity to do both.  That is eminently practical.  I would like to have received more from the European Regional Development Fund but £18 million is what we will get and most of it will go to Clondalkin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the study which Iarnród Éireann have <Col N="1185" /> already done with regard to the upgrading of the Dublin-Belfast line, can the Minister say how much he expects the upgrading to cost and over what period? My understanding is that this year we will get £3 million out of the Transport Infrastructure Fund and the likelihood is that we will not get any more next year; but by the end of 1992, the total we are likely to get is approximately £9 million, or perhaps £10 million, which must account for about 25 per cent&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's worries about the Transport Infrastructure Fund.  I am not convinced that it will solve this problem for the country because the cost of the entire project is given at £70 million.  Put that against the £18 million I have available for that kind of transport and Deputies will see that I have few options.  About £44 million of that £70 million will be the responsibility of the Republic, so the Deputy is right to be concerned about the amount we might get from the Transport Infrastructure Fund.  I will continue my search through other sources of funding.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister not agree that the estimated cost to the Exchequer to upgrade the line will be in the region of £10 million and that we are not just taking about a Dublin-Belfast line?  Will the Minister agree that the community of European railways have recognised the importance of this line, that it is part of the major European rail and sea link, linking Dublin with Belfast, Cork Brussels Amsterdam, Paris and Basle and that, therefore, it is of much greater significance than that it is a link across the Border from the Republic?  Finally, would he not agree, given the determination and dedication of Northern Rail to seek co-operation in up-grading the line, that this is really a slap in the face for them given that they expended £1 million last year as a result of &ldquo;provo&rdquo; gangsters blasting the line?  That determination still exists and, unfortunately, the Minister seems totally incapable of coming up with a solution that will guarantee the long term survival of the line.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the line is just not an economic link, it is a very important symbolic link.  I am making every possible effort at <Col N="1187" /> EC level to identify the funding which I need to go ahead with our part of it.  We are working with the Northern Ireland authorities to see if we can package it.  I know there is a sense of urgency about this matter but I have to try to package it as best I can and secure the very substantial funding for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 12, 23, 25 and 93 together.</P>
      <P>On 22 November 1990, I was advised by the chairman of Aer Lingus of decisions taken by the board to counter rising costs and the effects of the recession in air transport, particularly in the US and UK markets, which has been exacerbated by the continuing Gulf crisis.</P>
      <P>The chairman informed me that the board had undertaken a major review of the airline's operating plans in the light of weakening demand and escalating costs affecting airlines worldwide.  As a result, they had unanimously adopted an integrated action plan designed to protect the airline's strategic longer term interests and to position the airline to take advantage of expansion opportunities when buoyancy returns to the market.  The plan requires cost reductions of £20 million per annum within Aer Lingus, savings from operational changes of £15 million per annum, as well as increases in fares.</P>
      <P>Key elements in the plan include postponement of commencement of the Ireland/Los Angeles passenger service, suspension of the Ireland/Los Angeles cargo service, reduction of flights on smaller cross channel and domestic routes and cessation of the Dublin-Manchester-Hamburg service.</P>
      <P>In addition, the plan proposes that services between Dublin and Knock and Dublin and Derry will be discontinued. It also provides for the disposal of a number of the airline's older aircraft.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the financial forecasts provided to me by Aer Lingus, I fully accept that urgent corrective action has to be taken by Aer Lingus to avoid substantial losses on air transport which, without such corrective action, could amount to as much as £50 million in 1991-92.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I have conveyed to the board in general terms my broad approval in principle for the thrust of their recovery plan, I have asked them for further detailed information before deciding whether or not to approve the plan in detail.  It would be premature, therefore, <Col N="1189" /> to comment on individual elements of the proposals or on the effect the proposed cutback in services would have on the targets set by the Government in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that for 1991 an increase of 400,000 tourists are expected in conjunction with the <i>Programme for National Recovery?</i> The North American market is very important to secure that increase.  Last spring the Minister announced in the Dáil that negotiations were taking place with airlines in the United States following the withdrawal of Pan Am but nothing has happened.  With the withdrawal of Pan Am we have lost a good promoter of Ireland in their outlets throughout the United States.  If we do not have a proper service in and out of the United States there is no way the expected increase in tourist numbers for 1991 can be met. That would be catastrophic for the tourist industry and not alone are we talking about £50 million&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never made any secret of the fact that I would welcome and continue to invite &mdash; and have done so at the highest levels &mdash; American airlines to fly to Ireland.  At present only two companies, Aer Lingus and Delta Airlines, are doing that.  They are doing an excellent job but we could do with many more.  I am doing everything possible to attract them to fly to Ireland because at the end of the day that is the solution to our difficulties.  Aer Lingus have informed me that despite these cuts the number of passengers they will carry for the year ending 1992 will be approximately the same as the number they carried last year.  They expect to increase the load factor with the same capacity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that a special case can be made for the north-west of the country &mdash; he knows a good deal about that as he comes from that area &mdash; in view of the high unemployment and emigration, for a subsidy to be given to Aer Lingus to re-open this route?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am particularly disappointed that the company felt they had to discontinue the Dublin to Knock and Dublin to Derry services.  I have asked for full details on those services as I want to study the costings to see whether we can formally sanction the entire plan. That is the reason I have told them that in principle I approve their plan but I want to examine the details.  I am disappointed about their decision but that is no reflection on Aer Lingus.  They are trying to run a commercial operation and I gather that those two runs have shown very substantial losses.  They made a commercial decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that the development and expansion of US business is absolutely vital for the anticipated growth in the Irish tourist industry?  With the current exchange rate in the dollar and the mini <Col N="1191" />&mdash; if not major &mdash; recession in the United States economy a very aggressive marketing and promotional campaign will have to be engaged in by Bord Fáilte, and the Department, if we are to achieve the anticipated growth.  In 1989, 427,000 people from the United States travelled to Ireland.  Having regard to the ethnic population, and the immense wealth in America, surely Ireland can hope for a very substantial increase in the number of tourists in future years but it will require very aggressive marketing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy.  He has analysed the situation properly.  The transAtlantic traffic is growing at the rate of about 5 per cent whereas the overall increase in tourism is about 15 per cent.  The transAtlantic market is certainly under-performing compared to the others.  The continental routes are very exciting but the transAtlantic routes are down.  Of course, marketing is critical and Bord Fáilte are doing an excellent job in this regard.  I have to say to the Deputy &mdash; he referred to this himself &mdash; that the approach to travel of the average American citizen is based on the performance of their economy, the Gulf crisis and other matters which they take into account before they travel.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, there is an upward trend in airfares which we are desperately trying to keep down.  Every country has the same difficulty in that area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a bevy of statisticians and economists poring over that kind of problem regularly.  I am not holding my breath for a clear response because, to be honest, I do not think it matters that much.  Visitors come to this country, they leave their money behind, they stay in hotels and use our transport services and at the end of the day a visitor&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is neat and useful for planners &mdash; we are drawing up the figures and dissecting them &mdash; to know the origin of the traveller because they have to engage in marketing programmes and so on but once the tourists are here I do not see any major difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is important to hoteliers, those who run guesthouses and others in the tourist business to know whether a person is coming into the country to avail of the services here or whether they are just returning to meet their mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters. There is a follow-through on this and the Minister should satisfy himself as to whether we are talking about bona fide tourists or returning emigrants.

      <P>I received an application from Abbeyshrule Airport for grant assistance from EC Structural Funds under the Operational Programme on Peripherality towards the cost of developing Abbeyshrule Airport.  The application contained, <i>inter alia</i>, the tourism benefits to the region anticipated by the promoters.</P>
      <P>The operational programme as approved by the EC Commission does not permit funding for any non-State airports other than the existing six regional airports.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that because Abbeyshrule Airport has been in existence for over 40 years &mdash; it is not one of the new airports coming on stream &mdash; that it was perhaps overlooked on those grounds?  The population in that area is in excess of the population in the areas of some of the airports which have been funded, for example, Galway, Connaught, Sligo and Farranfore.  The population in the periphery of Abbeyshrule Airport is much higher.  There is a thriving flying school at this airport which could benefit from an expansion of the airport.  In addition, they have a marvellous aircraft maintenance section which could also benefit from an expansion of the airport.  The Minister has not addressed the impact this airport could have on the development of tourism in the area.  As the Minister knows&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The promoters in their study said that the airport is in the wrong place and they would like to start afresh and build it two miles down the road.

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under international law and convention, States may specify areas within their national airspace systems as danger areas.  Generally these are where military or naval exercises can and do take place.  The safety of civil aircraft operating in those areas is ensured through standard internationally agreed procedures to prevent any conflict between civil aircraft and military exercises.</P>
      <P>There are large areas of British airspace designated as danger areas in the region of Cardigan Bay.  The locations and times during which these areas are used by military or naval authorities are published by the relevant authorities in Britain.  When it is intended to use the danger areas outside the published times, special notifications are given to adjacent air traffic control centres and to pilots using those areas.</P>
      <P>There are two major air routes from Dublin to Britain, mainly London, which cross the Cardigan Bay area.  The degree to which these areas are used for military purposes is, of course, a matter solely for the British authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would not be proper for me to comment on usage made of these danger <Col N="1198" /> areas, which, as I have said earlier, is provided for under international law.  I can, however, say that there has been no noticeable increase recently in the number of notifications received by the Air Traffic Control Service at Dublin Airport of the danger areas referred to being used outside the normal published times.</P>

      <P>The inquiry which took place after the 1968 Viscount crash was not conclusive in establishing the case of that crash and there is a strong school of thought which says that it was a missile emanating from the area about which we are talking which brought down that aircraft.  Until that matter is dealt with and the true story is told, not only should we be opposing any stepping up of activity in that area but we should be opposing in all ways open to us any activity from that firing range.</P>

      <P>In view of questions asked about this matter in recent days in the British House of Commons, would the Minister agree that it would be desirable for an all-party group of this House to inquire into the activities of the missile base there, since there are clear suggestions that this base may be endangering the lives of people within its vicinity and may have contributed in the past to a plane crash.  Would the Minister agree that it should be inquired into by an all-party committee?</P>

      <P>The accident involving the Aer Lingus Viscount aircraft near Tuskar Rock, County Wexford on 24 March 1968, was the subject of an intensive investigation by an inspector of accidents of my Department.</P>
      <P>The inspector's report, which was published, considered the possibility of an explosion as the cause of the accident. The wreckage recovered was subjected to detailed examination by explosives experts.  No evidence was found that could lead to the conclusion that the cause of the accident was an explosion. In his report the inspector stated that the evidence derived from the investigation of the wreckage and the post-mortem enabled a number of primary causes of accidents, including an explosion, to be virtually discounted as highly improbable.</P>
      <P>The inspector in his report covered the widest possible range of causes for the accident &mdash; including the possibility of collision with another aircraft or airborne object &mdash; but found that there was not enough evidence on which to reach a conclusion of reasonable probability as to the cause of the accident.</P>

Has any information regarding traces of explosives come to the Department at any time?  I have strong reason to believe that information regarding traces of explosives in the wreckage should have reached the Department.  If the Minister does not know of such information, will he have <Col N="1200" /> another look at the matter?  If traces of explosives are known to have been involved in the wreckage, will he reopen the inquiry into the cause of the accident?</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>The Operational Programme on Peripherality contains proposals for EC aid of approximately £18 million for public transport, mainly in respect of rail projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main projects included under the <Col N="1201" /> operational programme are as follows: (a) provision of a new commuter rail service from Clondalkin to the city centre, with eight new stations and feeder bus services to Tallaght, at a cost of £28.5 million; (b) upgrading of the commuter rail service from Maynooth to the city, involving the provision of four new stations, at a cost of £0.76 million.  This project was completed earlier this year in advance of the finalisation of the operational programme; (c) construction of a new rail link to certain shipside container facilities at Dublin port, at a cost of £1.6 million; and (d) a number of improvements to the national rail network, with particular emphasis on improving facilities for the transport of goods by rail, at a cost of £5.2 million.</P>
    <P>While it is acknowledged in the operational programme that the Clondalkin rail project meets the broad criteria for assistance from the ERDF, such aid has been made conditional on the outcome of a socio-economic cost-benefit analysis of the proposed investment.  This examination will be undertaken shortly and it is expected that it will confirm the merits of proceedings with the project as a matter of urgency.</P>

In view of these talks between Chancellor Kohl and President Mitterrand, would the Taoiseach seek a meeting with the heads of Government and travel to Europe, even tonight, to ensure that decisions are not reached which could have far-reaching implications for agriculture and for our whole economy?</P>

I have no indication whatsoever that there will be any change in the Community position.  The mandate given to the Commission is very clear and very specific.  It is our intention to maintain adherence to that mandate.  There is no indication that discussions between Chancellor Kohl and President Mitterrand will have any detrimental effect as far as we are concerned or as far as they are concerned.</P>
      <P>The position of the German and French Governments is already well known and very clear and I have no reason to believe that it will not be adhered to.  These are very difficult negotiations. We have a very great interest in the outcome.  I would not agree that we are likely to be more seriously affected than anybody else.  The whole world will be affected if the discussions break down. On the other hand, our basic industry &mdash; agriculture &mdash; could be seriously affected if the negotiations went a certain way.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 3 is in the name of Deputy Tomás Mac Giolla.  With the indulgence of the Deputy, amendment No. 53 is related and amendments Nos. 4 and 52 form an alternative composite proposal. It is proposed therefore to take, for discussion purposes, amendments Nos. 3, 4, 52 and 53 together.  Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 5, after &ldquo;reactor&rdquo;, to insert&rdquo; or any instrument or device containing fissile materials or fusion devices which have been designed, constructed, developed or prepared for any military purposes&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Bill is designed to ensure radiological protection for the public, a matter that arose in the course of ratification of the three conventions in this regard.  The Bill deals with the various uses of nuclear equipment and devices, radiological equipment and so on.  The extraordinary thing is that it does not deal at all with what people are most frightened of, that is, nuclear explosives, nuclear bombs, weapons and so on.  My amendment is intended to deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A basic flaw of the Bill is that it does not deal with the issues that have most frightened people over the past 45 years since Hiroshima and Nagasaki were wiped out by atomic weapons.  Those events have over-shadowed everything else that has happened in the world since and have most moved and worried people, young and old alike.  In those 45 years, there has been the extraordinary development of even more massive weapons with the capability of destroying the whole earth and all the people who <Col N="1248" /> dwell on it.  The question clearly arises as to how we can be protected in the event of nuclear explosions and so on.  Much has been learned about this because of the hundreds of thousands of people who died, indeed those who are still dying, in Japan from the effects of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, indeed the effects on future generations. All of these have been measured scientifically and people are much more knowledgeable today than they were in 1945.  There are ways of protecting people in the event of some madness overtaking the world when nuclear weapons would be used or indeed as a result of accidental explosions of nuclear weapons.</P>
    <P>When this Bill was being talked about it was assumed that that would have been one of the areas covered by its provisions, that is protection of people in the event of nuclear explosions, protection from nuclear weapons, knowledge of when nuclear weapons might come near us, passing through or over us, coming into our stores or whatever.  All of that would be relevant to a Bill of this nature.</P>
    <P>That is why I tabled this amendment which differs somewhat from others tabled by Deputies Richard Bruton, Pattison and Garland in regard to nuclear explosive devices.  In section 2, the interpretation section, there is a definition of &ldquo;nuclear device&rdquo;.  The intention of my amendment is to include in that definition the words &ldquo;or any instrument or device containing fissile materials or fusion devices which have been designed, constructed, developed or prepared for any military purposes.&rdquo;  I am suggesting the inclusion of those words after the word &ldquo;reactor&rdquo; in page 6, line 5, as a more comprehensive definition of what &ldquo;nuclear device&rdquo; means.  The term &ldquo;nuclear device&rdquo; appears regularly throughout the Bill, particularly in Part II, sections 7 and 8, where one finds the term &ldquo;nuclear device&rdquo; referred to perhaps 10 or 12 times.</P>
    <P>Inserting a definition of &ldquo;nuclear explosive device&rdquo; as a separate issue I do not think will be of much assistance <Col N="1249" /> because that term will not appear elsewhere in the Bill although various amendments can be tabled to ensure they do appear in the Bill.  But at present it makes it somewhat more complicated to insert a separate definition which would have to be included by way of various amendments throughout the Bill.</P>
    <P>I believe my amendment covers the purpose very clearly.  People may wonder where the words I have used emanated from.  They are taken from a Bill introduced in the House of Commons a couple of years ago generally for the same purposes. In that Bill &ldquo;nuclear weapons&rdquo; were described as &ldquo;any instrument or device containing fissile materials or fusion devices which have been designed, constructed, developed or prepared for any military purposes&rdquo;.  That was a Private Members' Bill introduced by the British Labour Party a couple of years ago from which I borrowed the words I have just quoted.</P>
    <P>An amendment defining &ldquo;nuclear explosive device&rdquo; which I had considered including for some time was a definition contained in a proposed Bill&mdash;a Nuclear Free Zone Bill, 1988 &mdash; suggested by CND and others.  In that proposed Bill, the term &ldquo;nuclear explosive device&rdquo; appeared in several sections, in fact seven times in the course of 17 lines.</P>
    <P>My amendment has been tabled and is designed to include nuclear weapons and all possible definitions of &ldquo;nuclear weapons&rdquo; in this Bill under the term &ldquo;nuclear device&rdquo; so that wherever &ldquo;nuclear device&rdquo; appears in the Bill it will be understood to mean nuclear weapons in the terms in which I have defined them, that is containing fissile materials and so on.  The purpose is to ensure that nuclear weapons are kept from our shores and skies.</P>
    <P>Much work has been undertaken and documentation introduced in regard to nuclear-powered ships and ships carrying nuclear weapons but very little study has been undertaken or information been made available in regard to aeroplanes which carry nuclear weapons.  Since 1987 we have been asking parliamentary questions as to how many authorised over-flights <Col N="1250" /> of this country have occurred in the preceding year.  We have ascertained that there have been huge numbers of over-flights; I think there were 11,000 in 1987, approximately 8,000 in 1988 and 9,000 in 1989, those sorts of figures.  In those years, to my knowledge, something in the region of eight or ten overflights only were refused.  We do not have any information on why those overflights were refused; there could be many reasons therefor.  The most likely reason for their refusal would be that they may have been cross-Border flights when the British Army might ask to be allowed an overflight of our territory for some particular purpose, perhaps some kind of follow-up operation, which might be refused.  We do not know the reasons but a handful only have been refused.  There is no information whatsoever that any was refused by virtue of the fact that some inspectors had gone aboard and found something on those planes that should not have been carried on such an overflight.  Of course, the Government and the Department of Foreign Affairs assume that nuclear weapons of any kind are not being carried aboard such over-flights, although they have no information to that effect; this assumption is made purely on the basis of trust.</P>
    <P>The American Government will never say, &ldquo;No, we are not&rdquo;.  They will neither confirm nor deny as to whether there will be nuclear weapons on board.  The Government assume and trust them not to carry nuclear weapons or nuclear bombs across our territory.  Similarly the Government take it on trust that ships coming here have not got nuclear weapons on board or are not nuclear powered. I do not know the policy of some other governments.  Maybe they say yes or no but the American Government's policy is to say neither yes or no, they do not confirm nor deny.</P>
    <P>Greenpeace, that extraordinary brave and diligent organisation, have done an immense amount of work and study in America.  Under the America Freedom of Information Act they are able to get considerable information by digging, but it means a great deal of digging out <Col N="1251" /> material in regard to ships.  By digging out this material they discovered the ships which were nuclear powered, which of them carried nuclear weaponry and which were capable of carrying nuclear weapons &mdash; many ships are not capable of carrying nuclear weapons and some ships that used to carry them have become obsolete.  A number of frigates are now known not to be nuclear capable. If this Government had gone to the trouble of seeking the type of information Greenpeace got and published they would be able to say which ships are nuclear capable and which are not.  They would also be able to say which ships were potential carriers of nuclear weapons and, on that basis there would be certain ships they could allow in and others they could bar because of their nuclear capability.  However, this Government took no steps towards studying the situation or anything else. They just allow vessels in on trust.</P>
    <P>Vessels are not supposed to come in if they are on naval exercises.  Of course, many of the ships have come here almost directly from naval exercises and have been allowed here for crew relief at the end of their exercises.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 53 deals with the question of preventing the entry of ships carrying nuclear weapons and the prevention of over-flights of planes which may be carrying nuclear weaponry.  It is a fairly lengthy amendment and I would like to deal with it after I hear the Minister's comments on amendment No. 3, because we need quite an amount of information from him in regard to ships and planes entering and leaving our territory.</P>
    <P>Another area I would like to mention that carries great dangers for us in regard to possible nuclear weapons, is the fact that submarines speeding up and down off our coast outside Dublin&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Ceann Comhairle has instructed us that we may discuss amendments Nos. 3, 4, 52 and 53 together.  I propose to leave most of the discussion on amendment No. 53 for the moment but I want to refer to one other possible danger of nuclear weapons which is the submarines chasing up and down our shores, which are such a great danger not only to our fishermen but to others as well.  Five Belgian fishermen were drowned a year ago and four Scottish fishermen were drowned recently. Let us consider the great danger from an accident such as occurred when the <i>Nathaniel Greene</i> went aground on the Wexford coast and we were told nothing about it.  The American Government never even contacted us or told us there was an accident.  This was very serious. Had any fire or explosion followed that accident it could have had enormous repercussions for us, and this can happen at any time because of the huge number of submarines travelling up and down our coasts, whether they are American, Russian, British, French or whatever.  It is difficult to understand why the Government have not taken more serious action publicly at both UN and European levels to ensure that all this traffic going into and out of Holy Loch and coming down the Irish Sea cannot get to the Atlantic north of our coast and take that route to wherever they are going.  Furthermore, submarines using the Irish Sea should travel on the surface.  The Government have been asked for years about this. One of the greatest protections that can be given to our citizens is either to stop this traffic or ensure it is all on the surface and that there are no submerged submarines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously, if they cannot see fishing vessels, how can they see our passenger ferries?  This is a real danger to passenger <Col N="1253" /> traffic on the Irish Sea.  Last year a submarine was carrying sonar equipment which an Irish trawler took up in its nets. That is the other danger to our country and our people where radiological protection is needed and which is not covered in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The question of nuclear weapons which I have defined in this amendment is not dealt with anywhere in the Bill and unless this or some similar amendment is inserted, this Bill will be useless when it comes to dealing with nuclear weapons, nuclear accidents off our shores, nuclear weapons exploding in the sky when these planes crash, possibly into passenger planes, etc.  We must protect our skies and our seas from nuclear weapons and devices.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Gabh mo leith-scéal, we have only one amendment formally moved and we are discussing the others with it.  If the Deputy wishes a question to be put at the appropriate time we can do that, but we make our contributions on the relevant amendments now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for clarifying that.  I share the concern expressed by Deputy Mac Giolla that there is a gaping hole in this Bill if we do not face up to the issue of military sources of radiological hazard.  We are providing in this Bill a mechanism for regulating many of the radiological hazards to which our people are being exposed.  Perhaps there has been excessive emphasis in the public mind about the hazards of civil uses of radiation in this country when in reality the greatest hazards in an international context are from military sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish policy is very clear in this area. Irish policy is that no naval vessel shall enter Irish waters if it is carrying nuclear weapons, and no vessel shall enter Irish waters if it is part of a naval exercise.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has reiterated on several occasions that this policy is conveyed to any country requesting <Col N="1254" /> to make a visit to Ireland.  He also, I understand, has some form of consultations with the Governments making the request, though the precise nature of these consultations is very vague.</P>
    <P>However, as recently as last November, the Minister assured the House that the Government are confident that existing arrangements are adequate to ensure that the conditions laid down are upheld. As many Deputies will have read, a recent Greenpeace study looked at the situation with 13 recent US naval visits to Irish ports.  Their findings were quite startling and certainly put in question the Minister's assurances that our policies are being upheld.  The Greenpeace survey showed that only two of those 13 ships that visited Irish ports were not nuclear-capable. It also showed that six of them had received nuclear weapons inspections prior to their visit, and that, allegedly, is done only if they are going to be actively carrying nuclear weapons in the course of a particular naval operation. They also found that ten of the 13 were involved in major naval exercises and many of them were only visiting an Irish port in the course of the naval exercise they were involved in.  From the Greenpeace report there is very strong <i>prima facie</i> evidence that our policy is not being respected in practice and, of course, as has been often pointed out, there is a policy among all nuclear powers that I know of, certainly in the UK, Europe and the US, of neither confirming nor denying that nuclear weapons are being carried by a particular ship or aircraft. The combination of the Greenpeace evidence, the vagueness of existing systems for policing our policy, and the policy of the nuclear powers, puts into considerable doubt whether our policy is being respected.</P>
    <P>The situation is similar in relation to military aircraft overflights.  We have evidence from the Department of Foreign Affairs that last year there were about 7,000 military overflights, about 4,000 from the US, 1,400 from the UK, 375 from West Germany and 560, roughly from Canada and many other countries in the Eastern and Western <Col N="1255" /> blocs, to use the old language of the Cold War.  Again the situation in relation to those is vague.  It would appear that it is simply that we have a clear policy that these aircraft must be carrying no arms, ammunition or explosives, they must not engage in intelligence gathering and must not form part of military exercises or operations.</P>
    <P>Again in this area we run up against the same difficulty.  As Deputy Mac Giolla has pointed out, while there is no research work as to what these military craft may have been doing, there is a genuine concern among many members of the public and Members of the House here that there may in fact be a breach of our strict requirements in regard to military overflights and that, in fact, all that is happening is that our policy is notified to the powers concerned and, once we are satisfied that they understand what our policy is, that is the end of the matter.</P>
    <P>What this set of amendments is attempting to do is to provide a system where there would be some actual certification procedure involved so that naval visits or military overflights would be preceded by a certificate making it quite clear that they were not carrying nuclear explosive devices.  The purpose of this amendment is simply to underpin and to strengthen in law the existing practice of the Irish Government, and I think it is a very reasonable request.  It means that we will have some certificate from the various powers stating that they are observing our policy.  That is a very significant advance.</P>
    <P>In the case of military overflights, it is highly unlikely that we will be able to undertake inspections.  Nonetheless we will have documentary statements from those requesting the facility of overflight that they do respect our policy, and that would be a very considerable advance.  It is ironic that this is not in the Bill because in section 30 the Minister is providing himself with very wide powers under which he will by order regulate, restrict or prohibit the custody, production, processing, handling, holding, storage, <Col N="1256" /> manufacture, use, importation, distribution, transportation, exportation or other disposal of radioactive substances, nuclear devices and so on.  He is giving himself those very explicit powers to regulate or prohibit, and he is also saying that he would have particular regard to apparatus that may, in his opinion, be a danger to the life or health of any person. In the context of that section of the Bill, it is quite clear that the Minister has the powers to provide the sort of regulation we have in mind.</P>
    <P>What Deputies on this side of the House are trying to do in this amendment is go beyond the enabling powers that appear to be in section 30 and provide that the Minister would exercise those powers in a certain way.  That is the purpose of the amendment I have tabled. Other Deputies have tabled similar amendments.  The amendment specifically requires the production of a certificate from the relevant foreign state that the ship, submarine, hovercraft or aircraft in question does not carry any nuclear explosive device.  It is just taking the enabling section of the Minister's Act and underwriting a certain portion of it.</P>
    <P>The context of this issue is in a Europe that is heading towards political union and my party believe that in this context the whole issue of traditional neutrality which we have espoused is worth reexamining. We believe that a Europe worth creating is certainly worth defending but it is vital that Ireland have an actual input into the shape of any scheme of European defence when that becomes an integral part of political union.  It is equally important that Ireland be seen to be pressing for a non-nuclear form of defence of Europe and that specifically there would be no further nuclear expansion but rather the gradual elimination of the store of nuclear weapons and the remit within which nuclear weapons are moving.</P>
    <P>This amendment to the Bill underpins the general position that Ireland should be adopting.  We must be seen to be serious about prohibiting nuclear weapons from passing through our territory. I think we cannot declare that sort of <Col N="1257" /> policy in principle and then turn a blind eye to what are certainly <i>prima facie</i> breaches of the policy.  It is timely that we adopt this amendment and be seen to be serious about nuclear disarmament and the protection of the public from the hazards of radiation be they civil or military. I hope this amendment commends itself to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope these amendments are accepted by the Minister.  We cannot afford to be wishy-washy about the dangers of nuclear activity.  The purpose of the Bill is to give effect to certain international conventions among other things.  The countries which are parties to these conventions mainly have vested interests in the use of nuclear weapons. We must view the inadequate provisions concerning nuclear weapons with caution because countries with nuclear weapons are very sensitive and secretive about them.  It is too much for us to believe that every overflight and every military ship that visits this country does not carry nuclear weapons of any kind.</P>
      <P>In a booklet published some time ago entitled <i>The Case for a Nuclear Free Ireland,</i> published by the Local Government and Public Services Union, and the Irish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, US Rear Admiral Gene LaRoque, a former Pentagon strategic planner stated:</P>
      <P>My experience has been that any ship capable of carrying nucler weapons, carries nuclear weapons...They do not offload them when they go into foreign ports.</P>
      <P>That is an accurate and honest statement. We need the kind of amendments we are discussing.  We cannot give the kind of protection this Bill seeks to give unless we deal with the danger posed by nuclear weapons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every country is exposed to the danger of a nuclear accident be it civil or military. There is a 50-50 chance of an accident occurring and I hope the Minister accepts the amendments to help us try to prevent one.  It could be argued that with the Warsaw Pact almost a thing of the past, <Col N="1258" /> and a reduction in NATO exercises, these dangers will recede.  We have a great opportunity to lead other nations on this question.</P>
    <P>Many countries closed down their nuclear power stations over the last five years but with the uncertainty in the Gulf there is a great temptation to set them up again and develop them.  That temptation must be resisted.  By accepting these amendments we can show the way.  We can then encourage other countries to follow suit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak to amendment No. 4 which is very similar to amendment No. 3 proposed by Deputy Mac Giolla.  Deputies Bruton, Pattison and I put down amendment No. 4 jointly and there is great need for it as there is for amendments Nos. 52 and 53.  We must be clear that it is essential for this country to be declared a nuclear free zone.  This Bill provides an excellent opportunity to do that.  My amendments would bring this about.</P>
      <P>New Zealand is a nuclear free zone and that is greatly to their credit.  Apart from a few small Pacific islands New Zealand is the only major country which has declared itself to be a nuclear free zone. The Minister should take this on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of overflights and visits to our ports of nuclear capable vessels has been adequately dealt with by previous speakers and there is nothing useful I could add.  Many of us are becoming increasingly concerned with the very slow nuclear military wind down by the great powers, particularly France, US, Britain and Russia.  The Cold War has been over for a long time now and one wonders why it is necessary to have nuclear submarines going up and down the Irish Sea.  Is it just a question of the governments in those countries not having faced up to the short term economic problems that would be caused by a wholesale reduction in arms? There is talk about massive unemployment, particularly in America, in the arms industry both in civil employment and in the army.  If western capitalism is to survive, this is one of its greatest challenges.  How will it cope with the <Col N="1259" /> huge numbers of people coming back into the labour force?  Will arms manufacturers think of reasons why people should be employed in the industry?  We should keep these thoughts in mind at all times.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in sympathy with the amendments.  They have certainly been tabled with the best of intent and with full meaning and understanding of the enormity of the problem of nuclear overflights, nuclear submarines and also the transporting of nuclear spent fuel to the enormous Sellafield cesspit on our doorstep.  Continuing attempts have been made by the nuclear industry to hoodwink the population of various countries about what they are doing.  It is very difficult to get information that could even be put in front of this House about the number of shipments or overflights that occur.  It is ironic that on a day-to-day basis we issue in our newspapers health warnings such as asthma counts, smog counts and so on while yet this deadly fuel is passing our doorstep practically every day of the week.  Some major accident will take place before people sit up and take notice.  Chernobyl is a classic example.</P>
      <P>I must avail of the opportunity today to finger-point Sellafield once again.  This is the plant where the refurbishment of atomic warheads take place.  That is the principal danger to this country.  Anybody who took an interest in the Sellafield plant and its activities over the years will realise that a lot of the information emanating from that plant is grossly inaccurate and unreliable.  There were so many contradictions that people were tripping up, not realising they were contradicting what was said a year or two ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suffice it to say that Sellafield have engaged in a massive public relations exercise costing millions of pounds to try to instil in the public mind that they are dealing with a safe industry.  They speak proudly of the thousands of tourists who come to the hinterland of Cumbria to look around that plant, and the percentage of people who go away feeling <Col N="1260" /> more assured.  It is an absolute disgrace that that type of hoodwinking or evading of issues that are of major concern to this country is allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>There should be continual warnings of nuclear ships or spent fuel along the Irish Sea.  There should also be warnings of overflights.  I am concerned about this matter because I feel that perhaps it should come within the ambit of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I hope we are not limiting ourselves in the input we are trying to make.  I am quite certain the Minister will refer to that in his reply. It is important that the Department of Foreign Affairs are involved at this stage.</P>
    <P>I subscribe very strongly to Deputy Garland's suggestion that Ireland should become a nuclear-free zone.  This has been on the stocks for many years and it would be an ideal opportunity for Ireland to so define itself.  It is ironic that New Zealand on the other side of the world should be termed a nuclear-free zone. Why should Ireland not also be so termed?  It would be an example in Europe where techniques of manufacturing in this industry that were deemed impossible ten or 15 years ago, such as the storage of waste nuclear fuels are now becoming possible.  We are destroying the planet by dumping spent fuel, perhaps not knowing that in ten or 15 years time this practice will be superseded by more modern techniques and that we will be leaving a legacy of catastrophic proportions.</P>
    <P>If at all possible the Minister should take cognisance of some of the points made by previous speakers.  The contributions were made with the utmost commitment to their particular cause.  I have been fairly close to Greenpeace over the years, an organisation I have very greatly admired.  Were it not for the fact that this small organisation in their international efforts flew the flag of peace as regards nuclear power, a lot more destruction could have occurred.</P>
    <P>We do not like to feel that in Ireland we are a voice in the wilderness as regards this huge question.  Our neighbour, Britain, at times views this country with <Col N="1261" /> great concern, realising that a huge percentage of her own population along the coastline live in similar fear of nuclear warheads and spent fuel.  We must take a very strong stand here.  We should use Europe as our springboard for attention. I certainly would see no harm in this country setting an example of allotting a certain amount of money per year from the fiscal budget to try to counteract the abominable public relations exercise that takes place at Sellafield.  Perhaps other countries would then follow suit.  The Minister should take the initiative in trying to set up some kind of international warning system for the movement of nuclear warheads throughout the world. Quite obviously there would be strong resistance from the superpowers, but so be it.  We should make our voice heard. Ireland is making a strong stand in this field.  We owe it to future generations primarily &mdash; we are essentially birds of passage on this planet &mdash; to preserve the planet.  As I have said, I am in sympathy with these amendments and I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a coincidence that I am speaking after Deputy Brady because, as I recollect, in the years 1982 and 1983 when this whole matter was a Cinderella issue in this country, Deputy Brady and I came in here week after week to raise such matters as what was once called Windscale, the whole question of the disposal of toxic chemical waste, and the discharge of nuclear liquid waste into the Irish Sea.  At times our protests fell on deaf ears of Ministers from all Governments. It was only when the matter became a high profile issue internationally that people started to take notice in this country.  As a result we were left behind in our legislative programme regarding nuclear, toxic and chemical waste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The week before last I paid a visit to Kiev which is only 80 miles from Chernobyl. I went to see the ecological outfall from the Chernobyl disaster, visited medical facilities and met ecological experts and civic leaders in Kiev who outlined to my colleagues and me the <Col N="1262" /> outfall from that trans-Continental &mdash; as I term it &mdash; disaster.  There are still question marks over the quality of products coming from the area round Chernobyl to Kiev.  Kiev is very dependent on fruit and vegetables from the district and we were told when the accident occurred that people, from a sense of duty, rushed to Chernobyl to rescue those who wanted to leave.  Indeed, many people wanted to stay but those who wanted to go were brought out quickly.  The residents of Kiev recognised early on that the rescue effort was contaminating Kiev because the trucks, lorries and trains going in and out of Chernobyl were bringing back the contaminated dust and soil on their wheels.</P>
    <P>Chernobyl was the time bomb on their door step and we also have a time bomb on ours.  Nobody should say that Sellafield is 100 per cent safe, it is not, it is only as safe as man's ability to make it so.  I have been a frequent visitor to Sellafield &mdash; I was there in 1983 when it was called Windscale &mdash; and they changed the name to Sellafield as a result of a public relations exercise.  I was also there in 1987 and on both occasions, despite the massive public relations effort which was put into our visit, I came away unconvinced of its safety, to the disappointment of British Nuclear Fuels.</P>
    <P>Sellafield is one of the most lethal nuclear projects in the world in that it is not just a nuclear generating station, it is a nuclear processing plant, and there is traffic in and out, week in week out, from all parts of the world.  It is one of the keystones of the British economy because it is processing &mdash; and reprocessing &mdash; fuels for the world nuclear industry.  I am afraid that today we use a lot of energy in looking at what are at times harmless incursions to our ports while, at the same time, there is very dangerous traffic up and down the Irish Sea which, at times, is not even notified to the authorities here.  The time is now ripe for an international inspectorate for Sellafield to report on even minor incidents there because, in the past, incidents have been misrepresented by British Nuclear Fuels and, indeed, not reported <Col N="1263" /> until previous Governments set up a bilateral agreement.  At the same time, we are still dependent on the goodwill of Britain to inform our Government of what happens there.  Until such time as there is an international inspectorate, not only looking at Sellafield but at other nuclear plants throughout Europe, I will feel unsafe.  I am sure that applies to people here and in Europe because we hear daily of nuclear plants in Czechoslovakia and throughout Eastern Europe. This is the time to put in place a bilateral agreement between the European Community and the nations of Eastern Europe.  It should consist of an international inspectorate which would monitor activities in all nuclear plants, East and West.  The example of Chernobyl is that nuclear pollution does not recognise boundaries and that is why the time is ripe for a major international agreement involving an inspectorate examining all those plants from Britain to the Urals.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brady rightly referred to the problem of storage of the high level nuclear radioactive waste in Sellafield. The problem has not been resolved because they are still toying with the idea of storing waste under the Irish Sea.  They will proceed with that and nobody will stop them unless we get our act together. We have highly toxic nuclear waste here and we do not have a policy in relation to its disposal.  We depend on Britain to dispose of our waste and until we have a comprehensive national policy for the disposal of our toxic chemical and radioactive waste, we will be compromised in our attitude to our European neighbours and &mdash; more important &mdash; compromised in our opposition to Britain's sinister moves to store high level radioactive waste under the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>For all our sakes, I ask the Government &mdash; in a non-political way &mdash; to proceed with a policy in relation to the disposal and treatment of waste as quickly as possible. There is no point in telling us that it is being examined by a committee or a commission.  They have been looking at the problem for years and now is the time to grasp the nettle.  A site for the <Col N="1264" /> treatment plant should be identified and it should be built quickly.  The Government should come clean on this issue.  I know the Minister will say that he has plans in this regard but this has been going on for years and it is just a cop-out.</P>
    <P>Vessels come in and out of our ports. I come from a port city which is nuclear free and this amendment poses difficulties for it.  Ships come in from the United States and the USSR &mdash; a huge naval ship came from the USSR recently which was very welcome; it was a training and military ship &mdash; but there must be a fine tuning of this amendment on Report Stage.  It must be more specific and deal with ships which are military but not obviously capable of carrying nucler weapons. Under the terms of the amendment, the recent Russian visitor to Cork which brought in 600 cadets and a lot of business to the city, would, I am afraid, be debarred from entering that port in future.  This would also apply to the huge aircraft carriers.  Ships which are obviously not carrying nuclear weapons should be allowed access to our ports and there must be a way round these difficulties.</P>
    <P>Aircraft overflights is a non-issue. There may be a problem but we are still very much dependent on the goodwill of our colleagues in the international community. We do not have the capability of intercepting or &mdash; to be more dramatic &mdash; shooting down aeroplanes which invade our air space.  Goodwill is the important word.</P>
    <P>I hope the time will come, in the foreseeable future, when this amendment will be a non-issue and when the ongoing programme of countries eliminating nuclear weapons will continue.  Deputy Bruton implied, and I agree with him, that we must be a part of Europe, prepared not only to build Europe but to defend Europe.  What we build and invest in we must defend.  If somebody invades my house or property I will defend it. Likewise our role in Europe is to be willing and full partners.</P>

      <P>We have had wide ranging contributions on the four amendments before us.  Many of the matters raised were outside my area of responsibility and in some cases were outside the jurisdiction of the State.  I sympathise with many of the sentiments expressed.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 3 in the name of Deputy Mac Giolla proposes in the interpretation section to insert new wording after the word &ldquo;reactor&rdquo;.  I cannot accept this on the basis that the definition for nuclear device and nuclear reactor already contained in section 2 is quite sufficient and all embracing.  If we were to include the concept of military purpose by extending the definition of nuclear device this could have the negative effect of excluding these devices for civil purposes, which I am sure is not what the Deputy had in mind.</P>
      <P>In regard to the insertion of a definition for nuclear explosive devices.  I have to oppose that on the basis that the definition of nuclear device is already in the text and covers the concept of nuclear explosive device.  In the section, &ldquo;nuclear device&rdquo; is defined as including &ldquo;any machine or apparatus the operation of which involves the use of a radioactive substance, and irradiating apparatus or a nuclear reactor&rdquo;.  The definition covers devices regardless of whether they are explosive devices or of whether they are military or civil devices.  Therefore, what the amendment seeks is already covered in the Bill.  I hope the House will accept that explanation with regard to that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1266" /> Amendments Nos. 52 and 53 deal with the question of the entry of foreign military aircraft into our airspace and the entry of ships into our territory.  Ireland's policy of opposition to nuclear weapons is clear and unequivocal.  The only acceptable level of nuclear weapons is zero. Our policy in relation to the exclusion of nuclear weapons is also clear.  Permission will not be granted to any vessel or aircraft carrying nuclear weapons to enter our territory.  The entry of foreign military aircraft into our airspace and landings of such aircraft in the State are already covered under legislation.  The strict controls which exist under the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order, 1952 provide that no foreign military aircraft shall fly over Ireland unless at the express invitation or with the express permission of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  In addition, any aircraft involved must comply with any stipulations as the Minister may make.  Information such as identification numbers and aircraft types must be provided.  In seeking permission it is also necessary to state whether the aircraft complies with certain conditions, the most important of which are that they are unarmed, carry no arms, ammunition or intelligence gathering equipment and do not form part of any military exercise or operation. It should be clear that the Government's policy is not to permit nuclear weapons to enter our airspace.  Ireland is not a member of any military alliance and thus will remain free from any commitments that that might entail, in particular, the admission of nuclear weapons.  Foreign governments are aware of our policy on ships' visits and overflights and are reminded of this policy on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>The Government are not aware that any nuclear vessels have been brought into the State in vessels or aircraft nor are circumstances envisaged in which such is likely to occur.  Public safety is not endangered nor is long established opposition to these weapons being abused, threatened, tested or in any way misunderstood.</P>
    <P>The Greenpeace report was quoted by some Deputies and I understand that the <Col N="1267" /> Minister for Foreign Affairs has already responded to some paramount questions with regard to that matter.  Indeed, this whole area is a matter which is the responsibility of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and not of the Minister for Energy.  In order to help the House and the Deputies who put down these amendments I have sought to give the House as much information as I can.  I understand that the evidence provided in the Greenpeace report is almost entirely circumstantial in nature.  In fact in the presentation of a similar report to the Swedish Government, Greenpeace acknowledged that a US nuclear capable vessel which they had insisted was carrying weapons was later found not to have been doing so.  The Greenpeace research officer offers no proof that nuclear capable vessels are carrying nuclear weapons when they visit.  To suggest that because a vessel has a nuclear capability and pays a visit here it is therefore a vessel carrying nuclear weapons is a fair stretch of the imagination.  I am sure the House will agree that it would not be sufficient grounds to exclude a vessel to say that it had the potential to carry nuclear weapons. The official position here is that as long as the vessel is not carrying weapons it is in compliance with the regulations and with Government policy.  We do not grant permission to vessels which are nuclear powered.</P>
    <P>Submarines have been mentioned and it is important to stress that submarines travel on the surface in our territorial waters.  They must travel on the surface and must fly a flag.  Under international law they have the right of innocent passage. This relates to the problem which has been highlighted in regard to Sellafield and the transshipment of nuclear waste for reprocessing there.  Under international law all vessels have a right of innocent passage through the territorial waters of another state provided, in the case of submarines, they travel on the surface and carry their flags for identification.  Specific authorisation to exercise this right or notification that it <Col N="1268" /> has been exercised is not required.  Therefore, it is not possible to monitor the frequency and extent of such traffic.  Vessels of all nations, including submarines, have free access to the international waters outside the 12 mile limit.  In the present state of international law it is not possible to ban their passage through international waters or to ban their innocent passage on the surface through our territorial waters.  I am only giving the explanation here and the official Government policy on it, even though it is not a matter that comes under my own area of responsibility in the Department of Energy.</P>
    <P>As the House, and the Deputies who raised this matter, know it comes under the area of responsibility of the Minister for Foreign Affairs who has answered a number of questions on this issue recently.  Much information has already been put on the record of the House in regard to that matter.  It is not appropriate to deal with the matter under the provisions of this Bill.  For those reasons I cannot accept the amendments.  There is no need for the first two amendments and the third is not appropriate to this Bill.  The Department of Foreign Affairs have given assurances on numerous occasions that their requirements are adhered to and there is no evidence to suggest they are not being adhered to. They are fully satisfied with the procedures laid down and that they are operated effectively.</P>

      <P>I found the Minister's reply amazing.  I thought he would dwell on explaining why it was not necessary to put in this Bill any reference to nuclear weapons, nuclear bombs, nuclear explosive devices, etc.  Now he tells us that the Bill covers all those items.  That is an extraordinary statement.  He says the fact that the Bill states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;nuclear device&rdquo; includes any machine or apparatus the operation of which involves the use of a radioactive substance,....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>means that nuclear weapons, nuclear bombs, nuclear explosive devices are all <Col N="1269" /> covered in that definition.  We would be delighted if that were the case but why not make it clear?  What is the problem about making it clear in the Bill that this covers nuclear explosive devices, nuclear weapons and any word one cares to mention for atom bombs, nuclear bombs, neutron bombs or anything of that nature?  I cannot understand the Minister's attitude in explaining that all those devices are covered in the Bill.  They are not all covered in the Bill when nobody else can see it, except himself and his advisers.  Why not make it clear so that if the occasion arises, the judge on the bench will be able to see it but as the Bill is worded, the judge will not be able to see that.  If the Minister wants to have those devices included he must write them into the Bill.  I found it amazing that he should say we are all blind, except himself.  That is how I interpret his comments when he says those items are included in the Bill when it is obvious that they are not.  No judge in any court would say this definition covers nuclear weapons, nuclear bombs, etc.  He would look at the Bill but would not find them there.</P>
    <P>The purpose of legislation is to ensure that everything we mean when we are passing legislation is clear to the public as well as to the Judiciary.  That is what the Judiciary want to know when a case comes before them and there is a question of penalties for breach of the regulations, and this is the type of thing the general public will want to know.  If the Minister is an anxious as we are to see that nuclear weapons are included, I would urge him to look again at a wording which would ensure that it is obvious to us all that they are included.  In his reply the Minister said the definition in the Bill was quite sufficient and all embracing.  I do not know what he means by &ldquo;quite sufficient and all embracing&rdquo;.  I take it he means it covers nuclear weapons and nuclear bombs.</P>
    <P>The Minister tried to explain the Department of Foreign Affairs' policy which has been said repeatedly, in precisely the same words, by the Department of Foreign Affairs year after year. <Col N="1270" /> We do not want any ships or vessels or aircraft coming into our territory with nuclear weapons.  They are not allowed in.  The next question is: how do you prevent them coming in?  The answer is we trust them.  We tell them they are not allowed in with nuclear weapons and then we assume they will not bring them in. That is the actual position.  The Minister knows as well as I do and the previous Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Foreign Affairs before him all gave the same answer.  That is the stark diplomatic answer to this question.  The Minister then expects the Greenpeace organisation to come up with evidence in court that they saw a nuclear weapon on board.  Anything else is only circumstantial evidence despite the enormous amount of scientific work put into the production of the information which is presented to the Government, to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and I presume the Minister for Energy would have seen it.</P>
    <P>They gave specific information on each of 13 US Navy ships which visited Irish ports.  They gave more specific information that six of the ships which visited Irish ports were not alone nuclear capable but had been fully certified by the US Navy before leaving the US ports.  Special nuclear weapons inspections were carried out to ensure they were capable of performing their assigned nuclear mission that is, to carry and launch, if necessary, nuclear weapons when they left the US ports.  From the time they left the port and visited the Irish ports and until they arrived back at the United States port, nothing would have changed.  All the evidence is there; it is circumstantial, but it is the best one can get.  That is when an inspector needs to go on board to find out whether what they say is true.  In amendments Nos. 52 and 53 we are asking the foreign Government to certify to the Department of Foreign Affairs that neither the ships nor the aircraft flying overhead are carrying nuclear weapons, that they are not part of a naval exercise or part of a military exercise.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that nuclear submarines must surface when going through <Col N="1271" /> our territorial waters within the 12 mile limit.  That is the regulation.  Has the Minister any evidence that that happens?  Has he any information about what actually happened the <i>Nathaniel Greene</i> when the ship went aground off the Wicklow coast? Was that ship in Irish territorial waters when it went aground?  Obviously it was because it could not go aground if it was surfacing; it was submerged.  What information did we get about this accident subsequently from the American Government?  Did they give us any information on the effects of the accident, the damage that was done to the ship, the danger of fire, how the accident occurred and the evidence to show it will never happen again?  Was there any evidence to suggest that the ship was not surfacing, as it was required to, and what did we do about that?</P>
    <P>These are the kind of questions people put when they get glib ministerial answers such as, &ldquo;we are all pure, we do not allow any ships carrying nuclear weapons into our waters and we do not allow any aircraft carrying nuclear weapons to overfly our country&rdquo;.  It is extraordinary that the number of overflights of this country &mdash; this issue was raised in October &mdash; which have been fairly consistent in the past year &mdash; over 300 every month &mdash; increased from 321 in June, which is about average, to 624 in July, twice as many, to 824 in August and to 725 in September.  The number of overflights in August was almost three times the average.  The total number of overflights by these aircraft was 2,173 for those three months, which is well above the average for those three months in any other year. Had this anything to do with the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait?  It is amazing that the huge increase began in July, a month before the invasion took place.  Was information available about the possibility of invasion?</P>
    <P>The point I am making is that these overflights have a direct bearing on military problems in other parts of the world. Aircraft have to overfly Ireland to get to the Gulf and other countries.  One assumes that these aircraft are carrying <Col N="1272" /> some kind of weapons.  They are military aircraft and they are taking part in some kind of manoeuvres, war games or whatever. Yet the Minister said that the Governments who own these aircraft are asked to state that the aircraft are armed and that they are part of military exercises. Did the Irish Government receive such certificates in respect of the 624 overflights in July, of the 824 overflights in August and of the 725 overflights in September?  Did each one of those 2,173 overflights certify that they were not carrying arms and were not part of any military exercise?  Are those 2,173 certificates available to show that that was the case or is there one general certificate for the year issued on 1 January stating, &ldquo;all flights for the coming year will be unarmed&rdquo; and so on?</P>
    <P>The Minister's response was not convincing and therefore the amendments we have put down must be pursued.  If the Minister can give us an assurance that he will include a provision in this section to cover nuclear weapons, explosives and so on, we will withdraw our amendments. However, we will have to press our amendments in regard to ships if the Minister cannot give us a guarantee that some certification will be required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Deputy Mac Giolla's concern about the Minister's attitude. The Minister expressed concern but it had a very hollow ring to it.  He reiterated the formula of the Department of Foreign Affairs for answering questions about non-nuclear and non-military activities in our air space and territorial waters but, once again, he slurred the key detail as to the precise regulations which are in force to exercise control over these issues.  It is quite clear from the Minister's reply that no certificate is being produced by these countries.  The Minister used phrases such as, &ldquo;foreign countries are reminded of our policy&rdquo;, and, &ldquo;our Government are not aware of any circumstances where these have been breached&rdquo;.  It is the vagueness of those <Col N="1273" /> terms which create concern.  It is not sufficient to remind people of a policy if it is their explicit policy not to provide any evidence as to whether or not they are carrying nuclear weapons.  That is the weakness in the Minister's reply.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 52 recognises that the Minister has taken unto himself the right by order, to regulate any movement related to radioactive substances. According to the Minister's definition, this includes any possible movement of military radioactivity substances.  We are not asking the Minister to break new ground outside his responsibilities.  His responsibilities are clearly defined in section 30.  It is the Minister who chooses to bury his head in the sand and hide behind Department of Foreign Affairs' pat answers produced time after time.</P>
      <P>I contend that the Minister has precisely the powers to do what we are asking him to do.  Furthermore, I contend that the whole purpose of producing the Radiological Protection Bill was to draw together into a coherent radiological protection policy strands which had been scattered through the Department of the Marine, the Department of Agriculture and Food, the Department of Health and, as we now learn, the Department of Foreign Affairs also.  If the Minister is going to sponsor a Bill which is designed to produce a coherent policy for protection of the public from the radioactive hazards all we are doing is asking him to do that and exercise the powers he has given to himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may well argue &mdash; I wish he had done so on Second Stage &mdash; that he is not the Minister to do this.  Energy is not the appropriate vehicle for carrying all this responsibility.  I would have applauded him for saying that on Second Stage and agreed that it should be a matter for the Department of the Environment or Health.  However, the Minister said on Second Stage that he must have these responsibilities and insisted that he was the one to exercise control in the area of radiological protection. Having said that on Second Stage, the Minister has the gall to come in on Committee Stage and tell us that as far as <Col N="1274" /> military overflights are concerned he is not going to go back on what has been allocated to the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>From looking at the text of the order which gave the Department of Foreign Affairs this responsibility I contend that this was simply an administrative convenience at the time.  The order was signed by Seán Lemass who was the Minister for Industry and Commerce at that time and he also held responsibility for Energy.  He conferred these powers on the Minister for Foreign Affairs simply because it was easier for him to execute it in that way as the Department of Foreign Affairs had daily contact with the Governments of other countries.  I contend that when the Minister decided to bring forward this comprehensive legislation dealing with radiological protection &mdash; we all applaud him for doing so &mdash; he took unto himself the responsibility to subsume all the previous orders.  It is quite clear from the text of section 30 that the Minister has the authority to do what we are asking him to do.  I do not accept for one minute the Minister's suggestion that this is outside his area and he cannot deal with it.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will re-think his response to this amendment.  Essentially what we are trying to do in this Bill is provide the public with a comprehensive set of protections so that people can rest easy when they see we have an institute which is dealing with their concerns about radiological hazards.  If he leaves out this crucial area he is leaving a huge gap in the Bill.  He is quite explicit that he is not willing to give the House the assurance it wants that under section 30 he will exercise his rights.  That is not good enough.</P>
    <P>Unlike Deputy Mac Giolla, I am happy to accept the Minister's assurance that the definition includes nuclear explosives. I am no expert in that field.  If the Minister is happy that it is watertight and that any court would regard his definition as including all forms of nuclear weapons, assembled or disassembled, I am happy to accept that.  I am certainly not happy to accept his rejection of the spirit of <Col N="1275" /> amendments Nos. 52 and 53 in regard to a proper certification system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the two previous speakers, I am very disappointed with the Minister's response on all points raised. It is not good enough to say that he is not aware that any of the nuclear-capable ships visiting our ports were carrying nuclear weapons.  This must be one of the greatest cop-outs of all time.  Why are these ships made nuclear-capable?  They are made nuclear-capable so that they can carry nuclear weapons.  I am not saying that on every occasion these ships are in fact carrying nuclear weapons.</P>
      <P>We must be guided by Greenpeace, an organisation who have no axe to grind and no party political stance to take.  They are an environmental group and no one has ever, as far as I know, questioned their bona fides.  I do not think the Minister is so doing, although he gets very close to it at times.  By implication he is certainly questioning their competence, something which comes very badly from the Minister.  Greenpeace are a very large organisation who have people all over the world tracking down these nuclear-capable ships.  I will write to the Minister tomorrow and give details of a specific case where Greenpeace, through methods which they do not entirely publicise, established beyond all doubt that a particular ship leaving a US port had nuclear weapons on board.  They followed the course of that ship when it visited various neutral countries, including Ireland.  In all these countries the story was the same.  They neither confirmed nor denied.  This is stretching the bounds of credulity too far.  Is the Minister saying it has never happened that a nuclear-capable ship arriving in an Irish port actually had nuclear weapons on board?  I hope he will not say that, because it would be too ludicrous for words.  I am most disappointed with his response and I have no intention of withdrawing amendments Nos. 4 and 53.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>As somebody who has had a deep interest in environmental matters <Col N="1276" /> through the years, I thought in my innocence that the advent of the Environmental Protection Agency and the passage of this Bill would bring in a comprehensive system whereby the health, well-being and quality of life of our people would be maintained and protected. We await with interest the publication of the Environmental Protection Agency Bill.</P>
      <P>I thought the Minister would have come to grips with some of the problems which the Nuclear Energy Board failed to deal with.  I was a critic of that board where I believe there was a conflict of interest.  I imagined the Minister would come to grips with the issues that have been raised over several years and which have not been tackled because of the disjointed, disorganised approach of Government Departments and agencies who were dealing with issues of environmental protection.  A few of us have today addressed these issues but the Minister said most of them were outside his brief and decided that while it was irrelevant to him he would answer what suited him.  He pushed us all off with that glib statement.</P>
      <P>The attitude of the Minister indicates that this legislation when passed will have no teeth but will be dependent on the goodwill of other people.  We are still not dealing with the real issues of environmental protection.  We will be compromised in our attitude to other people.  I must express my extreme disappointment at the anaemic attitude of the Minister to the valid points raised by Deputies.  I will leave this House tonight very dispirited because this is yet another Irish solution to an Irish problem.  We are not willing to grasp the nettle of modern living and we will still have to depend on our colleagues across the water to deal with our problems for us.  The Minister is copping out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate that I have been assured by the Nuclear Energy Board that nuclear explosive devices are already covered by the definitions in the Bill, in other words that &ldquo;nuclear device&rdquo; covers radioactive substance, whether <Col N="1277" /> explosive or non-explosive, whether military or civic.  I am glad Deputy Bruton accepts that point.</P>
      <P>I sympathise with many of the points made by Deputies but it is and has been Government policy that the movement of international ships and aircraft is a matter appropriate to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Deputies are seeking to take unfair advantage of me.  It is not a matter for me.  Deputies have raised this matter on numerous occasions with the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  This may have seemed a convenient opportunity to raise these important issues but I am precluded from taking the steps I am being requested to take because it is not my area of responsibility and it has been long-standing Government policy that these matters are the responsibility of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>The proposal to amend the Bill to include nuclear weapons in its provisions is not acceptable because it is not within the jurisdiction of my Department.  We are not a nuclear nation and do not own nuclear weapons.  Such weapons would have to be the property of some foreign government or authority.  I am not the Minister charged with responsibility for dealing with that matter.  We are dealing here with a Radiological Protection Bill whose main aim is to establish an institute which would provide for radiation protection measures and give effect to international conventions in that area.  The question posed is of a military nature and more pertinent to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I reiterate as a member of the Government that I am satisfied that our existing legislation and policy in this area is fully adequate to cover Ireland's concern with regard to nuclear weapons.  The permission of the Department of Foreign Affairs is required for visits to Irish ports by foreign naval vessels. Permission for a visit will normally be granted provided that the visit does not form part of a naval exercise and the vessel is not carrying nuclear weapons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should say to Deputy Garland that it is very easy to get up here and give the impression that one has information that an American naval vessel came into an <Col N="1278" /> Irish port with a nuclear device on board. The Deputy has not given the name of the vessel, the date on which the vessel visited a port or indeed the name of the port.  I would suggest to Deputy Garland that that is very flimsy evidence on which to base an argument in Parliament that such a thing happened.  If the Deputy wishes to make an allegation in such specific terms it is incumbent on him to present the facts.  It is not good enough to say on an occasion such as this that he has a big file on this matter over in his office but, unfortunately, he does not have it with him now.  The Deputy's office is only across the road.  I had an office in that building for a period of three or four years so I know how long it takes to go from the House to there.  I invite the Deputy before the debate concludes this evening to proceed to his office.  I am sure both the Ceann Comhairle and I would be glad to facilitate him in giving the House the specific details which are required when a Deputy makes an allegation against another state on a matter of serious importance.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has alleged that the American Government and their naval service have breached our laws and regulations with regard to these matters.  That is a very serious allegation to make against them and of course they are well capable of replying elsewhere.</P>

      <P>The point I am making is <Col N="1280" /> that it is not a matter appropriate to this Bill.  Deputy Mac Giolla suggested that permission for a visit is granted on the basis of trust.  I wish to point out that it is not granted on such a basis but rather on the basis that the visit complies with certain conditions which include that the visit does not form part of any military exercise and the vessel is not carrying nuclear weapons.  These conditions apply to all requests for permission to visit.  It should be noted that these requests are received from friendly governments with whom we have good relations.  We have no reason to believe that our policy in this area is not being respected.  If, however, Deputy Garland produces evidence which would confirm unequivocally that a friendly government have broken the conditions action would be required from the Government here.</P>

      <P>Reference has been made to a number of other matters, including the <i>Nathaniel Greene.</i>  Again, this is a matter for the Department of Foreign Affairs.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it is the tradition that I indicate with whom the responsibility lies.  The Minister concerned in this case has already replied in very generous terms to questions raised in this House by Deputies.  If Deputy Mac Giolla wishes to pursue the matter further I would recommend that he consult the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  In fact, I will ask that Minister to reply directly to the Deputies who have raised points outside my area of responsibility.  I am trying to be as helpful as I can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to establish an institute which will be as independent as possible which will take the necessary measures to protect the community living on this island, within our jurisdiction, <Col N="1281" /> from any contamination from radioactive substances, and take whatever precautions are deemed both wise and prudent to avoid this happening within our jurisdiction. It is within those terms that the Bill is structured.  The Bill will enable us to adopt certain international conventions which will be of assistance in achieving that objective.  I am sorry, but I cannot accept the amendments before the House at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would reiterate that the corollary of the Minister's statement that his definition covers nuclear weapons of any sort is that section 30 enables him to issue orders that craft have to have the type of certificate that we on this side of the House have requested.  That is as clear as day.  It was to make it convenient for themselves that they allocated this to the Department of Foreign Affairs.  If the Minister wants to see the Department of Foreign Affairs continue to collect certificates we will be happy to assist him but he has the prime responsibility to protect the public from radiological hazards. This means he has the primary responsibility to make orders.  As I say, I would be quite happy to allow him exercise the powers provided in those orders with the Department of Foreign affairs as his agent if that suits him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill makes provision for a range of activities to be carried out by various Ministers in the event of a radiological emergency.  I would hold that it should also make provision for the taking of a range of activities to prevent such a radiological emergency or nuclear disaster.  I see no problems in this regard. It is unfortunate that the responsibility to protect the people of this country is divided between two Departments and this opportunity should be taken to co-ordinate in a better way the activities aimed at preventing such a disaster rather than the measures aimed at protecting the public in the event of an emergency. To illustrate my point I quote section 31 (1) which reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purpose of protecting <Col N="1282" /> individuals from radiological hazards, the Minister, after consultation with the Ministers for Agriculture and Food, Finance, the Environment, Health and the Marine and the Institute, may prescribe by regulations levels of activity (in this Act referred to as &ldquo;prescribed levels&rdquo;) in respect of animals, fauna, poultry, eggs, crops, carcases, fodder, animal feedingstuffs, fish, seaweed, bottled water or water supplies intended for human consumption or any food.</P>
    <P>Why would not the Minister reintroduce amendments along the lines I suggest providing that he may, after consultation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, deal with the military aspect of nuclear danger?  Such a provision would undoubtedly improve the Bill.  Probably it would cover the points raised in the course of this debate because, after all, the Minister is taking unto himself in this Bill powers to consult with a number of other Ministers, as is said in the subsection I have just quoted.  It is significant that the only Minister who is not mentioned anywhere in the Bill, the very Minister we are told by the Minister present plays the sole role in protecting our country from a nuclear accident occasioned by a military aircraft, naval or any other vessel, is the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Minister tells us that is the responsibility of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, yet there is no provision in this Bill for any consultation between the Ministers for Energy and Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to take the Minister back to the purpose of this Bill which is to give effect to the provisions of the Convention on Assistance in the case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency &mdash; the Assistance Convention; the Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident &mdash; the Notification Convention; and the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material &mdash; the Protection Convention. How can we ratify the Convention on Assistance in the case of a <Col N="1283" /> nuclear accident if we are not talking about nuclear weapons coming in on board ships or even nuclear-powered submarines coming close to our coasts, which was the case with the <i>Nathaniel Greene</i>? The Minister for Energy now says that is the responsibility of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  He could say in other parts of this Bill: Sorry, that is the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment; it has nothing to do with me.  In another section he could say: Sorry, that is the responsibility of the Minister for Health; it has nothing to do with me. That is a total nonsense.</P>
      <P>The Minister must take responsibility for giving effect to the provisions of those three conventions, no matter what other Ministry is involved.  If he has a problem <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Minister for Foreign Affairs, he should raise it at Cabinet level with the Taoiseach or whoever else.  That should have been done before he ever introduced this Bill in the House.  The Minister must be responsible for ratification of these three conventions and for the contents of this Bill.  I would ask the Minister not to use the excuse that it is the responsibility of some other Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is to be established a Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland with some independence over and above that of the former Nuclear Energy Board &mdash; indeed the fear of many people about this Bill is that the institute might be just another name for the Nuclear Energy Board for which nobody had any trust or respect, particularly after their performance following on the Chernobyl accident when they were three or four days too late in their intervention &mdash; I should imagine they would have a role in ascertaining what nuclear submarines might run aground close to our coasts, in ascertaining what nuclear weapons enter Dublin Bay or indeed might be flying overhead every day of the week in this city, Galway or elsewhere.  I am sure the institute would have an interest in what is taking place all around us.  I presume the institute would come under the aegis of the Minister.  This would <Col N="1284" /> mean that, when they would seek permission to check out such happenings, the Minister would have to ensure that the Minister for Foreign Affairs would allow them do so; they would have to have their independence and be able to move about for that purpose.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that every Department crosses every other Department at some stage or other.  I am sure the Department of Justice discover that constantly, say, when the Garda want to check out something which has a bearing on another Department's competence. One cannot tie down Departments just like that.  The Minister has given us an assurance that such independence will obtain.  I suppose, in some cases, if a Chief Justice is very conscientious then, as well as reading the Bill, he will read all the reports of what was discussed at the various Stages of its passage &mdash; which would entail considerable work &mdash; in order to ascertain what the Minister said and what was his interpretation of the position.  What the Minister has said now might be of some help in that event.</P>
    <P>That is no way to pass legislation.  It is not in the Bill; I cannot see it and, no matter what assurance the Minister gives that he intends it to be in the Bill, it still is not included.  While taking the Minister at his word that it is his intention and he believes it to be in the Bill, nevertheless, I must pursue amendment No. 3 because the Minister has not changed one word since we began this discussion at 3.45 p.m., or uttered one word to indicate that, yes, he agrees it should be included in the Bill.  All he is saying &mdash; in order to satisfy us &mdash; is: look, it is there; you do not see it.  I am not at all happy with that.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Minister's attack on Deputy Garland &mdash; which I thought a bit off the wall &mdash; the evidence given by Greenpeace is as close as one can get. Six of the 11 nuclear capable ships that entered Irish ports received special nuclear weapons inspections by nuclear weapons training personnel from the US Navy and the Defence Nuclear Agency prior to their visit to Ireland.  These six ships were fully certified &mdash; this is on the certificate &mdash; as &ldquo;capable of performing <Col N="1285" /> their assigned nuclear mission&rdquo; and their assigned nuclear mission was to carry and launch nuclear weapons.  The names of these six ships were: first, the <i>USS Conte de Grasse</i> that visited Cork on 1 to 5 April 1982; second, the <i>USS Truett</i> that visited Cork on 18 to 22 May 1983; third, the <i>USS Pharris</i> that visited Cork on 21 to 27 September 1985; fourth, the <i>USS Aylwin</i> that visited Dublin on 21 to 28 &mdash; the month is not given &mdash; 1985; fifth, the <i>USS Nitro</i> that visited Dublin from 28 September to 3 October 1986 and, finally, the <i>USS Conyngham</i> that visited Cobh on 8 to 11 July 1988.  Those are six specific ships named not only as being nuclear-capable but as being nuclear-certified as well when they left port and, therefore, most likely to be carrying nuclear weapons. The Minister can contend that that is circumstantial evidence only.  Nonetheless, it is the best evidence that can be obtained from United States documents available to the Minister and the Department of Foreign Affairs, though not availed of.  Indeed, any arm of Government can as easily inspect them as can Greenpeace.  Those are the facts.</P>
    <P>I might add that the United States Government do not tell lies.  The United States Government do not give any guarantee to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The United States Government say simply: we neither confirm nor deny that there are nuclear weapons aboard. They simply seek permission to enter our ports.  Our Government say: you are not allowed enter if you have any nuclear weapons aboard.  The United States government neither confirm nor deny and sail in.  The evidence is that it is 99 per cent likely that some of those six ships that used the ports of Cobh, Cork and Dublin, were carrying nuclear weapons.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be setting up an institute to protect us against nuclear accidents, to ensure there is early notification of a nuclear accident and for physical protection from nuclear materials.  That institute would have been interested in those ships, in all such aircraft and in nuclear submarines off our coast which were carrying weapons and <Col N="1286" /> could cause nuclear accidents.  There should be early notification of the accidents and there was no notification of the <i>Nathaniel Greene</i> accident, and maybe there were others.  The institute must insist on that notification.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Minister for Energy will have to sort out his problems with the Minister for Foreign Affairs because he will have to ensure the institute are independent of all Ministers and capable of carrying out their job.  Irrespective of what the Department of Foreign Affairs, or any other Department say, they must be permitted to carry out their job to ensure that these three Conventions of Assistance, Notification and Physical Protection are adhered to.</P>

      <P>Before calling Deputy Allen I will remind the House that the first round contributions were wide ranging and unrestricted.  At times they were not strictly in accordance with a Committee Stage debate where we are obliged to deal with precisely what is in the section and the terms of amendments proposed.  I point that out before we move much further into round 2 so that I will not have to be reminding Deputies of the requirements of Committee Stage.  I appreciate this is a very special, sensitive area but we should not make the mistake of thinking this is the only opportunity we will have.  There are other sections where Deputies will be at liberty to deal specifically with what is in the amendment.  I am calling on Deputy Allen now to give example by doing the right thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect to the Chair, I will be very brief.  The Minister's last response to Deputy Garland was a very arrogant response.  I am not going to protect Deputy Garland in this House; he will do it himself but the Minister should come off his nuclear horse and get down to facts.  The expectations in this and other sections were that we would have comprehensive protection for our people against nuclear accidents, and the Minister said there would be protection <Col N="1287" /> for people in the event of a nuclear accident. In this and other sections there is no sign of any tight, effective safeguard by Government Departments or agencies in the event of a nuclear accident.  I ask the Minister to illustrate how he sees an improvement in performance in the event of a nuclear accident.  What will the difference now be in the event of an accident as against the Chernobyl incident some years ago?  Then the Nuclear Energy Board said things were not too bad, this country was OK, there was no possibility of any fall-out initially and then things changed.  We had the tragic farce of health boards not being in a position to provide iodine tablets.</P>

The Conventions which will be brought into operation, and which we are providing for in this legislation, relate to civil emergencies, civil uses and nuclear material used for peaceful purposes.  I am constrained in not being able to give a full reply.  I have no doubt the Minister for Foreign Affairs has already indicated the situation.  I am aware of the procedures that are followed and I can only go so far as to say the interpretation Deputy Mac Giolla gave of what happens is not correct. Quite a stringent set of procedures must be followed thoroughly by the officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs in regard to these matters.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to withdraw amendment No. 4 at this stage.  I am accepting the Minister's assurances that the existing definition in the Bill includes <Col N="1291" /> military nuclear explosive devices.  I will, however, be consulting in the meantime with people who are more expert in this field than I, and if I feel the Minister's assurances are not watertight I will reintroduce it on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>The point I wish to raise also applies to section 7.  It deals with an omission which may have been accidental.  In the definition of radiological emergency there is a list of items that are under threat.  It states: &ldquo;may cause any individual, animal, fauna, poultry, eggs, crops, fish, seaweed, soil, minerals (including rocks of all descriptions) air, water or other things in the State to be exposed to significant levels of ionising radiation&rdquo;.  I know that almost everything is covered there but since this list includes eggs, I am surprised that milk and meat are not included.</P>
      <P>At a time of an accident such as Chernobyl, the item which reaches the food chain before any other is milk.  If a cloud comes over the country in the morning, people could be drinking the affected milk that evening, or certainly the following morning.  I am surprised that such a specific list including eggs, fish and so on does not include milk.  Maybe it is not necessary to include all these items but I think it would be useful if milk was included.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to radiological emergencies we are speaking of being exposed to significant levels of ionising radiation, but of course the key to a radiological emergency hinges on what is meant by &ldquo;significant&rdquo;.  I wonder if the Minister will at some point provide the necessary definition as to what triggers the radiological emergency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

      <P>The institute will lay down the relevant levels subsequent to the Bill being passed, if that is not already covered under the existing nuclear <Col N="1292" /> emergency legislation.  As regards the point raised about milk and meat, they are inside the animal and are therefore covered by the inclusion of animals.</P>

      <P>Yes, I am satisfied.  I think the Deputy will agree that this is a very comprehensive Bill which enables the institute to deal very adequately with the matter he has raised.  They will give their advice to the nuclear accident committee where they feel the levels are such that emergency action is required.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister that the words &ldquo;or other thing&rdquo; would cover practically everything but, from the point of view of public perception, since eggs, poultry and fish are mentioned, people would find it surprising that milk and meat, particularly sheepmeat &mdash; the two main items about which people are concerned &mdash; are not included.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 5 in the name of Deputy Mac Giolla.  Amendment No. 6 is related and it is proposed, therefore, for discussion purposes to take amendments Nos. 5 and 6 together.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 7, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash;Where it is proposed to make an order or regulation under this Act (other than an order made under section 5 or 32 of this Act), a draft of each such order or regulation shall be laid before each of the Houses of the Oireachtas, and shall not come into effect until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the type of amendment we have put down to quite a number of Bills over the last few years regarding ministerial orders and regulations.  The Bill says &ldquo;that every order made under this Act shall be laid before the House as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the order or the regulation is passed by either such House within the next 21 days on which that House has sat after the order or the regulation is laid before it, the order or the regulation shall be annulled accordingly.&rdquo;  Small groups, Independents and individuals in the Dáil <Col N="1294" /> find it very difficult to put down a resolution annulling the order before the House within the required 21 sitting days. Apart from that, it is a much more positive thing, from a democratic point of view, that the ministerial order be laid before the House and is required to be passed before the order becomes effective. We should like to bring in a new section which means that the present section would be deleted.  The wording of the new section is in my amendment.</P>
    <P>We are entering a new area of radiological protection which may change quite a lot with new technological advances in food, preservation and so on. Where the Minister is making orders, certainly under this Bill, they should be laid before the House and required to be passed by resolution of the House, in other words, the Minister brings in a resolution of the House to pass them before they are approved.  The intention of my amendment is that ministerial regulations laid before the House will not come into effect until a resolution approving them has been passed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Deputy Mac Giolla's concern about this sort of provision and, in principle, there are many cases where the point he made is correct. Is this really necessary in the case of the two sections here?  One provides for the establishment of the institute and the other, as I understand it, provides for designating countries which are parties to the protection convention.  The 21 day provision is probably sufficient for these provisions.  If it was a more far-reaching order I would agree with Deputy Mac Giolla that the House should have the right to scrutinise it, but in this instance &mdash; maybe he will correct me if I am wrong &mdash; it seems that it is essentially just triggering things to which no one could object.  In that instance it seems reasonable that the requirement of a positive approval should perhaps be waived by the House.  I should like to hear Deputy Mac Giolla's arguments if he feels there are very strong reasons for a contrary view in this case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an important matter of principle here, that as much as possible should be done by Dáil Éireann rather than by the Government, provided it does not have the effect of unduly delaying matters.  This is a very important principle and it should apply to all these kinds of regulations.  The opportunity should be given in Dáil Éireann &mdash; and in the Seanad &mdash; to deal with these matters. Therefore, I support Deputy Mac Giolla's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this amendment on the basis that the procedure already set out in section 3 is the established practice.  The intention is to ensure that orders are made as speedily as possible and come into force without any undue delay.  This approach is especially relevant in the context of a radiological emergency, as the Deputy will appreciate, where speedy decisions are of the essence.  However, having said that, I propose an amendment to this section which I wish to move.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will ask the Minister to formally move his amendment later as we must first dispose of amendment No. 5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  The Deputy will have noted my intention to move my amendment later.  This section requires that every order or regulation made under the Act, apart from the order relating to the establishment day, must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as possible after it is made.  An order or regulation laid before the House will be annulled if either House passes a resolution within 21 days annulling the order or regulation but, of course, such annulment does not prejudice the validity of anything previously done under the order or regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fair to make an exception of the establishment day order from the requirements of that section to ensure that there is no doubt or delay relating to the chosen date of the establishment of the institute and to the dissolution of the board.  As mentioned by Deputies who <Col N="1296" /> contributed, this Bill has been a long time in preparation as certain matters caused it to be delayed.  Now that it is before the House I am sure it is the intention of Members, having debated and passed it in an amended form, that its main provisions are implemented as soon possible, in other words, that the new institute is established and the existing Nuclear Energy Board disestablished.  There should not be any need for delay in regard to this and, if we adopted Deputy Mac Giolla's proposal there could be a delay, which I do not think is his intention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>It is certainly not my intention to delay matters but I do not see how my amendment would have that effect because the Minister can bring a regulation in on the first day.  It can be laid before the House and passed straightaway, there is no problem in that regard.  When the order has been brought in you do not have to wait 21 days if the motion is moved by the Government side.  The reason for the 21 day delay is to give an opportunity to other sides of the House &mdash; or Independent Deputies &mdash; to make whatever arrangements they can to have a motion laid before the House annulling it.  I do not think it has ever happened because they have never got around to it as it is an impossible thing to do.  That is why I am saying that it is a simple, democratic procedure, the Minister brings his order before the House and it is passed on the first day. Therefore, there is no question of delaying anything and I am anxious not to hold up anything.  I want to push this amendment.</P>

      <P>Subsection (1) (c) is to advise the Government, the Minister and other Ministers of the Government on measures for the protection of individuals in the State from radiological hazards.  My amendment seeks to insert after &ldquo;advise&rdquo; the words &ldquo;the public&rdquo;. That is a very important factor.  The day has gone when information can be passed secretly to the Government but kept from the public.  This area in particular has been clouded in secrecy by Governments throughout the world.  With regard to Sellafield, for example, the deviousness in responding to things that happen there is something else.  This is a Bill for the protection of the public so the public must know what the institute are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister admitted, the response of the Nuclear Energy Board to Chernobyl was, to say the least, lacking in urgency.  It was known where the radioactive cloud was at any given time and <Col N="1298" /> other Governments were way ahead of us in monitoring and testing with a view to protecting the public.  Nothing was done here until the nuclear cloud had almost passed us.  The first monitoring began on the Sunday after considerable rain which made the problem even worse here than in other countries.  The Nuclear Energy Board were not open in their response. They responded by saying that things were not serious or significant.  They gave the same sort of glib answers we get from Windscale, from Sellafield and from British Nuclear Fuels.  We are still told that discharges are insignificant, will have no effect and so on.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in this Bill, should ensure that the public have confidence in the new institute and that they are aware of what the institute are doing.  The institute should be open to the public especially in relation to measures for the protection of individuals in the State from radiological hazards.  The institute is supposed to be independent and it is important that it should have independence from the Government.  No matter how honest or straightforward a Government or a Minister, the public will always suspect that they are covering up something. The public will have more confidence in a professional independent institute which gives information publicly.  My amendment seeks to make it one of the functions of the institute to advise the public as well as the Government, the Minister and other Government Ministers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment No. 9 is similar to that of Deputy Mac Giolla. I share his concern in this area.  We should recall the weaknesses that were exposed in the Nuclear Energy Board.  Not only were they caught off guard and proved to have defective systems of communication with the public but they had not seen their role as advising the public.  That was a very major problem exposed by the Chernobyl accident.  Their telephone lines got clogged and information did not flow freely to the public.  People were left in confusion; there was a panic reaction and concern was created.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1299" /> A very explicit mandate for the Radiological Protection Institute should be that it should have a role in advising and educating the public about radiological issues.  A very serious weakness is the lack of understanding and the lack of effort to create an understanding of radiological hazard.  That is why, for example, the problem of radon gas, an acute problem in the west of Ireland, has never been properly addressed.  The public have not been made aware by the Nuclear Energy Board and the board have not had a proper mandate to make the public aware of this hazard.</P>
    <P>I would remind the House that a previous Minister abused a similar provision in the mandate of the Nuclear Energy Board on an occasion that many in the House will recall, when an officer of the Nuclear Energy Board issued a view to the public about a particular radiological development in Britain.  He was disciplined by the Minister and the Minister insisted that in future any such statement should come through his Department and be sanitised by the Minister.  That is highly unsatisfactory.  The current Minister's party at the time were as disturbed as my party at the abuse that was permitted to the former Minister by virtue of the fact that the role given to the Nuclear Energy Board was to report to him so that he could advise the Government, but not to advise the public.  The use the Minister made of that provision was to prevent the Nuclear Energy Board from advising the public on an issue which an official thought to be of sufficient public concern and public interest that the public should have an expert view. We do not want that sort of situation to continue, and this Minister would not want such a situation to continue.  I expect that the Minister will give a very positive reaction to amendment No. 7 and amendment No. 9 which is similar.</P>
    <P>I do not want to rake over the coals but in considering this issue we must recall the Minister concerned is the Minister for Energy, and like it or not, ten years ago, the self same Minister and a colleague proposed the building of a <Col N="1300" /> nuclear plant.  In that context a radiological protection institute is the public defender against the plans of the Department of Energy.  While we all agree that there should not be nuclear capacity for Ireland, this legislation does not ban the possibility that that might occur or the possibility that a Minister could, in the future, decide that nuclear power was appropriate to Ireland.  In that context the provision of the right to advise the public independently of the Government and the Minister is a very important element in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Similar legislation in other countries where they have protection agencies of this nature, very commonly have reporting rights and advice rights to a Special Committee of the Houses of Parliament, built into it.  That is not provided for here. There are only provisions for annual reports which go to the Minister for Energy before coming to the Oireachtas. In other jurisdictions there would be direct reporting either to the public or to the Parliament.  I strongly favour the concept behind this amendment and I hope the Minister will see the wisdom of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The section could be strengthened by these amendments.  I do not know whether the matter of educating the public is provided for in the section but there does not appear to be any obligation laid down in this section to involve the public.  As has been said, the public would have an important part to play in any emergency or in any measure for their own protection.  It could be argued on the Minister's side that this is provided for in subsection (1) (c), in other words that the institute will have powers to advise the Minister for Education to introduce some educational courses to give young people an idea of what should be done in the event of an emergency.  It could be argued that the institute would also inform the Department of Health who in turn would inform their health boards and all those in the medical area on what to do.  Similarly the Department of the Environment might be informed by the institute.  Perhaps all <Col N="1301" /> that can be read into subsection (1) (c) but I hope the Minister can suggest something even more embracing than that laid in the amendments to strengthen the section because if it is seen purely as a Government or ministerial responsibility the public will not be that interested in it.  The success or otherwise of the whole exercise will depend on the co-operation of the public, and co-operation depends on the knowledge they have.  If the public have not been advised or educated in this area, it will be useless relying on a procedure involving someone going on radio and television to advise them on what they should do after a disaster has occurred.  That would be far too late.  I hope the Minister will agree to these amendments but if not perhaps he can suggest something as good or better by way of involving the public, both young and old, at all levels.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support this amendment in the name of Deputy Richard Bruton, and the other allied amendments.  I was here during the debate on Deputy Shatter's Bill proposing the setting up of an environmental protection agency.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Harney, was in the House, too, for most of that debate.  In the course of that debate we talked about radiological protection in this island and the means of ensuring it.  The Minister gave us an assurance that that was not required in the context of an environmental protection agency, that it would be handled under a Bill which was in preparation. That is the Bill we are now discussing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this new institute is to become a elitist academic body whose operations will be secret and known only to the Minister and a few close associates, then, of course, it will defeat the purpose.  If, God forbid, there was to be another accident like Chernobyl, or more minor accidents, people need to know where they can turn for advice.  It must be advice that sets their minds at rest because the whole area of radiation and accidents such as this gives rise to a considerable amount of concern and panic.  It is important that <Col N="1302" /> full public knowledge would be available.</P>
    <P>I have read the statement by the Minister for the Environment where he announced perhaps for the first, but maybe for the second, third or fourth time, the proposed environmental protection agency.  It was very much on his mind that this agency would be available for the public to contact had they complaints to make.  The Minister for Energy should take on board the concept that we must have an agency which I or anybody else can telephone for assurance or for information.</P>
    <P>I would also like to know whether, under the provisions of this amendment, an institute such as this would be available to be called to give evidence or information to an Oireachtas committee.  It would be very important that we would not be told that this is the private instrument of the Minister and cannot be questioned in any way in front of elected Members of the Dáil or Seanad.  Perhaps the Minister can tell me whether it is his intention that that institute would be so private as that.  If that were to be the case we could run into extreme difficulties.</P>
    <P>Some years ago in Sutton in north County Dublin a major problem arose where gas escaped under a block of up-market apartments.  The occupiers had to be evacuated for many weeks and did not know where to turn.  The problem was shunted from one agency to another: the county council, the Department of the Environment and the body which is now being replaced here.  Nobody wanted to take responsibility.  All that time the residents and the people in the area were not sure whether the gas which was escaping was methane or radon.  That highlighted for me, at a local level, the need for some agency where I could get direct answers with no fudging and where I would not need to have a high powered masters degree or doctorate on the subject to get some straight answers.  I hope the Minister will accept this amendment, as I am sure he will, in the openness of the party he represents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support <Col N="1303" /> either amendment No. 7 or amendment No. 9.  My instinct is that amendment No. 9 is the better one.  Later in the debate perhaps Deputy Mac Giolla will indicate his agreement with me.  I think it is better to set out the rights of the public in a separate subsection.  The Minister may say this is unnecessary and that, of course, the public will be advised.  That may or may not be so but it is important to allay the disquiet of the public.  The public are entitled to have the benefit of a specific provision in this Bill to ensure they will be advised on what is taking place.  The whole secrecy business reflects very badly.  We badly need a freedom of information Act; until we have that there will be much public disquiet about the manner in which our system works.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was explaining to the House last night, Fine Gael support the Second Stage reading of this Bill because we have changed our minds about Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  Deputy De Rossa reminded us last night of the initial reaction of my party when it was led by W. T. Cosgrave, that the Articles meant nothing, that they were only a fiction and when read together Article 3 <Col N="1304" /> neutralised Article 2, and anyway they were only aspirations.  That was the view held by the Fine Gael Party and by myself.  We were inclined to go along with the idea that a complete revision of the Constitution would be more appropriate rather than taking one or two Articles at a time.</P>
      <P>The argument has been frequently put forward &mdash; Deputy De Rossa referred to it extensively last night &mdash; that because the Unionist community in the North object to these Articles of the Constitution it is correct to amend them.  That argument does not carry that much weight with me.  I remember exactly the same arguments being advanced before the Article relating to the Catholic Church was removed from the Constitution. We were told at that stage that it was offensive to the Unionist community, which it was, and that its removal would facilitate dialogue between the two communities in the two parts of Ireland. That Article was removed by an amendment supported by all the parties in this House but, of course, once it was removed, it became, in the Unionists' eyes, just an empty formula and did not mean anything.  I suspect the same could happen to Articles 2 and 3 if they are removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said last night, the judgement handed down in the McGimpsey case changed my party's view in so far as what was an aspiration became a legal imperative. That might have been interpreted by the Provisional IRA as giving them the right to achieve by violence what the vast majority of Nationalist people both North and South want to bring about by peaceful means.  I do not have to remind the House of the record of that organisation &mdash; all of it without a mandate from the people of Ireland and engaged in by themselves &mdash; over the past 20 years.  The wanton, mindless violence has affected, either through death or injury, virtually every family in Northern Ireland.  Their latest horror is the proxy bomb whereby innocent people are battered, blackmailed and beaten up and made to drive vans or cars containing explosives which <Col N="1305" /> are designed to explode when the person is in the car and take the lives of any other people who happen to be in the vicinity at the time the explosion occurs. I certainly do not want those people to operate in my name.</P>
    <P>As I was coming through the hall this afternoon I saw the 1916 Proclamation hanging on the wall.  It states that nobody should dishonour our cause by cowardice, inhumanity or rapine.  I do not know where the IRA see the humanity in the killing two days ago of a young man who was inspecting a plot of land on which he intended to build a house for himself and his young bride.  Neither do I see the humanity in the killing of a man who came out to feed his dog the night before last.  If the IRA want to try to persuade the democratic Nationalists of this island both North and South or human beings with any kind of moral responsibility that their actions are done in the cause of uniting this country I certainly want no part of it.  I do not think there is anyone in this House or in the country as a whole who would not subscribe to that view.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House seeks to amend Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution, to have the Constitution state formally what was agreed in the Forum Report and in the Anglo-Irish Agreement, that is, that the unity of this country should be brought about only by consent and without violence.  With the exception of The Workers' Party, I think Members of all parties in this House signed the Forum Report, and I believe that anyone who signed that report should support this Bill, consequential on the judgment delivered last March. I know that is a vain hope because I understand one party in Government have already stated today that they will not support the Bill.  I suppose one always lives in hope and maybe the Taoiseach will surprise us tonight in his contribution by saying his party will support it.  In that event Deputy Quill's party will be on their own.  I do not know how they will feel about that but I understand that at times they are on their own in Cabinet, so there may be no change.  Is that right?</P>

      <P>There are a number of political and legal implications of these changes which must be explored fully by the House before the Bill is passed.  We have first to take into account the position of the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland who make up 40 per cent of the population.  At least two-thirds of them, if not more, suppoorted the New Ireland Forum and Article 1 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  They regard Articles 1 and 2 of the Constitution as their claim on the people of the Republic not to abandon them and not to ever take the problem of Northern Ireland off the political agenda here until there is peace on this island. This is an important point.  If we change the Constitution in this regard the Nationalists in Northern Ireland must know that we have not forgotten our responsibility to them and that we will continue to have their concerns and future as a central issue on this part of the island.  I have to say that the record of some members of the Fianna Fáil Party during the Presidential election has meant that people in the North are within their rights in saying that some people down here have forgotten about them and have been treating them as less than full Irish people.  That is disgraceful. However, we will have that debate at another time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as these concerns there are a number of major legal implications involved in this proposal which I do not believe the Deputies in this Parliament have given sufficient thought to.  I hope the Government will accept this Bill in the spirit in which it is presented.  If they do this, then perhaps all the parties in this House would agree to have a break between the Second Stage and Committee Stage so that a committee of legal experts could be established who would advise us on appropriate wording with which to amend Articles 2 and 3.  Over a period of 50 years the words in those Articles have built up a certain meaning in legal documents both here and in international fora.  We should get legal advice <Col N="1307" /> in drawing up suitable wording to amend these two Articles.  My party will support the Second Reading of this Bill.  If the Bill passes Second Stage, I hope The Workers' Party will accept my proposal to give more thought and examination to appropriate wording with which to amend Articles 2 and 3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that Dáil Éireann should reject the proposal made in this Bill for a number of reasons.</P>
      <P>One good reason is that it is unnecessary. Ireland's commitment to the peaceful solution of problems is already contained in the Constitution and in many treaties and international agreements to which we are a party.</P>
      <P>Another reason is perhaps a narrow technical one but valid nevertheless.  It would surely be absurd for us to set down in our Constitution conditions which people outside our jurisdiction must observe in determining their future.  Yet that is actually what this Bill proposes.</P>
      <P>Another, in my view totally persuasive, reason for rejecting the proposed Bill is its disastrous timing.  The attempt to put the Bill forward at this time, when sensitive and important negotiations are going on in relation to the three sets of relationships in this island, and between Ireland and Britain, must be seen as irresponsible. By the signals it would give to the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland, it could well destroy for some time to come the chances of peaceful progress.  It would certainly strengthen the hand of the men of violence who would undoubtedly claim that we had deserted the Nationalist community and that they were now their only protectors. I disagree totally with Deputy Barry on that aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I go on to develop these arguments more fully, I would like to take the opportunity to reiterate most strongly the Government's total rejection of violence as a means of attaining our legitimate and democratic claim to unity. I know that I speak for all parties in this House in that regard.  Violence does not <Col N="1308" /> advance that cause: by dividing communities, it pushes ever further away the time when men and women of Ireland, whatever their political or religious beliefs or affiliations, can live together in peace, with respect and tolerance of each other's views and ideas.  Progress can be made only through discussion and negotiation among the constitutionally elected representatives of the people of this island.  I know that is common ground between us; nevertheless it is important on this occasion when we are dealing with these issues that I should repeat it.</P>
    <P>The Bill is unnecessary because there is already in the Constitution a provision which serves the same purpose as it is apparently intended to advance.  Article 29 of the Constitution states:</P>
    <P>Ireland affirms its devotion to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation amongst nations founded on international justice and morality.</P>
    <P>Ireland affirms its adherence to the principle of the pacific settlement of international disputes by international arbitration or judicial determination.</P>
    <P>The effect of these paragraphs is to make any reference to consent in Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution unnecessary.  Under them, the only way in which a dispute could be settled, under the Constitution, is peacefully.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, the argument sometimes made that our Constitution can be invoked to justify the use of force in pursuit of the purposes of Articles 2 and 3.  I utterly and totally reject the view that our legitimate democratic claim to unity can be construed by any reasonable person as a justification for using violence. There is absolutely nothing in the Constitution which can in any way justify the continuation of the campaign of violence being conducted by the IRA.  In fact, those who follow the path of violence are making a travesty of the heritage of this country and our conduct since we gained independence, as well as denying totally the fundamental democratic principles enshrined in our Constitution.</P>
    <P>Our allegiance to those same principles, to the ideal of progress by consent, with <Col N="1309" /> the will of the people, has been a principle by which the action of successive Irish Governments has been governed.  It has determined our attitude to the membership of international organisations. We are, for example, members of the United Nations for almost two generations now.  One of the provisions of the Charter of that organisation is that members are required-</P>
    <P>...to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours, and</P>
    <P>to unite our strength to maintain international peace and security, and</P>
    <P>to ensure ... that armed force should not be used, save in the common interest.</P>
    <P>As members of the United Nations, we have held steadfastly to these principles, not only in this country but in the many corners of the world where Irish soldiers have served as part of peacekeeping missions in furtherance of the cause of democracy and peace.</P>
    <P>Exactly the same philosophy inspired this country to subscribe to the provisions of the Helsinki Final Act in 1975, in respect of the territorial integrity of each of the participating states.  One of the provisions of that Act is:</P>
    <P>The participating states regard as inviolable all one another's frontiers as well as the frontiers of all states in Europe and therefore they will refrain now and in the future from assaulting these frontiers.</P>
    <P>Again, in that Act, Ireland records its formal adherence to the principle of the peaceful settlement of international disputes.</P>
    <P>In 1985, the Anglo-Irish Agreement was signed.  That Agreement says that the British and Irish Government:</P>
    <P>...affirm that any change in the status of Northern Ireland would only come about with the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>This is a formal declaration by the two <Col N="1310" /> sovereign States which has been registered with the United Nations in confirmation of the solemn and binding nature of the undertakings it contains. The Agreement recognises the need for continuing efforts to reconcile and acknowledge the rights of the two major traditions in this island, represented on the one hand by those who wish for no change in the present status of Northern Ireland and on the other hand by those who aspire to a sovereign united Ireland achieved by peaceful means and through agreement.</P>
    <P>The Agreement was the subject of a Supreme Court judgment in March last. I would remind Deputies of some of the Court's conclusions.  It found that Article 2 of the Constitution consists of a declaration of the extent of the national territory as a claim of legal right.  It found that Article 3 prohibits, pending the reintegration of the national territory, the enactment of laws applicable in Northern Ireland.  The court found that the Anglo-Irish Agreement is not inconsistent and is compatible with the Constitution and in particular with Articles 2, 3 and 29 and that the agreement was not concluded in disregard of the interests of the Unionist community in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>That in summary was the essence of the judgment of the Supreme Court.  There is nothing in these findings which in my view takes from the adherence of the State to the principle of consent, and the peaceful settlement of disputes enshrined in our Constitution and in international agreement after international agreement.</P>
    <P>I am quite clear that the constitutional requirement to seek the unity of Ireland by peaceful means is neither aggressive nor offensive, no more indeed than the Unionist desire to maintain the union is on their part.  As I have said on other occasions, I have a simple belief that unity on this island is preferable to disunity.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court affirmed the view that within the meaning of the Constitution the Government have complete freedom to pursue and develop peaceful <Col N="1311" /> and friendly co-operation.  I should point out that the Articles in question in our Constitution are very similar in their intent to the former Article 1 of the German Basic Law, which in its preamble laid down the following constitutional imperative: &ldquo;the entire German people are called upon to achieve in free selfdetermination the unity and freedom of Germany&rdquo;.  This provision never constituted a physical threat to the former East Germany or served as a basis for the use of force.  This had led in the fullness of time to the peaceful unification of Germany, East and West, with the consent of the people in both parts of Germany and of all the other parties involved in a general atmosphere of goodwill.</P>
    <P>But if the present wording of our Constitution, the Charter of the United Nations, the Helsinki Final Act and the Anglo-Irish Agreement were not enough to record Ireland's acknowledgment of the need for progress by peaceful means, I would draw Deputies' attention to the fact that as recently as last month, in Paris, I affirmed Ireland's continuing adherence to these same principles and, in particular, signed the Paris Charter for a New Europe which we discussed in this House recently.  Deputies will recall that that Charter provides:</P>
    <P>In accordance with our obligations under the Charter of the United Nations and commitments under the Helsinki Final Act, we renew our pledge to refrain from the threat or the use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or from acting in any other manner inconsistent with the principles or purposes of those documents.  We recall that non-compliance with obligations under the Charter of the United Nations constitutes a violation of international law.</P>
    <P>We reaffirm our commitment to settle disputes by peaceful means.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall also that the Charter reaffirmed the Ten Principles of the Helsinki Final Act, including the provision that allows the possibility of changing <Col N="1312" /> frontiers, in accordance with international law, by peaceful means and by agreement.  Indeed, the signatories to the Charter welcomed the fact that &ldquo;the German people have united to become one State in accordance with the principles of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and in full accord with their neighbours&rdquo;. I do not want to make too much of a corollary in that regard but I think it is a very clear example of what exactly I am talking about &mdash; that a constitutional provision seeking unity is not in any way in conradiction with all the international agreements we have signed.  Furthermore, in the German case it did, in the end, result in a very happy conclusion.</P>
    <P>We have solemnly undertaken, as in these provisions, not to breach frontiers and not to use force but peaceful means only for the settlement of disputes.  This is, I believe, a matter of both morality and pragmatism &mdash; as shown time and time again in country after country in Eastern Europe &mdash; that radical change can only come about and fundamental institutions of Government can be sustained only by the consent of the governed. Governments everywhere only last by the will of the people.</P>
    <P>Against this background of national and international obligations entered into and most solemnly registered, and a simple and pragmatic reading of the facts of public life, can anyone genuinely sustain the argument that there is a need now for a referendum in our country on Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution?  Such a referendum would certainly be politically divisive and would be totally unproductive.  It would open arguments which on all our past experience here with referenda could develop in ways which nobody in this House or anywhere else can predict on questions of the utmost fundamental importance and sensitivity. It would lead to bitterness and dissention at a time when more than ever we need moderation and consensus.</P>
    <P>These are not just my views or the Government's views.  Let me mention that a regular contributor on Northern <Col N="1313" /> Ireland matters, Mary Holland, wrote in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 21 March of this year in the aftermath of the Supreme Court decision, and warned of the dangers of a divisive referendum on Articles 2 and 3 and made the point that the broader Nationalist community in the North &ldquo;derives considerable comfort from the knowledge that the Irish Government regards them as its citizens and has a constitutional responsibility to look after their interest&rdquo;.  Even many of the most prominent of those who have argued the case for amplifying Articles 2 and 3 accept the idea that a referendum at the present time could be divisive and even counter-productive.  The SDLP have made it clear that they do not believe the Articles should be amended at present. Former party chairman, Mr. Seán Farren, stated in the <i>Irish News</i> on 11 December last year that the time for amendments would be &ldquo;in the context of a more comprehensive political settlement between both parts of Ireland&rdquo;. This point of view was clearly expressed at the recent SDLP Conference.  The Labour Party in the Seanad debate in March of this year also took a negative attitude to a motion to delete Articles 2 and 3 for the same reasons.</P>
    <P>I want to argue very cogently that in many ways this motion is very badly timed &mdash; in fact, I would nearly go so far as to say that it is dangerously timed &mdash; just as discussions on the current initiatives of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland have been making encouraging progress.  A motion like this is almost certainly calculated to damage that progress by seeking to pre-empt something that may very well be raised in the negotiations themselves if they get underway.  The timing of the motion is politically inopportune.  I am afraid that those who support it &mdash; I have to say this &mdash; are displaying a lack of political judgment in this area.  I do not think they have thought out fully the implications of what they are doing in seeking to pass this legislation and have a referendum on Articles 2 and 3 at this time.  I sincerely believe they should not pursue this further. Let us regard this Second Stage <Col N="1314" /> debate in Private Members' time as a good up-to-date discussion on these issues and leave it at that because I genuinely believe that if they precipitate us into a referendum on these Articles, which are of fundamental importance to a very large number of people in this country, North and South, and if they start the long process of a referendum at this stage, they will in fact be acting detrimentally and doing damage.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the Irish Government are at present engaged in a series of discussions and negotiations with the British Government.  The aim of those discussions and negotiations is simply to try to reach an agreement or an arrangement which has the prospect of transcending the Anglo-Irish Agreement in a way that can take account of the views of both Nationalists and Unionists in Northern Ireland.  That is what the first Anglo-Irish Agreement did not do. Perhaps that is what we will be able to do this time in the course of these discussions with the Unionists present and involved. Perhaps we will bring forward a new type of agreement, arrangement, settlement or whatever, which will have respect for, regard for, and listen to the Unionist point of view.  Does anybody seriously argue that in the middle of just such a negotiation, this country should be plunged into a referendum on what could become a major issue in the talks?  That is one of the points I want to emphasise. If this initiative succeeds and the talks get under way, we will be running with a referendum in this part of the country on issues which would be pretty centrally raised in the talks we are trying to have. That certainly would lead to total confusion.</P>
    <P>More than that it would come at a time, when the people of Northern Ireland are most in need of our understanding and support, and would send them completely the wrong message. That is precisely what we could be doing, whatever about the intention or the actual wording of the Bill itself.  As in so many other things that concern Northern Ireland it is not the actual, words, the phraseology or the formulation <Col N="1315" /> that counts, but the signals that can and will be read into the words.  The signal of this Bill at this time would be totally wrong.</P>
    <P>We are repeatedly told that the sensitivities of Northern Ireland should be borne in mind when we are conducting a debate on Articles 2 and 3 and this Government have consistently demonstrated their acknowledgment of and respect for Unionist sensitivities.  Our readiness for open-ended dialogue with the Unionist leadership has been signalled time and time again; I personally repeated it frequently.  In the current efforts to get talks under way which would embrace all the constitutional parties in Northern Ireland as well as the two Governments, we have consistently shown our flexibility in responding to various Unionist preconditions.  Here I would like to refer to something which I am told took place today.  Chris McGimpsey, who has been a central figure in this whole matter with regard to the case before the Supreme Court and who is the secretary of the Official Unionist Party, has indicated that he is not interested in this particular proposal.  I did not actually hear it myself but some of my colleagues who did, assure me that that is what he said.  Therefore, what are we about?  I have often said to Deputy De Rossa in this House &mdash; when he asked me questions &mdash; that I do not want to hear from him what the Unionists think, or what he tells me the Unionists think, or what the Unionists want; I want to hear from the Unionists themselves.  That is the only satisfactory way of doing it.  If Chris McGimpsey said today on Radio Ulster what I believe he said, that proves my point conclusively.</P>
    <P>It is important to remind this House also that we have obligations to the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland, obligations which are not and cannot be secondary to those we owe to any others.  For over 50 years Articles 2 and 3 have been of enormous importance to Northern Nationalists.  I do not care whether anybody says they were right or wrong in looking at Articles 2 and 3 in <Col N="1316" /> that way.  I know, from my own knowledge and experience, that that is the position; they do and have looked on Articles 2 and 3 as something of great significance and importance to them.  Our Constitution has reassured them that they have a place in the minds and hearts of those who live in the South, that their aspirations are shared and that their claim to be members of the Irish family is not just a hopeless, idle dream.</P>
    <P>Northern Nationalists have undergone a great deal over the past 70 years.  Their experience as second-class citizens over so many of those years is perhaps sometimes difficult for many in this part of the country to fully understand.  I want to say that I fully understand it because I have experienced it and know it at first hand. Indeed, I think there are plenty of people in this House who also know and have experienced it at first hand.  Over the past 20 years constitutional nationalism has valiantly struggled to assert the legitimacy of the Nationalist vision while unambigously condemning those who would contaminate that vision by the use of violence.  That is something to which we should very definitely have regard.</P>
    <P>I am sure all of us here in this House regard ourselves as having a difficult time in expressing our point of view, in promoting our cause in the House and with the public.  But we all know that our difficulties, such as they are, as practising politicians, pale into insignificance compared, for instance, with the task of the SDLP over the last 20 years in trying, on the one hand, to maintain their Nationalist position, their tradition and belief and, at the same time, steer clear of the violent expression of that tradition by others.  It has been a very difficult job for them; we all know, understand and appreciate that. I do not think we would be doing them any favours, or giving them any help in continuing to uphold that difficult, sensitive position in Northern Ireland by passing this Bill and holding a referendum.</P>
    <P>What signal are we to send to those who have struggled to uphold the values of constitutional nationalism?  Are we to <Col N="1317" /> say that, after all, expressions of nationalism have come to embarrass us in the South, that we no longer feel comfortable with a Constitution which gives full expression to the Nationalist idea?  Is that what we want?  I would submit that the day we made such an admission will be one not just of disappointment and disillusionment for Northern Nationalists but also, as I said earlier, a day of comfort for the men of violence in Northern Ireland &mdash; they will assert that constitutional nationalism has been fatally weakened, that the claim to nationhood has become the exclusive property of them, the men of violence.  It behoves all of us, I think, to think long and carefully before we would take any step of that kind, any step which might be interpteted as sending that kind of signal.</P>
    <P>I have always stated that new arrangements or structures which might be agreed for Ireland as a whole would clearly require an entirely new Constitution to be brought forward.  We should not seek to solve the problem, I think, by making isolated moves or gestures of this kind, the final result of which &mdash; unfortunately experience teaches us &mdash; has been disappointment and set-backs. Unilateral changes would not result in peace and indeed might have very detrimental consequences.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Barry on one point, when he spoke about the Articles which dealt with religion in the Constitution, which were regarded, we are told by some people, as an anathema and that all would be well if they were removed.  Of course once removed they would be of no importance; nobody would be interested in their removal.</P>
    <P>What I have in mind is not so far from what most other parties in this House have contemplated.  Not many years ago all the parties in this House &mdash; strangely enough, with the exception of The Workers' Party who are bringing forward this proposal now &mdash; sat down together in the <i>New Ireland Forum.</i>  We sat for a long time, worked very hard and produced a set of proposals or recommendations to which all the parties <Col N="1318" /> subscribed.  I would like to remind Deputies of certain passages in that report of the <i>New Ireland Forum.</i>  I might refer them in particular to paragraph 5.7 which was endorsed by all the parties participating in the <i>New Ireland Forum</i> and which states:</P>
    <P>The particular structure of political unity which the Forum would wish to see established is a unitary state, achieved by agreement and consent, embracing the whole island of Ireland and providing irrevocable guarantees for the protection and preservation of both the unionist and nationalist identities....</P>
    <P>The report of the <i>New Ireland Forum</i> sets out, at Chapter 5, the requirements which would have to be met to achieve the form of unity wished for by the parties to the Forum.  Briefly, those requirements would include: a total cessation of violence which can have no place in the building of the Ireland of the future that we all desire; constructive dialogue with Unionists in Northern Ireland; accommodation of the two traditions, their aspirations and their loyalties and an all round constitutional conference to formulate new structures.  That is what was contained in the report of the <i>New Ireland Forum</i> subscribed to by us all and it is as sound today as it was when we signed it.</P>
    <P>At this stage I do not think we in this House should now seek to go outside the consensus developed among our parties on these issues by pursuing a road set out in this Bill, of trying to solve one problem of the many that exist, trying to deal with the case of one community to the disadvantage of the other.  That is what is involved in this Bill; its promoters are trying to solve a problem perhaps of perception or otherwise of one section of the community to the disadvantage of the other section.  I do not think that is a sound way to proceed.  I do not think that is the way towards peace or reconciliation.</P>
    <P>All the Government's policies and actions are in accordance with the requirements of the report of the <i>New Ireland Forum.</i>  I have made it clear again <Col N="1319" /> and again that I would be willing, and indeed anxious, to meet Unionists at any time to discuss their concerns.  Such a meeting I believe should take place without any preconditions, without prejudice to anybody's position, Unionists' or anybody else but, in particular, without prejudice to the Unionist position on the Agreement.</P>
    <P>To sum up, in my view the proposals contained in this Bill are superfluous and unnecessary, if not constitutionally offensive and could upset the broad consensus here on Northern Ireland that has existed since the <i>New Ireland Forum.</i>  I know we have had differences of opinion and differences of emphasis but there has been that central, broad agreement or consensus since we all signed the report of the <i>New Ireland Forum.</i>  I also think that these proposals could send signals of despair to many constitutional Nationalists whose hopes and aspirations some here are inclined to overlook on occasions like this.  That is something I would like to emphasise, that we must maintain a balance.  We must always have regard in approaching these complicated, tortuous issues of the North, to the position of the Northern Nationalists as well as our attempts to meet the position of the Unionists and to assure them that we respect their traditions and their aspirations.</P>
    <P>For these and for many other reasons which I have not time to go into now, I strongly urge the House to reject this Bill and particularly to save us the confusion that the holding of a referendum on Articles 2 and 3 would cause in our community at this stage.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's presence in the House and his contribution which certainly sets a different tone to the debate from that set by his party last evening.  The conclusion I arrived at last evening while sitting in this House was that the Government and the Fianna Fáil Party were not taking this debate seriously or giving it the consideration it warranted.  In that respect I welcome the Taoiseach's intervention at <Col N="1320" /> this Stage.  I would disagree with many things he said and I certainly do not accept his concluding remarks that this Bill is constitutionally offensive.  I hold the belief, and I believe it is held by many people irrespective of political persuasion, that the Constitution itself must have a mechanism where it can be changed and the Constitution must be allowed to grow and mature like the country is growing.  I do not believe it was ever envisaged that the Constitution would be immutable or unchangeable when it was decided upon in 1937.</P>
      <P>The Bill before the House will be supported by the Labour Party when a vote is taken at the conclusion of Second Stage next week.  We have some misgivings about the Bill but it is a Bill which, perhaps, in terms of timing could be moved at a more opportune time; perhaps the timing and the changes proposed are not appropriate to the time.  The aim and motivation of the movers of the Bill I believe are laudatory.  I do not question their motivation, but perhaps their decision to force a vote, if that is what happens, on Wednesday next raises questions as to their political judgment.  If Second Stage of the Bill is passed there will be immediate pressure to establish a Special Committee of this House.  We would not favour such pressure at this time.  We do not believe the Bill should be allowed to move to Committee Stage until the conditions are right and my belief is that they are very far from right at this point.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that part of the reasoning behind this Bill was the perceived need to capitalise &mdash; in the very best and honourable sense &mdash; on the spectacular victory of Mary Robinson in the presidential election.  That victory signified a tremendous openness in the Irish people, a willingness to face change and an enthusiasm for new ideas.  President Robinson would not be representing the people of Ireland today if she had been confronted by the hide-bound and traditional attitudes of old.  She discovered, as she said herself&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I respect your guidance, Sir.  In the last number of months of the election campaign it was discovered that there was a fifth province in this country &mdash; something in our hearts was prepared to support tolerance and to open itself to the needs of others &mdash; but that fifth province must be explored with sensitivity. Doors that have been opened can be slammed again if a visitor becomes an invader.  The victory in recent weeks is not something to be capitalised on for that reason.  It is a victory to be lived up to.  It cannot be lived up to by rushing around blindly on the assumption that every windmill is now safe to tilt at.  The process of change requires painstaking analysis and it must be embarked on in full respect for the fact that we represent above all else an intelligent people capable of making up their own minds on every issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Bill before us the following things need to be said at the outset and the following questions need to be asked before I begin to elaborate on them.  It is arguable that the present Bill is opportunistic.  The Workers' Party have argued in the past for the deletion of Articles 2 and 3.  One of the effects of their present Bill is to restate the national aspiration and, arguably, to maintain it as a constitutional imperative, albeit in a qualified form.  In the way in which it is worded it could be seen as writing a <Col N="1322" /> Unionist veto into our Constitution.  The Bill comes at a time when no concessions of substance have been made by Unionists in any negotiation.  In fact, all that is happening is still very tentative.  It is talk about talks.  Is this the right atmosphere in which to make such a concession in principle?  In the past we have called for concessions to be made to Unionists, but there is a substantial difference between the kind of concession aimed at getting them to the negotiating table and concessions in principle which might pre-empt the need for negotiations altogether.</P>
    <P>What else are we being asked to give up in qualifying or diluting the claim to the national territory?  For example, are we diluting our claims in respect of territorial waters, mineral rights off-shore or Rockall?  What would be the effects of holding a referendum at this time?  Will it not be likely to encourage both sides in the North to back-pedal on efforts to secure talks until the outcome of the referendum is known?  What will be the effects of a referendum campaign?  Will it not be guaranteed to generate at least as much division and bitterness as the two most recent referenda, dividing political parties, dividing communities and, possibly, even dividing families?  What will be the effect of losing a referendum on this issue and of restating the existing provisions in the Constitution?  Would it not be guaranteed to set back the prospect of reconciliation at least for a considerable time?  Would we not be allowing the murderous Provisional IRA to claim instantly that all their vicious campaigns have been validated by such a decision if it were to happen?  What would be the effects of winning a referendum?  Is there any guarantee that Unionists would respond positively?  Would they not be more likely to seek to test the meaning of the result and, if they could establish that it had given them a veto over the prospect of unity, would that not be more likely to result in entrenched position-taking? Would violent and constitutional Nationalists alike not use such an outcome as an abandonment of them, and would violent Nationalists not claim they <Col N="1323" /> are now the only true defenders of the faith as they perceive it?</P>
    <P>Without clear answers to these questions it is difficult to see how this Bill can be allowed to proceed beyond a point of principle.  At the same time it is impossible to ignore the issues of principle that have been raised.  It must be said very clearly in this House that, if there is a way of sending a message, a loud and clear message, to every citizen living on this island that we in the Republic are open to change, then I believe the opportunity should be taken to send that message. There is no future for this island if we continue to cling indefinitely to the myths and symbols of old Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  Devised in a very different time and in a very different atmosphere, they have become a potent and powerful symbol, but a symbol nevertheless.</P>
    <P>For some of us they represent the symbol of an aspiration which is ingrained into us from the time we were born, an aspiration which will never be abandoned even if it is removed form our Constitution. For others living on this island they represent a symbol of our dishonourable intentions towards them.  We cannot afford to be carried away with the importance of such a symbol.  The generosity inherent in the definition of true Republicanism must make us ready to make the symbolic gestures that are appropriate at the time.</P>
    <P>Articles 2 and 3 in their symbolism, divide us from the people we claim to be part of ourselves.  Therefore, I believe very strongly that we must be prepared to adapt and to change in order to remove the division.  Obviously change is a two way street.  For a number of years I have been arguing very strongly for the kind of concessions which I believe necessary to attract Unionists to the negotiating table, principally by removing the elements of coercion they believe they have detected in the Anglo-Irish Agreement. Not only was I the first Member of the House to suggest this approach, but for a long time after I did so I certainly <Col N="1324" /> felt I was very much alone in the perception that a degree of openness was essential.  More than that, I was certainly roundly attacked on all sides at the time when I first called for this change.</P>
    <P>We should not underestimate the fundamental differences between the changes that are necessary to attract people to the negotiating table and changes that might make it unnecessary for them to come.  A concession on so fundamental a symbol to so many people as Article 2 and 3 deserves to be part of a process of give and take, to put it at its very mildest.  If such a concession is now made, why should Unionists come to the table looking for it?  Does anybody here seriously believe if we were to abandon Articles 2 and 3 now that the Unionist leadership would immediately respond by saying that our generosity demanded a reciprocal gesture from them?  Is it not much more likely that a concession on this point would simply be pocketed and instantly forgotten, which has happened in the past?  Surely what we must do, against the background of history and experience, is to hold ourselves ready for change, to prepare for change, but always insist that change must come about at both ends of the process.  That is what negotiation is all about.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if we were to go ahead with a referendum, as is being suggested, surely it would be inevitable that any campaign, no matter how wellintentioned, no matter how much restraint we would try to lead with from this House, would stir up fires and passions that could only do damage to the political fabric of this island.  If we have learned anything from the last two referenda it is that change in deep-rooted attitudes is painfully and slowly won.  A rush to decision on an issue like this can only sow seeds of yet more bitterness and division. Given the difficulties or our history we should be avoiding anything that would add to the bitterness and divisions which have existed and do exist on this island.</P>
    <P>I am not arguing here that we should be afraid to confront the forces of reaction, indeed far from it.  What I am saying is <Col N="1325" /> that there are many Irish people, motivated by nothing but the best intentions who will, at the end of the day, not readily support as radical a change as is being suggested in this House.  We know to our cost that there are skilled practitioners here in the politics of fear, and fear is the most easily instilled of all emotions capable of being dealt with only by the most powerful efforts of persuasion and communication.  If we try and fail, as I am inclined to believe may well happen, will we have done a service?  Despite our good intentions how much service will we have done?  It may well be argued that it is more honourable to try, but in relation to the North of Ireland above all else I feel that this is a very dangerous argument. People are being killed every day in the north in a campaign of terror as savage as has been experienced in any part of the world, and the people doing the killing are, to an overwhelming extent, the Provisional IRA.  They are the people who would claim any rejection of change as an endorsement of all of the killing and maiming, and the rest of the world would agree with them.  Inevitably, the other consequence of defeat would be to set back the process of conciliation in the North and, unfortunately and frighteningly, to replace it with recrimination and anger on all sides.</P>
    <P>To look at the specific provisions in the Bill before us, I believe it warrants interpretation and legal examination.  It means a number of things that I believe are not immediately apparent on a first reading.  It proposes that the provisions in Article 1 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, that there will not be any change in the status of Northern Ireland other than with the consent of the majority of the people of Northern Ireland, should be incorporated in Article 2 of the Constitution as an addendum.  I have difficulty in seeing how this will in fact be interpreted.  If it is intended as an extra concession to Unionism over and above its inclusion in the Anglo-Irish Agreement it fails that test.  This is so because first, the Anglo-Irish Agreement is binding on this State, and this State made that concession already in the agreement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1326" /> Second, although Article 2 will be amended by this addendum, the territorial claim enunciated by the Article remains intact, undisturbed, and in fact it would be reendorsed by the people were this amendment to be adopted.  The incorporation of a consent clause does not in any way dilute the constitutional claim expressed in Article 2 that the national territory consists of the whole island of Ireland, its islands and its territorial seas.  In my opinion, this addendum to Article 2 will make no difference to the meaning and effect of Article 2 of the Constitution as that was expressed by Chief Justice Finlay in McGimpsey against Ireland in which he said:</P>
    <P>The reintegration of the national territory is a constitutional imperative. Article 2 of the Constitution consists of a declaration of the extent of the national territory as a claim of legal right.  Article 3 of the Constitution prohibits, pending the reintegration of the national territory, the enactment of laws with any greater area or extent of application or extraterritorial effect than the laws of Saorstát Éireann, and this prohibits the enactment of laws applicable to the counties of Northern Ireland.  The restriction imposed by Article 3 &ldquo;pending the reintegration of the national territory&rdquo; in no way derogates from the claim, as a legal right, to the entire national territory.</P>
    <P>Having regard to that statement of the law by Chief Justice Finlay, it seems that the most that can be said in respect of the proposal, in so far as it touches on Article 2, is that the constitutional imperative of territorial reintegration might become subject to a majority of the people of Northern Ireland favouring such unity. Arguably in political terms this amounts to giving a veto to Unionists and there must be a major doubt about the wisdom of writing such a veto into our fundamental law.  It does exist, I accept, in the Anglo-Irish Agreement but agreements, by definition, can be changed through the process of negotiation and renegotiation.</P>
    <P>The other argument is that the Article, <Col N="1327" /> as amended, would still contain a territorial claim to Northern Ireland and this would inevitably be represented by Unionists as a concession which, in fact, is no concession at all.  By amending the Constitution in this way, this State would have endorsed the <i>status quo</i> subject to a consent clause which is already binding on the State in terms of international law.  It is a classic example of a no-win decision.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment of Article 3 is substantial.  The most obvious changes, as I read it, are: (i) The jurisdictional claim or proviso as contained in Article 3 at present would be deleted.  This is contained in the words &ldquo;and without prejudice to the right of the Parliament and Government established by this Constitution to exercise jurisdiction over the whole of that territory...&rdquo;  These words undoubtedly are intended to mean that for as long as the Article exists in its present form, the Irish State will not acquiesce in any claim that the frontier at present existing between the State and Northern Ireland is or can be accepted; (ii) The amended Article would proclaim the firm will of the people of Ireland to be reunited in peace, harmony and by consent; and (iii) Further, under the proposal, the laws of the Parliament of this State would have the like area and extent of application as they do at present &ldquo;until the unity of the people of Ireland shall otherwise require.&rdquo;;</P>
    <P>In essence the proposal drops the jurisdictional claim from Article 3 and seeks to put in its place an aspiration to &ldquo;the unity of the people of Ireland&rdquo;.  This must be an aspiration as it is difficult to see how this expression of &ldquo;unity of people&rdquo; can be given any hard, real or legal meaning.</P>
    <P>Taking Articles 2 and 3 together, the net result appears to be &mdash; this is my opinion &mdash; that the territorial claim to Northern Ireland would remain.  On the basis of the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court in the McGimpsey case, that claim is a claim of legal right and it would remain so.  Even though the reintegration <Col N="1328" /> of the national territory would no longer be considered an absolute constitutional imperative, it would seem to remain a constitutional imperative which would be subject, in an undefined way to the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland.  While the claim to the national territory is restated as a claim of legal right, it appears that the jurisdictional claim or proviso would go and would be replaced by an aspiration to &ldquo;the unity of the people of Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to say how these new provisions would be interpreted as a matter of constitutional law.  There is no doubt that the territorial claim would remain as a constitutional imperative in the legal order, even though it would be somewhat diluted by the need for the consent of the majority of the people of Northern Ireland.  This claim and assertion of the extent of the national territory sits uneasily and defies definition when taken together with &ldquo;the firm will&rdquo; of the people of this State that the people of Ireland should be reunited in peace, harmony and by consent.</P>
    <P>Under the proposal, Article 3 would define the extent of the jurisdiction of the laws of this State under this Constitution &ldquo;pending the unity of the people of Ireland&rdquo;.  But unfortunately &mdash; this is a major weakness &mdash; that unity is nowhere defined, and there is no mechanism mentioned which would enable it to be measured.  What we would end up with is a new Article which comprises a mix of political aspiration and a legally vague statement which limits the jurisdiction we claim.  It is very difficult to understand how such a mixture could be legally defined so as to delimit the jurisdictional extent of our laws.  In trying to find a solution we may end up with a more difficult problem.</P>
    <P>The result would be that Article 2 would become the focus of judicial interpretation. As stated, the effect of this proposal would be to do little more than to dilute the territorial, legal and constitutional imperative claim to Northern Ireland by making it subject to the obtaining of the consent of the majority of the people of Northern Ireland.  As I have <Col N="1329" /> stated, one interpretation could be that the change would have institutionalised and entrenched a Unionist veto in Southern Irish constitutional law.  I would quesiton whether that is desirable or necessary in the light of our obligations at international law and in the light of all our experience in relatively recent years of the intransigence of the Unionist leadership.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, in his concluding remarks, seemed to indicate that the proposers and indeed the supporters of the Bill before us tonight are behaving &mdash; I will try to quote him correctly &mdash; dangerously irresponsibly.  I do not accept that view offered by the Taoiseach.  For the last number of years since he became Taoiseach in 1987, the Leaders of the Opposition parties have behaved responsibly and have exercised very credible restraint in relation to discussions in this House on Northern Ireland.  I have, on many occasions, supported by leaders of the other Opposition parties, sought opportunities to discuss with the Taoiseach, to consult with him, to be consulted or at least to be informed on the development of policy in relation to Northern Ireland.  I think all of us in the South realise the difficulties and the dangers in which people try to live their daily lives in Northern Ireland.  It is far too serious an issue for any party down here to seek political opportunism or indeed to add to the difficulties which people experience on a daily basis in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Taoiseach has not seen fit on any occasion in the last three years to offer consultation to the Leaders of the Opposition parties.  We have sought consultation on a confidential basis, to be genuinely constructive and helpful in relation to the difficulties and the difficult state of negotiations between the parties in Northern Ireland.  I do not think anybody in this House who has been involved in the Anglo-Irish Agreement process or in any discussions with politicians north of the Border or in the British House of Commons on the question of Northern Ireland would seek <Col N="1330" /> to take advantage of information given confidentially.</P>
    <P>Despite our efforts it has not been possible for us to make any contribution in relation to the discussions in Northern Ireland, notwithstanding the fact that all the political leaders in Northern Ireland, irrespective if the size of their parties, have been consulted by the Secretary of State and have been kept informed in terms of the discussions, but that has not been the case here.  This is regrettable and, even at this late stage, I would ask the Taoiseach to seek some method by which we could be better informed in this area.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides the House with an opportunity of at least getting the views of the Government in relation to the potential for change in the Republic.  As I said, the timing may not be correct but there is an opportunity for the movers of this Bill to reflect on how the cause of reconciliation and progress through dialogue can be best served.  It seems from the strong position put forward by the Taoiseach and from the statement by the Progressive Democrats that this Bill will not survive a Second Reading.  Perhaps those of us supporting the Bill, or indeed The Workers' Party as the movers of the Bill, which I believe is a commendable one, should take the opportunity of considering how best we can serve what we are trying to achieve, that is to move towards peace and reconciliation on this island.  Rather than divide this House we should perhaps take the opportunity next week of working towards a consensus which can only emerge after constructive and worthwhile debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to Deputy Spring very carefully and he made as good a case against the Bill as any Member on this side of the House could. However, he informed us that his party support the Bill which seems a very strange stance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Partition has been one of the main sources of the problems on this island. Quite apart from causing the present and past strife in the Six Counties, it has also caused major problems on the southern <Col N="1331" /> side of the Border, particularly in areas close to it.  It has left a scar, physically and mentally, on this island.  My own area has not been able to sustain the same kind of growth &mdash; economic or otherwise &mdash; because of its implications.  No other part of the Twenty-six Counties would welcome peace and harmony on this island more than my own area.</P>
    <P>Articles 2 and 3 embody the desire of the Nationalist people on this island to have the nation reunited, not only physically but mentally.  Articles 2 and 3 have been the fundamental linchpins of Fianna Fáil since their inception.  Like it or not, the Fianna Fáil Party speak for a very sizeable portion of the southern side of the Border, and indeed they articulate the views and aspirations of a large proportion of people north of the Border. This Bill proposes that the validly held views of the Fianna Fáil Party and their supporters should be put aside with nothing put in its place to mirror those aspirations.  There is unanimity in the Fianna Fáil Party on the issue of the retention of Articles 2 and 3.</P>
    <P>There are very great dangers in this proposal; it would have the effect of allowing Sinn Féin and the Provisionals to claim that they are the only republican party, the only group promoting a united Ireland.  It could be validly said that Fianna Fáil have reneged on their previous guarantees to the people who supported them down through the years.  The claim by The Workers' Party that Sinn Féin and the Provisionals claim their mandate from the Constitution and from Articles 2 and 3 in particular is nonsense. They do not and never have recognised the Constitution.</P>
    <P>In the event of this Bill passing and the resultant referendum amending Articles 2 and 3 &mdash; something I do not think will occur &mdash; the Provisionals and Sinn Féin would almost certainly claim a mandate from the Constitution.  The Workers' Party also claim that they are not driving a wedge between the two parties in Government.  Deputy De Rossa said this last night but I do not accept it.  They are playing politics with one of the most <Col N="1332" /> potentially divisive issues in the history of the State.  If they are genuine in their claim, did they consult Fianna Fáil or the Progressive Democrats before they issued this Bill?  Did they consult the SDLP or even the Unionists for whom they say they are speaking?  Did they consult Mr. Brooke or his advisers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>From the inception of the Anglo-Irish Agreement I was one of its best supporters in Fianna Fáil but I freely admit that I had problems with it, mainly because it gave the Unionists in the North a veto on any progress towards reconciliation on this island.  It allowed them to stifle any effort to allow the two traditions on this island to live in peace and understanding of each other's aspirations.  I felt that the agreement was flawed because it very dangerously meant that if there was ever a 50 per cent plus one majority in the North in favour of a united Ireland, it would happen and the former majority in the Six Counties would then be a very small minority on this island against their wishes.  It would merely transfer the minority and would not make the situation any better.  This was too simplistic in its approach to the problems.  It may have placated the present Unionists but, conceivably, it could cause immense problems for our successors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why did I support the agreement? Because for the first time, it allowed the Republic some say in the internal affairs of the North.  People close to me, on the far side of the Border, have shown me tangible proof that they got action on their day to day problems as a result of their contacts through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat.  It must also be accepted that it is an internationally binding agreement which must be adhered to by the Government of the day.  However, it does not <Col N="1333" /> take precedence over the Constitution and this is why the McGimpsey case did not change my outlook on Articles 2 and 3.</P>
    <P>The most recent opinion polls in 1987 showed that two-thirds of the Twenty-six Counties are in favour of unity.  It may now be fashionable to claim &mdash; which I do not accept &mdash; that a large proportion of people south of the Border do not wish to have unity.  My attitude is that people want peace and a united attempt by all on the island to achieve it.  People who say that we do not want a united Ireland are confusing that attitude with a desire on our part not to draw down on us the violence in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>Deputy Spring referred earlier to the need to signal willingness to change.  The Taoiseach said on many occasions that, obviously, we would have to look at our Constitution in the context of any new settlement on the island.  This is a much more realistic political approach.  He admitted that this would have fundamental implications for Articles 2 and 3 in that context.  What more can be said? What more do the Unionists want?  I cannot understand why they will not accept this in good faith.  Why will they not come to the table, put their aspirations forward and discuss their problems in relation to Articles 2 and 3? the same applies to any other problems which they may have.  Obviously, if nothing came out of these talks, each side could then retreat to their respective positions, and I have no doubt that they would but they should at least give it a try.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry is not present but he and anyone involved in the negotiations on the Anglo-Irish Agreement know the political reality of Articles 2 and 3.  Why did the British side at that time not insist on the deletion of Articles 2 and 3?  They obviously were thinking of the reality of the political situation in the Republic, but now Fine Gael are saying that the Articles should go knowing full well that obviously the British did not feel at that time &mdash; and probably still do not feel &mdash; that Articles 2 and 3 should be changed.</P>
    <P>If Articles 2 and 3 were deleted, could <Col N="1334" /> it not be said that the Nationalists are being cast off by us, that we are washing our hands of them?  Like it or not, they look to us &mdash; not to the Six County State or to the British Government.  As Deputy Barry knows only too well, particularly because of his involvement in the British-Irish Parliamentary body which meets here next week, there are still very grave issues to be solved in the North.  The UDR and the RUC accompaniment is still a major problem and Deputies Barry and FitzGerald know that.  Fair employment is also a major problem and the same applies to the shoot to kill policy.</P>
    <P>If we deleted Articles 2 and 3, would it not lessen our right and our duty to be concerned for the interests of the people in the Six Counties?  Would it not be thrown at us, with even greater vigour, that we do not have any right to meddle in the affairs of the Six Counties? Obviously it would&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We would be casting aside the aspirations, fears and problems of the people in the North.  What impact would this Bill and a resultant successful referendum have on Sinn Féin and on the Provisionals?  It would give them and their horrific campaign a shot in the arm and would be a setback to the hopeful vibes created by Mr. Brooke's 100 day speech and his more recent utterances. The Provisionals would retreat to their age old justification for the havoc they are occasioning on this island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I stated earlier, the Provisionals and Sinn Féin have no mandate from the Constitution.  The only mandate they have is the 2 per cent vote they get down here, and they cannot really claim that. If the Provisionals were to quote the Constitution they could not surely reconcile their armed struggle with Article 29 which governs the peaceful solution of international disputes by this State.  This Bill could lead to an increase in the abysmal support down here but, worse, it could increase the support in the North <Col N="1335" /> for the Provos.  A large number of people could turn to the Provos if they felt the Irish Republic was not looking after their interests.</P>
    <P>This Bill comes at a most inopportune time regarding the talks.  Deputy Spring confirmed this.  I fully accept what he said.  I have always regarded Deputy Spring as being realistic in his contributions particularly in relation to the North.  Why then does he come in here and say that he is supporting the Bill? These talks are at such a delicate stage that any wrong signals from this side could unbalance the negotiations.  A vote against this Bill could give the Unionists renewed vigour in their refusal to enter the talks.  This Bill is merely playing into their hands.  As I said earlier, let the Unionists put their position forward and talk without pre-conditions bearing in mind what the Taoiseach said concerning the possible reassessment of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Many years ago we were playing with requests to change Article 44 of the Constitution which relates to the special position of the Catholic Church.  It was said, perhaps justifiably, that this was an impediment to the Unionists in their dealings with us.  That has long gone and yet we are no further down the road in satisfying their pre-conditions.  Then it was Article 44, now it is Articles 2 and 3. What will it be next?  I will just instance a case where a Deputy from the Fine Gael Party and I met two Unionists in the North and we discussed various matters of interest.  In the course of the conversation a leading Unionist pointed out that a provision in our Constitution guaranteed the position of the Catholic Church.  This was only last year.  We told him that this was not so, that that went years ago.  This was a senior Unionist who genuinely believed that Article 44 guaranteeing the special position of the Catholic Church was still in our Constitution.</P>

      <P>It is obvious that the <Col N="1336" /> Unionists do not know what we think. That is why we should support the Taoiseach's call at every opportunity to get the Unionists around the table.  They should not be outside, they should come in.</P>
      <P>This piecemeal messing with the Constitution in an effort to entice the Unionists is not the way to proceed.  Deputy FitzGerald's constitutional crusade ran aground because its starting point was to give in to all the Unionists' demands prior to negotiations.  In negotiations such as these one does not start by getting rid of one's bargaining position.  The approach adopted by this Government, and by the SDLP, mirrors the political realities of the three way process.  The Oireachtas committee in 1967 looked at this aspect. While it is true to say that they recommended change they did so in a climate of relative calm.  Since then, particularly over the past 20 years, we have seen endless violence because of the extreme polarisation of the two communities.  We cannot be seen to be adding to this polarisation in any way at this stage and this Bill could lead to that.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach referred earlier to Mary Holland whose views are highly respected in Britain and in Ireland.  She put her position very plainly in the article referred to and on the airwaves over the weekend when she said that if we felt the referendum on divorce was divisive, it would not be anything like the divisiveness we would have as a result of a referendum in relation to Articles 2 and 3.  She also felt that amending Articles 2 and 3 would in some way alienate and isolate the Nationalist community.  These views should not be ignored.</P>
      <P>The SDLP's approach should be examined closely.  They have suggested that a referendum in the North and a referendum in the South should be used as a device to get consensus on any settlement proposals.  This is by far the better way of doing things.  It is far better than continually allowing one side a veto.  Why should the Unionists have a written veto in our Constitution.  Surely the people in the Republic are entitled to their say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I entirely agree with Deputy Barry <Col N="1337" /> when he says that the Provo campaign is putting a wedge between the two communities on this island.  On this side we have been accused by some of the more hot-headed people on the far side of the House and, indeed, over the Border, of being in some way ambivalent on the question of the Provos.  We are not.  I come from an area which has been accused often of having its fair share of Provos, and I categorically refute that suggestion.  As far as I, and my colleagues, are concerned the Provo campaign is only putting Irish peace and unity further down the line.  How can they expect the families of the people they murder to accept the hand of friendship from this side of the Border?  Because of this, we should not in any way assist their propaganda machine.  This Bill, and its implications, would give them that shot in the arm for their propaganda machine.</P>
    <P>It should also be pointed out that Deputy Peter Barry last night misled the House when he claimed that the Supreme Court judgment of 1 March 1990 changed his party's position on amending Articles 2 and 3 at this stage, irrespective of any general agreement in Northern Ireland. A couple of days after the Supreme Court judgment last March the then Fine Gael Leader told his Ard Fheis that the articles could be removed if the Anglo-Irish Agreement led to the formulation of a new agreement.  That was in the <i>Evening Herald</i> of 5 March 1990.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> of 16 March 1990 we read of:</P>
    <P>...an indication by the Fine Gael Leader, Mr. Dukes, that change should be considered in the light of talks directed towards securing political progress in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>A Fine Gael spokesman explained that the frontbench had decided not to introduce a motion seeking a redrawing of Articles 2 and 3, in the light of the Supreme Court decision in the McGimpsey case.</P>
    <P>It was felt, he said, that such discussion should happen in the context of change in Northern Ireland and not in isolation.</P>
    <P>Yet we had Deputy Barry last night <Col N="1338" /> saying they had changed their position in the light of the McGimpsey case.  After the McGimpsey case when they examined the decision, they decided not to propose a redrawing of Articles 2 and 3. How can they reconcile their stance then after the McGimpsey case and now.  Is it not the case, and this is probably a lot more pertinent to the debate, that Deputy Bruton, now the Leader, had a different attitude then, and now, to that of his former party Leader, Deputy Dukes?  It should also be stated that what Deputy Barry said last night is not the view of the vast majority of the Fine Gael Party.  This was not Deputy Bruton's view in April 1990 when he was urging the unqualified amendment of Article 2 of the Constitution.  Journalists at the time noted the divergence of his view from his then leader.</P>
    <P>I think the Taoiseach has given Deputy Bruton some advice on how he should approach his new position.  I genuinely feel that Deputy Bruton jumped in too quickly, without looking at all the implications of what he was saying in relation to Articles 2 and 3, to support the position of The Workers' Party.</P>

      <P>That is clearly seen from the reaction of the Labour Party who decided to wait and see how the ball hopped and they chose to support the Bill, but they came in here and said something completely different.</P>
      <P>In the light of this it is clear that Fine Gael Party policy has changed, not because of the Supreme Court judgment &mdash; as Deputy Barry tried to suggest &mdash; but because they have a new leader who is less sensitive to the Nationalist opinion and to the views of the SDLP who are opposed to any attempt to remove or modify Articles 2 and 3 outside a new comprehensive agreement that would help bring peace to this island.  I firmly believe he did not take proper soundings from the SDLP on this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla has proposed the insertion of &ldquo;the public,&rdquo; after &ldquo;advise&rdquo;. This is an important paragraph as it gives the institute the function of advising the Government, the Minister and other Ministers on the radiation protection of persons in the State.  This is the first of three general advisory functions of the institute.  Along with the monitoring functions, the advisory functions are another major group of the institute's functions.  The provision of expert advice to the Government on radiation protection is one of the main reasons the institute is to be set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla has asked that we include &ldquo;the public&rdquo;, in other words that the public also be advised by the institute. I made it clear on Second Stage that it was my intention that this new Radiological Protection Institute would, as far as I could make it possible through legislation, be an independent body in order to ensure that the public would have every assurance that the advice to be given by the new institute would be the best possible advice based on the professional expertise of those who worked in the institute and those who were appointed to its board.  In order to achieve the objective of ensuring that there is a widespread public perception of the independence of the Radiological <Col N="1340" /> Protection Institute, I will be proposing a number of amendments on Committee Stage.  There will be opportunities to discuss these proposed changes as we move on to the later sections.</P>
    <P>In accord with that spirit I have no difficulty in accepting the principle behind Deputy Mac Giolla's amendment which is similar to my own objective as stated on Second Stage and restated now. I am prepared to accept the principle of the amendment but would seek the Deputy's agreement that the words &ldquo;and the public&rdquo; be inserted after the word &ldquo;Government&rdquo; in line 41.  That would achieve what he and I are anxious to achieve.  It is merely positioning the words &ldquo;the public&rdquo; in a more appropriate place in subsection (1) (c).</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (1) (e), line 4, to delete &ldquo;assist&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;co-ordinate&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is one of a number of amendments I have tabled seeking to expand and clarify the functions of the institute.  Amendment No. 8 specifically proposes that the role of the institute in relation to planning, in the event of a radiological emergency, would be extended from simply one of assisting in the planning to being the central co-ordinating agency for a radiological emergency plan.  If we are putting together people with skill and expertise in the radiological area, we should equally entrust them with the role of co-ordinating and executing an emergency plan.  It goes without saying that a radiological emergency requires very specific skills in relation to intervening where radiation levels have risen above acceptable levels.  It would seem to me that we need a central agency that is not only charged with the task of co-ordinating the response but also reports regularly to the public on the state of preparedness of those plans.  In the last emergency when the radiation from Chernobyl put Ireland under threat, there was no real co-ordinating body.  The Nuclear Energy Board <Col N="1342" /> did not succeed in acting as an effective co-ordinating body for our response to that emergency.  Various Ministers seemed to suggest that they had the power but there seemed to be a great deal of confusion as to where exactly the power lay and who was to do what.</P>
    <P>In an effort to improve and clarify the Minister's plans in this area I propose that if we are setting up a radiological protection board and bringing in people with a range of proven knowledge and expertise in this field, the sensible thing to do is to give them the right to execute and co-ordinate the planning and preparations. In the event of such an emergency happening, which God forbid, they would be the central agency bringing together all the information coming in from the regions, compiling it and producing the needed response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 7 (1) (e) provides that it will be a function of the institute to assist in the planning and implementation of measures to deal with radiological emergencies.  Because of the nature of radioactive substances and nuclear devices, proper emergency planning to enable swift and adequate measures to be taken to minimise the effects of a release of radioactive material as a result of a nuclear accident or other occurrence is very important.</P>
      <P>Following the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986 &mdash; this was referred to by Deputy Bruton &mdash; a national emergency plan for nuclear accidents was drafted by an interdepartmental committee chaired by my Department.  The plan involves the deployment of a network of radiation monitoring devices around the country in order to detect any increases in radiation, a system to enable notification of an accident abroad to be received and the rapid calling together of a nuclear accident committee, following the notification or detection of raised radiation levels, to direct the response and identification of the roles and functions of the various Government Departments, agencies and other bodies in relation to the emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government approved this venture of approximately £900,000 in 1988 <Col N="1343" /> to be phased in over a four year period for planning, for the purchase of equipment, the recruitment of approved staff and other running costs arising from the plan. Much of the necessary equipment for the operation of the plan has been purchased and it is now operational.  Some further work on the elaboration by Government Departments and other agencies of their roles is in progress.  A limited test of the plan has taken place and further tests will be held from time to time.  When it is established, the institute will take over the functions and resources of the board in relation to the emergency plan.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposes the deletion of the word &ldquo;assist&rdquo; in section 7 (1) (e) and the substitution of the word &ldquo;co-ordinate&rdquo;. I want to inform the House that under the national plan for a radiological emergency my Department have been designated as the co-ordinating body for the work of all the relevant State agencies such as the Nuclear Energy Board.  The Radiological Protection Institute will, of course, continue to fulfil the important role of assisting in the planning and implementation of measures to deal with a radiological emergency.  I cannot, therefore, accept the amendent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In what way does the Minister envisage his Department having the expertise necessary to co-ordinate an emergency plan for a radioactive accident of one sort or another over and above the expertise which will be available in this institute?  If we are setting up an institute to protect the public is it not more logical that we should go the whole hog and give them responsibility for co-ordination? After all, as I understand it, we are drawing together in this board the expertise in radiation matters.  Rather than leaving it to the Department of Energy to maintain expertise to duplicate that work, would it not be more appropriate to give the task to the institute?  Will the Minister elaborate on why he believes this planning should not be executed by the body which, on the face of it, looks like the one to which we will entrust all the skills, who will run the network of <Col N="1344" /> monitoring and, as I understand it, receive many of the notifications.  Why do we not go the whole hog and let them execute the plans as well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may be under a misapprehension in saying that the Department will retain a lot of the expertise. The Department will have a co-ordinating role and the expertise for dealing with radioactive substances and the implementation of the necessary measures to deal with that will rest with the institute.  The planning will be greatly dependent on the assistance given by the institute.  The co-ordinating role of the Department is important.  We must realise that in an emergency of that kind one would not be just activating the Nuclear Energy Board or the institute when it is established but one would also have to have access to the whole spectrum of activities throughout the country. All Government Departments can be involved in one way or another in certain situations and in all the different areas of activity in the economy which need to be co-ordinated.  I believe a Government Department is the appropriate body to have responsibility for that co-ordination role rather than handing it over to the institute.  I believe the Minister would be reneging on his responsibilities in this instance if he were to give the full co-ordinating role to the institute.  Obviously the institute will play a vital part in assisting in the planning, as is provided in the section, but I do not think it is appropriate that they should be the co-ordinators of the activation of the plan.  I think this matter has proceeded satisfactorily. As I have said, there has been one test already and following close examination of the results of that test the plan will be brought before the Cabinet and after it is approved it will be published.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment to publish such an emergency plan.  Can he also give us an assurance that we will have access to independent assessment of that plan for the institute?  I think many people are worried &mdash; perhaps this is borne in on them by experience &mdash; that when the memory of a serious accident such as Chernobyl fades from the mind the vigilance and resources devoted to keeping such a plan up-to-date would slacken. Can the Minister give us an assurance that the institute will be in a position to critically appraise the state of preparedness for a radiological emergency and will inform the public and the House of their view as to the adequacy of the resources provided and the adequacy of preparedness based on their ability to test what is in place?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the chair will agree that I am slightly inhibited in that the Deputy is asking questions about a plan which has not yet been finalised or formally approved in its final state.  Until it is and until it is published it would be more appropriate to reserve our comments. There can certainly be a public <Col N="1346" /> debate on the contents of the plan when published.  Under the provisions of the plan an accident committee will be established who will report to the Minister, who will then report to the Government. The House will accept that it is necessary for the Minister of the day to be responsible for serious national matters of this nature.  A lot is at stake and it is appropriate that a Minister should report on these issues to the Government, not an institute operating under the aegis of the Minister.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (1), between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(k)  to provide information to the public on any matters relating to radiological safety which it deems fit.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I expressed my views on this amendment during the debate on amendment No. 7. It is critical that the public should receive information from the institute which is not in any way sanitised or censored by a Minister or Government Department. We have had bad experience in the past where a Minister tried to intervene to stop information flowing from the Nuclear Energy Board.  While I welcome the Minister's amendment to an earlier section regarding the right to advise the public, it should be made clear that the provision of information and advice to the public will be independent of Government policy of the day and that the institute will not be beholden to the views of future Governments about the use of nuclear power or a Minister's views about how we should conduct international negotiations or dealings with EURATOM. EURATOM has been extremely unsatisfactory for Ireland from the point of view of radiological protection.  It is essentially a club of Energy Ministers, the bulk of whom are wedded to the idea of nuclear power.  We should set an <Col N="1347" /> example by establishing an independent institute who can advise the public independently of what a Minister for Energy might be saying at EURATOM.  This is crucial and should be enshrined in a separate section which copperfastens the institute's right to speak directly to the public on affairs it regards as important. That would include criticism of Government policy in relation to preparedness for an emergency or in relation to the negotiating position being taken in international bodies and so on.  It is important that the public get clear information based on the best possible scientific evidence.  I hope the Minister will agree.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment.  It is right that there should be a separate section giving the function to the institute of providing information to the public.  I commend the Minister for accepting my earlier amendment providing that the public be advised.  It is more significant than might be apparent and certainly gives me much greater confidence in the type of institute the Minister has in mind.  The great problem in the past was secrecy and attempts to cover up by officials or boards lest the public be panicked.  The Minister is correct in saying that the public will not panic over any information given but are very anxious for as much information as possible.  The Minister's attitude in making it more open and in providing advice to the public, as well as the Government and Ministers, is a very good indication of a more open institute.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton's amendment provides that it should be a specific function of the institute to provide information.  It should be possible for a member of the public to ring up the institute and ask for information. If this were listed in the functions, it would be a good addition.</P>

      <P>In keeping with my policy of independence for the institute and in the context of Deputy Mac Giolla's amendment No. 7 to which I have already agreed, I will accept the principle of this amendment.  I would ask Deputy Bruton to agree to a slight change.  As he has worded the amendment it could lead to a different interpretation from that intended.  I propose replacing the word &ldquo;it&rdquo; in the last line of the amendment with the words &ldquo;the Institute&rdquo;.  As originally worded it could be interpreted to mean that the public deemed it fit.  In order to ensure that there is no doubt about what the amendment proposes, I am asking Deputy Bruton to agree to that change. If so, I can accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (1), between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  to enter into arrangements with the Government, the Minister for the Environment and such other persons or bodies as appropriate to provide a safe and secure system of disposal of radioactive waste created within the country.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is born out of considerable frustration over the years at <Col N="1349" /> the snail's pace progress we have made towards having a secure system for the disposal of radioactive waste created within the country.  I understand the bulk of our waste, if not kept in secure sites in Ireland, is sent back to the producer, to the UK in many cases, for disposal. The Nuclear Energy Board have been critical of the facilities available for storage of many radioactive substances used in Ireland.  In view of the record in this area, I am anxious to see in legislation the provision that it is the clear function of the institute to sort out this issue, which has been bedevilling the country for a very long time.  It is particularly important at present because my understanding of the European Community's attitude to toxic waste of different sorts is that increasingly the policy will be that states must look after waste created within their own borders, and the option of sending waste back to manufacturers or other countries will be closed off to Ireland.  The reason I sponsored this amendment is that I wish to see this issue brought up front to ensure we create a strategy for the secure storage of waste. Even though the Nuclear Energy Board in their report did not indicate a need for panic, they quite clearly indicated that they did not regard the present arrangements as satisfactory.  I think we should take this opportunity to bring the issue to a head.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment.  It is surprising that there is no reference to radioactive waste in the Bill.  I hope the Minister will indicate what his intentions are in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the amendment.  There is a serious problem in disposing of our low level radioactive waste, some of which is being disposed of at Sellafield which is not very satisfactory. It is my understanding that the Irish flag flies outside Sellafield as an indication of the good relationship which exists between us at customer level.  I find it very strange that, on the one hand, we are trying to have it closed down and, <Col N="1350" /> on the other, we are dealing with these people.  I will be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about this problem of the disposal of low level radioactive waste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support my colleague, Deputy Richard Bruton, who has tabled this amendment.  Like other speakers, I find it extraordinary that the Minister has not included such a provision in the Bill.  Perhaps he would let us know why he felt it would be inappropriate to provide for the disposal of radioactive waste here and of our low level radioactive waste which is disposed of at Sellafield.  I agree with Deputy Garland on this point and have in front of me some quotations from what the Taoiseach and the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, said about Sellafield polluting the Irish Sea and so on, despite the fact that we give tacit approval to the disposal of radioactive waste at Sellafield.  Therefore we are trying to speak out of both sides of our mouth at the one time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am deeply concerned at the growing problem we face in this country in relation to the disposal of radioactive substances and materials from such places as hospitals and academic institutions which carry out research involving the use of radioactive isotopes and other materials. More and more we are beginning to hear reports about radioactive waste and other serious toxic materials being unearthed around the country.  Recently I spoke to someone involved in the disposal business and he told me some hair-raising stories about where some of the waste from our hospitals, which might be radioactive, is ending up.  He also said that it is given to people who might not always be as diligent or as moral about where it is disposed of, with the result that, as the soil is gradually eroded from around the pits where this material is buried, it will come to the surface again and might present a danger to people.  Needless to say we have all read reports about waste which has been washed up on our beaches or found in out of the way places.  If the Minister is not going to accept the <Col N="1351" /> amendment, I ask him to allay our fears by ensuring that the radiological institute will monitor the disposal of radioactive waste in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>There can be no doubt that considerable public concern would be expressed if a decision was made to build a radioactive waste disposal facility. Fears about radioactivity are widespread and a consultation process would be necessary with people living close to any proposed location for such a facility.  That having been said, it goes to highlight some of the difficulties we are confronted with in arriving at a point where we can make a decision regarding disposal in our own country.  Before I go any further I should say to the Deputies that reference is made in the Bill to disposal under section 7 (1) (d).</P>
      <P>The reality, as has been said, is that there is no site in Ireland where radioactive waste can be disposed of.  Hospitals and laboratories dispose of low level radioactive waste by storing it on site and dispose of high level radioactive elements by returning them to the supplier.  The Nuclear Energy Board and some users have for many years been seeking the establishment of a central disposal site. The problem was previously highlighted during the preparations for the possible re-entry into the earth's atmosphere of the Soviet satellite, Cosmos 1900, in the autumn of 1988, when it became clear that in the event of radioactive satellite debris falling on Ireland there was nowhere here to dispose of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Nuclear Energy Board carried out a survey of radioactive waste disposal in Ireland and the findings of that survey were published in December 1988.  In summary, the report indicated that a very small amount of radioactive waste was produced in Ireland, mainly from the use of isotopes in nuclear medicine and radiotherapy. Ninety-nine per cent of this waste is discharged as patient excreta to the sewers.  Should there be a substantial increase in the usage of radioactive isotopes a change in disposal methods would <Col N="1352" /> be necessary.  However, the report indicated that no increase in usage is expected during the next five years.</P>
    <P>The International Atomic Energy Agency have a waste disposal advisory service called WAMAP, waste management advisory programme, and this service visits countries on request to assess the disposal situation and to identify solutions.  We invited the IAEA in August of last year to send a mission here, but as there is a backlog of requests to the WAMAP for such missions we have been informed that we are unlikely to receive a visit from them until mid-1991. It is intended that proposals for a suitable waste disposal facility will be fully considered following the recommendations of the WAMAP team when they come here in the middle of next year.</P>
    <P>It is clear from what I have said that the disposal of radioactive waste is a matter of grave concern for me and that I have provided for it in this Bill at section 7 (1) (d) and (g).  A great many areas are covered by these sections and I do not think it would be appropriate to insert specific proposals into the Bill.  Indeed, it would seem from Deputy Bruton's introductory remarks that he was availing himself of the opportunity to highlight the need for such a system for the disposal of radioactive waste in this country, and I fully support the concern he has expressed.  I trust that he and the House would accept my anxiety to make progress in this matter, as evidenced by the approach to the International Atomic Energy Agency.  Unfortunately the delay since I became Minister has been caused by a number of requests that the special management advisory programme group have received from others prior to our request having been submitted.  It is a hopeful sign to be able to indicate that they will be coming here within the next six or seven months.  Armed with their expertise and knowledge we hope to be placed in a better position in which to take a decision in this matter.  I am not at all unaware of the type of difficulties that can arise.  I have a lot of political experience of the type of issues about <Col N="1353" /> which the public are wary.  I know there is a need at all times to have open discussion and consultation before taking any decision.  Certainly it would be my intention &mdash; based on whatever advice emanates from the advisory programme people and the institute, which I hope will be established by then, from officials of my Department and others in the planning areas, encompassing expertise in various Departments, in the Environmental Protection Agency &mdash; which I hope will also be established by then &mdash; that all of these people and agencies will proffer their advice, and we will take our decisions based on the best possible advice available.  I have no doubt but that there will be some difficult decisions to be taken in regard to the actual location. There is no point in my anticipating that until I see what emerges by way of proposals. Having said that, I do not think it is appropriate that we should have specific proposals of this nature when they are covered in the broad spectrum of responsibility being allocated under this section; we are not short of legislation, rather we are short of action in regard to the matter.  I am facing up to that in the best way I can.  Hopefully the point will be arrived at at which a decision can be taken without too much delay.  I do not think it is appropriate that it be written in in the form suggested in the amendment.  I take the intent of the amendment but I am afraid I will have to oppose it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a couple of points.  While acknowledging that there is reference to disposal, it is in the context of advising the Government and the Minister.  As I understand it, the Nuclear Energy Board have already made clear their advice, that this is a deficiency that must be addressed.  It is also my understanding that the direction of European thinking is to close off the opportunity for disposal in the manner in which we now do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While accepting the Minister's good faith that he is looking at this problem I would have to say, with respect, that writing off to whoever are these people <Col N="1354" />&mdash; WMAPs &mdash; asking them to come and see us is hardly a great step down the road.  They may be able to provide us with some useful advice on how we should put the thing in place.  But the issue has been established at this stage, that we do need such a disposal centre.  The question that arises is really not another review to go back over the 1988 review by the Nuclear Energy Board; that is not what is needed but rather an action plan to put this disposal centre in place.</P>
    <P>Where my amendment differs from the approach of the Minister is that I am seeking to actually locate the initiative for doing this with the institute who have the skills and who have their fingers on the pulse.  It does not appear to me that the initiative, wherever it now rests, is being properly acted upon.  This has been around for a long time; there would not appear to be a great deal of urgency.  The merit of giving this as a function to the institute is that it would be one of their specialised jobs to set about dealing with the problems that will be thrown up in finding answers to this problem.  I do not have great confidence that the Government, with other pressures on their minds, will be responding to this need in the same way as an institute which is tailor-made to address the task.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>May I pose a straight question to the Minister arising out of his reply?  After the establishment of this institute who will be responsible for dealing with complaints on the part of members of the public, local authorities or others about suspicions that might arise about the disposal of radioactive substances?  Will it be the local authority, the Department of the Environment, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland?  With the greatest respect to local authority officials, they are not trained to recognise and fully appreciate the dangers of radioactive substances. The Minister is losing an opportunity to bring together all of the issues relating to radioactive, radiological studies and so on under the one umbrella where the expertise will rest.  There have been complaints lodged at local authority level <Col N="1355" /> from time to time on the part of the people who suspect that radioactive substances are being dumped indiscriminately. Such radioactive substances may not be dumped indiscriminately but, with the greatest respect to local authority officials, they are not always able to tell; they can be blinded by scientists or others who will contend: no, there is nothing wrong with that, there is no danger involved.  Once the words &ldquo;radioactive&rdquo; or irradiation&rdquo; are used at all, the Minister will be aware, as a member of a local authority, they cause the greatest concern and emotional reaction.  The Minister must acknowledge that there are academic institutions, such as some of the universities, one of which disposes of some of their material on the fringe of mine and Deputy Bruton's constituencies. A few years ago when they sought planning permission from Dublin County Council the reaction was that they were going to build a nuclear bomb or something of that nature; that is the kind of reaction one gets.</P>
      <P>The Minister is losing an opportunity to bring this all under the one heading to ensure there is a proper, expert body able to examine and decide whether something is radioactive when found in a ditch, field or wherever.  Will the Minister say who will be responsible?  To whom can I or any other member of the public lodge a complaint &mdash; once this institute has been established &mdash; whenever I suspect the remains of academic research and radioactive isotopes are being dumped indiscriminately, or even going into ordinary domestic tipheads?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>In deference to the Deputy, if it is not clear already, her inquiry affords me an opportunity to make it clear.  When the institute is established, provided they have the powers we intend giving them under this Bill, they will be the institute to whom the public should have recourse with any concerns they may have about contamination or danger to health from any radioactive substance.  It will be the institute who will be the licence-issuing authority.  It is to <Col N="1356" /> the institute that the public, or public bodies will have recourse to ascertain the facts.</P>
      <P>I have already agreed to amendments tabled by Deputies Richard Bruton and Mac Giolla.  I have said, and it is clear in the amendments I have tabled myself, that I am anxious to establish this institute so that they can operate as independently as possible of, for instance, my Department. I want the public to have the fullest possible confidence in the advice and information disseminated by this new institute once established; that is what we are doing here setting up that body. There should not be any confusion as to whom one should go for the kind of technical and professional advice one might require.  I am well aware how easy it is to upset individuals and communities because of their fears about something they cannot see but which they know can cause them great damage if allowed to go out of control or in the event of some accident occurring.  Therefore, it is important that we have the best possible safety procedures and that is the intention in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton talked about disposal, and the lack of a site.  Yes, the Nuclear Energy Board in their study identified the problem.  They have not formulated proposals but I will be requesting the institute, when established, to put forward firm proposals to me.  Of course, it will be a matter for the Government to decide where this disposal site will be located and how it will operate.  It would be prudent of me to take into account the best possible expertise available and the WAMAP will integrate authenticity into any decision the Government might make.  It is proper that we get the best advice.  We have had comment from Deputy Owen that the expertise certainly does not lie in many planning sections of local authorities.  The officials are in the main civil engineers who may have a planning degree, and they cannot be expected to have this specialised expertise.  It is hoped they will have the institute to consult for expert advice in this matter.</P>

      <P>The difficulty I see is <Col N="1357" /> that we will have an institute with responsibility for responding to the public's concern who, if they find some radioactive waste illegally dumped, will not have the executive authority to find a safe and secure place for it.  An integral part of what the institute should do and an integral part of the licensing procedure, is to police a secure site where radioactive waste can be disposed of.  It is difficult to impose on them a licensing responsibility and a responsibility to deal with the public's concerns and breaches of regulations if they have not the wherewithal, responsibility and authority to resolve the problems that will be crossing their desk.  The essence of this amendment has not really been met.  I would feel better if we knew the institute would be reporting to the public on the state of progress in this area so that year by year they would be telling the public, &ldquo;we have made such and such progress, put forward proposals to the Minister and are awaiting a response&rdquo;. That would give me some assurance that this was moving, but I feel the correct way to deal with this is to give executive authority to the institute.</P>

      <P>It is a major problem and we all know it exists.  As the Minister asked, if we get a site, can it ever be used?  My problem is that I do not know very much about this business and neither do the majority of people. How safe can radioactive material be made if it is covered with lead and buried in concrete?  For how many generations will it remain safe?  Education will be an enormous part of the function of this institute.  They will have to let us know, first, the very important uses in hospitals and colleges, Trinity and UCD or wherever, of various nuclear materials, nuclear devices and radioactive substances. The Minister told us something tonight that I never heard previously and I was quite shocked to hear it.  He said something to the effect that 99 per cent of radioactive materials from hospitals are disposed of through human excreta and down the sewer.  I understood that when hospitals are using various devices they have radioactive waste left over.  I <Col N="1358" /> do not know what radioactive waste is. Has anybody seen it?  Certainly, I never saw it to know what it looks like.  The Minister tells us 99 per cent of it goes in through the human system and out through the sewers.  I cannot follow that. We have no problem when there is only one per cent disposal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Our problem is nearly solved.  It may be that if we get a few more people to eat up some more of this radioactive waste the tiny percentage will be gone.</P>
      <P>I would like a little sense to come into this.  What in heaven's name are we talking about?  By how much material must low level radioactive substances be covered before they become safe or can be picked up in your hand without harming you?  People do not know about that. What they should know, but do not know, is how important these materials are for the health of people through their use in hospitals.  Why are they needed? The Minister should tell us the various procedures that depend on the use of these substances.  At the end of the day if we use radioactive materials we are going to have something left over.  What are we going to have left over?</P>
      <P>If there was a mine shaft 10,000 feet, or ten miles deep and one covered up the tiniest bit of radioactive waste in wads of lead &mdash; we have thousands of tons of lead in Tara Mines and more discovered in Galmoy; we have more lead to dispose of than any other country &mdash; by dropping it down that mine shaft, I would object if it was near my town because I know nothing about it.  A major problem is that people know nothing about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Bruton's amendment, but if the institute find a safe and <Col N="1359" /> secure system of disposal will the public accept that it is safe and secure?  Unfortunately, they will not at the moment. The Minister should see to it that the institute educate the people on what we are talking about and then it may be possible to get a safe and secure system acceptable to the public.</P>

      <P>The institute's annual report would rightly contain all the information the Deputy has been requesting. Unfortunately the Nuclear Energy Board were established for a different purpose and at a time when it was planned to have a nuclear power station here.  The legislation did not put a strong responsibility on the Nuclear Energy Board in regard to purely radiological protection. This Bill is specifically designed for that purpose.  The institute will have a duty to make a full report on the matters raised in regard to levels.  I will check whether the information I gave was new and whether it had been made public in one of the Nuclear Energy Board reports.  I am not certain.</P>
      <P>In fact I am in some difficulty here. maybe I could appeal to the Ceann Comhairle to help me.  I have been advised that one of my advisers is not allowed to attend in the House because he is not a civil servant, and he is the one with the expertise in radioactive substances. He is from the Nuclear Energy Board.  Would it be possible to seek the permission of the House to have my other official attend, or is that going beyond bounds?

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (1), between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(m)  to enter into arrangements with the Government, the Minister for the Environment and such other persons or bodies as appropriate to put in place a programme to deal with the presence of radon gas in excessive quantities in houses.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Essentially this amendment provides that the institute would enter into arrangements to deal with the presence of radon gas in excessive quantities in homes.  As most Members of the House will be aware work has been done recently in Ireland on the extent of radon gas. Indeed it is the largest proven problem in Ireland of radioactivity affecting the ordinary public.  It is estimated that there are up to 100 deaths per annum due to excessive exposure to this naturally occuring radon gas which affects houses. The great concentration of the problem is obviousy in the west where it is associated with the rock formations there.  In some counties up to 10 per cent of houses are experiencing levels of radiation from radon gas which are many times more than would be permitted from a civil use, such as a nuclear reactor.  One hundred times higher exposures are being experienced by people in their homes than would be permitted to a member of the public from somewhere like Sellafield or a similar nuclear centre.</P>
      <P>It is not a problem which can be quietly brushed aside; it is a real problem and the Government have not come up with an effective programme to deal with it. There has been talk but there is no effective programme to deal with it.  In some counties there have been reports of schools experiencing very high levels of radon gas build-up.  The children have been exposed to this radiation and it could cause long term damage to their health.  Because it is such a serious problem the institute should put a programme in place to deal with it.</P>
      <P>The significant thing about exposure to radon, unlike some of the other problems, is that it can be solved.  The excessive build-up in houses can be successfully dealt with and, at an even lower cost, the design of new houses can ensure that this problem will not occur.  The Department of the Environment have been very far behind in dealing with this and it is a good opportunity for the Minister, in taking overall responsibility for radiological protection, to give an impetus to the institute to drag the Department of the Environment into this field to deal effectively with the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the presence of radon gas in houses has been a matter of particular concern to me. <Col N="1365" /> Indeed, excessive quantities have been measured in my own constituency. However, the Deputy should be aware that a programme to tackle this problem is already in place.  For some time now, the Nuclear Energy Board have been carrying out an intensive programme of monitoring and measuring radon levels in various parts of the country.  Very strict action levels have now been set by the Government in this area.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Environment are at present working on the production of guidelines for remedial measures for existing houses with high radon levels and for the building of houses in high radon risk areas.  The Nuclear Energy Board have had an input to these guidelines and will continue to have an input under sections 7 (1) (b), (c) and (g) and section 8 (h).  As with the Deputy's previous amendment, I am of the opinion that the question of radon gas is too specific a problem to be included in the Bill and, therefore, I must oppose it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's faith in his colleague's ability to deal with this problem is touching because I do not think that anybody living in those areas has seen any of the guidelines or the concrete evidence of movement to deal with the problem.  A real cost will be imposed on householders in this regard but there has not been an adequate warning &mdash; or identification of the problem &mdash; to them.  We are still in the monitoring phase many years after the first UCD study brought it to our attention that there was a serious problem in parts of the Minister's constituency and in other areas in the west.  I admire the Minister's loyalty to his colleague but I could not possibly agree that he has been effective in coming to grips with the problem.  I am sorry that the Minister does not feel that this is an opportunity to seize the initiative in relation to what has to be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to this problem and Deputy Richard Bruton's amendment, one does not want to be <Col N="1366" /> accused of scaremongering and frightening the people over and above the due level of care, attention and alertness required in relation to it.</P>
      <P>We acknowledge that the existence of radon in dwelling houses, particularly in the west, is a relatively newly discovered phenomenon but I am not satisfied that the monitoring is being carried out on a wide scale and that there is the required vigilance to determine where it exists.</P>
      <P>We do not doubt the Minister's sincerity in relation to this matter but we doubt the sincerity of the Department of the Environment and the manner in which they are tackling it.  The Minister said that very strict action was being taken by the Department of the Environment but I should like to know whether the Minister is satisfied that his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, has issued strict guidelines, recommendations and designs (a) in relation to planning permissions which would issue in respect of new houses; (b) for the conversion of existing houses affected, and whether these are contained in the county development plans which are currently under review in each local authority, including the Minister's local authority in Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>there is a problem with radon in certain parts of the country, particularly in the west and, as I said, my own constituency has shown some of the highest readings in the country.  It first came to my notice when I read the report from the Nuclear Energy Board shortly after I became Minister for Energy and I immediately brought the matter specifically to the attention of my colleagues in Government.  I have been in close touch with the Minister for the Environment in the matter because the best way to deal with it is through building regulations operated by the Department of the Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public notice has been given of the service of the Nuclear Energy Board advising that people should avail of their facilities to have their houses tested for radon.  This service has been made available to the public at a nominal fee.  I have <Col N="1367" /> commented on it on numerous occasions &mdash; and have given plenty of publicity to it &mdash; and I appeal to the public, particularly in western counties, to seek and avail of the services of the Nuclear Energy Board and to have their homes tested, particularly if they live in houses which have been built for some time.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment have done a lot of study on this and the new building regulations will make provision where it will be a requirement to take certain steps to ensure that the radon emissions do not become a problem in a new house.  Of course, the problem is mainly in old houses where some alterations to the floors are required if high readings are obtained.  The necessary work will involve a cost but the first step the public should consider taking is to have their homes tested.  All that is required to have the test carried out is the placing of a very small instrument in a cardboard box in each of the rooms in the House and the readings are taken over six to 12 months.  In many cases it will be seen that there is not a need to take action but in those cases where the readings are high it will be necessary to take some action.</P>
    <P>The Nuclear Energy Board have to date completed an initial survey of schools in the western counties. Initial measurements have been made in some 500 schools of which about 15 have levels in excess of the 150 becquerels per cubic meter.  Further measurements will be made.  The level adopted by the Government is 200 becquerels per cubic meter at which one should consider taking measures to reduce levels.  One school mentioned in the Nuclear Energy Board report in the county from which Deputy Higgins comes and for which I have a special attachment was identified as having high readings.  That matter was dealt with immediately on my instructions and there is not any problem there now.</P>
    <P>It is important not to alarm the public. As Deputy Owen said, when one talks <Col N="1368" /> about radioactivity everyone gets the jitters. We must accept that there have been some high readings in some places but overall the situation is fairly satisfactory. We must identify the problem areas and take action there.</P>
    <P>This amendment has given me the opportunity to give some information on this matter to the House.  One of the ordinary responsibilities of the existing Nuclear Energy Board which will be carried through this Bill to the new institute relates to this and there is no need for a specific amendment relating to this area of responsibility.  I am satisfied that the existing provision in the Bill places the responsibility on the institute to deal with this matter as it should be dealt with and that the Department of the Environment have a role to play, being the Department responsible for physical planning and the construction of houses.  What is required are measures to be taken with regard to building regulations to deal with this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (1), between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(n)  to set regulations in relation to the safe dosage level of radiation permitted in irradiating different foods and make recommendations regarding the appropriate labelling and notification to consumers of irradiated foods on the market.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of exposure of foods to radiation doses for the purpose of preserving their shelf life is a matter of concern. There is considerable concern among the public about what constitutes safe levels and how these should be notified to consumers. The Bill as at presently constituted does not intend to deal with this, although it would appear that the Minister may be entitled to include it at a subsequent date, using his discretion.  My amendment will bring this within the <Col N="1369" /> remit of the Bill.  There is a growing concern among consumers perhaps not about health but about the right to know.  There have been suggestions that foods exposed to high doses of radiation while they are not radioactive, do not show the normal rotting signs that would warn people not to use them and there may be problems with such foods.  My amendment is a vehicle to deal with this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment.  There is a lot of confusion about the irradiation of food.  Radiation of any kind worries people.  There is a lot of misunderstanding with regard to food and radiation.  We need to tighten up on the uses of irradiation for food and the manner in which the consumer can be defrauded by food irradiation which is used to remove bacteria from rotting food, in other words, to give the impression that it is fresh when it is not. There is a need for Deputy Bruton's amendment.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will tell us whether this is already covered in the Bill because I cannot see it.  Perhaps it is hidden in the same way as we found in an earlier amendment where the Minister showed us that nuclear weapons were covered in the Bill.  Perhaps the Minister can show us a section that deals with the matter Deputy Bruton covered in this amendment.  The Workers' Party will support this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, will support this amendment, subject to what the Minister will say.  There is considerable public disquiet about food irradiation.  As the House knows a Private Members' Bill has been laid before the House in connection with this matter but in the meantime the Minister should make sure there is provision to cover food irradiation in the Bill and, if there is not, he should accept Deputy Bruton's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of irradiation of food is essentially within the responsibility of the Minister for Health and the amendment is, therefore, not appropriate to this legislation.  The new Radiological Protection Institute will co-operate with the Department of <Col N="1370" /> Health as set out in the Bill.  Under sections 7 (1) (f) and 7 (1) (g) the institute will have a special role in relation to the monitoring and regulating of irradiating apparatus.  The areas of health and labelling of foods are matters for the Ministers for Health and Industry and Commerce. Food quality is the responsibility of the Minister for Health.  When food is irradiated it is not radioactive.  I will be opposing this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see some logic in what the Minister is saying in that he will be overseeing the equipment being used, but I am not satisfied that the Government have addressed the public concern in this area.  The safe radiation levels are not specified in law here and we do not have labelling requirements in this area. While I can accept that the Minister is able to kick to touch under existing legislation by saying that provisions for health, food and labelling are not his responsibility, most members of the public would be concerned about this and would be looking to the Radiological Protection Institute to give them some independent line of advice in this area, which does not seem to be forthcoming from the bodies that have that responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The point that worries me is that this is the responsibility of the Minister for Health.  Why then is it not the responsibility of the Minister for Health to monitor activity regarding ionising radiation levels in animals, poultry, eggs, fish or any other food?  That does not appear to be the responsibility of the Minister for Health simply because it is obviously the responsibility of the institute we are setting up under the provisions of this Bill where we are talking about radiation levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In irradiating food there are obviously safe dosage levels and unsafe dosage levels.  I agree with the Minister in that I would not like anything I say to give the impression that irradiated food is radioactive food or anything of that nature. That is an impression abroad which must be corrected.  Nevertheless, if there is an unsafe dosage level surely it would result in radioactivity in food.  The whole food chain is the direct responsibility of the <Col N="1371" /> Minister for Health but where anything in the nature of radiation is involved the institute must be involved.  The Minister has already mentioned that the institute will advise in relation to international standards regarding ionising radiation and irradiating mechanisms.  I cannot understand why the Minister is wiping his hands of this and saying he does not want to have anything to do with food irradiation which is increasing and becoming a major part of the food chain at present, though perhaps not as much here as elsewhere because we are not sufficiently educated.  In relation to maintaining food on the shelves it will be a very important function in the future.  I would accept it if the Minister said the institute will be monitoring this area and that it is covered by virtue of paragraph (f) or (g) or some other paragraph.  I became very disturbed when the Minister said this matter had nothing got to do with him or the institute but that it was a matter for the Minister for Health.  I am more perturbed now, following what the Minister has said, than I was earlier.  I would like the Minister to say at least that the institute will be continually monitoring this area or something of that nature.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to section 7 (1) (f) and the Deputy has now mentioned it.  There is a provision in paragraph (f) in relation to the irradiating apparatus on which the institute will have the duty to advise the Government.  The existing powers, under the 1971 Act, in relation to licensing of these apparatuses are being transferred to the institute.  That will be dealt with when we come to section 44. One of the orders made under section 44 was Statutory Instrument No. 166 of 1977.  This is an important document in relation to consideration of how radioactive substances and irradiating apparatuses are controlled in this country and this order will continue in operation.  This statutory instrument deals with the Nuclear Energy (General Control of Fissile Fuels, Radioactive Substances and Irradiating Apparatus) Order, 1977. That is the power under which the <Col N="1372" /> licences are issued, and the institute will be the responsible authority.</P>
      <P>The question of safe dosage levels is under consideration at international level.  In the event of the institute licensing a food irradiation facility in Ireland conditions would be attached to its usage.  While it is too early to be specific about such conditions it is likely that the question of dosages would be addressed.  No plans exist at present for the construction of a food irradiation facility in Ireland.</P>

      <P>We now come the amendment No. 13 in the name of Deputy Bruton.  Amendment No. 14 in the name of the Minister is related. With the agreement of the House, amendments Nos. 13 and 14 may be taken together.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 8, lines 31 to 46, to delete subsection (2).</P>
      <P>Essentially, this amendment is designed to explore what the Minister is trying to achieve in subsection (2).  It seems to me &mdash; and I think Deputy Mac Giolla referred to this earlier when we were talking about the lack of education and appreciation of what radiation is all about &mdash; that we should not restrict the remit of the institute to simply the equipment being used in the medical area and the conditions in which it is used but that they should also have, as part of the institute's remit, the right to look at the medical practices and the extent to which the medical profession are exposing their patients to radiation.  The institute should be the body that would look at the correct approach to the use of radiation in our hospitals and by the medical profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public are very much in the dark and they would appreciate the confidence that would be given if they knew the Radiological Protection Institute had, among their functions, the supervision of the manner in which radiation was used on patients, not in the immediate sense of interfering with the relationship <Col N="1373" /> between a doctor and a patient but in the broader sense of saying what would be the right standards to be adopted and how they should be dealt with.  As I understand subsection (2), it is designed specifically to rule out of the institute's remit the idea of making suggestions about the proper use of radiation in the medical profession.  I put down this amendment to tease out the Minister's intentions and to see whether he would consider that we should have some oversight in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Bruton is proposing the deletion of subsection (2), perhaps I should give an explanation as to what exactly is intended here.  This subsection qualifies all the functions conferred on the institute under the provisions of sections 7, 8 and 9 in relation to medical and dental uses of ionising radiation in order to clarify the limits of the intervention of the institute in medical and dental diagnosis or treatment of patients, in recognition of the role of the medical or dental practitioner in the care of his or her patient.  The purpose of this limitation is to preserve the role of the medical or dental practitioner in the care of the patient.  The practitioner should retain full control over whether to use a radioactive substance, device or apparatus on a patient and the strength or quantity of the application.  The institute in exercising its function of regulating the custody, use, manufacture, etc. of radioactive substances, devices and apparatus &mdash; see section 8 (j) &mdash; is limited to ensuring that the substances, devices and apparatus are properly supervised, stored, protected and maintained and ensuring that when used by the practitioner they do not give rise inadvertently to a dose to workers or others in the vicinity and that they deliver the dose to the patient which the practitioner intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The uses of radiation and radioactive substances in the medical field involve diagnostic X-ray examinations, internally administered radionuclides or diagnosis, radiation therapy for treatment of cancer and other diseases.  There was no corresponding provision in the 1971 Act thereby giving rise to some confusion <Col N="1374" /> about the role of the Nuclear Energy Board in the medical field.  It would not be possible for me to accept this amendment because to delete section 7 (2) would be contrary to the express wishes of my colleague, the Minister for Health, who is anxious to preserve the doctor-patient relationship by restricting in this section the function of the new institute in the health area to specific technical matters.  It is my particular concern to clarify in this section the limits of the intervention of the institute in medical and dental diagnosis or the treatment of patients, in recognition of the role of the medical or dental practitioner in the care of his or her patient.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>My simple question is: why?  I do not understand why the institute should be restricted from offering some guidelines to the medical profession as to how radiation should be used in diagnosis and therapy.  Having listened to the Minister, the only reason he seems to be advancing for not accepting this proposal is that the Minister for Health does not want it.  As I understand it, the Minister's amendment to the legislation will provide that there will be medical experts on the board.  If we are putting medical experts on the board it seems appropriate that they should provide some sort of overseeing role into the extent to which radiation is used in therapy and diagnosis.  I do not understand why the Minister for Health is not keen to see some standards applied in the profession if the board feel they are appropriate for the protection of the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the whole question of professional etiquette and the judgment of the medical practitioner as to what treatment he decides is appropriate in any particular case, is involved here.  Levels which in his estimation may be safe in one case may not be safe in another case.  In that type of one-to-one case the decision should rightly remain with the doctor who is treating the patient. I agree fully with the advice given to me by the Minister for Health in this matter and I think most reasonable people would accept that explanation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that doctors differ in this area.  There is respectable medical opinion that radiation is used excessively in diagnosis and treatment.  It is easy for the Minister to brush this aside by saying it might interfere with the patient-doctor relationship or that the Minister for Health does not want it but we have a duty to the public to provide protection outside those personal relationships.  No one is suggesting that the Minister interfere with those relationships but there should be some element of protection in this area.</P>
      <P>I do not want to hold up the House but my view differs considerably from the view of the Minister for Health.  I believe the public would like to think that outside of their personal relationship with their doctor someone was looking at the general principles of the use of radiation on patients.</P>

      <P>The whole point of this section is to make it quite clear in regard to medical practice that the decision is made by the doctor for his patient.  The role of the institute under this section is to ensure that the apparatus is up to standard and no patients are put at risk because of faulty equipment which is not properly stored, protected, calibrated or suitable in all manners for the purposes for which it is being used.  If the Deputy looks at section 8 (f) he will see the wide powers being given to the institute to prepare and issue codes of practice dealing with radiological safety, radioactive substances, nuclear devices and irradiating apparatus, taking into account the relevant standards recommended by the relevant international bodies.  I suggest that that meets the point.</P>

      <P>That is so in relation to any individual case &mdash; they can lay down guidelines &mdash; but the patient-doctor relationship must be preserved.  As I indicated, there was a difficulty under the <Col N="1377" /> 1971 Act where there was no specific provision in regard to this matter.  Much confusion arose because of this and I am trying to remove the confusion in this Bill by being specific in relation to the role of the institute and, in particular, their role in the doctor-patient relationship.  I think that is self explanatory.</P>

Section 8 which deals with the preparation and issuing of codes of practice is limited by section 7 (2) in that all the functions of the institute are limited. Therefore, the specific functions of the institute set out in section 8 are also limited by section 7 (2).</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not accept the <i>bona fides</i> of what Deputy Bruton is attempting to do, that is, give the agency the status it deserves so that it will be the general policeman, the final arbiter or the overall authority in relation to what constitutes safe levels of radiation? Very often the special nature of the patient-doctor relationship is used as a protective mechanism or excuse for not doing what is intended, that is, the ultimate protection of the patient while at the same time not infringing on the special nature of the patient-doctor relationship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even though it is not the direct remit of the Minister I submit, in view of the fact that we are talking about safe radiation levels, that there is a fair degree of evidence of a considerable amount of laxity in regard to the exposure of patients to excess levels of radiation.  I am talking about, for example examinations under the jurisdiction of the Department of Health &mdash; people who are sent from one doctor to another in relation to disability benefit claims &mdash; people involved in long and intensive medical negligence cases and people who have to go for second, third, and fourth consultations. Very often the files in relation to the amount of exposure to radiation are not properly perused, or examined at all. There is considerable evidence of this. We are simply asking the Minister to assume overall responsibility for the general application of the guidelines without <Col N="1378" /> in any way affecting the patient-doctor relationship.</P>

      <P>Deputy Andrew Boylan gave me notice of his intention to raise the announcement by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Peter Brooke, that he intends closing four manned crossing points on the Fermanagh-Cavan Border during the hours of darkness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for the opportunity to raise this serious matter at such short notice.  I also thank the Minister of State for coming here to reply.  The announcement by the Northern Ireland Secretary of State, Mr. Peter Brooke, that he intends to close four manned checkpoints on the Cavan-Monaghan-Fermanagh Border after the hours of darkness will have serious implications for the local community.  Business people, farmers with land on both sides of the Border and people in employment will find it impossible to return home before the manned crossings are closed. This will create serious problems for normal cross-Border traffic.</P>
      <P>I believe that in acting in this manner Mr. Brooke is playing into the hands of the paramilitaries as he will be creating a siege mentality and causing strife between the communities North and South.  This is exactly what the terrorists are seeking to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers with land on both sides of the Border need to tend their cattle or sheep at night, especially in the late winter or early spring and they will not be able to reach them.  Offices generally close at 5 o'clock and darkness can fall as early as 4 p.m. and people who work in these offices will not be able to get home from work.  This is not acceptable.  Many students travel to third level institutions in Enniskillen and Coleraine.  Their travel will be prohibited by these regulations. Many more of them look forward to coming home on Friday afternoon to <Col N="1379" /> spend the weekend.  This will not be possible. Mr. Brooke is making a major mistake.</P>
    <P>I do not condone the activities of the paramilitaries in that region.  Every right thinking person condemns them.  I say clearly and categorically that we must all stand up and be counted in the face of what is happening in the Border region. I would draw the attention of the House to the recent outrage involving good neighbours and friends of mine, the North family.  Ken North, his wife and their son Peter were taken from their home and beaten.  Their son's legs were almost broken and he was then placed in a van with a proxy bomb of over 1,000 lbs. of explosives, which he was made to drive to a checkpoint.  He was able to jump from the van and shout a warning so that people could get away.  His courage saved the lives of the unfortunate soldiers and civilians who were queueing to cross the checkpoint.  The detonator went off but, fortunately, the bomb did not explode.  He showed remarkable courage.  I congratulate the North family. It is the third occasion on which this family have been singled out for this activity.</P>
    <P>Mr. Brooke in these proposals is playing into the hands of the paramilitaries. They are achieving what they set out to achieve.  These people are not interested in a united Ireland and anybody who claims that they are is fooling himself. They want strife to continue, and they are succeeding.  That will give them an opportunity and a reason for their bank robberies and various other activities to fund their godfathers, who are in control of these possibly unfortunate young people caught in this trap.</P>
    <P>I suggest that there should be a review of policy on all Border crossings.  I do not think the checkpoints are having the desired effect.  If they were, there should be no terrorism in Northern Ireland.  The minor roads have been blown up and there is no other access north or south except through these crossings.  I would ask the Minister to take particular notice of Aughalane Bridge, a very important crossing where there is not even a manned checkpoint.  The bridge was <Col N="1380" /> blown up by the British authorities many years ago and despite repeated requests to have it reopened we have failed.</P>
    <P>We cannot accept this proposal, which would have serious implications.  I am asking the Minister to take up the matter with the Secretary of State, to urge him to reconsider his proposal and if necessary to raise the matter at the Anglo-Irish Conference.  We would welcome that initiative and the Minister would have the support of people north and south of the Border.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad this matter has been raised here and I welcome the opportunity to reply.  I have listened to Deputy Boylan's comments and I have noted his concerns, particularly with regard to those who have to travel across the Border in connection with work or business or to attend third level institutions.  I am fully aware of the effect which the decision by the British authorities will have on the economic and social life of people living in Border areas.  Deputy Boylan's question originally referred to the Fermanagh-Cavan areas, but that position has been clarified. A similar position obtains in Monaghan, a matter which has been raised by Deputy Leonard, whose parish is split in two by what has happened.</P>
      <P>We have been in close contact with the British authorities about this development through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat in Belfast, and I am at present examining all its implications.  From the information to hand, it appears that barriers will be placed at the checkpoints referred to by the Deputy after the hours of darkness, but that there will be facilities which can serve in case of emergencies requiring immediate passage.  I also understand, from inquiries made through the secretariat, that there will be some flexibility in regard to what constitutes daylight hours and that, for example, a known vehicle will not be prevented from crossing at dusk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully sympathise with the points made by Deputy Boylan and his concern about the situation of people living on one side of the Border and working on the other. <Col N="1381" /> The difficulties as a result of the installation of these barriers will be especially acute during the coming weeks and months when, as the Deputy said, darkness can fall as early as 4 p.m. or 4.30 p.m.  I assure Deputy Boylan that we will do all in our power to try to alleviate the situation of those people in particular since their livelihood is at stake, and we will pursue this matter through the appropriate channels.</P>
    <P>I, like Deputy Boylan, fully appreciate the need for appropriate security measures, particularly in the wake of recent IRA proxy bomb attacks.  I am sure that the House will join with me and Deputy Boylan in unreservedly condemning these attacks and the coldblooded manner in which civilians have been used to carry them out.  At the same time I am concerned that these additional measures could have serious social and economic consequences for Border communities, particularly as the Christmas season approaches and people would wish to visit their relatives on either side of the Border.  I am particularly conscious of the disruption caused to the daily lives of those living in Border areas by checkpoints and closed roads.  In this regard, the mechanism of the Anglo-Irish Agreement has been fully used to ensure that the British authorities are aware of the views of local communities and Deputies on these matters.</P>
    <P>I can assure Deputy Boylan, Deputy Leonard and all the other public representatives from both sides of the Border who have raised this matter that the closure of these crossing points during the hours of darkness, as well as the question of closed cross-Border roads generally, will be actively pursued through the Anglo-Irish Conference procedure with a view in particular to ensuring that the inconvenience caused to local communities is kept to a minimum.</P>

      <P>Deputy John Browne gave me notice of his intention to raise the matter of the failure of the Minister for Agriculture and Food to implement the regulations covering the Abattoirs Act, as promised in reply to <Col N="1382" /> Parliamentary Question No. 29 of 17 May last, thus depriving county councils of the legal power to collect fees for the work of veterinary inspectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Last April, I discovered that Carlow County Council, as they were compelled to, appointed a veterinary inspector under the Abattoirs Act and did not have the power to collect fees although the inspector was to be paid out of the fees collected. On 17 May, I put down a question to the Minister asking him when he would introduce regulations under the Abattoirs Act.  He stated in reply:</P>
      <P>Regulations laying down requirements for the construction, equipping, operation and management of abattoirs came into operation on 22 June 1989.  The provision of the Act relating to the licensing of abattoirs and the recruitment of local authority veterinary inspectors came into operation on 1 September 1989.  Further regulations on health marks and on veterinary examination are at present being finalised and are expected to come into operation in the near future.</P>
      <P>I was taken by surprise at our estimates meeting last week when the county manager highlighted a deficit of £28,000 arising out of the fact that we had appointed the veterinary inspector in accordance with the Act.  He informed us that he could not collect any fees.  On discovering this I managed to get the reply that despite several efforts on the part of the managers they could not get the regulations implemented.  &ldquo;Oxymoron&rdquo; is a word I have used here on one or two occasions but we seem to come across contradictions all over the place.  Is it not amazing that the Minister has brought in provisions to compel county councillors to appoint veterinary inspectors while at the same time he forgot to bring in regulations which would allow the county councils to collect fees?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have the utmost respect for the manager's association and I am quite sure that they are not misinterpreting anything. We have set aside £30,000 to cover the cost next year and if the county councils are not allowed to collect fees <Col N="1383" /> we will find ourselves in debt.  It so happens we have fought over a 1 per cent increase in rates and argued during the course of two meetings over a cut of 1 per cent.  In our case this could represent an increase of 2 per cent in rates if we cannot get our hands on the money.  I do not see any point in asking the Minister to give me a guarantee that he will refund the £28,000 as I am sure other county councils find themselves in the same position.  However, I certainly want to know where we will stand next year.  I ask him not to abuse the English language and use terms such as &ldquo;they will be introduced in the near future&rdquo;, &ldquo;shortly&rdquo;, &ldquo;soon&rdquo; or &ldquo;before long&rdquo;.  I would like the Minister to give me a date on which these regulations will come into effect as there is no point doing any long term planning if these regulations are not brought into effect.  I look forward to hearing his reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I thank Deputy Browne for highlighting this matter and bringing it to the attention of the House.  The Abattoirs Act, 1988 provides for standards of veterinary control and hygiene at local abattoirs supplying the home market which will be on a par to those applying at export plants in order to ensure that consumers can be assured of a quality product.</P>
      <P>Under the Act each premises is required to undergo annual inspection and licensing by the Department of Agriculture and Food.  Since 1 September 1989 the regulations under the Act laying down the requirements for the construction and operation of the abattoirs supplying the domestic market have been operational.  The day to day operation of licensed abattoirs will be under the direct control and supervision of the local authority veterinary inspectorate who will undertake ante and post-mortem examinations to establish the fitness of meat for human consumption and to apply the health mark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part V of the Abattoirs Act, 1988, which provides for the collection of fees by local authorities in respect of veterinary examination of animals in domestic abattoirs, <Col N="1384" /> cannot be implemented until the Veterinary Examination and Health Mark Regulations are finalised.</P>
    <P>The veterinary examination regulations will specify the ante-mortem examination of animals for slaughter and post-mortem examination of carcases and offals to be carried out by veterinary inspectors.  They lay down the test methods, standards and requirements for determining the fitness of meat for human consumption.</P>
    <P>The health mark regulations provide for the stamping of meat found fit for human consumption.  This will enable identification of meat which passed veterinary examination and will also identify the abattoir where the meat was produced. Until these regulations are introduced there is no basis for the charging of fees by local authorities.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the nub of the issue. The delay in the introduction of these regulations is regretted.  It is due to the complexities of the regulations which are by their nature extremely detailed and technical.  They are receiving priority at present and I hope to introduce them in the near future.  By highlighting this matter the Deputy has helped expedite the regulations.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Chair very much for giving me the opportunity to raise this local but nonetheless extremely important issue and the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment for taking the time this evening to listen to the points I have to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Darndale Estate in the Coolock area of my constituency comprises 921 houses. The scheme was built in the early seventies according to an award winning <Col N="1385" /> design.  Unfortunately, this design was departed from severely and the 900 or so houses were built in one quarter of the original space provided.  The fabric of the buildings is of poor quality and the standards of construction and lay-out were nothing short of appalling.</P>
    <P>Since their construction it is fair to say that Darndale has descended into a ghetto, one of Dublin's most notorious, if not the worst.  Unemployment within the estate ran to upwards of 80 per cent at any one time and it was used by Dublin Corporation as a place of last resort for housing purposes.  However, in the mid to late eighties the people of Darndale organised and began to fight back.  Under an organisation of young people and group leaders, known as Image Changers, a new campaign was started to give Darndale a new face and a new environment.  They met with the then Taoiseach on 9 December 1985 and made their case to him.  On 14 January 1986 they met with the then Minister for the Environment as a community group involving all the agencies such as the tenant residents association and other concerned community organisations.</P>
    <P>This led to a mass public meeting in Darndale on 19 February 1986 when a very ambitious plan was announced by the Department of the Environment for the overhaul and refurbishment of the scheme in its entirety.  This was welcomed by all and funding was committed.  The community, in consultation with the Department of the Environment and the corporation, set about working out a scheme.  A pilot scheme was introduced covering 81 houses in the Primrose Grove area on the estate.  The idea was that the plan of refurbishment would be put into place in this area to learn the nuts and bolts of the operation and from there the overall plan could proceed.</P>
    <P>However, work on the pilot scheme did not ultimately begin until early 1988, tenders totalling £900,000 having been ageed for those houses in October 1987. That pilot scheme has been completed but since then only one of the seven remaining phases has been completed, that is, phase 2 involving 119 houses. That began in 1989 and the final work is only being tidied up at this stage.  Phase <Col N="1386" /> 3, involving a further 119 houses, has just been agreed at tender stage and it is anticipated that work on this phase will begin some time early in the new year. The cost to date of the work done, and planned, is of the order of £4.5 million but in short over the period of five years we have managed to deal only with 200 houses.  Consequently, at the rate we are progressing it will be upwards of 20 years before the entire estate is completed.</P>
    <P>My plea to the Minister of State this evening is that he realise that an excellent scheme, well received by all, is being destroyed because of slow progress.  I plead with him to do something to escalate progress so that, within a period of four to five years, the entire estate will be completed.  What is happening at present is development of an oasis in a wilderness, a scheme and attendant community being developed at an uneven pace so that the good work of his Department is being undermined.  I urge the Minister to examine this problem urgently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, it must be emphasised that the mangement and maintenance, including the repair and improvement, of their rented dwellings are matters for local authorities to be funded from their revenue resources.  The Government, however, recognise that some authorities face exceptional housing problems, the cost of which they could not easily deal with from these sources.  It is to assist authorities in coping with such problems that the remedial works scheme is operated by my Department.  It is designed to help them refurbish dwellings built under low-cost arrangements, pre-1940 houses which are in need of major structural repairs, and certain run-down urban estates.  The Government have allocated a total of £15 million for the scheme in 1990.  I am glad to say that Darndale is greatly benefiting from this programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a 921 house estate built by Dublin Corporation in the seventies.  The refurbishment involves a redesign of the unsatisfactory estate layout, as well as structural works to the houses.  Because of the size of the project, and the high <Col N="1387" /> cost involved &mdash; over £11 million &mdash; it is appropriate that it should be carried out on a phased basis.  The location of the phases, the number of dwellings involved in each phase and the amount to be assigned to the project from their annual remedial works scheme allocation, are entirely matters for decision by the local authority.</P>
    <P>To date, phase 1 &mdash; 81 houses in the Primrose area &mdash; has been completed. Work is virtually completed on the 119 houses in the Buttercup area which makes up phase 2.  So far, over £3 million has been spent on the project.  Last June, the seeking of tenders for phase 3 &mdash; which also consists of 119 houses &mdash; at Primrose Grove was approved.  The corporation's proposals in relation to the acceptance of a tender were received in the Department last week.  A decision will issue as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Darndale is one of seven Dublin Corporation housing estates which have been designated for funding under the remedial works scheme.  The total estimated cost of these projects is in the region of £80 million.  Dublin Corporation received a capital allocation of £5 million &mdash; one-third of the total available nationally for all remedial works &mdash; in 1990.  The apportionment of the allocation between their approved schemes, including Darndale, is entirely a matter for themselves.</P>
    <P>I have already explained that the management and maintenance, including improvement, of their housing stock are matters for the local authority.  The remedial works scheme is not a substitute for a properly planned, and executed, programme of management and maintenance and should not be seen as relieving an authority of their responsibility for keeping their housing stock in good condition.  It is open to Dublin Corporation to supplement, from their own revenue sources, the allocations made by the Department, as a means of expediting work in Darndale.  It is also essential that they should take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that the management and maintenance of the estate is such as to ensure that the benefits of the refurbishment continue in the long term, that <Col N="1388" /> the substantial investment in the project is protected and that the quality of their housing accommodation is maintained in the future for the benefit of the residents of Darndale.</P>
    <P>I can say to the Deputy that I understand the position quite well.  He will appreciate that the submission was received in my Department last week.  I can tell him I will be looking favourably at it.  He can rest assured that I understand the position well and will be favourably disposed towards it.</P>

      <P>The Minister, through his Department, allocated £879,000 to Kerry County Council in 1990 for the upkeep and improvement of our national primary roads.  That was the fifth lowest allocation of the 27 local authorities nationwide, the figure having been the smallest in years.  For example, in 1984 the Government allocated £2.135 million <Col N="1389" /> and in 1988 £1.927 million were allocated. As Kerry is one of our most peripheral counties we need good access and internal infrastructure from both a tourism and industrial point of view.</P>
      <P>It should be remembered that Kerry increased its tourist revenue over 50 per cent in the past four years.  Within that period not a single major road improvement project was carried out on the national primary route from Feales Bridge on the Limerick Border to Killarney and Tralee.  The section of the national primary road from Castleisland to Farranfore Airport must be the worst in the country.  There is grave danger that the growth in the tourist industry could be checked and industrialists discouraged from investing in our county if the Minister will not substantially increase the allocation for the improvement of our national primary roads in 1991.</P>

      <P>The need for the Department of the Environment to sanction moneys for up-grading public lighting in the village of Borris-in-Ossory is crystal clear.  Two pedestrian fatalities occurred in recent times in a village with a lighting system of a type more suited to the Emergency.  Surely this warrants immediate, positive action.</P>
      <P>In reply to parliamentary questions, reported at column 455 of the Official Report of Wednesday, 28 November last, the Minister suggested that Laois County Council had not applied for sanction.  I contend the Minister's reply was deliberately evasive, designed to provide as little information as possible.  The Minister is not presenting the true picture. Laois County Council have been in discussion with the Department of the Environment and a request has been submitted to that Department.</P>
      <P>In the interests of safety and, in view of the fact that the village of Borris-in-Ossory is the only village on the national primary route N7 with inferior and substandard lighting.  I am asking the Minister of State &mdash; who represents the constituency &mdash; to pledge to this House and the people of County Laois that this matter will receive urgent and immediate attention.</P>

      <P>In the early eighties it was envisaged that a large group water scheme would cover a wide area outside Shanagolden.  This scheme was never proceeded with and encompassed too wide an area.  Also it was difficult to organise and would have involved significant expenditure.  Over the years many of the people originally interested in the scheme proceeded to sink their own wells.  For the majority of those interested in the Clashganniff group water scheme it was not feasible to sink wells because of the ground surface.  Considerable advances have been made with the co-operation of Limerick County Council and the Department of the Environment.  What is now required is the commitment of the Minister to allocate State grants in order that this scheme can be proceeded with, providing a long awaited water supply for up to 30 applicants. I sincerely hope the Minister will now provide the necessary finance for that purpose.</P>

From one direction traffic, including juggernauts, drives off the Stillorgan dual carriageway and then seeks out short cuts through estates in Mount Merrion, Clonskeagh and Dundrum.  From the west, where part of the ring road has been constructed, heavy traffic arrives at Rathfarnham with nowhere to go.  It spreads through Ballyroan Road, Scholarstown Road, Butterfield Park and in general takes every available short cut through what once were quiet and safe housing estates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Southern Cross route should, when it is built by 1995, help to resolve this problem.  The Dundrum by-pass will also have an impact.  In the meantime, Dublin County Council have no adequate funds to provide ramps for these estates that are being directly affected by the dramatic increase in traffic.  I ask the Minister in the interest of public safety to <Col N="1391" /> make a special road safety allocation to cope with this urgent, immediate need.</P>

      <P>I raised the matter of the serious traffic problem in Borris-in-Ossory village by way of a question in this House on 28 November and I want to bring to the attention of the House again the dangerous traffic situation in Borris-in-Ossory.  The traffic conditions in the village are a threat to the local community.  In the past month there have been two separate fatal accidents.  Two highly respected members of the local community lost their lives mainly because of bad lighting and poor road conditions. To aggravate the situation, at least six people were knocked down and injured in separate accidents in the main street. That is why I raise this matter here in Dáil Éireann tonight.  The Minister for the Environment must immediately ensure that Laois County Council are given the necessary finances to instal national primary route lighting and a proper road surface in the town.  The gardaí have a hand radar on loan from Durrow Garda station.  A permanent hand radar should be provided in Borris-in-Ossory village for the Garda Síochána. More vigilance enforcing traffic speed limits in this area is also necessary.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the professional staff of the Eastern Health Board are endeavouring to provide an adequate health service in Swords, a town with a population of over 20,000 from a condemned Victorian building built in the early part of this century?  Will he confirm that the provision of a new health centre in Swords is a Government priority and that finance will be made available from his Department in 1991 to enable work to proceed? I understand from the Eastern Health Board that they cannot proceed any further without this commitment and the situation is totally unacceptable to the people in Swords.</P>

      <P>Tralee General Hospital is the only hospital of its size, apart from Sligo, which is without junior anaesthetic staff.  One year ago the Department of Health sent an official to Tralee General Hospital to assess the needs of the anaesthetic department.  The official recommended that three junior anaesthetists and an anaesthetic nurse be appointed.  These recommendations have to date been ignored by the health board despite the fact that there is a major problem in Tralee General Hospital because of the lack of junior anaesthetists. When one of the present anaesthetists is ill or absent, operation lists have to be cancelled and patients sent home.  If junior staff were available these operations could take place.  If an onduty consultant is involved in a serious operation he may be called away to an emergency case.  This occurred recently when a consultant was called away from an orthopaedic emergency to attend to a Caesarian section.  This incident was reported to the Southern Health Board; however, nothing happened.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the problem is addressed immediately and that three junior anaesthetists and an anaesthetic nurse are appointed as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to mention the continuing crisis in the service for persons with mental handicap.  The crisis is twofold. Many persons in urgent need of placement are receiving no service whatsoever and existing services are hopelessly underfunded.  Hundreds of persons are at present on waiting lists who receive no service or an inadequate one.  There is an acute shortage of residential places throughout the country.  Organisations, voluntary and statutory, are struggling to cope but are severely handicapped and hampered by the scarcity of resources. The onus of care falls back on families who are ill-equipped to manage.  In many cases the quality of life for the persons and their families is poor and the suffering is considerable.  Research shows that at least 2,000 more residential places are required in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise that £2 million extra this year has been a help, but it is still grossly <Col N="1393" /> inadequate.  Existing services are then hopelessly underfunded and persons suffering most from these cutbacks are those of disturbed behaviour and the profoundly disabled.  The service cannot continue without the necessary staff and input from the Government.  I know the Minister is conscious of this.  We attended day care centres together in my constituency and he must be aware of the crisis in the care of the handicapped.</P>

      <P>Regarding Balbriggan by-pass, I can confirm to Deputy Ryan that the Government accept the need for a by-pass of Balbriggan.  I can also tell him that the operational programme, which will set out the timing of all our proposals for major road improvement schemes, will be published next week.</P>
      <P>In respect of Kerry roads, until the road grant allocations for 1991 are decided, I cannot say what amount will be available for national primary roads in Kerry next year.  However, Deputy Deenihan can be assured that the needs of County Kerry will be taken fully into account in making the allocations.</P>
      <P>In regard to Borris-in-Ossory, I fully appreciate the concerns of Deputies Enright and Flanagan about public lighting at Borris-in-Ossory and I also regret the recent tragic loss of life arising from two road accidents.  The development of proposals for improvements to public lighting at this location is a matter in the first instance for Laois County Council. On receipt of any such proposals in my Department, the question of road grant funding will be favourably considered.</P>
      <P>On the Shanagolden group scheme I have to tell Deputy Finucane that my Department are awaiting Limerick County Council's approval of the Shanagolden group's revised design.  When details of the council's requirements are received, my Department will be able to cost the scheme and to deal with the group's application for grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding road ramps, I must tell Deputy Kitt that the cost of providing ramps falls to be financed from local authority resources, supplemented by the discretionary grants provided by my <Col N="1394" /> Department.  Dublin County Council will receive £1.3 million in such grants this year.  It is up to them to decide what schemes they will carry out with the aid of these grants.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Seán Ryan, we are aware that the present health centre at Swords is inadequate to meet the needs of this growing area.  The Eastern Health Board have already purchased a central site for the construction of a new health centre.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board are also aware of the inadequacies of the existing facilities and have already made alternative arrangements for community welfare services and for ante-natal classes. The new health centre at Swords is high on the priority list drawn up by the Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>In recent years the resources provided in the public capital programme for health projects have not been sufficient to meet all the competing demands.  As soon as the public capital programme for 1991 is announced consideration will be given to the possibility of granting approval to the development of health centres including the new centre at Swords.  The Eastern Health Board intend to carry out a further review of the situation in Swords shortly in order to determine what further improvements can be carried out to the existing health centre, pending the construction of the new health centre.</P>
      <P>In regard to Deputy Deenihan's question, as pointed out to the Deputy in reply to a Parliamentary Question on this matter on Thursday last, the provision of anaesthetic services at Tralee General Hospital is a matter in the first instance for the Southern Health Board.</P>
      <P>In line with current personnel policy, health agencies generally, including the Southern Health Board, have autonomy to make appointments of staff up to a given number without my Department's approval subject to certain restrictions, including the need to operate within available financial resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Officials from my Department are having discussions with the Southern Health Board &mdash; indeed I was present at <Col N="1395" /> one of them recently &mdash; with regard to the board's priority requirements in the context of the 1991 allocation.</P>
    <P>The provision of additional staff for the anaesthetic department at Tralee General Hospital will be a matter for the Southern Health Board to determine having regard to its overall financial situation and in the context of other competing priority requirements.</P>
    <P>In regard to Deputy Ferris' question, we are aware of the difficulties which exist in our mental handicap services at present.  For this reason regional mental handicap co-ordinating committees were reactivated by the Minister for Health to produce multi-annual plans for the development of the service in a prioritised and co-ordinated way.</P>
    <P>This year approximately £140 million will be spent on the provision of services to people with mental handicap.  An additional £2 million was allocated to meet the immediate priority needs identified by the co-ordinating committees.  This allocation enabled 170 residential places and 442 day places to be provided.  It was <Col N="1396" /> also possible to approve 25 extra staff for other supports.</P>
    <P>I must also point out that allocations to voluntary mental handicap agencies funded by my Department have been protected since 1986 in real terms in recognition of the vital service they provide. I feel, therefore, that the Government's record shows a commitment to mental handicap services, and an understanding that this area should be regarded as a high priority.</P>
    <P>The priority requirements for service developments in 1991 are being considered by my Department at present and will be incorporated in a national programme for the development of mental handicap services.  I am determined that the priority needs established in this national programme will be dealt with in line with the funds made available to the health services in 1991 and future years.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 6 December 1991.</P>

      <P>The Exchequer subvention to CIE in 1990 in respect of essential public transport services will amount to almost £111 million, of which about £14.8 million is in respect of bus services provided by Dublin Bus.  I have no plans to increase the level of Exchequer subvention.</P>
      <P>Since I took up office, I have consistently refused applications from CIE for increases in fares and rates, emphasising instead the need for further cost economies within the CIE group's operations to keep the costs of public transport to the travelling public and to the Exchequer as low as possible. However, in view particularly of the substantial increase in fuel costs arising from the Gulf Crisis, I decided reluctantly that an increase in fares and rates was unavoidable, since these fuel cost increases, being outside CIE's control, must be recovered.  I have therefore, recently conveyed approval to CIE for an increase not exceeding 7 per cent in fares and rates from an early date.  The precise details of the individual fares increases are at present being settled between my Department and CIE.</P>
      <P>I should mention that the last increase in CIE fares and rates was in January 1988.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 94 together.</P>
      <P>The Government decided in 1987 that no further consideration should be given to extending the DART system, because of the high costs of such development and the scarcity of financial resources. Following this decision CIE submitted transport investment plans for the greater Dublin area involving bus-based options and diesel services on existing lines.</P>
      <P>Most of the bus proposals in the plans have already been implemented.  The plans also propose the construction of four new stations on the railway line from Maynooth to the city centre.  I am pleased to say that these new stations were opened last July and that the project has been included for EC assistance in the operational programme for peripherality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The investment plans prepared by CIE also included proposals for a commuter diesel rail service on the line from Clondalkin to the city with eight new stations and a feeder bus service to Tallaght.  This project is also included in the operational <Col N="1208" /> programme.  Assistance from the programme has been made conditional on the outcome of a socio-economic cost benefit analysis of the proposed investment. This examination will be undertaken shortly and it is expected that it will confirm the merits of proceeding with the project as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I am also looking at other options for meeting the public transport needs of the city and in this connection I have established a high level working group to asses and report on the feasibility of rail and busway options for public passenger transport in relation to the former Harcourt Street railway line and the Tallaght area.  I expect to receive the report of the group shortly.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the chairman of CIE that the existing DART fleet is adequate to cater for any further increase in passengers in the foreseeable future.</P>

      <Quest>if he has discussed with Irish Rail the request made by Dublin Corporation for a narrow strip of land along the Royal Canal near Spencer Dock Bridge, Dublin 1, in addition to the smaller site already under negotiation to enable Dublin Corporation to rehouse the tenants of the Sheriff Street flats; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>My Department has been in contact with CIE about the question of having land owned by the board made available to Dublin Corporation to rehouse tenants displaced from the Sheriff Street Area.</P>
      <P>I have been informed that the board recently agreed terms with the corporation for sale of a site at Spencer Avenue.  I also understand that there have been discussions between the board and the corporation about the sale of other sites.</P>
      <P>I should explain to the Deputy that CIE have a statutory obligation not to dispose of property which is required for the purposes of the undertaking.  I fully appreciate the need to rehouse the tenants of Sheriff Street Flats and I raised with CIE the question of disposing to Dublin Corporation the particular strip of land to which the Deputy's question refers.  CIE have indicated, however, that they wish to reserve this land for possible future railway development.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the upsurge of hostilities in Sri Lanka and of the disturbing reports of human rights abuses there.  On 22 October, Ireland joined with its partners in the European Community in issuing a declaration on Sri Lanka.  The European Community and its member states deplored the resurgence of hostilities initiated by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in June and the misery thus caused to the civilian population in the affected parts of the country.  The Community, while recognising the serious difficulties faced by the SriLankan Government, urged that only minimum necessary force be used in restoring peace and maintaining order in the country.</P>
      <P>Ireland and its partners in the Community have regularly conveyed their concerns on the issue of human rights to the Sri Lankan authorities.  They have particularly urged the Sri Lankan Government to act against the death squads and to make every effort to bring the perpetrators of such killings to justice.</P>
      <P>The issue of human rights in Sri Lanka was also raised by the European Community and its member states on 26 November, in the Third Committee of the United Nations which deals with human rights issues.</P>
      <P>As an indication of the extent of their concern on human rights in Sri Lanka, the Community and its member states have drawn attention to the fact that they will be considering their future assistance for the development of Sri Lanka's economy with reference, among other factors, to the Government's performance in regard to human rights.</P>

      <P>My Department has received representations recently from the Irish section of Amnesty International concerning the human rights situation in Syria and in particular the work being done by Amnesty International on behalf of more than 280 prisoners of conscience there.</P>
      <P>The Government have not so far made representations to the Syrian Government but we continue to follow the issue closely.  The question of human rights in Syria has already been a subject of discussion from time to time in European Political Co-operation.</P>
      <P>I will ensure that it is raised again for consideration in the relevant working group at an early date.</P>

In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners have acted in accordance with the regulations in this instance.</P>
      <P>I have previously indicated that a review of the relevant regulations would take place after their first year in operation. This review is now under way and, in that connection, the relevant medical and departmental authorities involved have already been asked for their views on operational and other aspects of the scheme.</P>

      <P>The Killery river enters the Bonet at a point downstream of Dromahair, County Leitrim.  In the preparation of the Bonet catchment drainage scheme a number of these downstream areas were excluded for practical and economic reasons.  During the course of scheme works a number of representations were made on behalf of the landowners concerned to have this river included in the scheme and it was decided to re-examine the feasibility of carrying out some works in the area when the scheduled works of the scheme had been completed.</P>
      <P>Early indications for a scheme of works were relatively promising and it was decided to process the matter further. However, more recently it has proved necessary to re-examine the scheme as a whole on environmental and economic grounds and it is imperative now that works be curtailed for these reasons.  The inclusion of the Killery river in the Bonet scheme could not be justified as the cost would be incommensurate with the benefits to be derived.</P>

      <Quest>when it is intended that some general work will be carried out on the Bonet river between Dromahair and Lough Gill, where conditions have deteriorated considerably arising out of the changed patterns of water flow because of the excellent work done in the arterial drainage of the other sections of the Bonet river.</Quest>

      <P>The stretch of the River Bonet between Dromahair and Lough Gill was excluded from the Bonet catchment drainage scheme for practical and economic reasons.  The channel immediately downstream of Dromahair has a very steep gradient levelling out as it nears the lake.  In these lower reaches the channel is greatly influenced by lake levels which would to a large extent negate the effects of any drainage works.  In addition the bed of the river is largely composed of rock which would render prohibitive the cost of any works which might be considered.</P>
      <P>With regard to the suggestion that drainage upstream has changed the pattern of water flows, the Commissioners of Public Works have had a number of surveys of the area carried out during the course of scheme works and the results show that the drainage scheme has not caused any deterioration of the position. Any flooding which occurs is of shorter duration than existed pre-drainage and the commissioners are satisfied with the capacity of the river to cater for postdrainage flows.  The commissioners will, of course, keep the position under review.</P>

      <P>Between 1984 and 1988, the local improvements scheme was confined to counties qualifying for EC aid under the Western Package.  Since then, I extended the scope of the scheme to all other counties. In 1990, a grant of £50,000 was allocated to each of 12 county councils, including Waterford County Council.</P>

      <P>I propose to circulate in the Official Report a tabular statement setting out details of State road improvement and maintenance grants for national primary roads in each of the years from 1980 to 1990.  The figures for 1980 to 1989 are the amounts of grant payments in each of the years in question. The 1990 figures represent the allocations for the year.</P>
      <P>The information available in my Department on EC grant commitments relates to the overall amounts in respect of improvement works on national primary, national secondary and major urban roads.  Information on the commitments for national primary roads alone is being compiled and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>It is also understood from Limerick County Council that the reckonable income in this case for the year ended 5 April 1990 is such as to warrant renewal of grant for the 1990-91 academic year at the rate of full fees and the council will be informing the applicant accordingly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 87 and 88 together.</P>
      <P>Inservice training for teachers involved in the new junior certificate programme is provided by way of a series of one-day courses, which are organised nationwide. Three such courses have been held to date and they have dealt mainly with syllabus content and methodology.  It is my intention to provide at least two one-day courses per school year up to 1992. As I have already announced in the House the next two courses will be held in late January or early February and in March 1991.</P>
      <P>Travelling expenses are payable to course participants.  Subsistence is in the form of a midday meal, which is provided at course centres.  Substitution costs are not payable by my Department; school managers may close their schools on course days, if they deem it necessary, for the purpose of allowing their teachers to attend the courses.</P>
