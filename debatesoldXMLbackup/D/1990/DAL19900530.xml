      <P>I have notice from Deputy Dick Spring that he seeks leave to move a motion under Standing Order 30.  Will the Deputy please state the matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the unprecedented and outlandish statement of the Minister for Communications in this House last night, I serve you notice, Sir, that I wish to raise a Standing Order 30 matter this morning.  The matter I wish to raise is as follows:</P>
      <P>That this House condemns the unprecedented attack on a public company by the Government, and the total breach of the spirit of the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> as outlined in the announcement of the Minister for Communications last night, and instructs the Government not to proceed with the proposals contained in the Minister's announcement.  Furthermore, this House considers that in the light of his intentions, the Minister for Communications is not a fit person to appoint a new RTE Authority. Accordingly, this House has no confidence in the Minister for Communications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="708" /> I move that motion in view of the statement made by the Minister for Communications last night, in view of the obvious top off the head type of decision it indicates&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure you are aware, Sir, that as of now this matter is by far the most important public issue, certainly in the context of what has been said on the airwaves this morning and is still being said at this time.  Also, given that the Minister for Communications is going to announce a new RTE Authority, the mind boggles at the instructions and guidelines he will be issuing to them.  I am asking the Taoiseach in the public interest, contrary to the announcement made by the Minister last night which was certainly not in the public interest and not in the interest of the RTE Authority or of public broadcasting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out that, first, the Minister made the announcement in the House during the course of the debate on broadcasting. Furthermore, his proposals will have to be enshrined in legislation.  That legislation will be published within a day or two and will be taken in this House within a week or so.  The Deputy will have every <Col N="710" /> opportunity to voice any concern he wishes about these proposals in that way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's intervention at this stage.  Let me ask him when this legislation was contemplated. We were circulated with a list of legislation for this House about three weeks ago and there was no mention of this legislation.  Furthermore, the Minister for Communications said in this House in 1987 that public moneys would not be required for propping up Century and other stations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 11 and 12.  It is also proposed, subject to the agreement of the House, that (1) business shall be interrupted at 10.30 p.m. tonight; (2) the sitting shall be suspended today from 6.30 p.m. to 7 p.m.; (3) the proceedings on Committee Stage of No. 11 shall be brought to a conclusion in accordance with the following timetable: sections 11-13 to conclude not later than 1 p.m.; sections 14-18 to conclude not later than 4.30 p.m.; sections 19-22 to conclude not later than 5.30 p.m.; sections 23-41 to conclude not later than 9 p.m.; section 42 (conclusion) to conclude not later than 10.30 p.m.; and where proceedings have not concluded by the stated time, they shall be brought to a conclusion by one question which shall be put from the Chair, and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only amendments set down by the Minister for Labour.  Private Members' Business shall be No. 23.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing the proposal for a late sitting tonight because I feel it is the only way open to this House today to protest against the hamfisted approach adopted here last night by the Minister <Col N="711" /> for Communications on an issue which goes wider and deeper than the issues contemplated in the Fine Gael motion. The Minister for Communications is intending to solve one problem, which I agree should be solved, but in doing so he is keeping up his sleeve a series of draconian measures which cannot but have the most serious effects on RTE and create a whole series of other problems. It is not the proper business of the Minister for Communications to create new problems for a company for which he is responsible in a way which will not bring any benefit to the other companies which he says he is interested in preserving.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to inform you we are opposing the Order of Business and I urge the Taoiseach that the matter which I referred to in my Standing Order 30 application should be taken in this House today.  The House is sitting until 10.30 p.m.  I believe that matter should be debated in the public interest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>In general terms, The Workers' Party will be opposing in every way possible the announcements and proposals of the Government as indicated by the Minister for Communications last night.  Clearly the business of the day is urgent and important, dealing as it does with the Industrial Relations Bill.  We would certainly support the motion proposed by the Labour Party in seeking to challenge what is happening.  The Workers' Party have an amendment to the Fine Gael motion which will be taken tonight, which in essence reflects the position of the party as opposed to that of Government, who are attacking in an unwarranted way the position of the national broadcasting station.</P>
      <P>For those reasons we are obviously not in a position to oppose the late sitting of this House, but in any other way available to us The Workers' Party will be standing full square against what is being proposed in this measure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party had a motion on broadcasting before the House.  The Minister announced his proposals in this House.  We are often attacked for not announcing proposals in this House but when we do so we are also attacked.  The Minister announced his proposals in good faith.  Those proposals will have to be enshrined in legislation and every Member of this House will then be free to express fully his or her concern about these proposals and act accordingly during the debate.  The Government are proceeding in a totally democratic manner in this regard.  I would add that the Minister's proposals are brought forward in response to requests and pressure from every side of this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>You are quite right, Sir.  I put the Taoiseach on notice now that I will oppose every one of the hamfisted measures the Minister has up his sleeve <Col N="713" /> which will seriously damage RTE and will not produce any of the benefits for any other of the interests he claims to want to protect.</P>

      <P>I want to put on record, Sir, my reservations about the speed with which we are going through this very important industrial relations legislation.  We will probably not be back in this House again on this matter for 15 to 20 years and it is my considered view that unless full consideration is given to many of the sections we will create a lot of problems for ourselves.  For that reason I want the record to show that we are opposed to what is, in effect, a guillotine motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>For a variety of reasons it has been necessary to agree to a guillotine for the processing of the remainder of Committee Stage of the Bill.  I greatly regret that.  This is the first major Bill before the House in almost 45 years dealing with this topic and it is regrettable that a Bill that is likely to have such an impact on our industrial progress ought to have to be guillotined in this fashion. On the last occasion all sides had agreed that section 11 was the single most important provision in the Bill.  It radically alters the law on picketing.  Under the <Col N="725" /> 1906 Act picketing was lawful once it was in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute.  There were no restrictions on the premises which could be picketed nor was there any restriction on who could make up the picket.  Restrictions were, as the Minister pointed out, imposed by the courts and, generally, it was necessary to show that there was a connection between those picketing and the employer in dispute, the premises being picketed and that employer.</P>
      <P>It was in exceptional circumstances that the courts intruded and then it was only to ensure that picketing was carried out in an orderly and peaceful fashion. However, the new provisions on picketing go much further than anything imposed by the courts.  The section draws a distinction between primary and secondary picketing.  In the case of primary picketing it is clear that the only premises which can be picketed are those of the employer in dispute, where he works or carries on business.  The only employees who can participate in the picket are the workers of the employers concerned. Inevitably, a number of practical problems will arise from that provision.  It is usual in many industries for pickets to be augmented by other members of the trade union concerned and, on occasion, from members generally.  Often it is necessary to enter into a dispute with an employer who is not employing members of the union in order to prevent that employer working outside the terms of a particular industry-wide agreement.  I have formed the view that this amounts to a very serious restriction on trade union rights and significantly shifts the balance of power which has obtained up to now between employers and trade unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 26 in my name specifically addresses the question of the test that must be applied where workers are picketing a secondary employer.  The changes introduced by the Minister now require that workers so picketing must have a reasonable belief, at the commencement of their attendance and throughout the continuance of their attendance, that the employer has acted <Col N="726" /> in a way calculated to frustrate the strike or other industrial action by directly assisting their employer who is party to the dispute.  It will not, therefore, be enough for the workers to honestly believe that such is the case, the belief must also be reasonable.</P>
    <P>There is an important distinction here between the criterion applied by the court as to whether workers honestly believed that the secondary employer was contributing to undermining the dispute or whether an objective criterion is applied by the courts requiring this reasonable belief on the part of workers.  This invites the involvement of High Court Judges in determining the tactics of a trade dispute. Section 11 (2) is so worded and rigorous in terms of its application to the trade union movement that it is unreasonable to expect people involved in a trade dispute to have more than an honest belief that the secondary employer is acting in a manner damaging to or interfering with their dispute, especially when one sees the context of the total section which not only requires trade unionists picketing the secondary employer to have this reasonable belief but also to have a belief that the employer has acted &ldquo;in a way calculated to frustrate the strike or other industrial action by directly assisting their employer who is party to the trade dispute in the first instance&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is completely unreasonable to require trade unionists to be able to support a claim that the secondary employer was acting in a way calculated to frustrate the strike.  I gave several examples where other employers could act to frustrate the strike but it would be impossible to prove that the secondary employer so calculated. I instanced the contract sector, specifically the example in this House.  If a contract catering company tenders in the marketplace and gets the contract for providing the catering service to the Members and staff of this House &mdash; and subsequently refuse to employ the existing staff who have been doing the work for many years &mdash; there is no way it can be proved that the employer was acting in a manner calculated to directly assist the existing employer.  Far from it, he <Col N="727" /> was acting in his own commercial interest and it would not be possible for the workers in the canteen to prosecute a trade dispute against the new employer under this section.</P>
    <P>I should say &mdash; in case anyone in the House is not familiar with it &mdash; that the entire tradition, convention and practice in the trade union movement is in the proliferating contracts in which they operate today.  They cannot prevent another contractor in any area &mdash; security, cleaning or catering &mdash; from tendering but they say that the workers have a right to follow their work.  In other words, if the security for this House was on a contract basis and if another contractor managed to win it for a subsequent period of five years or whatever, then he should employ the existing staff. That is the basis on which the trade union movement operate and if the new contractor does not employ the existing staff it is possible for the members concerned to prosecute a trade dispute for employment against the new employer.  Under the 1906 Act it is permissible to prosecute a trade dispute for employment and in this case the workers would be seeking to hold on to their own jobs.</P>
    <P>However, it is not possible as this section is framed and I ask the Minister to accept the fact that contracting and subcontracting are becoming more common in our economy.  They are a growing feature of the structure of the workforce and to put so many workers outside the protection of this Bill would be wrong because they are most vulnerable and insecure.  I have personal experience of dealing with the contract area in a range of services and I know that workers have no security.</P>
    <P>For example, the committee responsible for the restaurant facilities in this House might decide that they are not satisfied with a certain aspect and put it out to tender.  They might also consider that the cost is prohibitive and no trade union can interfere with that decision, which is quite proper.  However, in the event of a new successful contractor not employing the existing workers, the workers will go out the gate but they may <Col N="728" /> not prosecute a dispute because, if they do, they will not have the immunities conferred by this Bill.</P>
    <P>I feel no less strongly about this now than I did on the last occasion.  The record shows that my union colleague, Deputy Bell, felt equally strongly.  We are both talking from experience and it is not a partisan view because workers are entitled to join a trade union and to have its protection if their employment is threatened.  Accordingly, I plead with the Minister to consider his position.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank Deputy Rabbitte, Deputy Mitchell and Deputy Quinn for agreeing to take Committee Stage today.  This matter was debated for four days on Second Stage, we will have had two days on Committee Stage, which is quite lengthy, and we still have Report Stage. There will also be a long debate in the Seanad.  I thank the Opposition Deputies for their co-operation otherwise it would not have been possible to finish this Stage today.</P>
      <P>Perhaps it is a sign of the times that we must accept that the Finance Bill, the Social Welfare Bill and the Bill on the environment take precedence with the Whips because of the many pressures being exerted on them.  Nonetheless, I appreciate that we had more or less four days devoted to Second Stage debate and now another full day on Committee Stage, not to mention Report Stage. Because of the number of arguments advanced and cases made, bearing in mind other conditions prevailing, probably we will be unable to reach Report Stage until the end of this session, but I can assure Members that we will examine closely amendments tabled and arguments advanced.  I can give the House an assurance that I will also talk to my Opposition colleagues because I anticipate that it will be difficult to get sufficient time to debate Report Stage.  Nonetheless I want to thank them for their co-operation and assistance to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte has expressed strong views on this section.  I want to reiterate some of the points I made on the last <Col N="729" /> occasion and to make some additional ones.  The subsection deals with secondary picketing.  It has three main aims, the first being to clarify the existing legal position so that the law, once again, constitutes a guide to conduct, and which has been highlighted in a number of recent court cases.  The second aim is to regulate secondary picketing more closely and to define &ldquo;secondary picketing&rdquo; in clearly understood industrial relations terms rather than engagement in legal monologues in an endeavour to examine an industrial relations issue.</P>
    <P>The precise legal position in regard to secondary picketing is unclear but is generally thought to be as set out in the case of Ellis <i>v.</i> Wright in 1978 when it was held that, for a picket to be lawful, there must be a &ldquo;clearly discernible connection between the premises picketed and the dispute in the sense that the employer or workman affected by the picket is directly connected with the dispute&rdquo;. This interpretation limits the extent of the protection given to picketing in section 2 (1) of the 1906 Act but is still sufficiently vague to allow for considerable confusion to arise as to what constitutes legal secondary picketing in particular cases.</P>
    <P>The people participating in this debate will understand the difficulties that continue to arise in this area.  This is especially so in proceedings for interim and interlocutory injunctions.  The danger with this lack of clarity is that the law will fall into disrepute and no longer act as a guide to conduct.  Therefore, the clarification provided by this subsection is extremely important to industrial relations practice.</P>
    <P>Another aim of the subsection is to regulate secondary picketing more closely and not to extend it.  The broad &ldquo;clearly discernible connection&rdquo; test of case law will be replaced by a more precise statutory statement on lawful secondary picketing.  The subsection provides that secondary picketing will be lawful if, but only if, it is reasonable for picketers to believe that the second <Col N="730" /> employer has acted in a manner calculated to frustrate the strike or other industrial action by directly assisting their employer who is a party to the trade dispute.  Merely filling a gap in the market left by a strike-bound employer will not give rise to lawful secondary picketing.</P>
    <P>The subsection also changes the basis on which the connection between the first and second employer is judged in secondary picketing &mdash; from a mixed company law/industry relations basis to a straight industrial relations basis.  The present test can give rise to complicated questions of company structure, such as who controls the company, whether one company is legally related to another in such a way as to be able to bring pressure to bear on the first company to resolve a dispute.  The legal relationship between companies &mdash; especially in large groups of companies &mdash; will not be obvious to picketers or strike organisers.  However, under the provisions of this subsection picketers will have a simpler question to answer &mdash; which we believe to be extremely important to them &mdash; more directly related to their industrial relations experience, that is: &ldquo;is it reasonable to believe that the second employer is acting to frustrate the strike?&rdquo;  Thus the law will become a better guide to conduct with workers having a clearer idea of what is and is not lawful in a particular dispute.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to go into any great detail in this House with regard to the number of difficulties experienced with people taking both interim and interlocutory injunctions and the case on which they base such injunctions. This will present workers, trade unions and indeed their legal advisers with a much clearer question.  We must remember that, within the trade union movement today, there has to be resort to legal advice on a variety of issues, that is the reality, but, in a court hearing, an objective test would apply to the reasonableness of the picketers' belief that the second employer acted directly to frustrate a strike or industrial action.  It would not be reasonable for people merely to <Col N="731" /> have any view; they must have an objective view.  If people believe they have a reasonable case, they must put that case. If they have such a reasonable case then they are justified in their secondary picketing action.</P>
    <P>With regard to amendments Nos. 26 to 28, inclusive, I might reiterate that Deputies will be aware that secondary picketing was one of the most controversial issues which arose in the preparation of this Bill, and Deputy Rabbitte was correct in so saying.  There has been pressure exerted on me from the employers side to outlaw such secondary picketing completely.  They advanced probably one of the strongest arguments ever on the part of employers in the course of discussions on this and previous legislation on industrial relations.</P>
    <P>The work previously undertaken endeavoured to completely outlaw secondary picketing.  As I have indicated on many occasions my view is that that would be going too far.  If secondary picketing were to be completely outlawed employers would be afforded wide scope to circumvent the effects of legitimate industrial action.  While employers have a right to endeavour to circumvent the effects of any strike directed against them, in a democratic society this cannot be an absolute right and must be balanced by the right of workers to bring economic pressure to bear to further their legitimate claim.  That is something about which I feel as strongly as anybody else. Therefore, under the provisions of the subsection only employers who directly involve themselves in a dispute, by acting to frustrate a strike, will be subjected to secondary picketing.  In addition, if secondary picketing were completely outlawed we would be presented with a massive problem <i>vis-à-vis</i> enforcement.</P>
    <P>Therefore I have adopted a middle ground approach and stipulated what I believe to be a fair approach to secondary picketing, that is, that it be permissible where it is reasonable for those workers picketing to believe that the second employer was acting directly in a way calculated to frustrate a strike by directly assisting.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="732" /> Were I to accept these amendments, as tabled, it would lead to a loosening of the overall position, when we would be moving away from the objective test of having &ldquo;a reasonable belief in the concept of direct assistance,&rdquo; central to the proposal to regulate secondary picketing in a balanced manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bell dealt with this part of the debate in my absence on the last occasion.  I have one or two questions I want to put to the Minister.  Everybody shares the view that, if we can render the law as explicit as possible, room for judicial interpretation will have been reduced.  It is our concern that judicial interpretation, so far as is necessary, be minimised.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, would the Minister inform the House what would be his and his advisers' test of &ldquo;reasonable belief and directly assisting their employer&rdquo; if an employer, the object of a secondary picket, were to seek an injunction preventing that picket from interfering with his business, if his legal team were to challenge the validity of the picket and the immunities such picketing would enjoy under the provisions of this Bill in general?  If they were to go to court, contending there is not reasonable belief in a given case, that they were not directly assisting, if the union representing the workers were then to say: &ldquo;we believe you are assisting&rdquo;, how does the Minister anticipate the court might interpret such a plea?  What would be the range of interpretation prevailing in such circumstances? The object of Deputy Rabbitte's amendment &mdash; which I support &mdash; is to afford secondary picketers as wide a scope as possible within a relatively compact framework which is what this subsection, if amended, would do.  I ask the Minister to tell us why the adjective &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;, as distinct from the word &ldquo;belief&rdquo;, is contained in the Bill and what is meant by the term &ldquo;directly assisting&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that we include the term &ldquo;directly assisting&rdquo; in the Bill as the interpretation of the word <Col N="733" />&ldquo;assisting&rdquo; is so loose as to make it meaningless. As I outlined earlier, I do not believe that one could argue that an employer filling a niche in the market is acting in a way calculated to frustrate a strike but if the second employer is actively involved in the transferring or switching of orders from one employer to another he is acting in a way calculated to frustrate a strike.  As Deputy Rabbitte pointed out, both the workers and trade unions are aware of what the normal practice is in an operation and who is supplying the company.  On the first day of a strike they will very quickly be able to see who is acting in a way calculated to frustrate the strike.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn asked in what way will the court interpret the section.  In the courts the employees will have to outline their reasons for believing the employer is acting in a way calculated to frustrate the strike.  I do not think they will have any great difficulty in doing this.  The courts will have to decide what constitutes reasonable belief if any worker or union official goes into court to argue that it is reasonable for him to believe that a second employer is acting in a way calculated to frustrate the strike.  It is important that we bear in mind in our discussions on this matter that there has to be an objective test and that someone should not be able to decide off the top of his head that even though everything appears normal in the enterprise with no one acting in a way calculated to frustrate a strike, that someone might be frustrating the strike.  The employees would have to show some grounds for believing that an employer was acting in such a way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's difficulties but would he be of the view that the union representing those on a secondary picket would have to produce documentary evidence to support their belief, and that it would not be reasonable to believe something if there was no written evidence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think they <Col N="734" /> would have to produce written evidence but rather to show reasonable grounds, with particular reference to what the position was prior to and after the dispute. Deputy Rabbitte has convinced us to look very closely at the wording but two issues arise.  It was argued that the word &ldquo;directly&rdquo; should be deleted and that the section should read &ldquo;.... frustrate the strike or other industrial action by assisting their employer who is a party to the trade dispute, provided that such attendance is merely for the purpose of peacefully obtaining ...&rdquo;. However, if we were to do this, the section would be too loose.  Deputy Quinn has asked me a straight question. It is my view that a union official or worker will go before the court to indicate the normal practice in a company and the position since the commencement of the strike and it is hard to see, given the way the section is worded, how the courts could find against the workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I find the Minister's position very unconvincing.  I am not surprised by this because he cannot make a cogent credible case for the argument he is seeking to sustain.  For example, he has not commented on my amendment, amendment No. 27, which as you, a Cheann Comhairle, reminded us at the outset we are also discussing, which would require the workers to be sure in picketing a second employer that that second employer is acting &ldquo;in such manner as to have the effect of frustrating the strike by either directly or indirectly&rdquo; assisting the employer with whom they are in dispute.  What could be more rigorous than that and how could it be considered loose?  It is as certain and as precise as one can get; in other words, the workers would be required to show in court, if it were tested, that a secondary employer is acting in such manner as to have the effect of frustrating the strike either by directly or indirectly assisting the employer with whom they are in dispute. That is very precise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has made much play &mdash; quite rightly, as it is very pertinent &mdash; of the Ellis <i>v.</i> Wright case but let me refer <Col N="735" /> him to what Kerr and White had to say on the Ellis <i>v.</i> Wright case on page 306. They make the point, as the Minister has done, that there would have to be in the opinion of the court a clearly discernible connection between the premises picketed and the dispute in the sense that the employer or workman affected by the picket is directly concerned with the dispute. Tony Kerr goes on to comment that it is not exactly clear what is meant by the word &ldquo;connection&rdquo; and states that Mr. Justice Butler indicated that it would be found in the fact that the employer in dispute had a controlling interest in the company which was picketed or in the fact that one or more employees of the employer in dispute visited or attended the premises picketed in the course of their employment.  Therefore the court's interpretation in the Ellis <i>v.</i> Wright case is not nearly as restrictive as what the Minister is seeking to do here.  Kerr admits, on page 308, that the legal status of secondary picketing is, therefore, uncertain.  He states:</P>
    <P>Despite the plain wording of section 2 (1), the Irish courts tend to regard it as unlawful.  The ability of employees to take secondary action, however, may be essential in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take that point on board.  He continues:</P>
    <P>The application of pressure on a third party, with whom the union has no dispute, to induce that person to cease doing business with an employer with whom the union does have a dispute is a very effective way of furthering a dispute if the primary action has been totally successful.  No matter how widely the union spreads the dispute the purpose remains the same. All the union seeks to achieve is the equivalent of a fully effective strike of the primary employer.  All the union asks is that others act as if the employer were in fact closed by the strike.</P>
    <P>Again, I ask the Minister to note this point.  Perhaps it is a case of quoting scripture to suit the devil's purpose. <Col N="736" /> Nonetheless he is an authority on this issue of secondary picketing and he says that &ldquo;to curtail secondary action, therefore, is to deprive workers of an element of their strength, to make them enter the economic struggle with one hand tied.&rdquo;  I believe it is a big bad world out there at present and employers are becoming more ruthless in the marketplace and this legislation will put workers into the struggle with one hand tied behind their backs. The Minister did not address himself at all to the question that I raised about the most vulnerable section of the workforce, contract workers.  He repeated today what he said last night, and I quote: &ldquo;Merely filling a gap in the market left by a strikebound employer will not give rise to lawful secondary picketing.&rdquo;  I agree that will be the position if this Bill becomes law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the problem and it is wrong, given the examples in the contract areas.  Does the Minister really believe, or do his senior advisers believe, that if we had a dispute in An Post and a courier does some of the work, say, delivers parcels &mdash; we have seen other examples of this, for instance, the threat by PAMBO to come in during a CIE dispute &mdash; in that situation, the courier would be acting to undermine the dispute, but no action could be taken because the courier company is not assisting An Post but filling a gap in the marketplace as the Minister sees it in this legislation.  If anybody seriously thinks that the postal workers would accept that situation, they are not living in reality.  I quoted a former Minister for Labour, Deputy Patrick Hillery, before when he made the point that he removed a Bill from this House because he did not think it would have the voluntary allegiance of the trade union movement.  It is not practical to think that the bus workers in Dublin would sit idly by while the private operators came in and decided to run the profitable routes or similarly the postal workers would accept couriers coming into An Post.  Workers would not accept <Col N="737" /> that.  It is a fundamental flaw in the Bill. I would not mind if I were asking the Minister, as my colleague, Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan, has done, to delete the phrase &ldquo;by directly assisting their employer who is a party to the trade dispute&rdquo;.  I toyed very much with doing precisely that, but I recognised that stood little chance of winning the Minister's confidence, so I opted for alternative wording, on which, as I explained on the previous occasion, I had expert assistance.  The phrase we came up with is: &ldquo;the employer acting in such manner as to have the effect of frustrating the strike by either directly or indirectly assisting the other employer&rdquo;. I cannot see in all reasonableness why anybody in the House would be opposed to that, because one would have to be able to prove in court that it was having the effect of frustrating the strike, and that seems to me to be very onerous.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>On a lighter note, I meant to tell the Deputy earlier that I am a member of the committee which decided to employ contractors in the Oireachtas.  Obviously, the Oireachtas is not an example of the bad employer Deputy Rabbitte referred to, because the Oireachtas committee decided to get separate contractors in addition to the existing workers and allow other contractors come in.  However, I accept that this would not happen in every case, and I am not arguing that point.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Ellis <i>v.</i> Wright case, there is no certainty that that position will not be overturned and I do not want to fall into that.</P>
      <P>I accept that the courts are becoming involved more and more, and the courts are involved in the employment appeals tribunal and every aspect of industrial relations, but the idea, as I outlined in detail previously, is to keep the courts out of industrial relations and to clear the position.  That is the whole purpose of the Bill, and particularly the sections linked to injunctions.  I think that is a valid point which cannot be overlooked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte asked that I re-examine the question of secondary picketing. <Col N="738" /> We already have had a long and detailed discussion last night lasting a number of hours on these amendments which centre on this question.  I have argued that I am satisfied that the test of having a reasonable belief and also the requirement about the direct assistance of the second employer are central to the subsection and that they should be retained.  With regard to the arguments that Deputy Rabbitte has outlined against the word &ldquo;calculated&rdquo;, the legal advice available to me is that the word does not have the restrictive meaning attributed to it by the Deputy.  Deputies Quinn and Bell have also argued on this aspect, and I am prepared between now and Report Stage to see if we can provide an alternative form of wording.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome that but, of course, the objections from these benches have not sprung merely from the use of the word &ldquo;calculated&rdquo; but also from the very important area of &ldquo;direct assistance&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying it was the only matter, but last night the Deputy felt that the word &ldquo;calculated&rdquo; would have a very strong interpretation when read in conjunction with the other sections and I accept that is a valid point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point, and I welcome the Minister's readiness to look at it again.  However, the question of workers having to prove that the secondary employer is directly assisting the employer is extremely offensive and places the most onerous obligation on the workers.  It is also the most radical change and we have to look at this.</P>
      <P>The Minister said in the course of an earlier reply &mdash; and I wrote this down &mdash; that he feels that workers can fairly readily see another employer frustrating them and that they have a good instinct in this matter.  I agree with that: workers do know but workers knowing something and being able to prove it are two entirely different things.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely the reason that I am arguing in amendment No. 26 for the test to be that of honest belief.  On the last occasion I produced evidence from the new Labour Party document in Britain where their spokesperson, Mr. Tony Blair has come up with the concept of honest belief as being the measure or yardstick that ought to be applied.  Who is going to interpret the question of reasonableness and, as Deputy Quinn has asked, what kind of objective evidence will have to be advanced in order to convince the courts on that point?  I agree that workers have a good nose for this type of situation, but in a world of multi-group companies, where production can be switched from one location to another, where work can be contracted out and ownership transferred and so on, I believe it is inordinately restrictive and I think the Minister should now try to address that area as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>While there is a great deal of merit in the questions being raised by Deputy Rabbitte, there are also a great many dangers.  Therefore I think we will have to be very careful. As regards the possibilities cited by the Deputy, of PAMBO, the private bus operators filling a gap created by an ongoing strike in Bus Éireann or Dublin Bus, or of a courier doing extra business by taking advantage of a strike in An Post, it would certainly be very dangerous if secondary picketing was permitted in all such cases.  There are cases where there is no collusion among employers but if one employer takes the business of another &mdash; for example, there is poaching by one employer against another &mdash; if one takes advantage of the difficulties of the other, that is a different kettle of fish from the case where a strike is taking place in one company and that employer goes to another person in the same business and asks him to supply his clients while he is unable to do so.  That <Col N="740" /> is collusion between employers.  We have to differentiate between the two cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the same. They are two very different cases.  The case of collusion between employers to frustrate a strike should be covered by secondary picketing and we should take every reasonable step to tighten the provisions in this regard.  It is a different matter where there is competition between employers.  For example, if one sausage manufacturer supplies 20 per cent of Superquinn's needs and another provides 60 per cent, and the manufacturer supplying 60 per cent goes on strike, if the other manufacturer fills the gap by providing 80 per cent of the goods during the strike, is that person to be the subject of a picket and is that picket protected by law?  I am interjecting here to highlight the fact that these are two different cases.  On the one hand, there is collusion between employers and on the other there is competition between them.  I accept that the actions of both employers may have the effect of upsetting workers, particularly in the latter case I mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Mitchell misunderstands the point.  In the example he has given of the two sausage manufacturers, this argument does not apply because if the market is taken up by the second sausage manufacturer, he is in no way assisting, directly or indirectly, the first employer.  He is taking his business and good luck to him.  There is nothing the trade union movement can do about that.  It is not relevant to the argument because he is not assisting the first employer and therefore it does not apply, but what does apply is the kind of example I have given.  In the case of a transport dispute, for example, there is an outcry from the public &mdash; it can be a very emotive issue &mdash; PAMBO, as they indicated on the last occasion, would want to take over some of the more profitable areas of the service.  The workers employed by Córas Iompair <Col N="741" /> Éireann, the generic term, Dublin Bus or whichever of the three companies are concerned, could do nothing under this Bill to protect their employer because PAMBO are not acting to assist CIE; they want to get a share of the action in the hope that &mdash; just as the Minister, Deputy Burke, changed the rules of the ball game in broadcasting last night &mdash; the Minister for Transport will change the rules.  He has PD tendencies and would be more likely to change the rules in transport, and in that case the workers could do nothing about it.  I instanced the case of An Post.  There is no way the postal workers would accept a situation like that.  It would be inoperable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The cases of the sausage manufacturers and An Post are not very different.  Deputy Mitchell's point would equally apply to An Post.  Let us take the example of the motor bike couriers who developed the service when there was a protracted postal strike in 1979.  Under this legislation postal workers would not be able to put a secondary picket on these companies.  Is Deputy Rabbitte arguing that they should be allowed to do so?</P>

      <P>He is saying that if a company are in dispute and elements of different industries take up part of that business, the employees can go out and picket these industries.  Is that not against the point the Deputy is making about somebody else in the marketplace taking the business when one company is on strike?  That is happening in a dispute at present.  Advertisements are being transmitted on the radio to try to take work away from a company on strike.  Is the Deputy arguing that the picketers of that company should be able to go around the country picketing individual firms?</P>

      <P>It is not an off the top of the head reply.  There is a distinction between the operation of the free market and the private sector.  The position is, and will continue to be, somewhat unclear.  There is very little the trade union movement can do in the case where one sausage manufacturer takes up the slack.  They can try, and at present they are free to do so&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not do so and, in my opinion, that practice will continue, but there are a number of areas in the economy where there are what commentators like to call monopolies &mdash; for example, public transport, the postal service, energy supply and the communications industry.  It is accepted that electricity is provided by the ESB, that the postal service is run by An Post and, maybe with reservations in some quarters, that transport is provided by the generic company, CIE.  PAMBO have tried to get in on the scene.  In that case busmen, would prosecute their trade dispute, including putting pickets on PAMBO, and I am saying they ought to be permitted to do so.  They are allowed do so at present and we should continue to allow them to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I suspect there is a danger of getting very deeply into this area and I suggest that we come back to the concern of people on this side of the House. Whatever law we enact should, as far as possible, coincide with what is acceptable practice.  We should not bring about a situation where if we make the law too tight in order to satisfy one side of the social partnership, the FIE, we put constraints on workers in respect of their legal rights to picket, particularly in regard to secondary pickets, because they will ignore it and picket anyway.  An injunction would then be brought against them, they would be found in contempt of court and would end up in jail.  That would bring us back to 1969 and the ESB <Col N="743" /> dispute.  This is a very finely-tuned, balanced area and I accept that there is no given wisdom on it.  An attempt is being made to strike a balance and I accept that is what the Minister is trying to do.</P>
      <P>I accept, too, that the Fine Gael Party do not articulate out loud the FIE interest sections that they undoubtedly represent in private, so, in fact, there is a one sided dialogue in this House.  I do not mean that in any scathing way to Deputy O'Keeffe. The trade union social partnership position is being articulated in this House by Deputy Rabbitte and me whereas the FIE view is not being articulated out loud.  If the Progressive Democrats could bring in some of their backbenchers we might get the kind of counterbalancing debate which the Minister has had to listen to in private.</P>
      <P>Our concern has been, and is that under the interpretation of this proposed section, if a group of workers in a particular circumstance &mdash; Deputy Rabbitte has referred to PAMBO &mdash; decided to put a picket on another company because they reasonably held the belief &mdash; although they may not be able to demonstrate it in documentary form &mdash; that their primary strike was being frustrated by the actions of the secondary employer, under this law, that secondary action would be considered to be illegal and would not enjoy the protection under existing law.  My concern is that if these people continue to picket they would be in contempt, and the Minister is aware of what would happen after that, because the secondary issue of imprisonment of the picketers would override the primary issue of the original strike.  That is our concern but I do not want to dwell at length on this issue.</P>
      <P>Another point I would like to raise is the actual place of business, registered offices, etc. which the Minister has probably dealt with already.  If anything new has been said on Committee Stage which has not already been addressed in private or in the various discussions, the Minister should give reasonable consideration to that and respond to it on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to <Col N="744" /> intervene but as somebody who is not an expert in industrial relations I find this debate fascinating.  I am standing in for my colleague Deputy Mitchell.  There are a couple of points I would like to make. Well researched and very valid arguments have been raised by both sides on this issue.  From a general point of view it suggests to me &mdash; I know this is a broad point but I think it is worth making &mdash; that the way we conduct our Committee business does not really allow for the full development of these arguments.  This is a Bill which has many sections where many such arguments could arise.  As a Member of this House I am making the point that we should consider better ways of conducting Committee Stages of Bills rather than have the whole House tied up debating what are very important points but yet, as a consequence, no other business can be done.  I would be very much in favour of having a much more formal arrangement where Committee Stages of Bills, particularly important Bills such as this, could be debated in very great detail at considerable length outside this Chamber and then brought back to the Chamber for formal approval.</P>
      <P>In intervening where angels might fear to tread I must be very careful.  I want to make it clear that I do not represent the employers or the unions in making what I think might be a few objective comments nor have I had an input or a briefing from either side.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I plead guilty to that charge.  Now that the Minister has raised that point, the manner in which the section is drafted &mdash; I appreciate the balance which the Minister is trying to achieve &mdash; does introduce, in the main, the question of what is reasonable.  My experience as a lawyer is that &ldquo;the reasonable man&rdquo; is the person who, in legal terms, has a long and honoured history over the centuries. Generally what is acceptable in legal terms is what is found to be acceptable <Col N="745" /> to this mythical person, &ldquo;the reasonable man&rdquo;.  The courts have a history&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has it absolutely right.  That has been a criterion that has been found to bring just and fair solutions in legal cases.  The core of this section would appear to provide that secondary picketing is all right provided, it is reasonable.  Obviously, in legal terms we so provide.  Somebody has to interpret whether it is reasonable.  I accept the point made by both Deputy Rabbitte and Deputy Quinn that it is probably better that there is as little interference by legal decision in industrial relations as possible, but at the end of the day if we are providing a statutory form there must be some forum that will ultimately interpret the Statute.  Having gone through all industrial relations procedures there must be such a forum to provide such interpretation and that forum can only be the court.</P>
      <P>Having listened to the argument, which I found fascinating, about the sausage manufacturers and the transport providers and so on I would like to make one further general point.  I do not think it is in the employers' interest, in the country's interest or in the employees' interest to have monopolies &mdash; whether those monopolies be in the State sector or in the private sector.  I mention that in the context that Deputy Rabbitte talked about certain possibilities that may arise following industrial disputes in monopoly suppliers.  Whether the employer in dispute is largely a monopoly supplier to the market in the public or private sector the legislation should not be framed to meet the situation either of the employer or the employee in such a monopoly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Essentially, what the Bill provides is that secondary picketing should be permissible in certain circumstances.  It is an accepted part of industrial relations that primary picketing is generally in order. We are reaching to the periphery when we are talking about secondary picketing <Col N="746" /> with the possible consequence of doing extreme damage to another employer who may improperly or unjustly have a secondary picket on his door.  In that case it is proper that we should be very careful to lay down what is permissible from the point of view of secondary picketing.  I take the Minister's point that the present imprecise state of the law is not helpful to industrial relations.  It is better for us to be clear on what is or is not permissible.</P>
    <P>We then come to the fine tuning between protecting an innocent employer from having a secondary picket on his door and protecting the workers where an employer is not innocent but who may be in collusion with the original employer in the trade dispute.  Taking all those circumstances into account, it seems that the balance struck by the Minister is fair and reasonable.  On that basis, and trying to be as objective as I can, I do not think the case made by Deputy Rabbitte and Deputy Quinn is well proved on this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I had to stand in here for my colleague Deputy McCartan on the Larceny Bill recently and I felt somewhat similar to the way Deputy O'Keeffe must be feeling now.  Unfortunately, I never had regard for the profession when I was outside the House, but apparently there is some expertise one acquires in the business of industrial relations if one spends long enough at it.  I will take some of the general points Deputy O'Keeffe made but really they do not address the question.  The reality of Irish industrial relations is such that, confronted with the challenge of modern, complex business, if you accord the right at all to workers to withdraw their labour it can be now so constrained by a combination of the complexity of modern Irish business and by the law that you are effectively in certain circumstances taking away that right.  I would like to deal with the points and maybe we can come back to the essential point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe asked why we should seek to apply the subjective test when the objective test of reasonableness and of the reasonable man has stood us well <Col N="747" /> down through the years.  I agree with that, but I would not have sought to introduce amendment No. 26 were it not for the remainder of section 11 (2).  It is the extremely rigorous requirements that are imposed on trade unionists that cause me to seek to intrude the test of honest belief on the part of workers as being adequate. This whole business of having to be able to prove that the secondary employer calculated to frustrate the strike, that he was directly assisting the first employer, can all be very difficult in the world of business out there, in the world of modern and advanced technology.  If a worker goes into the witness box and is prepared to swear that he has an honest belief that that employer was undermining the dispute, then that ought to be acceptable.  However, I am prepared to accept what Deputy O'Keeffe has said and I think I hinted this to the Minister on the last occasion.  If this test of what the man on the Clapham omnibus thinks is to be the yardstick of the man on the Tallaght bus, I am prepared to withdraw amendment No. 26 in favour of spending the rest of the time available to us on amendment No. 27 which is really the crux of the issue.  However, withdrawing amendment No. 26 is leaving quite a difficult task for the trade unions in a litigation situation.  Be that as it may, what is really important is that the Minister is effectively ruling out the prospect of secondary action in so many cases based on section 11 (2) and he is excluding an entire category of vulnerable workers from the possibility of prosecuting a trade dispute at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not addressed himself to this issue at all. Surely it is not fair in an economy where tens of thousands of women &mdash; they happen to be women predominantly &mdash; who, because of unemployment in the <Col N="748" /> household and disadvantaged circumstances have to go out as contract cleaners or into the contract catering business.  I accept the good standards applied by this House the Minister referred to earlier, but every year in the outside world the contract now changes. Two people can appear on the scene overnight and establish a contract security company.  There is no registration, no licensing necessary.  One contract cleaning company are seeking to undercut the other in order to get the contract and get a foot in the door.  It has happened in many cases &mdash; I take one example I was involved in personally, the UCD dispute &mdash; that an outside company came in, took the contract, did not employ the women and they prosecuted a dispute for jobs against the new employer.  They may not do so under the new Bill.  I do not think that could have been the Minister's intention.</P>
      <P>I would have some sympathy with the Minister if I were seeking to excise the offending phrase, but I am not.  I am prepared to live with the situation and I think the ICTU would live with it if the provision was that you had to be able to prove that that secondary employer was acting in such a manner as to have the effect of frustrating the strike by either directly or indirectly assisting the primary employer in the dispute.  That is reasonable and fair and I cannot see why there should be objection to that.</P>

I am welcoming the fact that the Minister has undertaken to consult <Col N="749" /> with his advisers concerning what might be the position in regard to the term &ldquo;calculated&rdquo;, but I suggest the more offensive part of the phrase is this obligation on trade unions to have to prove that that secondary employer is directly assisting the primary employer.  That would be impossible to do in some circumstances and very difficult in many, and would have the effect of ruling out the immunities entirely for a large section of vulnerable workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to what Deputy Quinn said, naturally enough, regardless of what is said outside the House, I accept totally that we have to argue again inside.  Not just the FIE but a number of employer bodies surfaced for the purpose of this Bill but they were all united on one thing which was to say that secondary picketing should be outlawed completely.  They were unanimous and inflexible in that view and that is their stance on this issue.  I have to give credit to Deputy Quinn &mdash; he has done the softening process over a long period on this &mdash; that it was beginning to be evident that secondary picketing would not be allowed.  We were into compromise and into recognising our peculiar industrial relations ways, and whether they are right, wrong or indifferent, they are there and they will outlive all of us. Those matters have to be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reasonableness and objective tests are necessary because employees would have to have some grounds for their beliefs. There must be some test and it cannot be on the basis of some striker who believes he is seeing things all over the place, that, for instance, during the night when there were ten guards outside the gate of a plant at which there was industrial action, he saw ten lorries being driven out laden with materials to be used somewhere else and that the following morning some 150 picketers should be sent to pick up those materials.  You have to have an objective test.  I am sympathetic to the argument, but there must be some acid test on this. There is no point in giving controls and <Col N="750" /> powers on the basis of off the head decisions.  The legislation is to deal with disputes between workers and their employer.  Contract workers, like any others, can have a dispute with their employer and place a picket at the location where he carries on business.</P>
    <P>I know what Deputy Rabbitte is talking about with regard to contract workers, but let me clarify in my way what we are talking about.  If a contract company are cleaning the windows or brick work of Dáil Éireann, the workers can have a dispute with the employer and can picket not only the employer's head office but Dáil Éireann as well.  We must not give the impression that a contract worker in a dispute has not got these rights to picket.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another argument. A contractor may win a 12-month contract to clean Dáil Éireann but at the end of the 12 months he may have to tender again and may lose that contract. That is a different argument.  We are now arguing that because contractor X has lost the contract and contractor Y has got it, contractor Y must take the workers of contractor X, otherwise the workers of contractor X can picket the place.  That is a far broader issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have dealt with and watched many disputes in which Deputy Rabbitte has been involved and I have great respect <Col N="751" /> for his professional expertise as a full-time trade union official, as I have for his work in this House.  Is it the case that people tendering unsuccessfully in the open market can be faced with a dispute? There are all kinds of other problems.  If this is followed through it will end up in the Supreme Court with arguments about the rights of people tendering for contracts. It is a massively complex area.</P>
    <P>I have discussed at length the wording of section 11 (2) which is a very important section.  I asked specifically about the meaning of the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; in this context.  Was it a term that could be used only in the way that a High Court Judge, the Attorney General or a legal draftsman would use it?  The answer is that it is something considered reasonable in the view of the ordinary Joe Soap.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

      <P>The courts have decided that &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; means in Irish law what the ordinary Joe Bloggs interprets it to be.  In this case secondary picketing would be permissible where Joe Bloggs feels that the employer is directly frustrating the strike.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte asked why we should not remove the word &ldquo;directly&rdquo;.  Practically all sides have said that if I do so I may as well remove the whole thing.  That is why the word is still there and I am reluctant to accept the amendment. &ldquo;Directly assisting&rdquo; must be read with the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;.  I considered the argument advanced in respect of the word &ldquo;calculated&rdquo; and it is a good argument. I checked with the parliamentary draftsman and the Attorney General in respect of the other words and I am advised that they should not be removed. I do not want to be unfair in saying that I will look at it on Report Stage.  I can make progress in respect of the word &ldquo;calculated&rdquo; but not otherwise.  That is the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

      <P>The point I am making, however imprecisely I am putting the case, is that we are dealing with a section on secondary picketing.  The Minister has raised questions about the commercial appropriateness of contractors undercutting other contractors and so on, but he has conceded the point that under this section contract workers may not prosecute a secondary picket against an employer in the circumstances I have outlined. Because the Minister has conceded that point I believe it is incumbent on him to see what can be done to include them in this section.  I did not come in here &mdash; but maybe I should have &mdash; with a list of the kind of cases I am talking about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given examples. I am talking about the position in Government Departments, for example, the recent dispute at the Department of Agriculture and Food in Castlebar where the employer to whom the cleaning contract was given, did not employ the cleaning women who had worked for the previous contractor for the previous five years.  The practice in the trade union movement is to ensure, just like dockers in the old days, that workers follow their work.  Otherwise, those people will have no rights at all.  Very often part-time workers do not have any rights under protective legislation.  The Minister has to take this and a number of other points on board.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bell dealt with this issue on the last occasion.  He adopted a broader argument than just the position of contract workers and dealt with multiple companies.  For example, a holding company with a number of subsidiary companies, associated companies or companies in which they have a stake holding, can easily transfer production or business to circumvent the terms of the law.  I am now conceding that the Minister can retain his objective test of what is reasonable in the circumstances, but the remainder of the clause is offensive to the trade union movement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said he is satisfied with the way the Judiciary has applied the objective test and so on, and that he thinks it is fair.  I want to again refer him to the foreword of the book by Kerr and White, written by one of our former most eminent judges, Brian Walsh, when he was a member of the Supreme Court.  In his preface to the book he says it is clear, in his view, that in many respects the trade unions enjoy a privileged position under the law, and he goes on to develop that point.  The point I am making is that it would be foolish, and carrying the good temper of this debate too far, to pretend that the judges are broadminded when it comes to dealing with trade union disputes. The former Judge Brian Walsh <Col N="754" /> would have been regarded as one of the most liberal members of the bench when he was there, but generally speaking one could not make that argument.</P>
    <P>If the Minister leaves in the requirement that a trade union must be able to show that a secondary employer is directly assisting the first employer it will lead, first, to permanent litigation in contentious disputes, and second, it will not be possible for the trade union in many cases to prove that they have a reasonable belief that that secondary employer is directly assisting the first employer.  This legislation modernises and codifies much of the existing industrial relations legislation and it would be a great pity if it tilted the balance to the extent that is being argued here.</P>
    <P>A great many rank and file activists and shop stewards do not even know the Bill is being processed.  With all due respect to our friends in the media who comment on politicians not spending very much time in the Chamber, they do not spend a great deal of time in the Chamber and when it comes to reporting the detail of legislation, one is likely to get more attention for being thrown out for some stunt on the Order of Business.  Shop stewards do not know this legislation is going through the House and they do not know the implications it will have.  Some of the Minister's advisers, whom I respect, do not know as much as they think about the private sector.  This is not the Civil Service or the public service. There is a ruthless world out there in the private business sector and many workers will find themselves on the wrong side of the law if this provision is enacted.</P>

      <P>As I said earlier, I am prepared to look at the word &ldquo;calculated&rdquo; and other points which have been raised by the Deputies.  I have given the Deputy the advice I have received and I do not think I will change my mind, unless it is for some other reason.  I do not want to misinform the Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's <Col N="755" /> honest and frank response and that he is not going to fob us off until Report Stage. I am not surprised at his response but I want to put my welcome of it on the record.</P>
      <P>Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan has put down an amendment which proposes to delete the term &ldquo;by directly assisting their employer who is a party to the trade dispute&rdquo; in section 11.  Amendment No. 27 attempts to meet a half way position.  We will have to have a vote on this amendment because it is the view of my party and the Congress of Trade Unions that the section, as drafted, does not reflect the desires and wishes of the employees, and some of the employer organisations, and is such a variation from what is current legal practice that in time there will be a series of actions of a secondary picketing nature which will result in legal action in the courts and people being put in jail.  The Minister or his successor will have to deal with a situation where the original industrial dispute will be totally superseded by the fact that five or six people were put into jail for contempt.  As we all know from the Ranks Mills dispute these people will not be able to get out of jail unless they purge their contempt.  This will lead to the martyrdom of industrial workers and the emphasis will shift from the rights and wrongs of a particular industrial relations dispute to the fundamental right of workers to protect the only thing they have to sell, which is their labour.</P>
      <P>This is the stuff of numerous learned journals and stories within the labour movement history.  I am not a bit surprised the Minister confirmed that a number of employers would like to ban totally secondary picketing.  A number of employers would like to ban picketing and trade unions <i>per se</i>.  The developed corporate sector&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making, which is a good one, is that we are trying to make a law which will cover the worst possibility rather than reflect the general <Col N="756" /> situation.  The general situation will not be the problem; we have to have regard to the worst scenarios because they are the cases that will end up in court.  This is a bit like, in engineering or construction design terms, having to design for the extreme or maximum load rather than the normal load because from time to time the normal practice will be bent, overloaded or overweighed.  It is my considered view, having sought expert advice and having been briefed by a number of people, that if this section goes through it will represent a middle point.  From a debating point of view it probably reflects a fine line between what the employer organisations and the representatives had to say to the Minister on the one side and what the Congress of Trade Union officials and others &mdash; the Minister did not confine himself exclusively to those &mdash; had to say on the other side.  Does it, however, represent a middle point in regard to practice out on the ground?  We will have to wait and see.</P>
      <P>I would suggest to the Minister that the phrase &ldquo;directly or indirectly assisting&rdquo; in amendment No. 27 gives a fair degree of cover and goes some way towards meeting the original wording.  Reasonable belief in indirectly assisting an employer to frustrate a primary strike seems to go a long way down the road of rationality in allowing somebody to enjoy legal protection in a picket.  The reasonable belief that there is indirect assistance being granted by a second employer to frustrate the strike of a primary employer seems to get very close to what is considered acceptable practice by the trade union movement in relation to secondary picketing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter has been around for a long time and that must be respected.  In the light of this formula of words, however, I would ask the Minister to think again about how he could deal with this on Report Stage.  I accept that deleting &ldquo;direct or indirect&rdquo; altogether as we were proposing is extreme.  It effectively recognises the <i>status quo,</i> which a number of employers' organisations would regard as totally unacceptable, but inserting &ldquo;directly or indirectly&rdquo; is quite different <Col N="757" /> from having no adverb in front of the word &ldquo;assisting&rdquo; at all.  I think the Minister is unwise in this because, notwithstanding his numerical strength in this House, unless this is challenged we will end up with people being in contempt of court for refusing to obey an injunction of the court because what they currently believe to be their rights as a result of successive events in Irish labour history will no longer be legal.  People will be curtailed in their actions.  They will find that when they behave as they have behaved in the past what was legal six or seven years ago is no longer legal and that will create a problem of its own.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am conscious of the points made by my colleagues and that they have taken soundings and discussed this issue.  I am conscious also that all wisdom is not on my side.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte made a point about contracting.  I am not saying he did not put his argument fairly but we must be clear about this aspect.  This is not something that happens as a matter of course, although I accept that there are abuses on the part of some employers who create substantial difficulties, and I am in no way trying to discount that.  Like most Deputies I continue to get representations about the odd practices of some employers.  It is my intention as far as I can, with advice from my advisers, consultations and so on, to create a better climate for industrial relations.  There would however be a difficulty in establishing a new principle of rights to picket an employer to force him to offer employment. Deputy Rabbitte put the argument eloquently and very forcibly but if one is to follow the line of argument through, does it stop with the contractor?  If the contractor loses a particular contract with resulting loss of jobs for employees, can those employees then put pressure on him through strike action and pickets, whether primary or secondary, to offer them work?  That is a new concept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present people do not have the right to picket in order to get themselves a job.  I have not dwelt on it enough to <Col N="758" /> come to a conclusion whether that would be a desirable practice in itself.  It has happened in the past but in the context of present practices it seems to be going very far.  I would have to ask, what about the position of the second employer's own employees?  I am aware of such disputes because I also worked where there were too many contractors who would always get into this difficulty.  If we are to enact legislation we must get away from the security and cleaning areas.  I know that in the general hospital system, for example, it would be bad practice to have too many contractors in laboratories and in radiology departments, for occupational therapy and so on.  This is something that should not be building up in the service but it is there, and what happens if these contractors are let go because some central person has lost a contract?  Will other people have to fight for the rights of the people who have been let go?  I respect the points made by Deputy Rabbitte but they would have knock on effects in many other areas.</P>
    <P>Inserting the word &ldquo;indirectly&rdquo; has the same effect as removing the word &ldquo;directly&rdquo;.  I cannot accept that the word &ldquo;indirectly&rdquo; is clear and concise.  All I can say is that the word &ldquo;directly&rdquo; is central to the subsection.  It helps strike a balance between outlawing and controlling secondary picketing.  I do not wish to say any more than that because it may be misleading.  However, I will look closely at all arguments made during the debate because I accept that I do not have all the knowledge.  I will give a commitment that I will return to this matter at a later stage.  I want the provisions of the Bill to last the course of time, like others involved in the debate, and I agree with Deputy Rabbitte that a small number of Members have devoted a lot of their time to the debate.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe suggested that a Committee of the House should deal with the Bill.  Informally, we expressed the view that this was an appropriate debate to be held in Committee.  The view was expressed that we should lock ourselves into a room for five or six weeks and deal <Col N="759" /> with the provisions and I have no doubt that the Opposition spokespersons would have been prepared to do that but the structures of the House would not permit us to do so.  For that reason, we must debate the issues back and forward in the Chamber.  I am giving a commitment to come back on the word &ldquo;calculated&rdquo;, although the legal advice to me is that it does not have the restrictive meaning attributed to it.  The arguments by Deputies on that aspect were good and I am prepared, between now and Report <Col N="760" /> Stage, to consider an alternative form, if it is necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 41:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection (2) (a), line 9, to delete &ldquo;or other industrial action&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In accordance with procedure, and having regard to the fact that a certain number of amendments on the Order Paper were not taken because of the guillotine, it is my intention to re-enter them on Report State of the Bill.</P>
      <P>This is a consequential amendment because of the refusal of the Minister to accept a redefinition of &ldquo;industrial action&rdquo;.  As the House knows, the provisions of section 14 lay down procedures for balloting of members in respect of strike action.  There is no difficulty whatsoever with the concept of having a secret ballot in respect of strike action or certain kinds of industrial action.</P>
      <P>I presume we are taking amendments Nos. 41 and 43 along with a number of other amendments listed.  I presume we are talking collectively of deleting the phrase &ldquo;or other industrial action&rdquo;. Would I be correct in assuming that that is the procedure?</P>

      <P>It is proposed that we deal exclusively with amendment No. 41 and relate that to the announcement made when we were dealing with amendment No. 13; the Deputy will be familiar with that.  At that stage we talked about taking amendments Nos. 42, 44, 47, 49, 51, 54; also amendments Nos. 13, 41, 43, 46, 48, 50 and 53 together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not detain the House because we are subjected to very tight time constraints.</P>
      <P>If the Minister requires a trade union to hold a ballot of its members directly concerned in any kind of industrial action &mdash; as set out in subsection (2) (a) &mdash; I believe such will not be practicable.  My concern and that of my party throughout this entire legislative process is to devise legislation which, at the end of the day, will be perceived to be practicable as well as being just, proper and balanced.  Its practicality is of overriding importance. We must remember that we are talking about human industrial relations in the workplace.  Though many of us would like it to be otherwise, people do not always follow a logical path or approach. In the heat of the moment, in a set of given circumstances, people may react spontaneously in a way that is neither rational nor logical.</P>
      <P>It would not be productive to have a repetition of the debate that took place on the definition of &ldquo;industrial action&rdquo;. The Minister is well aware of our concerns in this regard.  To stipulate that henceforth all such action will have to be subjected to the holding of a secret ballot presupposes that all such action will be premeditated.  We contend that some such action will not be premeditated, that any dispute could be more readily resolved by recognising that those types of action should be excluded from secret balloting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know it is the considered view of the Minister and his Department that, notwithstanding all of that, at the end of the day, the provisions of section 14 will be internalised within a union, that failure to observe those provisions does not confer any right on anybody other than somebody who is a member of the union concerned; that these provisions will not be subject to the type of British Conservative raids on particular unions, including sequestration and so on.  I fully accept that we are here talking about a totally different approach, that the way in which the British Conservative Party or unions have behaved does not influence this legislation, is not relevant to <Col N="764" /> our circumstances; I am quite happy about that.</P>
    <P>If we do not amend the definition of &ldquo;industrial action&rdquo;&mdash; and we know what is the Minister's argument in relation to this &mdash; we will be conferring a right on somebody who happens to be a member of a trade union to take out an injunction against that union.  We must envisage circumstances in which a strike may occur within a particular company, say, in the industrial estate in Tallaght or elsewhere in the Dublin region, within a single union shop or factory where, say, the only union involved is SIPTU, the largest union in the country.  Let us suppose the employer concerned &mdash; who wants to frustrate the strike, or to take out an injunction preventing the union acting on it, or in some way get at the union because they failed to hold a ballot on the type of spontaneous action I have just described &mdash; telephones his brother in, say, Connemara, Donegal or Kerry, who is also a member of SIPTU, who may be a part-time farmer, creamery worker or a full-time gombeen man who happens to be a member of a trade union which, in many instances, will not be beyond our cultural traditions, for private considerations, not communicated by telephone but whose intent was made clear to the brother in Connemara.  The brother in Connemara then decides to take out a legal injunction against the union.  I am citing deliberately a very extreme case.  But it is an extreme case which must be used to test the generality of the provision.  Is it possible that the circumstances I have described could occur?  If such is possible then the probability is that somewhere within the next 20 years it will occur.  If there is the probability of such happening, we should examine what might lead to its happening in the case of it being unreasonable.  I contend it would be regarded as unreasonable if the Minister does no consider changing the definition of &ldquo;industrial action&rdquo;.  We have absolutely no problem in the trade union movement with secret ballots, about the week's notice, the method of balloting and so on; broadly speaking that is common practice within most unions today and does not <Col N="765" /> present a problem.  The manner in which this is proposed is something we can examine later.  If the Minister fails to change the definition of &ldquo;industrial action&rdquo; and it includes everything, including the right of sanction against a union for failing to hold a ballot on that form of industrial action, resulting in a loss of production to the employer, has any other member of that union anywhere else in the country &mdash; under the provisions of the law as they would obtain if section 14 is not amended &mdash; a right to seek an injunction against the union on the grounds that they failed to comply with their own rules.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty with this section is that it is somewhat like motherhood and apple pie; we are all in favour of secret ballots.  Indeed one would run very serious risks were one to maintain that it was otherwise.  But what is being sought here is to enshrine in law what is the practice within most unions throughout the country.  There is no tradition here of the car park meeting except in so far as it relates to unions with headquarters in the United Kingdom where a different tradition obtains.  That does not cause any difficulty for the trade union movement here.  Of course, what the Minister is seeking to do goes far beyond that.  It is very regrettable that he would not be happy with circumstances in which he requires unions to enshrine in their rule books the provisions stipulated here for a secret ballot before a primary dispute can take place, I do not see why that is not adequate.  I contend that to include the term &ldquo;or other industrial action&rdquo; is to invite all kinds of trouble and, in my view, will not be operable within the private sector.  I contend it will be very quickly proven that to seek to impose a ballot in all circumstances in which industrial action is contemplated &mdash; no matter how minor &mdash; is simply a nonsense.  One of the unions who have written to me makes the point that issues such as working to rule, working to agreement, resisting overtime and so on are all classified as <Col N="766" /> industrial action.  It is simply not practicable to talk about imposing a requirement of a secret ballot in all cases of minor fractures of industrial peace.</P>
      <P>Of course the definition of &ldquo;industrial action&rdquo; is unbelievably restrictive.  In the private sector, in particular, the Minister &mdash; and I think he so indicated when we debated the definition of &ldquo;industrial action&rdquo;&mdash; said he would be prepared to take another look at this question within the private sector in which there are frequent minor fractures of industrial peace, when the impostion of the requirement of a secret ballot would lead to unofficial industrial disputes.  In such cases, on the one hand one would be confronted with circumstances in which a stoppage or industrial action of whatever form is involved, is extended by virtue of the imposition of the detailed procedures that must be complied with here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It must be appreciated, however, that the suitability of the space provided and the types of artefacts which can be safely displayed there are matters for the professional judgment of the director and his staff.  Questions arising <Col N="768" /> in that context are primarily a matter for resolution between the director of the National Museum and senior local authority management.  My Department will, of course, endeavour to facilitate the successful conclusion of these negotiations.</P>
    <P>In addition, the National Heritage Council is formulating recommendations on the development of regional museums which could provide a framework for the National Museum's activities in this area.</P>
    <P>As I indicated to the House on 1 May, plans for the creation of a museum at the Custom House Docks envisage the development there of a decorative arts and folklife museum.  This museum will contain nearly 100,000 square feet as compared with 66,000 square feet in the museum's Kildare Street premises.  There are a number of possibilities for the exact location of the proposed museum in the development, and the merits of the different possibilities are being examined within the context of the commitment by the development company to provide the necessary built space.  It is envisaged that construction work on the museum premises at the Custom House Docks site will start in 1991 as part of the Dublin City of Culture project and that the museum will open in the following year.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his composite reply to the three questions in my name.</P>
      <P>May I first deal with the question of the development of a nationwide scheme of county museums?  Can I take it that the Taoiseach is aware that the National Museum may lend part of its collection only to properly established permanent county museums staffed from local authority sources?  Would the Taoiseach agree that any development of such a scheme is a far greater undertaking than the Director of the National Museum could initiate and would require substantial support from either central Government or local government funds?  Is the Taoiseach's Department taking any active role in advancing the kind of resources needed to put such a nationwide scheme in place?</P>

As I said, it is primarily a matter for the Director of the National Museum who accepts in principle the policy and he is discussing with the various local authorities concerned what might be done.  My Department will facilitate these discussions.  I am not at this stage, indeed I am not sure if I will ever be, in a position to commit any funds from central Government for this purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my address to the annual conferences of the two Garda associations who have raised this matter, I am not persuaded that the establishment of a commission on the management structures and methods of the Garda Síochána is required.  I hold the view that the role of the Garda Síochána is the same today as it has always been &mdash; to be the Guardians of the Peace, to uphold the law to protect people and property against the assaults of those who would injure them. I accept, of course, that times change and that the environment in which the Garda operate is constantly evolving.  However, I have confidence in the skills and experience possessed by management at all levels of the force and in their competence to adopt new approaches and put into practice any new operational response which may be required to meet changing needs and circumstances.</P>
      <P>I have made it clear to the associations that if they see a need for any fundamental change &mdash; or indeed any change &mdash; in any area of the Force's organisation or activities they should bring it to the notice of their own management &mdash; right up to the commissioner if necesary and finally to me, if they consider an approach to me necessary and appropriate.  Any suggestions or proposal they may have will be fully considered.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not accept that, if the primary role of the Garda Síochána is to be Guardians of the Peace, it would suggest they do not have a role in being management experts, <Col N="772" /> financial experts or industrial relations experts, that they are police men, and from that viewpoint he has proved the case from his own mouth for the type of commission I am talking about?  Does the Minister not accept that, when one is talking about a force of over 10,000 people, it makes sense to have a commission to investigate their management structures to see how they can be made more effective?  Would he not accept that he is the one who is out of step with this proposal as the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors and the Garda Representative Association have been promoting this for some time and, indeed, his own ministerial colleague, Deputy Michael Woods, when Opposition spokesman on Justice proposed this very step in 1986 when he was chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism?

      <P>The central point of the Deputy's question relates to management matters.  I am sure he is aware that there is already in existence a Garda advisory group under the chairmanship of Mr. Paddy Moriarty, Chief Executive of the ESB.  This group is available as a source of advice to me on non-operational Garda management matters.  It has a very wide brief.  The Garda Representative Association had the opportunity of presenting their views to the group, which is flexible and can take on board any of the management questions the Deputy raised.  However, in relation to operational matters, the operational responsibilities remain the same &mdash; as I said in my initial response to be guardians of the peace, to uphold the law <Col N="773" /> and protect people and property against the assaults of those who injure them. Times change and I am ready to listen and to take on board any suggestions but I am not convinced, nor is Garda management, that now is the time for the type of inquiry the Deputy is suggesting.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Justice</askee>
      <Quest>the steps, if any, he intends to take to correct the deficiencies in our prison system highlighted in the Annual Report on Prisons and Places of Detention for 1988, published on 11 May 1990; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Annual Report on Prisons and Places of Detention is a wide-ranging document which, as the Deputy will be aware, includes the views of the visiting committees to the various institutions on many aspects of prison life as set out in their annual reports for the year in question.  While it would clearly not be practical for me to comment in detail on the contents of the report by way of replying to a parliamentary question I would, of course, be in a position to give a considered response to any question on a specific matter covered in the report which the Deputy cares to put down in the normal way.  By way of general comment, it is important, I feel, to draw attention to the fact that here we are <Col N="776" /> dealing with a report on prisons for the year 1988 and that many of the criticisms made no longer hold good.  In some instances, the deficiencies adverted to have long since been rectified &mdash; in others, plans are well advanced to meet the criticisms made.  By way of example, I might mention that the reference to life sentence reviews in the Portlaoise Visiting Committee Report has been met by the establishment towards the end of last year of the Sentence Review Group; the point made in relation to more compassionate parole also adverted to by that committee has also been met; the question of prison suicides mentioned by the Mountjoy Visiting Committee is the subject of specific examination by an expert group I established some months ago from whom I have sought an interim report; and a provision of £750,000 has been made to provide a new kitchen in Mountjoy.  These are not the only matters which have been dealt with.  It is not practical, as I have said, to comment in detail on a report of this nature by way of reply to a Dáil question.</P>
      <P>Of course, I am not for one moment suggesting that all the criticisms made have by now been fully addressed and it would be misleading, in listing some matters already attended to, to pretend otherwise.  Much remains to be done, for example, in relation to what is perhaps the main difficulty and that is the question of accommodation pressures &mdash; this difficulty is acknowledged incidentally not just by visiting commitees but in the introduction to the report itself.  On this issue, also, a number of substantial developments have taken place since the period covered by the report.  Perhaps the most significant was the bringing into operation of the new place of detention at Wheatfield which is at present accommodating about 240 offenders.  The remaining 80 places will be brought into use before the end of the year.  As the House will be aware, Wheatfield is the first purpose built institution of its kind since the foundation of the State and represents an enormous improvement in the stock of accommodation available to the Prison Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="777" /> The accommodation at St. Patrick's Institution is to be refurbished completely as is the accommodation at the Women's Prison at Mountjoy which forms part of the same complex.  A new unit is being provided in the grounds of Mountjoy to cater for offenders who have special medical needs, including offenders who have been identified as HIV positive.  These major projects are in addition to ongoing maintenance and upgrading works at the various institutions. I believe that this programme, which gives priority to the needs of juvenile offenders, female offenders and offenders with medical problems and is costing £8 million in the current year, is a substantial and effective response to tackling major difficulties faced by the prison system.  As I stated however in my reply to Private Notice Questions on 8 May, there is no doubt that more needs to be done and I shall do my best to ensure that what can reasonably be provided by way of resources for this work will in fact be provided.</P>
    <P>A final point which I feel must be made concerning the annual reports made by visiting committees &mdash; and here I am not referring simply to the 1988 reports &mdash; is that interest tends to focus almost exclusively on any adverse comments which may be made.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, in the nature of the work of visiting committees that they have from time to time to make critical comments about what they preceive to be deficiencies in the operation of the institutions.  It is obviously part and parcel of their job to bring such concerns promply and clearly to the attention of the relevant authorities and they would be failing in their duties to do otherwise. I think it would be only fair to the visiting committees, however, to point out that a feature of their reports which does not tend to receive much public attention is that, by and large, they offer substantial praise for many positive aspects which they find and, in particular, pay handsome tribute to the efforts of prison management and staff together with the support services, in doing a difficult job <Col N="778" /> on behalf of the community.  It is neither fair to the staff concerned nor to the visiting committees themselves to ignore the fact that much of what they say is very positive and encouraging indeed &mdash; in this respect 1988 was, I am glad to say, no exception.</P>

The reason for the delay was, as I outlined in this House before, that the Prison Officers' Association became aware of some of the contents of the report and were threatening legal action.  I had no responsibility at the time for it.  I had no difficulty in publishing it other than that particular problem which arose.  I would like to assure the Deputy that it is and will continue to be my practice in the Department of Justice to be as open as possible and to publish documents which come to me at any time.</P>

      <P>The Minister has indicated a difficulty in dealing with specifics but having regard to the general nature of the question tabled, would he not agree that the one major issue that screams out for attention in so far as at least four of the visiting committees are concerned, is the question of over crowding? Beyond the fact that the Minister has opened Wheatfield, has he any proposals to cut back in the level of the prison population as a means of addressing the accommodation problem which is so urgent and seems to impinge on so much <Col N="779" /> of the other every day workings of the prison system such as welfare, education, parole, early release and other matters?</P>

      <P>There has been an increasing and welcome move by the courts to impose community service and other orders, instead of remand sentences and to have regard to the question of general care and attention being available outside the prison system to those concerned. Because of the level of crime, there will continue to be a need for secure facilities. It is my responsibility and that of the Government to try to improve the accommodation standards.  I cannot interfere with the independence of the Judiciary as to whether they decide to send somebody they find guilty of an offence to prison or to give them a community order.  In many cases the people who are sent are not first offenders; they are people who have been repeatedly causing difficulties in society.</P>

    <P>I would draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that the figure for 1983 is 8,295 offences and the corresponding figure for 1989 is 2,647 offences which, on the face of it, suggests a very considerable improvement.  In an effort to reduce the incidence of crimes committed by persons on bail, the law was strengthened in the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, which provides that a sentence of imprisonment for an offence committed by a person on bail must be consecutive on any sentence passed, or about to be passed, on him for a previous offence.  The operation of the relevant provisions in the 1984 Act is being monitored.  The figures which I have provided to the Deputy would suggest that they are having an effect.</P>
    <P>Should it be established at any stage that the provisions of the 1984 Act are not proving to be as effective as required, I will give further consideration to the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Encouraged by the improvement in the figures following the 1984 legislation there is still a major problem in that we are talking about between 2,000 and 3,000 offences a year.  Would the Minister not accept that we have the most lax bail laws in the world, that this is a consequence of the O'Callaghan decision in 1966 in the Supreme Court and that effectively we probably need a constitutional change to deal with it but that we must face that?  Would he not accept that it is outrageous that people who are charged, and in some instances caught red handed, with offences, including murder, rape and robbery, can go to the courts and obtain bail?  Would the Minister not accept that we should face <Col N="781" /> the situation of having a constitutional referendum on this matter if necessary and that that could be tied in with the Presidential election?  The Minister would get full co-operation from this side of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>My advice is that, short of an amendment to the Constitution, any legislative proposal which would make it more difficult for an accused person to get bail would be open to serious challenge on constitutional grounds.  In that regard it should be noted that the Supreme Court has held that bail cannot be refused on the grounds that there is a likelihood of further offences being committed by the accused.  I do not want to give any commitment here today &mdash; I would not be in a position to do so &mdash; in relation to a constitutional change but I would consider it unlikely in the timescale the Deputy has suggested.  I agree with him that it is a matter of concern and that it is the public perception that people who are on bail do commit crimes because they know they will be punished in any event.  However, the whole House can take some comfort from the fact that there has been a drop in the number of offences committed by persons on bail as between the years 1983 to 1989 and that the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, is working in this area.  A drop in the number of offences committed by persons on bail from 8,295 in 1983 to 2,647 in 1989 is something that should give the House considerable encouragement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to give serious consideration to a <Col N="782" /> constitutional amendment which I think we both agree is necessary.  Would he not accept that having a figure of almost 3,000 crimes per year committed by people on bail is utterly unacceptable? Would he not further accept that our bail laws are probably the most lax in the world and would he not take the example even of the notorious case in Athy where the robber who was shot was out on bail at that time?  Would he not accept that we have a serious problem, that it must be addressed and that the longer we delay in addressing it the more we will have crimes committed by people on bail who should not be on bail in the first instance?</P>

I do not want to mislead him on that.</P>

      <P>First, it was the Deputy himself last night in the course of his contribution who suggested that a loan of over £2 million would be given to Century Radio.  I have made no such suggestion.  What is suggested is that the whole independent radio and television areas will be the subject of the receipt of a sum of money through the independent radio and television commission.  That money will be disbursed under criteria to be decided on by the commission and published by the commission and will be totally independent and away from Government, as is the commission. There is no suggestion in what I announced last night that Century or any other station will be in receipt of any particular sum of money.  That is a matter for the IRTC; not Deputy O'Sullivan's proposal that a particular amount of money should be loaned to a particular company.</P>

If he feels it is a matter requiring or deserving of legislation does he not agree that one option is that he could initiate the necessary legislation to impose the will of the House on the matter?  On the other hand, if the Minister stands by his view that the legislation is not necessary, has he taken any steps to let his view on whether it would be desirable for BTE to have a customer's charter as suggested by the Ombudsman be known?</P>

      <P>The experience here with voluntary codes of practice has worked <Col N="787" /> very well.  The ESB have one and from my days in the Department of Energy I remember it worked well.  British Telecom have one and there has been some consultation to see how effective it has been.  They say it is difficult to produce evidence that codes of practice improved customer relations on the ground, and really what we have to do is try to improve customer relations.  It also appeared that in some respects such codes can themselves be a cause of contention. However, I accept that the rights of the customer need to be protected at all times.  It is a matter for the board of Telecom, and if it is the considered view of the House &mdash; I will be interested to hear the observations on it &mdash; I will go back to the board of Telecom and tell them the view expressed in this House.</P>

Whether they are right or wrong, many of them feel they have been robbed by BTE, for the simple reason that they have no independent check of the meters at the exchange, unlike the ESB who provide meters in the home.  Will the Minister not accept that there is an issue here to be addressed as highlighted by the Ombudsman, and that he should take a more positive role?</P>

      <P>The main burden of the complaints with the Ombudsman system has been in relation to the accuracy of the billing.  That matter is being rapidly addressed by BTE through the introduction of their individual bills where you can have each call made from your phone identified, and that service will become available throughout the country.  That is not to say there are not other issues that would arise where they might need a code of practice.  On the whole, relations between BTE and their customers are good.  Their service is being extended throughout the country and we have one of the most up to date telephone systems in the world.  I make no political point on this, both sides of the House were responsible for that.  The service has improved dramatically and we should be very proud of it.</P>

      <P>Let me make a point about new customers of BTE.  It has taken from 18 months to two years to give them the first bill.  I have never been able to get a satisfactory explanation for that.  Why do these machines not show up in the first month the bills of those new customers?  There seems to be something wrong with BTE's billing system.  Certainly it is not explained to my satisfaction, and it does not appear to be explained to the satisfaction of the Ombudsman.  Does the Minister not feel he has a duty to examine this more carefully and positively and come up with a process to deal with it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that in Dublin not only is there dissatisfaction with the billing system but there is widespread dissatisfaction with BTE's inability to communicate with their customers? Is he aware that, for example, many people moving into new housing estates in Dublin find it virtually impossible to discover from BTE what their <Col N="789" /> work schedules are and by what date phones are likely to be supplied?  Will he also bring that problem to the attention of the board?  Will he confirm that he agrees that well organised State or semi-State bodies should have a work schedule by which they can indicate to applicants for custom that if an application for a phone is made on a particular date, a phone will be available?  Could the Minister also ascertain what has happened to their much vaunted promise of some five years ago that within a matter of two or three years in Dublin telephones would be available on demand?  In many parts of Dublin that is very far from reality.</P>

I agree they have a very good system but some people have been <Col N="790" /> hassled so much by getting incorrect bills that they have had to have the telephone disconnected.  Has the Minister come across this in his constituency work?  I certainly have.  The Ombudsman has told us within the past few days that he is some 18 months behind in dealing with complaints about Telecom.  Deputies can wait even longer to get a result.

That problem is being overcome on a nationwide basis by making available to subscribers an itemised bill.  That is a major step forward.  It is in response to the continuing reports of the Ombudsman that Telecom have taken on the task of introducing this service for their customers. They are aware of the need to meet the legitimate concerns of customers. It is costing in the region of £20 million to install this individual billing system on a nationwide basis.</P>

The new chairman of An Post, together with the board and management, are coming forward with a plan for the future.  A new chief executive is about to be appointed.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 17 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputies to my answer to a similar question on 27 February of this year &mdash; columns 556 to 558, Volume 396, No. 3, of the Official Report for that day. Since then I have awarded the MMDS franchise for the Donegal and Sligo area to a company called Cable Management Ireland Limited, a company with extensive cable television interests in different parts of the country.  MMDS services have come on stream, in a limited way, in County Limerick and I expect this trend to continue in the coming months. Progress in each area will differ, at least in the initial stages, due to terrain differences, planning permission, subscriber take up and so on.</P>
      <P>The building of a national MMDS system is already underway.  I have not heard any rumours that the whole MMDS project is going to be abandoned. There is no basis for such rumours, if they exist.</P>
      <P>With regard to illegal rebroadcast systems or deflectors, because of their nature I do not have accurate information on the number of such systems or the numbers served.  Spokesmen for the illegal operators have claimed up to 100,000 subscribers, and some of these are residing in areas where cable service is available.  This means that even by their own unsubstantiated claims, illegal rebroadcasting operators provide a service that varies in quantity and quality to less than 17 per cent of the potential market.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>In addition to introducing a licensing system for restaurants and making minor changes in the permitted hours for licensed premises, the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, provided for a wide range of measures aimed at curbing under-age drinking.  I am satisfied with the operation of the Act.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not accept that the reply he gave recently to a question from a colleague of his, that is, the number or prosecutions for under-age drinking in 1989 was a mere 129, was derisory in the context of the question? Does he not also accept that teenage drinking and drunkenness are widespread, that the age threshold is coming down all the time and that this is a major social cancer which has not been tackled by this legislation, well intentioned as it might be?  Finally, will he have recourse to the suggestion in that Act and introduce ID cards?</P>

      <P>The question of a national age card scheme is still being considered. I want to evaluate the workings of other provisions in the Act before I embark on the introduction of a national age card scheme.  I also want to see how the voluntary age card schemes which are being operated in various areas, notably in Greystones in County Wicklow where an excellent scheme is being operated, are working.  As the Act was only introduced in 1988, I believe this is a reasonable approach in the circumstances.  I share the Deputy's concern about the problem of under-age drinking but I do not want to take precipitated action in relation to a national age card scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, fail to understand how the Minister considers the Act to be working well when it is not curbing the rising incidence of under-age drinking. The section of the Act dealing with the regulation and sale of intoxicating liquor in supermarkets has not yet been brought into play.  This section provides that the area selling intoxicating liquor has to be divided from the area selling foodstuffs.  May I ask the Minister what progress, if any, has been made in the implementation of that section and why it has not yet been brought into play?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason it has not been brought into play yet is that the making of an order would have very serious repercussions, financial and otherwise, for both large and small supermarkets. As I said in relation to a national age card scheme, I want to be sure that the measures we put in place to curb under-age drinking are working as effectively as possible before I make this order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">

      <P>I would be the first to admit that there is a problem in this area.  I have <Col N="799" /> had discussions with representatives of the trade.  It is not just a question of making an order; I have to find some practical way of dividing the area of the supermarket selling alcohol from the areas selling other items.  I am trying to see if this can be done on a voluntary basis rather than by making an order.  I am trying to devise practical solutions to this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am hoping to get the co-operation of the representatives of the trade generally so that there will be a natural division of the two areas in stores. This will have major financial and other implications for supermarkets.  It will be easier for some supermarkets to separate the areas, for example, it will be very difficult for some of the small family type supermarkets to separate these two areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister adverted to the need to have a physical barrier in supermarkets to deal with dividing areas where intoxicating liquor is for sale from other areas and it is over 12 months now since the regulations came into effect so far as the restaurant bar is concerned. Would the Minister accept that the physical barrier, introduced as a late amendment into the legislation in 1988, should be reviewed?  Would he accept that the physical barrier in a bar in a restaurant is somewhat farcical, that it is offputting from the customer's point of view and has given rise to a situation where people <Col N="800" /> going into a restaurant cannot engage in the simple exercise of having drink at a counter prior to a meal?  I hope that when the Minister is bring forward the regulations he will take that into account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the frustration of the six day licencees as they see their licensed neighbours and business rivals opening on a Sunday in tourist areas.

There are 11,000 licensed premises throughout the country, 50 per <Col N="801" /> cent of which are selling four barrels of beer a week or less.  The Vintners' Federation are now in the habit of conducting a campaign to purchase <i>en bloc</i> licences that become available which is having a serious effect on the entire licensed business to such an extent that we are not reflecting the needs of our community. Would the Minister accept that towns like Leixlip, Clane and Ashbourne on the perimeter of the capital are not in a position to provide the public with a licensed premises because of the outdated and outmoded licensing laws?

      <Quest>if he accepts the validity of the view, expressed by the Director of Public Prosecutions to the Incorporated Law Society Conference that our gardaí have to operate under outdated statutes; and if he accepts the need to update our criminal law.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that there are areas of the criminal law which need to be updated.  It is practically inevitable that this will always be the case.  The mores and values of a society, which the criminal law must reflect, are in a state of constant evolution and, therefore, the criminal law will always be subject to a need for change and updating.</P>
      <P>In the address by the Director of Public Prosecutions which is referred to in the question, the Malicious Damages Act, 1861, is referred to in particular as an example of out of date legislation.  I accept what was said but I can tell the House that I have in my Department a Bill, at an advanced stage of preparation, to replace that Act.  It is my hope, indeed, to have it circulated before the end of this session.</P>
      <P>As the area of the law dealing with crimes of dishonesty, the Larceny Act, 1990, which was recently enacted, updates and refines the law on receiving and the Law Reform Commission are at present working on recommendations for further legislation to replace the other provisions of the Larceny Act, 1916.  The commission also have on their programme the question of updating legislation on offences against the person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bills are at present before the Oireachtas to amend the law on rape, to update the law on firearms and offensive weapons, to provide for DNA testing for forensic purposes and to abolish capital punishment and I have a very full programme of further legislation at various stages of preparation.  I should draw the attention of the House to the fact that a <Col N="804" /> total of 21 Bills in the Justice area have been enacted or introduced in the last three years.</P>
    <P>I believe that it should be clear from what I have said that, not alone do I accept the need for updating of the law, but that I am, in fact, doing a good deal about it with all the speed that the resources at my disposal allow.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that weight should be given to the views expressed by the Director of Public Prosecutions who is very slow indeed to go public and, I imagine, would not have done so unless he thought there was a serious problem?  Will the Minister accept that the position today is that the Garda are operating against highly sophisticated, professional criminals and that we are giving them an unfair advantage by not updating our laws?  Furthermore, would he not accept that there was a commitment in the Joint Programme for Government to update and consolidate our laws?  Would he not accept that it is ridiculous that 130 years on Acts, such as the 1861 Offences Against the Persons Act, which have no relevance to the conditions of today are still being operated? Finally, I would suggest again to the Minister that the only way forward is to establish a criminal law reform commission to tackle the job properly.  Will the Minister now, at this stage, concede that point and set up that committee so that we can do the job in a reasonably expeditious manner?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do accept that when the Director of Public Prosecutions makes a statement in relation to the law it is right and proper that the Minister for Justice and the Government should pay careful attention to it.  I accept that significant areas of our criminal law require review and updating.  The fact is that the resources which we can devote to law reform are limited.  The best use that can be made of these resources is to target those areas where the need for review and reform is greatest.  I should point out that the work is not finished when a <Col N="805" /> commission reports and makes recommendations for legislation.  Further considerable work has to go into preparing and drafting Bill to implement recommendations and both my Department and the draftsmans' office have limited resources.  Rather than using the broad brush it is better to target particular areas.  I fully accept that there are anomolies in the law, the Deputy mentioned one, the 1861 Act, and I mentioned others.  We are coming to grips with them.</P>

This country should now take the obvious, sensible step and have a separate criminal law reform commission to do the necessary investigation for the updating and consolidation of our laws.</P>

      <P>I do not disagree with the need for law reform in this area.  I accept that there is a need for change and we are trying to bring about those changes. In the last three years more than 21 Bills have been prepared and there are some important ones before the House.  For example, I hope to circulate a Bill to change the Malicious Damages Act, 1861, by the end of the session.  I am attempting to target certain areas with the resources available.  It is not a question of establishing another commission.  A commission would produce a report but it would have to be processed.  We are trying to come to grips with the problem.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to consider his policy in regard to this, bearing in mind that he has said it is the function of his Department to target specific areas in need of reform. Will the Minister accept that in line with updating the criminal law there is a need to simplify the laws and make them more easily understood?  Will he accept that that is part and parcel of the problem? Will he also accept that for the criminal justice system to prosecute and convict it must deal with many amendments to Acts, regulations, amendments to regulations and so on?  Instead of targeting specialist areas and bringing forward amendments to them, the Minister should consider a codification of the criminal law system to ensure that we simplify the position.  The Minister has told us that the resources are not available to his Department and I suggest that the only answer is to establish a commission to simplify criminal law for the general public.  There is no doubt that that is not the position at present.</P>

      <P>I fully accept that in tackling our crime problems it is vitally important that the gardaí have the legislative backing that they need to do their job effectively and considerable progress is being made in providing this legislation &mdash; recent examples include the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Bill, 1989, and the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Bill, 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Firearms and Offensive Weapons Bill introduces strict and effective controls on stun guns, crossbows, knives and other dangerous articles and provides the Garda Síochána with appropriate powers of arrest, search and seizure related to the provisions of the Bill.  The Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Bill empowers the Garda Síochána to take <Col N="808" /> bodily samples from persons suspected of serious offences, for the purpose of forensic testing, to enable them to take advantage of the most up to date developments in forensic science, including DNA profile testing, in the investigation of crime.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the recently enacted Larceny Act replace the existing offence of receiving stolen property with a more broadly based offence of handling stolen property.  It also contains important new provisions regarding the possession of articles for use in larceny and buglary and related offences.  I have no doubt that this Act will greatly help the Garda to deal with those who receive and deal in stolen property.</P>
    <P>Also, the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, conferred on the gardaí significant powers for the purpose of investigating serious offences, including powers of detention after arrest.</P>
    <P>I should add that all relevant legislation in the area of criminal law, evidence and procedure is kept under review.  A number of measures in that area are being considered in my Department and the necessary legislative proposals will be brought forward as appropriate.</P>
    <P>While I am, of course, concerned at the level of violence associated with much of the crime perpetrated at the present time and while I do not wish to play down the seriousness of the overall crime situation I believe that it is right that I should make the point that the provisional figures for 1989 indicate a drop of approximately 15 per cent in the level of recorded indictable crime during the period 1983 to 1989.  I am determined to do everything possible to ensure that this welcome downward trend is maintained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is seeking to introduce a secret ballot, to move from the position of there being no statutory obligation to hold a secret ballot in the case of a trade dispute to one where a secret ballot will be imposed by statute, not only for a primary strike but for any dispute and, wider still, for what is called any other form of industrial action. Although a secret ballot is not required by law most unions, if not all unions, have no objection to there being a requirement to hold a secret ballot for a primary strike.  However, it is unwise, wrong and unworkable, to seek to extend the requirement for a secret ballot to <Col N="845" /> cover all forms of industrial action.  It will invite a rush of unofficial disputes because unions will know that the immunities conferred by subsequent sections will not be conferred in circumstances where they act outside of the provisions of section 14.</P>
      <P>My submission is that minor disputes are part of the dynamic of the private sector in particular.  What will now happen is that minor disputes will become major disputes because workers who will be required to go through the elaborate and tedious procedures laid down in the Bill in order to get their union executive to convene a meeting and hold a secret ballot in the manner prescribed and so on, may say that they could resolve their difficulties in a five minute dispute but as they will have to have a secret ballot they might as well make a proper dispute out of it.</P>
      <P>That is one reaction, and the other is that workers will know that their union executives and leadership will not want to know about this kind of situation.  They will turn a blind eye; the workers will take whatever action they want to on the shop floor but when the union executives are asked to account for it they will say that they did not know or that they did not make it official.  What does the Minister propose to do when all these minor fractures happen throughout the private sector?  Put all the workers in jail?  It is simply not practicable.  I will not go on because the Minister indicated the last day that he was rethinking this aspect of the section.</P>
      <P>I repeat that there is no objection on any side of the House to a secret ballot for a primary dispute, although we will later come to difficulties it will cause in the operation of the all-out picket.  Minor disputes are part of the everyday life of the industrial sector, but they will become major disputes if the Minister insists on enshrining this in law or they will invite unofficial action on a scale that we have not seen before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Bill the secret ballot provisions <Col N="846" /> apply to strikes and other forms of industrial action.  &ldquo;Industrial action&rdquo; is broadly defined as all forms of disruption short of strikes, and it has been claimed that a requirement to have a ballot in all cases could cause chaos and lead to a rash of unofficial disputes.  These difficulties are exaggerated although I can see that in some cases it is essential that balloting arrangements apply, as some forms of industrial action such as working to rule, a go slow or an overtime ban can be equally &mdash; if not more &mdash; disruptive than a full-scale strike.  I spoke about this the last day and I do not want to go into it in great detail now.  People who say that the only kind of action which causes disruption or the closure of a plant is a strike, do not understand what happens. It is nonsense for any Member of the House to take that view.  I know that in many cases a go slow or unofficial action means that the workforce are idle at certain times while still drawing their pay, but it should be possible to provide a definition to differentiate between major and minor industrial action.</P>
      <P>There are many cases of unofficial action but we do not need to deal with them until they are made official.  I gave a commitment to Deputy Quinn and Deputy Rabbitte that I would examine certain points.  I am doing this at present and we may be able to make progress in regard to them on Report Stage.  I have in mind the point I already made in regard to secondary picketing and the word &ldquo;calculated&rdquo;. I also intend to carefully examine an amendment in relation to one-person disputes to take account of the points raised by the Deputies.  I have also agreed to examine the definition of &ldquo;industrial action&rdquo;.  I am still considering this matter with my legal advisers but there is great difficulty in moving from the present wording in the absence of an acceptable alternative.  However, we will seek to do so and I reiterate the commitment I made on the last day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In looking at the redefinition of &ldquo;industrial action&rdquo; the Minister might consider the following wording: &ldquo;Industrial action means any action taken <Col N="847" /> by any number or body of workers acting in combination, or under a common understanding, which involves a partial refusal to work or a refusal to carry out work or to provide services normally carried out or provided within the terms of their contract of employment as a means of compelling their employer to accept &mdash; or not to accept &mdash; terms or conditions affecting employment but does not include a refusal to carry out work or provide services which, if carried out or provided, would frustrate a strike or industrial action engaged in by others&rdquo;. On the understanding that comprehensive and constructive consideration will be given to this definition, I will withdraw my amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 42:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection (2) (a), line 9, after &ldquo;other&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;major&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We cannot simply accept the phrase &ldquo;any industrial action&rdquo; because it could bring the legislation into disrepute.  You could have circumstances in which a minor dispute could be settled very quickly locally by discussion but it could blow up because somebody insists on having a ballot. Therefore, we cannot let that phrase stand.  If we preceded the word &ldquo;industrial&rdquo; with the word &ldquo;major&rdquo; to read &ldquo;other major industrial action&rdquo; it might help.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge that &ldquo;major industrial action&rdquo; is not very precise but it at least indicates more clearly what I think the House and the Minister wish to enact, that in any major stoppage there would be a secret ballot but that it would not be invoked for ordinary, everyday skirmishes. I ask the Minister to consider an amendment along the lines I suggested. In relation to what Deputy Quinn said, you cannot provide for every incident which will take place but the words &ldquo;other industrial action&rdquo; are too broad.  My amendment may not be perfect but it is an improvement.</P>

      <P>We discussed this at great length on the last occasion and, therefore, the definition of &ldquo;industrial action&rdquo; was not arrived at in a hurry.  I will examine all these points of view but there are difficulties involved.  A work to rule in a large plant is certainly &ldquo;major industrial action&rdquo; and I can give many other examples.  The same applies to a go slow or an overtime ban which may halt productivity.  It is also hard to define &ldquo;minor industrial action&rdquo; but we will examine the matter to see if any improvement can be made.  It is not a simple area.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 45:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection (2) (b), lines 16 to 20, to delete from and including &ldquo;votes without interference&rdquo; down to the end of the paragraph and substitute &ldquo;may do so;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I might explain the compelling reasons for my tabling this amendment.  This is the requirement that must be inserted in unions' rule books for them to come within the terms of this Bill.  I might read into the record subsection (2) (b) which says:</P>
      <P>... the union shall take reasonable steps to ensure that every member entitled to vote in the ballot votes without interference from, or constraint imposed by the union or any of its members, officials or employees and, so far as is reasonably possible, that such members shall be given a fair opportunity of voting;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Frankly, I am amazed at that construction. I would ask the Minister what in Heaven's name is the reason for all the <Col N="849" /> constraints imposed in that subsection? Why can we not have as I recommend in my amendment:</P>
    <P>(b)  the union shall take reasonable steps to ensure that every member entitled to vote in the ballot may do so;</P>
    <P>The position, as it stands, is extraordinarily restrictive in terms of how a trade union normally does its job.  Is a trade union official, making a recommendation on behalf of his executive, trying to influence the outcome of a ballot, seen to be interfering with the conduct of the ballot?  Is he leaving himself open to an action being taken against him?  It appears to me that the ordinary task one undertakes in endeavouring to influence one's members this way or that way &mdash; which is a perfectly legitimate and democratic thing to do &mdash; is being constrained here.</P>
    <P>One of the matters about which I am worried &mdash; something we have not touched on at all &mdash; is what happens when the commission get round to introducing draft codes of practice, for example, when they introduce a code of practice to deal with trade union balloting, as they did in the United Kingdom?  In those circumstances &mdash; bad and all as was the original law &mdash; it was rendered draconian as a result of the draft code of practice sought to be implemented.  I should like to have had more time to deal with this in greater detail.</P>
    <P>If the House will permit, I should like to quote the conclusion of Mr. Bill Wedderburn, an acknowledged expert on labour law, who wrote the book <i>The Worker and the Law</i>.  He said there were four underlying objectives in the Tory code introduced:</P>
    <P>To delay industrial action for as long as possible; to extend the grounds on which an injunction can be obtained against a union; to induce a majority vote by members against industrial action and discourage ballots and, therefore, official union strikes.</P>
    <P>He concluded that the lack of reciprocity <Col N="850" /> in the draft code was &ldquo;staggering.&rdquo;  He said that by those means union power was to be weakened and employers' power increased.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will contend that we would not do anything like that here, that that is what has been done by the Tory Government in Britain.  I might refer the Minister to page 55 of this document produced by the Institute of Employment Rights where he will find, amazingly, in paragraph 54 the following:</P>
    <P>... The law requires your trade union to ensure in this ballot:</P>
    <P>(a)  Your vote will be secret;</P>
    <P>(b)  You are allowed to vote without interference from or constraint imposed by the union or any of its members, officials or employees.</P>
    <P>I would seem to have ascertained where the Minister's advisers discovered this paragraph.  I am sure the Minister would never admit that he would borrow from Norman Tebbitt's legislation but it is extraordinary that it is precisely the same wording as that introduced in Britain.  Of course, as Mr. Bill Wedderburn said, it is &ldquo;staggering&rdquo; in its partiality.  I rest my case on that.  I do not think the British Tory solution is appropriate here.  Rather we should go for a wording to the effect that all reasonable steps are taken to ensure that every member entitled to vote in the ballot may do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read a great deal of Lord Wedderburn's writings and would agree with many of them.  He is an eminent Labour Peer and adviser to the British Labour Party on industrial relations.  I do not think he could advance any other view bearing in mind his capacity in that respect.  I am sure Members would find that certain portions of our legislation adopt the same wording.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might say to Deputy Rabbitte that the provision in subsection (2) (b) is intended to ensure that every member of a trade union who is entitled to vote is given an opportunity to cast his or her vote without constraint or undue influence; in other words, that people can <Col N="851" /> vote whatever way they want to.  I do not see anything excessive in this provision. Certainly it is not what happens very often.  I could give the House many examples of circumstances in which individuals wishing to vote are not allowed register their democratic decision.  Instead they are harassed and are not allowed register their democratic decision, the ballot having been set up in such a manner that they must show their ballot paper, placing it in front of people. I am not prepared to implement legislation carrying such constraints.  Nonetheless, in reality that is what happens in many instances.</P>
    <P>In this clause we have inserted the minimum justifiable.  I do not see anything excessive in it.  I would not see it interfering with the ability of union officials stating their case.  I would agree with Deputy Rabbitte in that respect.  Naturally, a trade union official should be allowed speak to his members and present whichever side of the case he chooses.  Indeed, I would contend that it is better that a trade union official present the case and circulate any relevant data. All of that is legitimate.  But the provisions of this subsection deal with circumstances in which a person goes to cast his franchise when he should at least be afforded some kind of normal protection. We are merely seeking that trade unions provide their members with a fair opportunity of voting whichever way they want without interference or constraint.  I might again read into the record the wording of subsection (2) (b):</P>
    <P>the union shall take reasonable steps to ensure that every member entitled to vote in the ballot votes without interference from, or constraint imposed by the union or any of its members, officials or employees and, so far as is reasonably possible, that such members shall be given a fair opportunity of voting;</P>
    <P>I cannot see how that provision could be much milder.</P>

      <P>Deputy Rabbitte is not being reasonable in his proposal.  It is really scrurrilous of him to endeavour to discredit our Minister for Labour by associating him with Norman Tebbitt.  At the same time I have to say that, with regard to this provision, probably Mr. Tebbitt is right; he was not wrong about everything and in this he is probably right.  Anyway, our culture is different. What is being sought here is that the normal rules and regulations governing secret balloting be observed in the way we, as elected representatives, must observe them at election time.  We cannot be in the polling stations constraining people to vote for our candidature or our party.  I feel this is a reasonable provision and I will certainly support the Minister on it.</P>

      <P>With all due respect, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the Minister <Col N="853" /> did not answer the questions put to him. With all due respect to him and to the rest of us, it really does not matter what we think, the courts will make the decision on the basis of the written word in this section.  When Deputy Quinn asked the Minister whether a recommendation by the union to reject the terms would be considered interference, he answered no.  I would like to think that is the case, but I have expert opinion available to me that suggests that canvassing rejection of the terms could precisely constitute the type of interference envisaged in this section.  What is the necessity for a section which says &ldquo;the union shall take reasonable steps to...&rdquo; allow everybody a fair chance of voting.  I accept that, but the paragraph continues &ldquo;...without interference from, or constraint imposed by the union or any of its members, officials or employees&rdquo;.  It seems to me that there is any number of possibilities open to a trade union official or shop steward which could be construed as constraint by any member of the union afterwards.  Let us remember there is always a minority in a ballot, you rarely ever get 100 per cent agreement.  He may say he was pressured, canvassed or interfered with by a shop steward.  As far as I am concerned it is part of the democratic process that the executive of the union would form a view on a package of terms and would canvass support for that point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe this is completely unnecessary. I am quite prepared to say to the Minister to tag onto the end of the paragraph that the union should take reasonable steps to ensure that every member entitled to vote in the ballot &ldquo;may do so&rdquo; and to change the phrase towards the end to &ldquo;members will be given a fair opportunity of voting&rdquo;.  As Deputy Jim O'Keeffe remarked earlier today, the paragraph is prefaced by the words, &ldquo;the union shall take reasonable steps,...&rdquo; However, constraints are then inserted in the section.  I wonder why no constraints are being imposed on employers, as there are no corollary constraints on the employers who may, in any given <Col N="854" /> number of ways, interfere with the conduct of the ballot.  We all know that a big stick can be waved.  There are no restrictions on the employers while restrictions are being imposed on the trade unions.  I am most unhappy with this.</P>
    <P>I have explained the genesis of this section and where the Minister's advisers found it.  I do not think its paternity does him any credit.  I think it is an important matter, notwithstanding Deputy Mitchell's treatment of it as a light matter. It is unfair to the trade union movement. With all due respect to the Minister, I do not accept his arguments that wholesale intimidation or harassment goes on in the Irish trade union movement.  I have never seen workers being interfered with when trying to cast their vote in a ballot.  There are sensible regulations and precedents laid down that have governed the practice of secret ballot for as long as trade unions have existed in this country.  I know there is a division in so much as the British based unions have a tradition of a carpark mass meetings method of voting but they will have to accept that the law applies to them as to everybody else.</P>
    <P>I think it is an unnecessary slur on the trade union movement to require that a provision must be inserted which says that the workers must vote &ldquo;without interference from, or constraint imposed by the union, or any of its members, officials or employees ...&rdquo; That is unnecessary and I ask the Minister to reconsider this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a brief comment before the Minister because we might want to devote some of this scarce time to the position on the congress all-out picket.  In reply to my previous question, the Minister suggested that it would be quite reasonable and ordinary for a trade union official to take the ballot box around to places of work in order to facilitate members.  Is the Minister aware that the Registrar of Friendly Societies is currently saying to the largest union in the country that they will not be allowed to do this in respect of a ballot on the establishment of a political fund?  The <Col N="855" /> Registrar of Friendly Societies has taken a view contrary to the Minister that the ballots will have to take place in the union office.  Their view is the converse of what the Minister has just said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will now deal with the questions.  I did not refer to wholesale abuses but to abuses.  Indeed, Deputy Rabbitte is well aware of the abuses.  This section can only be read in relation to voting.  We are not talking about people coming in to meetings and making their points about what way people should vote, or directing people as to the way the branch would like them to vote, or when people point out the complications that will arise if they do not vote the way the unions wishes them to do so.  Under this section, people are entitled to go to a table or a box and to cast their ballot without having to show their hand or openly indicate what decision they have made.  It would be wrong if we did not provide this safeguard.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Quinn's question, the practice has always been when major issues were being decided, such as decisions on national agreements or union amalgamations &mdash; I am particularly familiar with the procedures on amalgamations because I saw a number of ballots on amalgamations a few months ago &mdash; the trade union officials brought around the boxes.  The Deputy knows as well as I do that the Registrar of Friendly Societies is an independent person. However, I think it would be restrictive if people had to go to a certain place because the procedure has always been that people could go to their place of work.  The clause in section 15 (b) is to give people an opportunity to ballot in the normal election process.  This is a right they are entitled to.  The wording used is not in any way restrictive.</P>

      <P>There are a number of important amendments coming up and I do not wish to detain the House at this stage by calling a vote on this section. However, I am disappointed with the Minister's response because I cannot see how it is such a central matter for him.  I am not ascribing to him the views concerning the manner in which this will be interpreted, but the facts are as I have said, that it is not really what the Minister's intentions are that we are concerned with but with what the section says.  The section says very explicitly, and this must be enshrined in the rule books of the union, that they must provide a facility to vote &ldquo;without interference from, or constraint imposed by the union, or any of its members, officials or employees ...&rdquo; I do not believe it is possible in a political party, in a trade union or in a sports club to have such an unreasonable rule because we are all free to canvass and influence the outcome and try to win wavering support to our point of view.  Nobody would be a greater expert in that than the Taoiseach, who has joined us, and I am sure would agree with me.  It is a perfectly democratic thing for us to seek to do.</P>

      <P>It is not what I am saying.  I would be quite happy &mdash; as I am sure the trade union movement would be &mdash; to agree to a provision which would require the union to take all reasonable steps to ensure that every member entitled to vote may do so.  As I have said, if the Minister wants to rewrite the section to provide for what is listed in the last line, that members shall be given a fair opportunity of voting, I would be quite happy to take that on board but I am most unhappy with the position whereby a trade union, or an individual <Col N="857" /> member, employee, official or shop steward is open to legal action as a result of a crank subsequently saying that pressure was put on him or that he was interfered with in the course of exercising his right to vote.  There are head cases and cranks in every large organisation and that is likely to happen.  I cannot see why it is of such central importance to the Minister not to reframe the section.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 52:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection (2) (d), lines 32 to 35, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;the trade union&rdquo; down to the end of the paragraph and substitute &ldquo;, in the case of ballots by more than one trade union, an aggregate majority of all the votes cast, favours such strike or other industrial action;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The question of the all-out picketing arrangements operated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has been the subject of much discussion and commentary recently.  Much of what has been said was misleading and inaccurate.  There was never any question that the Bill would outlaw or make the all-out picketing arrangements illegal and there is nothing in section 14 as it stands which would do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept fully that the all-out picketing <Col N="858" /> arrangements have brought a great deal of order to what was previously often a very chaotic situation.  I wish to make it clear that the all-out picketing arrangements can continue subject to the various unions involved balloting their members. I believe that giving members the right to ballot in these situations is fundamental to the whole principle of having secret ballots in industrial disputes.</P>
    <P>Having considerd the various concerns expressed in consultation with congress and the FIE I am proposing two amendments in section 14.  I acknowledge the suggestions and points that were made by Deputies on all sides of the House during Second Stage.  The first of these arises in subsection (d) which deals with the position where there is more than one union in an employment and the members of one union vote against a strike or other industrial action but a majority of all the employees vote in favour.  In such circumstances the union whose members voted against will be entitled to call on their members to participate in the strike.  The present wording of subsection (d) could be interpreted as requiring that formal arrangement for the aggregation of ballot results be in operation. Amendment No. 52 makes it clear that a formal arrangement is not necessary. It simply requires that the majority of all the votes cast be in favour of the strike or other action.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 55 will add a new subsection to make it clear that a decision to support a strike by another trade union will not be implemented until an all-out picket is authorised by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  This will ensure that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions retain their position of having control over whether picketing is extended to cover members of unions other than the union directly involved in the dispute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am truly sorry that the debate on this set of amendments is curtailed, because they are central to the purpose and the success of this Bill.  I said earlier in the debate that in practice this Bill is needed to deal with cases largely where there are non-congress unions <Col N="859" /> involved.  I think all sides of the House would agree that the practice and arrangements within congress, the all-out picket arrangements and the pre-strike discussions that take place between congress unions, are very effective.  The real problem in the past &mdash; and we can reasonably foresee problems in the future &mdash; have arisen most often where there are non-congress union involved.</P>
      <P>The Minister's proposals in amendments Nos. 52 and 55 improve the Bill but they are still far from what is required. Probably the most significant omission in the Bill is its failure to deal with the case where one union which is not a member of congress, even where that union represents a minority in the workplace, decides to strike, even after a secret ballot, and by placing a picket, without any consultation with other unions, can close the firm.  That union may be in the business of hyping up activity to poach members from other unions, as is frequently the case.  I would like to have spoken at much greater length on this issue but I realise that other speakers wish to contribute.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider this matter for Report Stage. I will be putting down an amendment on Report Stage so that we can consider it in more detail.</P>

      <P>I will be very brief.  The all-out picket has made a major contribution to good order in Irish industrial relations.  It is clear, and is accepted by the Minister, that this Bill will make the all-out picket inoperable.  I agree with the Minister that there has been some wild discussion about making it illegal but that is not the point.  The point is that it will make it inoperable and I do not believe the Minister's amendment goes far enough to restore that situation. Employers and Government, on many occasions, have been very grateful for the <Col N="860" /> availability of the all-out picket mechanism which has been used very constructively, the threat of the application of which has precipitated a settlement in many disputes.  Any restrictions on the use of the all-out picket will be regretted.</P>
      <P>Up to now the executive or industrial relations committee of congress could make a decision on whether or not to grant permission for an all-out picket, based on the merits of the dispute and not on whether they had an aggregate ballot of all the workers.  The primary union involved could bring a case to congress who would examine it on its merits and would decide whether or not to grant the all-out picket.  The requirement being imposed in this amendment is so restrictive as to make that inoperable and I think we will regret its passing.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Mitchell and Deputy Rabbitte for curtailing their potentially extensive contributions in this regard.  I would simply suggest to the Minister that amendment No. 60, in the name of Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan, which is an addition to the section and does not detract from anything the Minister or his advisers want to do, gives an either-or option.  We would all recommend that if people are going to go on strike they should, where possible, have the right to vote in advance without constraints, interference or pressure.  The all-out picket mechanism, which is part of our culture and which has worked very well, should not be made inoperable, which is, in effect, the considered view of this Bill. I would simply ask the Minister to seriously consider this amendment in particular. The aim of all these amendments is much the same but amendment No. 60, which gives an either-or option does not take away from what the Minister is trying to do.</P>

Congress have the last say.  During the debate here the last day I was asked to consult further.  I consulted the Congress of Trade Unions, and we still have time to look at the legalities before the Report Stage.  This process is now acceptable to Congress.  If anyone can think of something stronger, they should let us know; but this covers the two essential parts &mdash; the aggregate of the ballot and the fact that Congress have the final say.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 66:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 11, subsection (1), lines 14 <Col N="862" /> to 17, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;that employer shall&rdquo; down to the end of the subsection and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;no person shall be entitled to apply to any court for an injunction restraining the strike, the picketing or other major industrial action unless notice of the application has been given to the trade union and its members who are party to the trade dispute.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of amendment No. 66 is to improve and clarify the provision in section 19 (1) which, as I read it, prevents employers seeking interlocutory injunctions without the knowledge of trade unions.  As the subsection is drafted, somebody else could seek an interlocutory injunction without informing the trade unions.</P>
    <P>The purpose of my amendment is to make it clear that no person shall be entitled to apply to any court for an injunction restraining the strike to picketing or other major industrial action unless notice of the application has been given to the trade union and its members who are party to the trade dispute.  In the past, the granting of interlocutory injunctions which have taken place frequently in the past, some times in the judge's home in the middle of the night, unknown to trade unions who are not represented at the proceedings, has all too frequently been a cause of concern. It is only right that due notice of any such proceedings in future should be given to the union so that they can be represented, whether it is the employer or some other person who seeks that interlocutory injunction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the thrust of what Deputy Mitchell has said but I am not so sure that this amendment is the best way to achieve it &mdash; there are alternative amendments listed.  In any event, the net point is that it is completely inadequate to have a situation where it is provided that the employer shall not be entitled to apply to any court for an injunction.  What about a third party? Since there are any number of situations <Col N="863" /> where a third party may wish to apply for an injunction, confining it to &ldquo;that employer&rdquo; is unacceptable and again shifts the balance from the trade union movement.</P>
      <P>We are discussing amendments Nos. 66 to 71, inclusive, which include my own amendment No. 69 which proposes the insertion of the words &ldquo;or picketing&rdquo; after &ldquo;action&rdquo; in line 16.  In the interests of clarity it is important to note that we are not just talking about an injunction restraining the strike or other industrial action because some other person might seek to restrain picketing.  In that case, you may as well, in many circumstances, call off the dispute.  If a third party were to seek an injunction to restrain picketing then, for all intents and purposes, that could mean that the strike would be completely ineffective because the outward manifestation of a trade dispute being underway is the physical picketing boards and the act of picketing.  If an injunction could be secured to terminate picketing or restrain it, that could be very damaging to the dispute.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <P>In the interests of brevity I would like the Minister to clarify if he is prepared to accept the replacement of the word &ldquo;employer&rdquo; with the word &ldquo;person&rdquo;.  If so, it would meet our concerns. The example I have in mind is the customer who is dependent on a particular product or service being supplied by an employer and who, in order to ensure that he or she gets that product or service, places an injunction on the trade union.  As we read the law, they would be entitled to so do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The subsection provides that where a union or a group of unions hold a secret ballot in favour of strike action or industrial action and the company or group of unions give the employer at least one week's notice of the strike, the employer will not be entitled to see an <i>ex parte</i> injunction. Without going into any detail, and in view of what we said earlier, we are switching the balance one way.  This is an important point for the trade unions.  It has been <Col N="864" /> fought long and hard that this position would change because, as Deputy Mitchell said, it has been used very unfairly. Instead, the employer would be required to give notice of his intention to seek an injunction to the union and workers concerned so that the workers can be represented at the hearing.</P>
      <P>This is to remedy the abuse of injunctions by some employers in trade disputes. <i>Ex parte</i> injunctions are often sought and granted on the basis of an employer's sworn affidavit sometimes late at night or in the judge's home as has happened in a substantial number of famous disputes over the years.  Injunctions are often sought by employers as a bargaining tool and not for the purpose for which they are intended &mdash; the important point is that it has disrupted and caused so many problems in industrial relations matters &mdash; namely, to preserve the <i>status quo</i> until a full hearing can be arranged.  Trade dispute cases rarely come to a full hearing.  <i>Ex parte</i> injunctions will continue to be available in the case of trespass, damage to property, or actions likely to cause death or personal injury.</P>
      <P>In relation to the amendments it is clear that actions of this nature against trade unions will invariably be taken by employers.  That has been covered in the section.  This provision puts specific constraint on employers and it would not be appropriate to include other persons.  In any event, I have been legally advised that third parties would be unlikely to establish the necessary <i>locus standi</i> to take any action.  In drawing up these provisions I had to arrive at a careful balance in the rights and the interests involved, including the question of access to the courts.  However, picketing is embraced by the definition of industrial action in section 8 and it is not necessary to refer to it specifically in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the Minister has been given advice to the effect that the <i>locus standi</i> of a potential customer would probably be dismissed, but why should we allow that probability to be <Col N="865" /> assigned to some particularly conservative judge &mdash; we are not without a few of them?  Why allow a probability of doubt to be written into the law?  If that is the only reason the Minister is saying he is not prepared to say &ldquo;employer or other person&rdquo; or to remove the word &ldquo;employer&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;person&rdquo;, simply that it is the assessment of a current group of advisers that on the basis of their knowledge of the current judicial culture it is unlikely that probability would allow them to establish <i>locus standi</i>&mdash; that is wing and a prayer country.  We have an opportunity here now to make it hard, fixed and fast, and we have all agreed that the less discretion of a value judgment kind we give to people outside the making of the law and the interpretation of the law, the better for all concerned.  I think the Minister's intention is that third parties should not be entitled to seek injunctions.  If the Minister can clarify to the House that it is not his intention or the intention of the people who drafted this legislation to provide for the possibility, however remote, for third persons or persons other than the employer to seek and successfully obtain an injunction, then he should write it into this Bill at this time.  However, if that is not his intention and he wants to leave open the possibility for persons other than the employer, perhaps he will indicate his position on it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Quinn is correct in that I have no objection, but it is a question of balance on the rights and <Col N="866" /> interests involved.  We are taking away a right that employers have had.  They could &mdash; wrongly in my view and I think everyone agrees &mdash; get an injunction. From an employer's point of view that is major, and now employees will enjoy a significant gain because now they will not be disruptive when following normal procedures.  From now on if trade unions and their workers follow the fairly simple and straightforward procedures of having a ballot and giving one week's notice, the employer cannot get an injunction against them.  We all have had that right. When we are hard done by or people have done something against us we could take an injunction.  That right has been taken away.  The argument is that if we take away totally the right of a third person, we are moving close to the area of constitutional rights, though that is an unlikely occurrence.  I am giving the view to the Deputy.  Are the Deputies saying that it is a question of &ldquo;person&rdquo;, not really &ldquo;third party&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;employer&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>Under the arrangements we are now putting in place, for a strike to take place there has to be a secret ballot, access to the balloting process has to be without interference in terms of physical access, the outcome of the ballot has to be counted and it has to be conveyed then to the individual employer concerned, and one week's notice has to be given.  That is what we are proposing to be the law.  That process may very well come at the end of a long hot summer of aggravation or whatever and there may be anger and short temper on the part of nervous people.  The ballot has taken place and notice has been served, and the Minister is saying at that point the employer will not be able to get an injunction to prevent that strike from taking place.  If you recognise, having gone through the process, that those types of <i>ex parte</i> or interlocutory injunctions should not then be open to an employer, it seems the provision is wide open to abuse if a third party can go in, and, establishing <i>locus standi,</i> very well claim <Col N="867" /> that they were going to be an aggrieved customer, were going to suffer a great material loss and be out of pocket or whatever.</P>
      <P>We will try to balance it.  The Minister entered a second argument in his second response which was that removing the rights of persons other than employers to seek an injunction might possibly be a constitutional matter.  It seems contradictory to the argument earlier, that the Minister was advised it would be difficult to anticipate a situation where a person could establish <i>locus standi.</i> Maybe we should pursue what will constitute <i>locus standi</i> in these circumstances. I think the other Deputies here are simply saying there is a process that is now going to be enshrined in law. In most cases it combines with practice anyway but it is now going to have the force of law and it clearly has a time built into it, so there is no surprise likely in strike action where people observe that process.  The fact that there has been a call for strike action, that there is a ballot and one week's notice is required in reasonable terms means a minimum of ten days and in all probability something much longer.</P>
      <P>The urgency factor that comes into something like that for a third party person can be readily addressed.  Therefore, if you leave open the door you are allowing somebody else to decide whether a person other than the employer has the right to file and obtain an injunction.  If it is not the Minister's intention to provide that employers or other persons acting on behalf of their own interests or of the employer's interests have access to the courts for the explicit purposes of injuncting this action, then he should accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister has brought in the question of the possible unconstitutionality of amending this provision to say &ldquo;no person&rdquo;.  Even with my man-in-the-street knowledge of the law I do not think it bears any consideration. It seems more probable that what might be unconstitutional is having injunctions granted without those who are sought <Col N="868" /> to be injuncted being present to defend themselves or put their case.  That seems fundamentally unjust.</P>
      <P>We talked previously about multi-employer locations, and this problem will most likely arise in relation to those places, such as ports, airports, shopping centres or industrial estates.  It could be another employer who is adversely affected by a picket because a picket has to be at the approaches in given circumstances. The restriction here is only on the individual employer involved in the dispute.  It does not extend to other employers in multi-employment locations.  It is only a small step forward, and the Minister should see his way to accepting the amendments.  It makes absolute sense that unions should be informed of the <i>ex parte</i> injunction and should be able to go to the court and say that this should not be granted because the secret ballot and other provisions required by law have been observed.  I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>Take the company who are currently doing a very good job on the old College of Science buildings, International Contract Cleaners.  They are part of the Sisk group, but they are quite a separate, stand alone company whose equity is held in part by the Sisk group. They operate, trade and compete externally and internally with that group, as is increasingly the practice with groups of companies.  If the employees of ICC had a dispute, served strike notice in the normal way and put a picket on their headquarters and on their registered offices on the Naas Road, where other companies which are part of the group also have offices, could not a third party seek an injunction to prevent the workers going on strike or taking other action? That is an example of the third party position.  It may not be the employer but another person.</P>

      <P>I must confess I am <Col N="869" /> convinced by the argument.  My advisers have been told by the Attorney General's Office that it would be very difficult to cut off this third party.  It might not arise in many cases, or even at all.  We are taking away a major fundamental right of employers and to do that across the board could be unconstitutional.  That is the issue.  We are taking away the right of a third party, if they have a dispute or an issue with a union on strike, to seek an injunction.  At the same time I see the argument Deputy Quinn is making that there could be collusion involving the employer operating the system.  I will endeavour to see what can be put in without creating a constitutional problem.  I will speak again to the Attorney General and if it can be done I will bring forward an appropriate amendment.  I accept the argument.</P>

I cannot see how he could be advised that it is possibly unconstitutional to allow people to be defended in court.  It defies common sense.  The Minister has a reputation for having common sense &mdash; let us see some of it.  Let us accept the amendment. If the Attorney General still insists that it will not do, he can bring in a futher amendment on Report Stage.

      <P>This seems to do no more than have an honest belief on the part of the persons concerned accepted as the test rather than the more onerous requirement to establish a fair case.

      <P>Section 19 deals with the granting of injunctions.  Section 19 (1) provides that employers may not apply for <i>ex parte</i> injunctions in certain circumstances. There is no doubt but that it is a big restriction.  Subsection 19 (2) provides in certain circumstances when there has been notice and the secret ballot has been held, the court shall not grant an injunction where the union side establishes a fair case that it was acting in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute.</P>
      <P>What we are doing here is placing considerable restrictions on the granting of injunctions.  The onus to establish a fair case does provide a reasonable test and that would not be possible if the word &ldquo;believes&rdquo; was inserted.  In the circumstances, I cannot accept the amendment. All that is required, however, is for the striker or those involved in organising the strike to put forward their case.  That is a simple matter.  The balance here is clearly with the worker.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="874" /> In page 11, between lines 44 and 45, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(6) For the purposes of this section, a trade union shall be deemed to have fulfilled the requirements of section 14, and to have given not less than the notice required by subsections (1) and (2), unless the court is satisfied to the contrary.&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my view that a sweeping provision which assumes compliance is inappropriate for inclusion in legislation.  In any event, the legal advice available to me is that an amendment along the lines proposed is not necessary as it would be up to an employer who raised the question in relation to a secret ballot or the giving of notice to satisfy the court that the provisions concerning ballots or notice had not been complied with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is not necessary, would the Minister not consider it as, perhaps, providing a bit of comfort?  It is a reassurance that a vexatious seeking of an injunction by an employer or by a third person would not be entertained if they were to claim without providing satisfactory evidence at the time that they were seeking the injunction that the requirements of section 14 in respect of secret balloting had not been properly complied with.  It may very well be stating the obvious, but sometimes that has to be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the case sometimes, but I do not think it is necessary. The employer who raises the question in relation to a secret ballot and the giving of notice to the court under the provisions concerning ballots and notice, would not have complied with what is in the legislation. It is straightforward.  It can only be interpreted in that way.  I do not think the Deputy's amendment is necessary.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 74:</P>
      <P>In page 13, between lines 5 and 6, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Where a grant is made under section 15 of the Trade Union Act, 1975, the Minister shall itemise the broad headings of the expenses in respect of which such grant has been paid.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Effectively what is being sought here is the insertion of a new subsection which would amend the Trade Union Act, 1975. The purpose of the amendment is to require the Minister to be more specific in terms of funds allocated under the relevant section of the Trade Union Act, 1975, which has to do with trade union amalgamations, and itemise in broad terms the headings for the expenses in respect of which the grants have been paid.  This, as the House will be able to divine, springs from representations made to me as a result of the amalgamation of my own union with the Federated Workers' Union of Ireland and the fact that £1.4 million in all was paid to assist that amalgamation.  I understand that the figure in the budget was £1.27 million.  Many people raised their eyes at that amount of money which far exceeded what could have reasonably been expected.  If my information is correct I do not think anybody could have raised their eyes more than the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>SIPTU command a lot of clout with the Minister and the Taoiseach who would not run the risk of displeasing that body.  Therefore, the money was provided because, of course, SIPTU would be a cornerstone in any new negotiations for a programme for national recovery or a central agreement.  Nonetheless, it is important that there should be accountability for public money so disbursed. <Col N="876" /> Like other trade unionists.  I would like to know the purpose to which this was devoted.</P>
    <P>For some reason, and the House can make up its own mind on this, I seem to be regarded by many members of the new joint union as some kind of ombudsman to whom they can write about various grievances.  One takes some of those complaints with a grain of salt because one is accustomed to receiving that type of representation but, generally, the questions raised merit a response.  The transport union, in particular, has always been a centralised union and as far as I can see under the new set up the centralisation has been exacerbated.  When one takes that with the fact that the rules of amalgamation provide, for instance, that there should be no conference for five years, a top heavy structure, and, in the opinion of many members, make access to the leadership more difficult, one must ask questions.  I have received many queries about this.</P>
    <P>Of course, this has been exacerbated in the media coverage given to claims of inordinately high salaries being paid to a significant number of people in the leadership. One does not know if the media coverage is accurate but, if it is, it will cause some disquiet among the rank and file of the union.  One reaches the point where one must be concerned whether the salaries reported are compatible with the purpose and objectives of the trade union movement.  I do not think that leaders of any union, no matter how big, ought to be paid more than, for example, Government Ministers.  They ought to be paid a salary commensurate with the very difficult and demanding job they have. One can understand why many of the rank and file who are living on the average industrial wage, or lower, wonder if some of the £1.4 million of public money went to enhance the salaries of a small number of individuals.</P>
    <P>I may be alone in the House in believing that, with some honourable exceptions, the disposition of the trade union leadership is very conservative but that is cyclical; it will change.  Questions about <Col N="877" /> internal democracy, access to information, how the money of members is spent, accountability of public money put at the disposal of those for the amalgamation, are legitimate.  It would be very insensitive on anybody's part in the times in which we live if they were not sensitive to such questions.</P>
    <P>In the political arena we have seen how, in cases where the leadership became remote, overly centralised or insensitive to the views of the people or tried to get their fist into the jar of sweets for more than they were entitled, there was a reaction.  The question about public accountability is a legitimate one.  The purpose of the section is to do no more than provide for the future.  One hopes that the process of amalgamation will continue and that in such negotiations there will not be any secrecy about the public money put at the disposal of unions.  The Minister has broadened the scope of the Bill to the extent that where an honest attempt is made to merge two unions the expenses incurred will be met. I welcome that positive move but it is important that there should not be any secrecy about these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the section and the fact that the exceptional circumstances have been removed.  It is right that there should be an incentive to amalgamate.  All Members agree that we need amalgamations and that they are long overdue.  Indeed, the interpretation by the Department of Labour and, more to the point, the Department of Finance up to 1985 in relation to equalising pension entitlements was unnecessarily restrictive.  I must say to Deputy Rabbitte that his veiled attack on the merger which resulted in SIPTU was unwarranted.</P>

      <P>Fóir Teoranta are not required by law to break down the amount of money they give to companies. The Comptroller and Auditor General will ensure that everything is above board.  I should like to assure the Deputy <Col N="878" /> that there is nobody more rigorous than the officials in the Department of Finance when they seek a break-down of the costs incurred.  To suggest that the salaries of the SIPTU officials have in some way been subsidised by the £1.4 million grant is misleading because that money was to meet costs incurred, and was a once-off payment.  It cannot be regarded as an ongoing subsidy to a union.</P>
      <P>I can only speculate as to Deputy Rabbitte's motives but in my view we should welcome the amalgamation of the country's two largest unions whose history since 1922 has been characterised by extraordinary rivalry and bitterness.  I am pleased that the personalities have put their differences aside and that the unions have amalgamated.  The one person, one vote structure and the regional structure that have been written into the rules will ensure that the new union will be the most democratic of all unions.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Labour was right to give assistance towards the amalgamation of the unions.  He was correct in having that figure included in the budget rather than hiding it under a general provision. If that can be seen as the generous hand of the Oireachtas to encourage other unions to do the same, we will have done a positive day's work towards establishing a modern trade union structure here.</P>

      <P>If there is one thing that has bedevilled industrial relations for many decades it is the multiplicity of trade unions and the structural diversity of our trade union system.  Anything that will facilitate amalgamations or mergers is to be welcomed.  Therefore, I warmly welcome the improvements in the 1975 <Col N="879" /> Act.  Deputy Rabbitte referred to the level of salaries of the officers of SIPTU but I fail to see the relevance of that in the context of the amendment or the section.  I would have thought that salaries were a matter for internal decision by a union and that they should have a right to set them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to reply to this issue so that the record will be clear.  Each claim for expenses arising from a trade union merger is, as Deputy Quinn said, examined on its merits.  Grants are generally paid in respect of postage, printing, advertising, meetings, conferences, pensions, legal fees and so on.  All the moneys paid must be sanctioned by the Department of Finance and the Minister for Labour, unfortunately, does not have discretion in this regard.  I am not talking about SIPTU or any other union.  The moneys paid out are subject to scrutiny by the Comptroller and Auditor General and all that entails where Members can raise queries on the relevant committee. I do not think a provision along the lines suggested is necessary.</P>
      <P>In the 1975 Act all additional moneys had to be classified under a heading of &ldquo;extraordinary expenditure&rdquo; but I hope to issue a list for inclusion in this Bill because it is important for people to know what they can claim.  Deputy Quinn mentioned the pension provision of the smaller unions and that the reason they will not amalgamate is because some of them have been in existence for 40 years. I totally understand their position and a lenient attitude should be adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a lot of money involved in the SIPTU amalgamation but it was the biggest amalgamation since the foundation of the State.  Following negotiations in that regard, I had to go to the Department of Finance because it was far bigger than any previous amalgamation.  It was then approved at the Cabinet table but, because it could be misinterpreted or misread, I argued for it to be included as a budget provision which would leave it open to the House for a budget debate. Every Member of the House could then <Col N="880" /> raise it as they would not be confined to Question Time.</P>

      <P>We now come to amendment No. 75.  Amendments Nos. 76 and 77 are related and amendment No. 77a is an alternative to amendment No. 77.  Is it agreed that amendments Nos. 75, 76, 77 and 77a will be taken together?  Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 75:</P>
      <P>In page 13, subsection (1), line 30, to delete &ldquo;psychiatric&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to delete the word &ldquo;psychiatric&rdquo; from the definition in this section.  The purpose of the amendment is known to the Minister.  As the law currently stands &mdash; and as it will stand when this Bill is enacted &mdash; certain categories of worker are excluded from the protection of the Bill.  The purpose of my amendment is to include one particular category of workers, a very substantial and significant one, whose exclusion is anomalous.</P>
      <P>If Members of the House turn their attention to subsection (1) they will see that it defines &ldquo;worker&rdquo; for the purpose of the Bill and includes in particular &ldquo;a psychiatric nurse employed by a health board&rdquo; but not a series of persons listed from (a) to (f).  I do not want to take up the time of the House by explaining why &ldquo;psychiatric nurse&rdquo; is included in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to say with what one agrees as well as raising questions.  I agree with the inclusion of &ldquo;psychiatric nurse&rdquo; and I also agree with the amalgamation of the Federated Workers' Union of Ireland and the ITGWU.  While agreeing that a <Col N="881" /> psychiatric nurse should be included, a generally trained nurse in any of the disciplines should also be included.  If one excises the word &ldquo;psychiatric&rdquo; the section reads &ldquo;including in particular a nurse employed by a health board ...&rdquo;.  No argument can be put forward for excluding generally trained nurses from the protection of the Bill.  It is wrong to exclude them, it is anachronistic.  Generally trained nurses are now joining the conventional traditional trade union type organisation in their thousands in circumstances in which they were not joining up to now.  Their own organisation &mdash; the Irish Nurses' Organisation &mdash; traditionally were a kind of in-house staff association but they have applied and have recently been accepted to membership of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, which I welcome.  The structure and make-up of the INO for the purposes of the affiliation to Congress will make it more and more a conventional trade union.  I cannot see why generally trained nurses should not be protected by the Bill, especially since the pressures on them have been exacerbated in recent years.  They are at the coal face in the health services and have taken the brunt of the health cuts.  They perform a most difficult and demanding job in a tough environment.  On Second Stage I described matrons as being the last bastion of autocracy in management and the Minister is in a unique position to know the truth of that statement.  It is discriminatory that generally trained nurses do not have recourse to the Labour Court and the commission, it cannot be justified. I ask the Minister to take the opportunity provided by this amendment to bring these nurses within the scope of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister replies I wish to broaden the scope although the principle remains the same.  I agree with what Deputy Rabbitte said but I urge the Minister, in the light of the implications of the changes which will occur <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court &mdash; and having regard to <Col N="882" /> the levels of dissatisfaction among some sectors of the public service &mdash; not to exclude certain categories from the right of access to the Rights Commissioners.</P>
      <P>Time prohibits me from putting it all on the record but I have here a letter from the Local Government and Public Services Union, a union to which the Minister should have particular regard at present since they are the only people who have appended their signature to the next programme for national recovery and have done so with a fair degree of characteristic spirit.  Public reward for public courage, or placing one's neck on the block, should be recognised.  In the course of a submission prepared by their general secretary they say, on page 3:</P>
      <P>The conciliation process is less favourable than that available to workers generally through the Labour Court in that there is no external assistance or facility in seeking to arrive at solutions.</P>
      <P>If anything is endeavouring to accommodate the modern culture of a progressive system of industrial relations that is it.  To continue the quotation:</P>
      <P>A further difficulty is the slowness/duration of procedures. Some delays may be due to either side but even a strict adherence to the time limits within the scheme is unlikely to result in a span of less than a year from serving of claim to finality.  The time span on the processing of claims in the Labour Court is a fraction of this.</P>
      <P>1.3 This is considerably facilitated by the court's working procedures which keep claims on the move.</P>
      <P>1.4 Workers generally have access to a rights commissioner in the circumstances referred to below while those within the ambit of our scheme have no such facility.  Subject to the agreement of both parties a rights commissioner may investigate any dispute other than the following:</P>
      <P>(a)  a dispute connected with rates of pay, hours or time of work, or annual holidays of, a body of workers;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="883" /> (b)  a dispute involving persons who have not access to the Labour Court for the purposes of a trade dispute;</P>
    <P>(c)  a dispute in relation to which the Labour Court has already made a recommendation.</P>
    <P>The conclusions of this LGPSU document are as follows:</P>
    <P>2.1 The inadequacy of the existing machinery is resulting in many grievances being left to fester although, whatever the ultimate outcome, access to a third party would in most cases satisfy the position.  Employers are increasingly agreeing to <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements but this is generally in situations likely to lead to industrial action.</P>
    <P>2.2 The major limitations in the existing machinery may be summarised as follows:</P>
    <P>(i)  limitation on issues/matters capable of referral to arbitration;</P>
    <P>(ii)  absence of meaningful exchange/mediation facility at conciliation;</P>
    <P>(iii)  slowness/duration of procedures.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>2.3 In general terms the staff panel seeks dispute resolution machinery no less broad in its scope or flexible in its capacity than that available to workers generally through the Labour Court/rights commissioner.  To facilitate in movement in that direction the following specific changes are sought:</P>
    <P>(a)  amendment to enable third party reference of all issues in dispute;</P>
    <P>(b)  access to rights commissioner-type facility for appropriate issues;</P>
    <P>(c)  provision of independent chairperson/facilitator/mediator at conciliation stage.</P>
    <P>2.4 The changes sought are made even more urgent by the industrial <Col N="884" /> relations fall-out of the present economic climate and also the proposed improvements in the machinery and facilities available to those workers who have access to the Labour Court as set out in the Industrial Relations Bill, 1989.</P>
    <P>There is a very fair case to be made here because &mdash; quoting the Minister himself &mdash; in all probability we will be back here to amend this Bill.  Therefore, we should anticipate a harmonisation and improvement in terms of equal access of workers, no matter who their employer, to some type of conciliation machinery such as rights commissioners.  The same document, of which no doubt the Minister has received a copy, contrasts with the position of some categories of workers who are in receipt of similar salaries, some working for voluntary hospitals, some for local authorities/health boards, when the same person with the same skills and on the same pay grade in the dispute can gain access to the Labour Court and rights commissioner while others are bound by the constraints of the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  I contend there is a compelling argument for liberalisation in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to section 23 (1) the definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; is identical to that which permits access to the Labour Court and rights commissioners as at present.  The definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; is much more detailed and restrictive in the general definition used in section 8 for the purposes of a trade dispute.  I will not reiterate all of the arguments advanced in relation to psychiatric workers and why this provision is as it is. Deputy Rabbitte was kind enough not to go through it all and I will not either, except to say that the definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; contained in this section determines those categories of workers who have access to the services of the Labour Court, rights commissioners and the Labour Relations Commission.  It effects no change in the existing definition, but merely brings together a definition which is at present spread over a number of <Col N="885" /> Acts.  In so far as it tidies up that spread, it is useful but does not cover the point made by Deputies.</P>
      <P>The categories of workers excluded from access to the Labour Court and rights commissioners are covered instead by the conciliation and arbitration schemes.  The question of providing access to the Labour Court and other services for such categories is one for discussion and agreement between the parties to the various conciliation schemes.</P>
      <P>A provision is contained in section 23 (5) to allow the definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; be amended by order.  Therefore it does not require the amendment of legislation which, as Deputy Quinn rightly contended, would present difficulty.  In the absence of agreement to the making of an order I am not in a position to effect any amendments to that definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year when I attended a conference of local government and public service workers this issue was raised with me.  I undertook, along with the Department of Finance, to get discussions going on this matter.  The Deputies will be familiar with the many arguments advanced, but, of course, there are differing views.  For example, some people want dual access, others want sole access; some people are quite happy with the conciliation and arbitration scheme; others want access from the conciliation and arbitration scheme to the Labour Court and &mdash; as we observed in this House some years ago &mdash; some people would have liked to uphold their conciliation and arbitration rights which would have suited their cause.  In a few of these cases I have at least endeavoured to have discussions initiated between the parties involved, but if the different parties agree, then the role of the Minister for Labour in this is that he can ensure such access by way of order.  Otherwise it would be a matter for Government approval in individual cases.  That is the provision laid down in this Bill which is not cumbersome.  I do not mind saying that it would be useful if we could tidy up the present divergence of views.  As far as I can, I will endeavour <Col N="886" /> to aid both sides in making some progress in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall confine my comments to amendment No. 75.  Deputy Quinn has correctly broadened it beyond that.  I am not exactly clear to what extent, if any, the Minister is prepared to take on board what has been said.  Just for the record may I correct Deputy Quinn on the very helpful document with which we have been supplied.  The document has been issued by the staff panel of the conciliation and arbitration scheme, not by the LGPSU.  I was a party to the discussion which led ultimately to the very precise and helpful drafting of this document by Philip Flynn who has contacted all of us on what is a very important matter.  If we were just to take it at the level of the rights commissioner service, it is a great pity that the Minister is not more flexible on this.  The rights commissioner, as an institution, is very highly regarded by both sides of the divide in industrial relations.  Time out of number the rights commissioner facility has resolved seemingly intractable disputes. Of all the grievances and deficiencies in the conciliation and arbitration scheme listed by Mr. Philip Flynn in this analysis, the most hurtful in discriminatory terms in 1990 is the refusal of access to the rights commissioner service of so many categories of public servants.</P>
      <P>In my initial remarks I dealt with the exclusion of general trained nurses.  In my view the most serious aspect of that is that there is no outside party to which one can have resort in a dispute.  Usually, the disputes are minor, individual or particular, but in fact there is no outside body to which one can resort, there is no Solomon of industrial relations, who will listen to both sides of the argument and make a decision, which ironically is not binding in Irish industrial relations but which 98 per cent of the time is accepted as binding by both sides of industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have an opportunity now &mdash; and we will not have the opportunity again &mdash; to make that service available to the <Col N="887" /> categories of public servants who are currently excluded, which is very regrettable. I must enter a special plea for general trained nurses because one of my areas of responsibility as a trade union official was for the health services.  Time out of number when the general trained nurses met with a negative from the matron's office or from the secretary-manager, they could have resort to no other forum, although all other categories of health workers could have a similar grievance and have it processed through the machinery of conciliation and arbitration, and the finding in 98 per cent of cases would be accepted automatically by both management and trade unions.  It is a great pity the Minister does not acknowledge the role of the general nurses in our society, because at the end of the day that is what it comes down to.  General trained nurses are still required to do the job that is assigned to them, and to ask no questions.  It goes back to the old ethos in the hospital, which is presided over by the matron and the general nurses are expected to behave as if they are the extension of the schoolgirls they were.  That is entirely wrong. They have the same rights as any other health worker, indeed the Minister knows that better than most and I hope he will accede to the request being made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the view expressed by Deputy Rabbitte about the role of nurses and the quality of the work they do.  There is no question but that they are at the coal face and that they do particularly good work.  Over many decades they have been known for their vocational commitment, which is quite exceptional.  I would have thought, thinking of matron <i>versus</i> nurses relationships, that this is at the individual hospital level and that we cannot do much to influence it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Professor Hillery Professor Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I think both Deputies have raised a very important point about a sizeable part of the workforce having access to the Labour Court while <Col N="888" /> a very sizeable proportion do not have the same access, but they do of course, have access to the conciliation and arbitration machinery.  There is a lot to be said for the conciliation and arbitration schemes and they have been characterised by a very high level of staff side participation and membership.  They have thrown up some very good people for negotiations purposes on the staff side and the machinery generally has shown very considerable resilience over the years even in difficult times.</P>
      <P>Having said that, however, a Minister would need across the board agreement or consensus to move on this.  Deputy Rabbitte makes a special case for a special category, the general trained nurses.  However, I do not think this is the way to approach it as we have tens of thousands of workers who are in the public service conciliation and arbitration scheme, and before a Minister would exercise an order or move on that issue, there should be agreement to move to the Labour Court or to the rights commissioner service.  Consensus, obviously, is of the essence.</P>
      <P>Essentially I am arguing that I do not see it as appropriate in this debate to move unilaterally in respect of one category of worker for access to the Labour Court or to the rights commissioner service but rather I would encourage the two Deputies, who obviously have considerable knowledge in this area, to, in turn, encourage agreement in the public service if it is their wish to gain access to the Labour Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have made it clear that I understand the issues very well.  Deputy Rabbitte said that I worked in an organisation for many years where we encountered the same sort of difficulties as nurses and others.  I understand the protective way people fight for the conciliation and arbitration scheme. Complications arise when we have dual claims &mdash; claims being processed in the Labour Court at one stage, and under the conciliation and arbitration scheme by a different section of the same workforce. It is not easy for the management <Col N="889" /> side either where people are trying to operate both systems.  It is very confusing. I know Mr. Philip Flynn's views because I discussed this issue at the annual conference in open debate, and I have discussed it with some deputations from the union since.  Indeed I facilitated the setting up of some of these meetings to try to get movement on this issue.  I also know the views of the teachers' union on this issue who were in with me over a year ago; and I know the views of some of the public service unions.  Deputy Rabbitte and Deputy Quinn know that too. However, there are some discussions with which I am not up-to-date.  There has to be an agreement between the workers and the Departments in the case of health boards and local authorities and this legislation can very quickly enact by Order whatever they decide.  That is the important point.  I cannot &mdash; and there is no point in indicating otherwise&mdash; implement the rights for a whole section of workers unilaterally.</P>
      <P>If I may, I will deal briefly with the issue of the rights commissioners.  I have no objection in principle to allowing public servants covered by the conciliation and arbitration scheme to have access to the rights commissioner service, provided there was agreement between the parties to the scheme as I said recently in reply to a question.  However, this is a matter for discussion between the Ministers directly concerned.  In the absence of agreement I am not in a position to alter the terms and conditions of the negotiating machinery which is at present in place.  I have taken account of what the Deputies have said and I will continue, to try to help in the process of clarification, because it is not a straightforward issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the constraints the Minister is under in relation to a broad based amendment.  I accept that people on both sides have to be consulted; in fact, that goes without saying.  However, there is a clear request from the representatives of a very large section of local authority workers and from a larger section of workers in the <Col N="890" /> soon to be merged union, set out in amendment No. 77a and notwithstanding the provisions in the section, they would be entitled to have access to the rights commissioner.  As Deputy Rabbitte has already said, the findings of the rights commissioner are not binding on either side, but they have the force of moral authority and their acceptance is quoted by a very high level of acceptance by either side.</P>
      <P>We are going to have to come back to this matter on Report Stage.  I appreciate that the Minister cannot accept this amendment on the floor of the House because it involves other people such as the Minister for the Environment, the Minister for Finance, probably the Minister for the Marine and the Minister for Agriculture and Food in so far as agricultural advisers are involved.  If we are not going to have a Report Stage debate for at least a fortnight, which I understand is the arrangement between the Whips, to facilitate Deputy Mitchell who has been facilitated here all day, I would ask the Minister to get a formal view from the various Departments, notwithstanding their view with regard to the Labour Court which is a different matter, on access to the rights commissioner as a mechanism of quickly resolving internal disputes which would be the source of a lot of personal aggravation and grievance.  That would go a long way to improving the climate of industrial relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many other points to be made on this matter in the period allocated to us, including the role of the Labour Relations Commission.  If the Minister is looking for another <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> he should consider areas that do not necessarily cost money and this is one such area where there is evidence of positive support. Access to rights commissioners has been formally requested by a wide category of workers.  I would like to think that we would ultimately reach the stage where individual workers, no matter who their employer or what conciliation and arbitration scheme they operate under, have <Col N="891" /> ready access to a rights commissioner if they have a personal grievance.  It has been my experience that, instead of going to the trade unions who represent them when people have a grievance, they frequently go to their solicitors because they feel the trade union system is not capable of speedily or effectively representing them.  That is manna from heaven for many solicitors who have no experience of industrial relations law, and before long we are embroiled in adversarial court type actions when what is required is access to a rights commissioner.</P>
    <P>I accept fully that the Minister cannot unilaterally accept the amendment because of the short notice but, given that there are at least two weeks between now and Report Stage, it is not unreasonable to ask him to get the views of the other Departments involved.  If they do not agree with this suggestion, let us put it on the record so that it forms part of the overall debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a distinction here.  Amendment No. 75 deals with a specific area.  Deputy Quinn has proffered his view on the wider question of the excluded categories but my amendment No. 75 relates to the inclusion of a specific category, that is, all nurses, within the scope of this Bill.  Can the Minister tell me how he can justify drawing a distinction between a psychiatric nurse and a general trained nurse?  In my opinion it is not possible to do so.  I do not accept the remarks that have been made about consensus being necessary and the Minister needing time because I know that these discussions have been going on for a very long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is at least three years since the trade union group, under the auspices of the staff side of the conciliation and arbitration scheme, initiated the discussions about the serious deficiencies which are causing such depressed morale in the public service.  There is a measure of <Col N="892" /> agreement between both sides of the conciliation and arbitration scheme but time and again the employers' side advances the law as being the obstacle.  I do not accept this is something that is being sprung on the Minister.  He has been telling us since we started this debate &mdash; and I give him all credit for it &mdash; about the great pains he has gone to in consulting with all sides.  I would respectfully submit that this is also an area on which he could have consulted if he was so minded, because it is a very important area.  I do not believe the Minister's advisers are so minded either.  I think they would prefer to see general nurses excluded because of some paternalistic view of how the health services ought to be operated.</P>
    <P>I have always promised general nurses that if I was ever in a position to espouse their case in this House on this injustice that is being done to them, I would do so.  I do not accept that the Minister needs more notice, because it is not as if one was breaking new ground.  Nursing is becoming more and more a unitary profession and psychiatric nurses have been included since the fifties.  Therefore how can we exclude general nurses?  There is no rational argument for doing so.  The profession is becoming more and more unified &mdash; for example, the whole approach to mental illness has changed enormously, patients who were previously institutionalised are now being located in the community, general trained nurses acquire psychiatric qualifications and <i>vice versa</i>.  It simply is not tenable in rational terms to exclude general trained nurses and therefore I would ask the Minister to take this amendment on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not go through all the detail again but I would repeat to Deputy Rabbitte what I said earlier that categories of workers excluded from access to the Labour Court and the rights commissioners are covered instead by the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  The question of providing access to the Labour Court and other services for such categories as the Deputy suggests is one for discussion and agreement between <Col N="893" /> the parties to the various conciliation schemes and not for the Minister for Labour.  Whether it is the local authorities or the Department of the Environment who are involved, if they do not agree with the Minister for Finance and with the individuals concerned, I can do nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte mentioned discussions of three years ago.  The latest discussions I have had with the Local Government and Public Services Union were at conference time last year and I know they have been involved in discussions since then.  The issue here relates to the way people wish to be represented. Some people want to hold on to everything that is good and not move into other areas while others want access to the conciliation and arbitration scheme, the <Col N="894" /> Labour Court and the rights commissioners but I can see great difficulties in that.  I was the facilitator of those discussions but I cannot make up people's minds for them.  It is a matter for them to decide for themselves.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Quinn has asked, I will certainly urge the Departments concerned to facilitate us in this matter.  I wrote to them on this issue some months ago and I will follow that up but I cannot give a decision now.  Finally, these Departments concede that this Bill is as up to date as it can be in providing for this service.  I would ask the parties in dispute on this issue to resolve their differences.</P>

      <P>RTE have on the whole served us well and lived up to their responsibilities as the national broadcasting service.  Radio 1 has discharged its responsibility to public service broadcasting. It has covered every aspect of national life, minority interests, agriculture, fishing, folklore, the handicapped, islands, language and the Gaeltacht.  It has served and attended every aspect of national life.  It has an efficient network of correspondents in every part of the country.  No area is too far to visit.  They have never been too busy to send a crew to cover a local fleadh or festival and to report back on the national airwaves.  This, of course, is no more and no less than one expects from a national broadcasting service funded by the licence contribution and advertising revenue.</P>
      <P>RTE coverage of events in the Oireachtas has been the essence of impartiality.  I have never heard any one complain about the coverage of debates in this House.  They have always been impartial and objective in their reporting.</P>
      <P>Since its establishment about 11 years ago FM2 has been highly successful in its own right.  It has satisfied a demand, particularly among the young generation, for popular news, pop music and entertainment of that kind.  It has also provided a 24-hour news service for the entire country.  All surveys and scientific data available indicate its impressively huge listenership and popularity.</P>
      <P>Both RTE radio stations complement each other and cater for the demands and tastes of our population.  If one wanted to listen to a chat programme one listened to Radio 1, while if one wanted to listen to pop music one tuned in to FM2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also have Raidió na Gaeltachta under the auspices of RTE to cater for the needs of the Irish language, the people of the Gaeltacht and Irish speakers throughout the country.  It is generally accepted <Col N="901" /> that it has done a very good job through the years.</P>
    <P>In his Dáil contribution last night the Minister read the obituary of FM2.  While we still await the final details of his plan, it is absolutely clear that FM2 is being sacrificed and killed off to make room for Century Radio.  Century Radio was the Minister's own creation.  There was no obvious demand for another national radio station, as we said at the time. Certainly there was a demand for local radio.  Raidió na Gaeltachta is a perfect example of how popular and effective a local radio station can be.  The Minister was not satisfied with merely establishing a network of local radio stations.  He also wanted a new national radio service, so we had the creation of Century Radio.</P>
    <P>Since its establishment Century Radio has gone from crisis to crisis.  A campaign was mounted stating that the dice was loaded in favour of RTE, particularly FM2.  The demand was to level the pitch. What the Minister announced last night is actually the killing off of FM2 as we know it to make room for Century.  The allocation of £3 million to the independent Radio and Television Commission for disbursement in 1990 is questionable.  To put it crudely, £3 million of taxpayers' money is being transferred to private enterprise.  I wonder if this is legal and whether the unsuccessful bidders could have improved their original tenders for the franchise if they had known about this money.  Is this a once-off payment or the thin end of the wedge? Can we expect an annual subvention?</P>
    <P>The <i>coup de grace</i> is contained in part of the Minister's speech last night where he stated as follows:</P>
    <P>The Government have, therefore, decided to ask the new RTE Authority, as a matter of priority, to develop plans for an alternative use of the 2FM network which will be more in keeping with the public service mandate of RTE.</P>
    <P>The Minister elaborated by saying that <Col N="902" /> FM2 will have to concentrate on continental languages, rural and farming sectors, business and trade union affairs, social welfare and a range of special interests and specialist music.  Radio 1 has been providing a service in these very areas for years.  They have been providing programmes such as &ldquo;Farming Journal&rdquo;, &ldquo;Parliamo Italiano&rdquo;, regular French and German language programmes and a programme for emigrants.</P>
    <P>I remember the Minister stating on a number of occasions that RTE broadcast too many chat programmes from 8 a.m. until 6 p.m. FM2 provide the music and the two channels complement each other perfectly.  I do not see any reason to kill off FM2 by providing more public service programmes which are already being provided on Radio 1 in order to facilitate Century.  It is a crude exercise by the Minister to bury FM2 and to give RTE a bloody nose in the process.</P>
    <P>There is another danger for RTE.  Not only will they have to sacrifice £3 million in licence fee revenue but there will be a massive loss of advertising on FM2 if they have to transfer from popular music to the heavier type of programme.  That point must also be considered.  The Minister's announcement last night has made this a dark day for RTE.</P>
    <P>We have not yet had a satisfactory answer as to what is envisaged for Teilifís na Gaeltachta.  The demand was for an independent service located in the area servicing Irish speakers throughout the country.  We envisaged the Irish service having an independent Irish channel of its own.  I feel there is now competition between the third television channel and Teilifís na Gaeltachta for the remaining airways.  It would be unacceptable to those of us in favour of an Irish language television service to have it slotted into Network 2.  In my opinion and that of the Irish language organisations, such a solution would not make anybody happy. Those of us who want an Irish television station would not be happy because we would have to compete on the same channel with those who want to have English language programmes.  Those who are already watching Network 2 would be <Col N="903" /> unhappy because they would regard Irish as taking away from their viewing time.</P>
    <P>Clarification is urgently needed.  The Minister's speech last night is also the obituary of an independent Irish television channel.  I do not know what he has in mind but I implore him to look at it again.  It is our first official language and should have a channel of its own.  I implore the Minister to look at this issue again and to let us know his intentions as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Deputy McGinley for sharing his time with me.  I was not a Member of this House when the Minister introduced the 1987 Sound Broadcasting Bill on 8 December of that year but I have read through his Second Stage speech on that Bill.  It struck me forcibly when reading that speech that at no stage during the debate did the Minister give an indication or warning that he would take the action he is now taking.  I should like to refer to some very interesting sections of the Minister's speech.  On the question of the pool of advertising revenues available to sustain the independent radio services the Minister stated, and I quote:</P>
      <P>It is purely on these considerations therefore, combined with my conviction that radio services do not need a &ldquo;Big Brother&rdquo; type regulation...</P>
      <P>We saw the &ldquo;Big Brother&rdquo; coming to the fore last night and over the past few weeks and he is well and truly with us now.  The Minister continued:</P>
      <P>It will be noted that subsection (5) provides that the services to be provided under this Act are additional to any sound broadcasting services provided by RTE.  In this regard, any involvement by RTE in the provision of additional radio services...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night the Minister told us that he intends to curtail the services of RTE. Like others, I believe he has a warped sense of fair competition.  The Minister said that he wants to level the playing field but in his lemming like chase to do so he has tilted the balance in the other <Col N="904" /> direction.  It is quite clear that Radio 2FM took on the competition and improved the quality of their services and programmes. They went after listenership and have increased their advertising revenue considerably.  In other words, RTE faced up to the competition from the independent radio stations.  However, they are now being punished for doing that work.  I do not believe the Minister is in any way levelling the playing pitch; he is actually tilting it in the other direction. In other words, Radio 2FM had to be nobbled if Century Radio were to get back a share of the market.</P>
    <P>What the Minister was trying to get across in his Second Stage speech was that the introduction of competition would lift the level of broadcasting.  That is what happened but instead of commending RTE for the improvements they made they are now being penalised.  It seems the Minister is saying, &ldquo;as long as Century Radio keep going I do not actually mind about the level and quality of their service&rdquo;.  I do not think that is the way forward.  There is a need to ensure there is an alternative broadcasting station to RTE but not to the extent where the level and quality of the service drops and we have to rob Peter to pay Paul.</P>
    <P>The Minister had an opportunity in his Second Stage speech on the Sound Broadcasting Bill, 1987, to say if the 20 per cent of news time would be a problem for the new stations, whether he would consider looking at the spreading of fees, etc., but all he said was:</P>
    <P>As I have already said I regard the requirement that 20 per cent of broadcasting be devoted to news and current affairs as a key element in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not set down any warning. He made it clear to anybody applying for a licence that 20 per cent of their transmission would have to be devoted to news and current affairs and they had to take this provision on board in the financing of their companies, which I believe many of them did.  I was interested to hear the head of 98FM say this morning that he had not asked for <Col N="905" /> any money, did not know he was getting any money and was quite happy to continue to operate his station without any public money coming into their purse.</P>
    <P>I do not know the reasons behind the Minister's actions but concern has been expressed that the giving out of the licences in the first place may not have been done in as apolitical a way as possible. In my constituency, which the Minister also represents, many of the people who were involved in pirate stations are now involved in the running of legitimate stations.  It is interesting to note that the person who ran Sunshine Radio, probably the best pirate station which existed, could not convince the commission that he was suitable to run a station.  There is a question mark hanging over why he was not considered suitable then and has still not been regarded as suitable to be involved in broadcasting.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has pulled back somewhat on his proposal to cap-off advertising.  Advertising on radio is different from advertising in the newspapers and it is wrong for the Minister to say that if he caps advertising on RTE, suppliers will automatically look to the newspapers or somebody else; this advertising will probably go to UTV and SKY which are widely viewed in this country.  I am pleased the Minister seems to have pulled back somewhat on this proposal but I ask him to look at it again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on tonight's motion has widened very considerably since yesterday and a completely new set of issues has been raised.  The Minister is proposing to give a £3 million grant to commercial radio, the bulk of which in all probability will go to bail out Century Radio.  That is the reality behind the smokescreen of making money available to the Independent Radio and Television Commission.  This is a blatant manoeuvre to bail out a failed capitalist enterprise. Capitalism is all about the survival of the fittest and where the weakest go to the wall.  In this instance, therefore, the weakest should go to the wall.  Why <Col N="906" /> should the Irish taxpayer have to subsidise the likes of Jim Stafford, the Clare Street wrecker?</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael motion put forward by Deputy Jim Mitchell proposes the provision of an interest free loan of £2.25 million to what he describes as &ldquo;alternative radio&rdquo;.  We can manage very well without national commercial radio stations. The Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, would like to see a national TV and radio service operated by RTE, both of which would be funded entirely by a licence fee, the same as the BBC.  The probable collapse of Century Radio has probably diverted the attention of this House and in that respect I am quite happy to vote for the Fine Gael motion which proposes the setting up of an independent review body.</P>
      <P>There is a number of matters such a review body would need to look at.  First, they would need to look at whether our national broadcasting authority, namely RTE, should be allowed to advertise.  I do not think they should be allowed to advertise and this would leave the field open for commercial or preferably community co-operative local radio which would be allowed to raise funds through advertising.  Second, they would need to look at the provision of an independent Irish language TV service.  This matter should be given more consideration than the ridiculous Údarás na Gaeltachta report which stated that the provision of such a service would require a capital cost of £5.2 million and annual running costs of £9.6 million for a service which would run for two hours per night.  These figures are ridiculously high.  I guess this proposal will languish in the cavernous pigeon hole which must by now contain many reports of a similar nature.  If the Minister studied the TV service provided by the Faroe Islands he might learn something to his advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is considerable public disquiet about MMDS and whether it constitutes a danger to health.  There are serious indications that it does and these should be thoroughly investigated prior to the use of this system in Ireland.  Norway will <Col N="907" /> not allow the use of MMDS, probably for very good reasons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I start, I will be sharing my time with Deputy John Dennehy, if that is agreeable.</P>
      <P>Deputy Garland is quite correct when he suggests that the debate has widened somewhat since last night.  I do not think I would agree with anything he said after that.</P>
      <P>The motion has been swept aside by the somewhat hysterical reaction to the Minister's contribution in which he outlined all that has been achieved in the last three years.  First he pointed out the deadlock and the disagreement that existed between Fine Gael and Labour that has been broken.  We have now put on the Statute Book at long last legislation dealing with radio.  The ridiculous situation of the law of the land being flouted by dozens of unlicensed operators has been ended.  Legislative proposals for the licensing of an independent radio and television station have been enacted and the IRTC, the Independent Radio and Television Commission, has been set up. Multiple choice on the airwaves has been introduced through licensed and legitimate stations.  Up to 600 people are now being employed in legally operating stations outside RTE, an additional television channel has been franchised and broadcasting is now a growth industry.</P>
      <P>I do not repeat these points to be pedantic, but it is worth putting on record that since this Minister moved into Communications an extraordinary amount has been achieved.  A revolution has been achieved in broadcasting in this nation. The extraordinary reaction to the statement here last night beggars the imagination. The recital of what has been achieved is, of course, based on logic and logic has very little to do with the hysteria that has been drummed up and that has swept through the debate, through this House and through the media, particularly the broadcast media and the State owned broadcast media since last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reaction to the Minister's decision to allocate a proportion of the licence fee with a defined ceiling to the Independent <Col N="908" /> Radio and Television Commission has been, to say the least, extraordinary.  The trend of the debate on this, in no small way, has been influenced by the extraordinarily distorted coverage of this proposal given by RTE itself.  Talk about vested interest; I listened with incredulity this morning to one of the station's most popular programmes, when one of the station's deservedly most respected broadcasters permitted a most distorted view of the proposals that the Minister has outlined to be propagated.  It is to his discredit that he did that.</P>
    <P>It is worth while, therefore, to dwell on that aspect, and in particular to look at the very positive possibilities that funding the IRTC now opens.  The proposal to allocate a proportion of the licence fee to the IRTC is logical and has a great deal to commend it.  If anybody is seriously interested in logic they will reconsider some of the statements that have been made here.  More important it is a proposal which has such potentially positive aspects that it should commend itself to anybody who is in the least interested in serious broadcasting and in the development of serious broadcasting.  The licence fee is, in effect, a form of tax.  It is a tax which is based on the ownership of a receiver, and that is its unique aspect.</P>
    <P>The wise decision was taken a long time ago that the yield from the fee would be made available to RTE, to the State broadcaster at that time, to cover the obligations of being a public service broadcasting station.  The licence revenue was to supplement income from commercial activities and from advertising. If Deputies who scurried to Dáil debates in the 24 hours since last night wish to go back and look at earlier debates on this issue they will see that that is the precise intention of the licensing fee.  From the very foundation of broadcasting in this State the principle has been established of funding the public service broadcasting element of broadcasting from the licence fee while allowing commercial receipts and advertising revenue to cover other aspects of broadcasting.</P>
    <P>Much of the more hysterical reaction <Col N="909" /> to the Minister's initiative would give the impression that it has been decided to give a handout of £3 million to Century Radio.  That is a distortion and a mistruth and those, whether in RTE or this House, who propagate that know it is a distortion and a mistruth.  This is to seriously misunderstand and misrepresent the Minister's proposals.</P>
    <P>The position is that the moneys in question are to be paid to the IRTC who will be responsible for disbursing it in accordance with criteria which it will be required to draw up and publish.  As was made clear by the Minister last night the basic philosophy behind this initiative is that we, as legislators, impose a series of public service obligations on the broadcasting services established under the 1988 Act.  These obligations include the quota requirements relating to news and current affairs but they also embrace aspects relating to the range and quality of programmes to be provided on the services, including programmes in Irish and relating to Irish culture.  Indeed, RTE have argued continuously over the years for increases in broadcasting licence revenue specifically because of the cost of meeting these very specific requirements.  If we impose similar obligations on independent services then it is totally logical, bearing in mind that plurality of sources of news and information is a cornerstone of any broadcasting policy, that we should support materially the achievement of those objectives.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day it will be the commission that will be responsible solely for the disbursement of the moneys made available to it and, as the Minister made clear last night, it will be totally autonomous and independent of the Government of the day in determining how it will distribute the funds in question.  At the end of the day the commission will have to account fully for the disbursements in the annual reports and accounts which will be laid before this House and thus be debated by this House.</P>
    <P>As regards the various radio stations <Col N="910" /> or, indeed, the proposed television service, each will have to make its own case for any grant and seek to qualify for its grant in accordance with the criteria to be established by the commission.</P>
    <P>I find the expressions of so called shock and horror at the notion of subventing the independent services from licence fee money strange if not bemusing.  First, there is nothing new in the notion of giving grants to areas of the private sector where this is deemed to be in the public interest or where it is desirable in order to achieve certain national policy objectives. Every day of the week the IDA give grants to the private sector to promote employment and development in the manufacturing and services sectors.  Likewise grants are handed out by various other bodies, CTT, FÁS and Bord Fáilte. Nobody finds this principle strange and nobody throws their hands up in shock, or in horror and amazement to suggest that some new Rubicon has been crossed.  Why then should there be such astonishment in this House at the idea that the independent broadcasting sector should have public moneys available to it?  I suggest the answer is simple.  It is a craven attempt to curry favour with a powerful broadcasting organisation.</P>

      <P>I listened to your rubbish without interruption, Deputy.  They too are creating employment as the Minister pointed out last night.  Since 1988 they have provided 600 jobs and they are providing an important service to the public, and the public attest to it every day when they in tune to the independent stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the fact that the source of the revenue is to be the radio and television licence, it is important to stress that RTE has no eternal or God given right to the totality of such revenue.  Indeed, in the strict legal sense RTE is not in receipt of licence fees at all, nor has it any legal claim to them.  The position is that under the Broadcasting Authorities Act, the <Col N="911" /> Minister, with the approval of the Minister for Finance may &mdash; and that is the word used in the Act &mdash; pay the authority out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas a grant equal to the proceeds of the licence fee.  Licence fee revenue goes to the Exchequer like any other tax.  In other words, it is a grant voted each year by this House when it adopts the Estimates of the Department of Communications, that is paid to RTE.  Likewise, any such grant to be paid to the Independent Radio and Television Commission will come before this House and will be voted on by this House and will be subject to the democratic imperative.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal now with some specific points regarding public sector broadcasting. It is important to place on the record the view that public sector broadcasting need not be confined solely to a State owned station.  RTE does a very fine job and I will accept everything that has been said in that regard.  It has done a very fine job in public sector broadcasting since its foundation, but it would be an absolute arrogance for RTE or its supporters to propagate the view that this is an area which is its sole prerogative. There are other forms of public service radio that clearly cannot be provided by RTE.  Specifically, I have in mind the type of radio provided by a real community based radio station.  Community stations can provide a fascinating range of programmes.  They are part of an overall radio environment and they allow for a unique diversity of structure and of content.</P>
    <P>In my own constituency Horizon 94.9FM are operating a real community owned service for Wicklow and south County Dublin.  I do not pretend that it is unique; there are similar stations in operation.  It reaches into the community in a way that RTE could never hope and, to their credit, do not seek to do.  It is developing programmes that address a wide range of special and local interests. Horizon is one of the new independent local stations and, although it is funded through advertising, it is not run for commercial reasons.  It is, therefore, quite a different type of radio station. <Col N="912" /> That is a model of radio that was not thought of or thought possible when Radio Éireann was first established.  That model could not have been envisaged when the system of licensing was put in place.  It is a model of broadcasting that exists now and it is one which could in the future be clearly considered for fund assistance by the IRTC when they are participating in licence fee revenue.</P>
    <P>It is worth pointing out that my constituents who work for, listen to and support Horizon, and the constituents of other Deputies who support similar stations, pay their licence fee and have never suggested how that fee should be spent. Nobody has ever asked them what should be done with that revenue but clearly some have voted with their ears and their fingers when they decide to tune to local rather than national radio.  If in the future the IRTC were to decide that the creativity of a local community station should be freed from commercial fetters, in the same way as RTE's creativity has been freed in the public sector broadcasting domain for many years by licence fees, what is wrong with that?  Congratulations to the Minister on seeking that as a possible use for licence fees.</P>
    <P>There is another possibility for a new and equally exciting breakthrough coming forward from the university sector.  UCD, with Trinity College, Dublin City University, St. Patrick's College and a number of institutes and organisations, are discussing a proposal for a speech based radio station to provide programming opportunities for a wide range of divergent interests, ranging from those concerned with general access to information to potential educational programmes. The proposed station would also provide a wide range of alternative entertainment programmes aiming to reflect the rich cultural heritage and activities of the nation and its capital.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGinley asked if those things were not being done by RTE.  The simple answer is no, they are not because it would take such a massive additional amount of funding, staff and resources that it was impossible for a radio station <Col N="913" /> such as RTE, with all its talents, to achieve. The plan is to broadcast a wide range of special interests but it would go beyond entertainment.  One aspect of the proposal is to provide continuing education in different professional spheres. This service, if it comes on stream, will have three distinct elements.  It will have an educational element with programmes assisting distance education.  It will have information programmes for undergraduate, post-graduate and those at pre-university level.  It will have single and serialisation programmes contributing to personal development.  It will have series designed to contribute to community development and an entertainment, arts and cultural service that will draw on all that is rich in the university sector and bring it beyond the hallowed walls of Trinity, UCD and the other institutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that Deputy De Rossa has to get his name occasionally on the record of the House.  Another element of the proposed service would be an information service to provide background information and analysis to a wide range of current topics, issues and debates.  The institutions involved in producing this truly exciting proposal, in particular the staff of UCD's audio visual centre, are to be complimented on this initiative.  However, it is obvious that an invitation like this will never see the light of day unless there is some funding. Clearly, sponsorship is one element of funding.  Public broadcasting in the United States derives a good deal of benefit from sponsorship but in Ireland sponsorship for this type of expansionary and visionary proposal would not go far enough.  An IRTC with funds could become a real force in broadcasting.</P>
      <P>I have outlined two elements, community radio and the UCD initiative, but they are just two of the possibilities that could be opened up.  I acknowledge that RTE have done a good job and produced programmes of a very high standard.  I acknowledge that they operate in a market which is limited but, at the same time, I must state that there are others with a creative urge in radio and broadcasting. They should be freed from the shackles of pure and absolute commercialism. I am surprised that Deputies opposite regard the idea of commercialism as anathema.  Should they not take the view that broadcasters, other than those who inhabit Montrose, should be allowed to freely express their views with support from the licence fee which now goes in its entirety to RTE?  I am surprised and startled at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's proposals deserve support. They provide us with the opportunity to provide in a small nation a unique and vibrant broadcasting mix ranging from public sector broadcasting, owned by the public service, to community broadcasting, to privately-owned <Col N="915" /> pop stations.  We should not shy away from that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDennehy" hpid="Mr. Dennehy Mr. Dennehy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dennehy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank my colleague for giving me an opportunity to contribute to the debate.  It had been my intention to deal with the motion but events have overtaken that.  It is important that we should consider the position before the Minister took over responsibility for the Department of Communications. Deputy Jim Mitchell can be described as an expert on the period from 1982-1987.  His junior Minister at the time was Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan, a good solid Cork Deputy who was most anxious to move against the pirates and legalise local stations.  However, whether due to an ideological conflict or something else, no action was taken against the pirates for five years.  At that time the law was broken daily and one of those opposing the change announced by the Minister last night worked under the flag of a pirate station.  Now that such people are working for legitimate stations they are given an opportunity to voice their opinions on national radio.</P>
      <P>I was surprised to hear Deputy Mitchell getting involved in this issue.  The Minister told us of the changes that have taken place since he took office.  The local stations are independent of the national network.  Many people have referred to Century Radio as if that was the only station involved, but that is not the position.  Radio South and County Sound are operating in Cork and Radio Cork will shortly be on the air as they are taking up the franchise which WKLR had previously.</P>
      <P>This is about local community radio and assisting local effort.  It is in total contrast to the previous system where people were unregistered and nobody knew how many people were working in a given area.  We have now legalised these radio stations and it has emerged that there is a need for funding for these stations, not just for Century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's proposal is to hand over £3 million to the national commission for distribution because they allot the franchises for the various areas and are <Col N="916" /> in charge of monitoring and conducting radio stations.  They will be quite capable of handling the money and distributing it properly.  It was most unfair of Deputy Garland and others to say that the money would be given to Century Radio because the Minister was quite specific in pointing out that it will go to the commission to ensure that these companies do not go to the wall.</P>
    <P>Deputy Roche was right in saying that anybody going into the service industry will, rightly, get financial support.  Up to now, not alone did we not give financial support to these groups, we imposed restrictions on them so that they could not run a viable operation.  The restrictions on what they produced added to their costs.  Public service obligations were very strict.  There was a lot of discussion on them at the time but it was felt, in the interests of the public, that these obligations should be imposed and it has now emerged that many of the stations could be in difficulties if they do not get financial assistance.  It is right that a portion of the money paid by the public through licence fees should be granted to everyone providing the service as there is an audience for all stations.</P>
    <P>I am a strong supporter of RTE, it is a tremendous State body but I should not like to see them over-reacting.  They have done an excellent job; 2FM were initially set up to compete with the pirate radio stations because the then Government failed to regularise the situation.  The station have now done the job &mdash; if they took some of the pirates on board, so be it &mdash; but it is now time to review their progress.  The Minister is asking the new RTE Authority to evaluate the situation to see if the station should be changing direction.  Indeed, they probably will change direction as there is a need to do so.</P>
    <P>Every country in Europe has private radio stations, which is good because there is need for competition.  I am quite sure that they get a portion of the licence fees and this is right because they need encouragement.  I would prefer to have them operating legitimately instead of the previous system.  Many allegations <Col N="917" /> have been made, including one by the Leader of the Labour Party.  However, they lack credibility because Deputy Spring said this morning that this legislation and ideas were plucked from the air and were unheard of up to last night. A list of pending legislation was circulated on 25 April which included this Bill.  It proves that the Leader of the Labour Party was unable &mdash; or did not have time &mdash; to read this list or that he was ill-advised.  At any rate, it discredits everything he said.  The carry-on this morning was unfortunate but it is par for the course.</P>
    <P>If the public wish to assess the various arguments they will have to look at the record from 1982-87 and compare it with what the Minister has done since.  We have a very solid section of RTE in Cork and I appeal to all those employed &mdash; who are all competent and professional &mdash; not to over-react.  There is an obvious role for them and there is also a need to provide the kind of service which the Minister mentioned last night.  He referred to five or six areas which we all know are not adequately covered at present.  They are weak areas and they need a firmer base and more time to develop.  In this context the position of Radio 2 FM should be looked at again.  I do not have a complaint about the amount of music they play but the overall position of the station needs to be evaluated. It was set up ten or 11 years ago, it has carried out the task for which it was set up and it is time for a review which can be carried out by the new Authority.</P>
    <P>Deputy Garland and others made the crazy allegation that we would be putting £3 million into somebody's pocket.  We have heard that kind of rubbish before in this House and it has invariably been proved wrong.  The difficulty is that it will be reported in the media and the trouble is that when you throw enough mud some of it will stick.  It is an attack on private enterprise which should not go unchallenged and it is the kind of allegation which damages the country.</P>
    <P>I was a State employee for 25 years and I always supported the involvement <Col N="918" /> of the State in industry and commerce but we also need the private sector.  I ask Deputy Garland to reconsider his allegation that named individuals will line their pockets.  It is a logical approach to allocate a portion of this money right across the board.</P>
    <P>Opposition Deputies have avoided mentioning the number of jobs which have been created since the Minister legitimised the area of broadcasting. There are 600 jobs in it at present and if any other sector was subjected to the vicious attack to which the area of broadcasting has been subjected the smaller parties particularly would be screaming for blood.  They would say it was an attack on the working men and women. However, there is no merit in their attacks on the broadcasting system.  By innuendo, every single person working or supporting local or national radio stations is at fault.  It is pathetic and it should not have been said.</P>
    <P>Local radio stations should be further strengthened because they have a vital role to play in the future.  They will need financial encouragement in many areas but we should not all be locked into this argument because there is more to broadcasting than RTE, Century or anybody else.  I should like to see a far greater emphasis on local radio, particularly in regard to financial support, because it has been successful.  Many broadcasters in local stations are very familiar to those in their own area although in many cases people do not know if they broadcast nationally or locally; they just broadcast on the station to which they listen.  We should encourage community effort instead of attacking it in this House. People should reconsider the wild allegations they made today and I hope that, when the temperature cools and the promised Bill is introduced in the next couple of weeks, there will be a more enlightened debate on the whole topic.</P>

      <P>I move the following amendment:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Irish language services&rdquo; and to substitute the following;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and, pending the report, to:</P>
      <P>(a)  protect the public service broadcasting role of RTE, by ensuring that there is no reduction in the revenue available to the station from either advertising or licence revenue, and</P>
      <P>(b)  take all reasonable steps to ensure the continued operation of the national and commercial radio stations which have been established since the enactment of the Radio and Television Act, 1988.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I understand that this amendment standing in the names of members of my party, is acceptable to the Fine Gael Party.  That being the case, while we will seek to press our amendment, I should say we will be supporting the substantive motion, as amended by us.</P>
      <P>Having said that, The Workers' Party cannot help feeling that the proposal for the establishment of an independent review body &mdash; as advocated in the main motion &mdash; is five years too late.  The die has been cast by the terms of the Radio and Television Act, 1988.  We contend it would have been far better to have established a review body in advance of that legislation, something we suggested at that time.</P>
      <P>On the Second Stage of the Sound Broadcasting Bill, 1987, our party leader, Deputy De Rossa, made the point that it was incumbent on us to establish a commission on broadcasting.  I quote his remarks from column 1808, volume 377, of the Official Report of 10 February 1988:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is needed and which should have preceded this Bill but which at the very least should be done in tandem with the Bill &mdash; I am talking specifically <Col N="920" /> about the Sound Broadcasting Bill rather than the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill &mdash; is a commission on broadcasting with specific terms of reference which would put broadcasting policy, issues of culture and public policy at the head of their list and questions of cables, frequencies and licences at the bottom of their list.</P>
    <P>Such was the anxiety of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael to open up what they perceived to be a lucrative, profit-making area to their supporters, the issue was never properly thought out.  The process of the emasculation of RTE and the public broadcasting ethic &mdash; which began with the passage of the 1988 Act &mdash; has been brought much further by the Minister's sweeping decisions announced last evening.</P>
    <P>The past 12 months have brought a cold dose of reality to the circumstances surrounding commercial broadcasting. As many people have discovered to their cost, it is not that easy to run a successful radio station at local or national level. We believe that the real demand among listeners was for local rather than commercial radio, as such.  When the Radio and Television Bill came before the Dáil we urged that RTE should have been developed, with a network of local community stations established under their umbrella, to meet the demand for local radio and affording listeners a genuine choice.</P>
    <P>However, neither Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael nor the Progressive Democrats were prepared to give RTE that chance. Rather they pushed through a Bill supposed to serve all purposes &mdash; to guarantee listening choice, provide generous profits for those involved, make no demands on the taxpayer.  Of course it has not worked out like that at all and several stations now face real difficulties.</P>
    <P>Although we advocated a different approach we take no pleasure in the difficulties now being faced by a number of these stations.  It would be regrettable if any of these stations went to the wall when jobs would be lost and listening choice reduced.  It would be particularly <Col N="921" /> sad if Century Radio were to close.  While clearly they made many mistakes, and found to their cost that running a national radio station requires more skill, management and expertise than running a pop concert or managing a show band, unlike a number of local stations they at least made an effort to provide something other than non-stop pop and patter.  They also made a real effort to provide a genuine news service.  Their news service, in particular, is first-class, comparing well with RTE in this regard.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I want to stress that we are totally and utterly opposed to the proposals announced last evening by the Minister to divert £3 million in licence revenue to the private stations, to cap RTE's advertising revenue and effectively end 2FM's role as a popular music station.  These moves have nothing to do with providing a better broadcasting service to the listening public.  Rather they are all about settling scores with RTE, providing public money to rescue a handful of mainly rich investors in private radio, many of whom have close political connections with Fianna Fáil judging by the results of their commercial misjudgment and mismanagement.  This is not about levelling the playing pitch; these proposals are about levelling RTE.</P>
    <P>I might quote the radio columnist of <i>The Irish Times,</i> Mr. Michael Cunningham, who wrote in yesterday's edition of that paper &mdash; as it turned out with great foresight since his comments preceded the Minister's announcement:</P>
    <P>I'd love to meet the person who coined the term &ldquo;uneven playing pitch&rdquo; to describe the effects on the market of RTE's dual funding by licence fees and advertising revenue... This attempt to level the playing pitch is a polite euphemism for penalising RTE &mdash; the station has been too successful, according to those broadcasting landscape gardeners, who want to do some ruthless bulldozing and pruning.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that RTE are being <Col N="922" /> penalised, not only for being commercially successful but for being genuinely independent in their news and current affairs broadcasting and declining to act as a public relations agency for the Government.  Fianna Fáil have never moved far from the attitude expressed by the late Seán Lemass in 1966 when he described RTE as &ldquo;an instrument of public policy and, as such, responsible to the Government&rdquo;.  Ironically, the then Taoiseach was speaking in the Dáil about a complaint by the then Minister for Agriculture, none other than Deputy Charles Haughey, that RTE were not giving his statements more weight than those of the IFA.</P>
    <P>Clearly the Taoiseach has a long memory and has been biding his time.  He has promoted the ludicrous assertion, in Government and in Opposition, that The Workers' Party somehow had some sinister control or influence over RTE. Members of Fianna Fáil have been making it clear in private for a long time &mdash; nobody more so than the Minister for Communications &mdash; that they believed they were getting a hard time from RTE and were only awaiting the opportunity to get even.  Clearly the crisis in Century Radio has afforded them that opportunity. That is no basis for any national broadcasting policy.</P>
    <P>By diverting £3 million of public money to assist private-owned stations &mdash; established only for the purposes of making profits for their owners &mdash; the Minister for Communications has shown himself to be the ultimate radio pirate; henceforth he will be known to us all as buccaneer Burke.  The Workers' Party have no wish to see any commercial radio station go off the air, but why should it be RTE and licence payers who must bail out failed business ventures?  If unsuccessful stations need financial assistance for a limited period to get on their feet why should that not be done by imposing a levy on successful stations in the private area, some of whom are reported to be making substantial profits?  Most of all, how does that square with those sentiments we hear from Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats about the free <Col N="923" /> market being allowed take its course? Surely propping up unsuccessful business ventures with public money interferes with this great free market?  Is it not ironic, at a time when there is a Bill before the Dáil providing for the abolition of Fóir Teoranta &mdash; a body established to help rescue unsuccessful industrial concerns &mdash; the Minister should be promising new legislation to help rescue unsuccessful radio ventures?  To all of those Deputies who suggest there are parallels for what is happening in this area in the private sector, with the IDA hand-out &mdash; I would say there is no other example of unsuccessful private enterprise being propped up by direct robbery of resources of a public sector body working in the same area.  There is no comparison anywhere else in the industrial policy of this Government of taking the money out of the pocket of RTE and handing it over to the private sector when it will simply figure on the balance sheet of the private concern.</P>
    <P>Of course, the channelling of £3 million in licence fees will not have been the first tranche of public money to have been diverted to the commercial radio sector. Last year the Minister intervened to compel RTE to reduce the fee they were to charge Century Radio for transmission facilities from approximately £1 million &mdash; which RTE said was the true cost &mdash; to approximately £400,000.  In other words, Century Radio have already received a subsidy of approximately £600,000 from public funds.</P>
    <P>The decision of the Minister to take powers to cap RTE's advertising revenue clearly will have major implications for programming and is bound to threaten jobs at the station.  The outgoing Chairman of the RTE authority, Mr. Jim Culliton, stated clearly, following the recent publication of RTE's draft accounts, that any further cutback in income &ldquo;could result in a very significant reduction in programming, quality and quantity.  You cannot produce a consistently good programme schedule without sufficient cash&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In taking this action the Government are responding to pressure not only from <Col N="924" /> commercial radio stations but also from newspapers, national and local.  The assumption on the part of the newspapers seems to be that if RTE advertising, especially television advertising is curbed, those advertisers will have recourse to other outlets.  In fact what is likely to happen is that advertisers will seek other television outlets, such as UTV, HTV and some of the satellite channels, which are now received over a wide area of this country.  This will mean Irish money and jobs going out of the State.  It may also mean that more advertising will go to the new independent channel, TV3 whenever it is set up and this, indeed, may be the long term strategy involved in the Minister's current moves.  The fact is that curbing advertising on RTE will not deliver one more listener for the commercial radio stations, or one more reader for the newspapers. Indeed we have heard pleas for assistance from the newspapers before, particularly in the mid eighties, when they urged successive Governments to reduce the level of VAT on newspapers. The Government responded eventually, but what happened then?  First, the papers did not reduce their prices by the full amount of the VAT reductions, and within a matter of months they were back up to their original price structures.</P>
    <P>The most extraordinary part of the Minister's position is that relating to 2FM.  It has been widely acknowledged that 2FM have been particularly successful in recent years &mdash; too successful it seems for the begrudgers in Fianna Fáil, and now the Minister seems determined to destroy them.  This move is particularly ironic as it is not too long since we heard the very same Minister complaining there was too much talk on RTE.  The transformation of 2FM into the sort of information channel envisaged by the Minister will be a double blow to RTE.  First, a channel of this nature will be more expensive to operate and second, there will be a decline in advertising revenue.</P>
    <P>Everyone knows that popular music stations attract the large numbers of <Col N="925" /> young people whose attention advertisers are trying to catch.  It is the simplest and most successful formula on radio.  That is why virtually all of the commercial stations concentrate to such a degree on popular music and why none is broadcasting the sort of cultural, educational and information programmes the Minister now envisages for 2FM.  I am all in favour of RTE extending their broadcasting in these areas, but not at the expense of 2FM.  Indeed the network on which such programmes could be developed is already there in the FM3 channel, which is very much under used at present.  If the Minister was seriously interested in developing RTE's range of programmes then he should expand FM3, leave 2FM alone and use the revenue they earned from the popular format to pay for these education and information programmes.</P>
    <P>It would, I think, be reasonable to expect 2FM to be subject to the same requirement as the commercial stations regarding a minimum amount of news and current affairs programmes.  I understand that RTE have indicated that they would be quite willing to do this, but it must also be said that many of the commercial stations are not meeting the requirement in this regard.</P>
    <P>What is happening is the effective privatisation of 2FM.  Far from being offered a level playing pitch, RTE are being shown the red card and the most lucrative part of the pitch is being left for the exclusive use of the financial backers of Fianna Fáil.  Those who came up with the notes to bankroll successful election campaigns for Fianna Fáil are now being rewarded with a bonanza payment to beat all bonanza payments.</P>
    <P>RTE have done a good job in recent years.  Despite reducing staff numbers they have continued to improve their services, especially in radio.  When the decision came to award the contract for the televising of the Dáil, the same spite and pique was used to award it totally to a company who are unproven, who have no track record in this area at all.  We saw a repeat of this spite and pique recently <Col N="926" /> when the decision was taken at the behest of Government to allow a private company to film the visit of Nelson Mandela to this House on 2 July 1990 to the exclusion of RTE who had made a special request to film the event.  This was awarded despite the fact that Windmill Lane had asked for the three months of October, November and December 1990 to get into training to be ready for the 1991 budget day deadline.  For some odd reason they have now been told that on 2 July they are welcome to come into this Chamber, to the exclusion of RTE, to film Mr. Nelson Mandela's arrival, even though it has not been settled that RTE will be in a position to rebroadcast that visit to the nation.  A great opportunity may well be lost and it is simply another example of the spite and pique that exists in this Government towards the national broadcasting agency.</P>
    <P>The campaign being waged by Fianna Fáil against RTE and brought to a culmination in the Minister's announcement last night, is unjustifiable in every respect. When the promised legislation is brought before the Dáil The Workers' Party will fight it section by section and line by line.  I promise the Minister and the Government a long hot summer.</P>

      <P>A debate on broadcasting policy at any time is to be welcomed but who would have anticipated &mdash; indeed there has been great shock &mdash; the Minister's decision on behalf of the Government to divert £3 million from the broadcasting licence fee to the independent media?  The Minister has also indicated that he will be asking the RTE authority to consider an alternative use for 2FM to provide comprehensive public service programmes.  I understand that consideration of a Government proposal to link 2FM and Century Radio has been shelved &mdash; perhaps this would have been the best way to deal with the matter &mdash; if they were to provide programmes in the area of education, the teaching of continental languages as well as cultural, trade union and farming activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to two issues that particularly affect my own county: first the <Col N="927" /> refusal of the Minister to grant Cork local radio permission to extend their broadcasting hours at weekends, at the time when private groups were seeking licences and were granted franchises to broadcast.  Cork local radio, as Deputy Dennehy has acknowledged is very professional. Indeed one has to agree that the standard of both national and local coverage on Cork local radio was exemplary. The level of support it enjoyed from Cork city and county has indicated that quite clearly.  The decision last night is coming as a great shock to the people and it is tantamount to a vote of no confidence in Cork local radio &mdash; a station that could be said to be impartial and balanced in their reporting and in the presentation of their programmes &mdash; and a vote of no confidence in the second largest city in the State.</P>
    <P>The radio station, County Sound 103, are situated outside my own back door. They first broadcast as a community radio station but within weeks of being granted a franchise they joined with a consortium and were granted a licence to broadcast in County Cork.  Let me say that representatives of the Government party were brought on radio and in some instances they were given up to 15 minutes uninterrupted broadcasting time and this certainly in my view is in breach of section 9 of the Radio and Television Act, 1980 which outlines the broadcasting treatment of current affairs including matters which are either of public controversy or the subject of current public debate.  The Government representatives were brought on to debate subjects which are issues of current public debate and little time was allocated to the main Opposition party but as far as I can say there was no question of balanced or impartial reporting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am deeply grateful to Deputy McCartan and The Workers' Party for sharing their time and allowing me time to make a few points.  I wish to comment on the Labour Party's position on what has been taking place here this evening and last evening.  Reference has been made to the position taken by Deputy O'Sullivan, by me and by others during the period 1982-87.  In those years we defended public service broadcasting for some well known reasons that we outlined.  We spoke about the tradition of broadcasting, and this evening I will just say a couple of things about that.</P>
      <P>There is such a thing as the ethos of broadcasting and the ethos of making money.  The people who had been part of the ethos of making money found that when they went into broadcasting they were not able to make money so easily. Having distilled everything we have heard this evening down to its elements, what is being said is that, having had a free run at independent broadcasting and having failed to capture a listening audience, the Minister has decided to give those stations part of the licence fee. Deputy Roche is not sure whether it is a licence fee or a tax.  If it is a tax, why not abolish the licence fee?  You cannot apply the same logic as Deputy Roche and then just walk away from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting that on 20 November 1987 the present Minister, Deputy Ray Burke, when speaking about broadcasting and the funding of the broadcasting regulatory authority, said: &ldquo;It would be unacceptable to provide public moneys to finance a new broadcasting regulatory authority.&rdquo;  At that time the House was told that there would be a public service component, that there would be definite requirements in <Col N="929" /> relation to what the stations would be able to broadcast.  Have people now suddenly discovered that the operation of these stations is more costly than they had thought or have their friends said: &ldquo;We did not find it as easy as we thought&rdquo;?  The announcements that have been made are dishonest.  This is not simply about deregulation; it is about attacking RTE.  The attack on RTE, by taking part of the licence fee, goes much further.  I challenge the Minister to say when in history a Minister for Communications has told a radio station what they could broadcast.  For example, in the case of 2FM he decided that youth culture is a good area for the private sector and told them he was pushing them off the air in that area.  That is what this debate is all about.  It is not about the plurality of broadcasting or the other hocus-pocus nonsense that Deputy Roche and others were talking about.</P>
    <P>RTE were told they were not doing enough to win advertising revenue but they then found out they could do so. Now this deregulating Minister, this private enterprise person of the free market, is telling 2FM that they are not free to get advertising but if they have any money to spare, there is a whole list of areas that are dear to good old Fianna Fáil's heart such as traditional music, foreign languages and, at the end of the list, Irish, which we believed in at one time.</P>
    <P>As Deputy McGinley and others have pointed out, the Minister hinted last night at the depth of the Taoiseach's commitment made during the election campaign to the people of the Gaeltacht that there would be a Teilifís na Gaeltacht.  It is very clear now that the Irish language will be used again as a stick to beat Network 2, freeing up TV 3 for the commercial opportunities that are there.  This is supposed to be healthy broadcasting and is supposed to be creating jobs and so on. With my limited experience of broadcasting, I was disgusted to hear Deputy Roche and others speak about broadcasting as an activity, as if it was the production of any other commodity.  The companies are in trouble because they <Col N="930" /> did not understand or respect the nature of broadcasting.</P>
    <P>There is only one other freedom that the Minister can interfere with.  Maybe he will be able to force the people to listen to the radio stations he is recommending or to force them to view the television stations he wants them to view. That is the kind of hugger-mugger we have been listening to tonight and last night.  I want to say on behalf of the Labour Party that when the Minister brings in the legislation we will be reading out his speeches to him and will be telling him that that shower over there who stand up and pay tributes to RTE and so on are a disgrace&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Communications, on the basis of what he said last night, will be seeking what I can only call unprecedented controls over broadcasting in this country.  I find something sinister about this.  I find it all the more sinister when I remember that this Minister in 1988 wanted to keep wide powers in his own hands.  Fortunately at the time Fianna Fáil were in a minority and we were able to prevent them doing that. There is an independent commission, although I have a feeling the Minister would like to clip even their wings.  Now, <Col N="931" /> propped up by the Progressive Democrats, one time <i>émigrés</i> from the Fianna Fáil Party, the Minister is trying again to gain more control and we can only speculate on what the reasons for this are.</P>
      <P>The issue before us this evening is a very straightforward one.  We simply cannot allow a blundering Minister to do irreparable damage to our national broadcasting station.  We have to stop him.  I would say quite sincerely that Progressive Democrat Deputies who left Fianna Fáil because they had enough of stroke politics should think very long and hard on the consequences of what they do tonight before they vote for what can only be called the stroke of the century.</P>
      <P>The Minister bungled the setting up of national independent radio.  We remember the haste with which that legislation was brought forward.  We remember the long arguments that took place before the Minister would agree to an independent commission of any kind.  In view of that, Century Radio have a case for a once-off State injection to assist them with their present problems, if that can be done, but no more than that.  I say that without the slightest hesitation because other companies in the past have received assistance from the State, even when there was not the slightest suggestion that the State was in any sense to blame or that legislation led people into error or induced people to make investments that were not entirely justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there is no case for the Minister to take a slice off the licence fee revenue for an indefinite period to prop up independent radio.  I can inform the House &mdash; I think other Members will have also realised this during the course of the day &mdash; that some independent radio operators find the whole idea ludicrous. Even people who stand to benefit from this vague measure the Minister has put forward find the whole thing nonsensical in the context of independent radio. There cannot be a case for the Minister, who is after all supposed to be the people's guardian of RTE, to systematically damage that State enterprise. It is all the more tragic that the Minister <Col N="932" /> intends to do that when there is a State enterprise which, thanks to the enlightened policies of my colleague, Deputy Jim Mitchell, when in Government, has worked its way into a basically healthy and sound position.  They did that in the face of determined opposition from Deputies now on those benches over there who thought at the time that the very idea of getting State enterprises to cover their costs was anathema.  There is no case to injure or to damage an enterprise that has gone through all that and has produced a situation where it can live in a healthy and competitive environment. So far as I can remember, there is no example in the history of this State for a Minister to set out deliberately to undermine a State company.  RTE belongs to the people of this country.  It is ours, it has served us well and it deserves, at least, fairness from the Minister and from our Legislature.</P>
    <P>The Minister, it seems, will be asking the Dáil and the Oireachtas to give him the power to curb RTE's advertising in terms of both price and time.  That is utterly wrong.  It will harm RTE, jobs will be lost, quality will suffer, it will produce no advantage for independent television or for independent radio or for the print media, but it will produce extra revenue for UTV.  I bear UTV no ill will, but it is no part of our function in this House gratuitously to hand over to UTV advertising revenue that could be spent within this State.  I am informed, the Minister refuses to see the people who represent the advertising industry who could tell him what happens in the real world and outside the Cabinet room or the council rooms of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>We will oppose that legislation when it is brought in here.  We will oppose every single bit of it that will damage RTE, or that is so misguided as to make a present of advertising revenue to a television station outside our jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>There is about this whole affair a smell of sharp practice and, indeed, corruption by the Minister.  He has had the opportunity to clear that up and he has patently failed to do so.  The Minister this afternoon compounded further the damage <Col N="933" /> in his announcement of the new RTE Authority.  The new Authority is, to a very large extent, a Fianna Fáil solution to a Fianna Fáil problem.</P>

      <P>Speaking of hookery, it is worthwhile for this House to recall the recent history of this issue.  On 12 February last in a speech in Cork I revealed that the Minister for Communications was seeking ways to divert money from RTE to independent radio. The Minister gave no television or radio interviews on that day, but a statement was issued from his Department and reported in all newspapers the following day.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> on 13 February 1990 under the headline &ldquo;Dept. denies plan was to aid Century with TV fee&rdquo;. stated:</P>
      <P>Communications Minister Ray Burke last night strongly denied Mr. Mitchell's claims, saying they were &ldquo;without foundation ...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On the same day &mdash; 13 February 1990 &mdash;<i>The Irish Times</i> under the headline &ldquo;TD insists subsidy to Century sought&rdquo; stated:</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the Minister last night described Mr. Mitchell's statement as &ldquo;without foundation and having no basis in fact&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the same day the <i>Cork Examiner</i> under the headline &ldquo;Burke: no TV cash for Century&rdquo; reported on the matter.  The <i>Irish Press</i> on 13 February 1990 &mdash; truth <Col N="935" /> in the news, Fianna Fáil organ &mdash; also carried the story under the heading &ldquo;Burke `leaning on RTE' to give Century licence aid&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>More seriously, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I tabled questions to the Minister which were due for answer in this House on 27 February 1990, so did some other Deputies, who did not understand the nuances of the situation as well as I did. The Minister on that day &mdash; I refer to columns 544 to 546 of the Official Report &mdash; in reply to those questions said:</P>
    <P>Neither I nor my Department have made any proposals, formal or informal, to RTE to divert income to any independent radio station.</P>
    <P>On that day I had the temerity to say &mdash; in what I understand was parliamentary language &mdash; I had reason to believe the Minister was misleading this House.</P>

      <P>The Minister and his party have earned the censure and anger of this House.  Over the coming weeks and months he will pay for his contempt and for the corrupt perversion of RTE and for his attempts to influence the independent broadcasting sector.  I know that some of what the Minister proposes has some allure for the print media because they do have their own difficulties.  The capping of RTE advertising revenue&mdash; prospective capping sometime in the future &mdash; may benefit the print media and if it can be done that way and if it has that effect no one would be more happy than I because I understand and know the problems of the print media.  When in Government we reduced VAT on advertising to 10 per cent, and perhaps it should be reduced further.  Do not let that lure the print media into silence on this issue, because in any democracy the vitality and health of that democracy depends on a free and impartial media. Let it be clear and let it go out from this House tonight that there will be no cooperation of any sort in dealing with this legislation.  It will be fought line by line on Second Stage, on Committee Stage and on Report Stage.  We will table as many amendments as we see necessary to remove perversity and corruption from the proposed Bill.  We will do everything in our power to put roadblocks in the way of the Minister's unethical bulldozers.</P>

      <P>Under the 1969 Act the Labour Court is enabled to investigate a dispute when conciliation has been held and the parties request it to investigate. One of the main reasons for the establishment of the commission is to ensure that as many issues as possible are settled without recourse to the Labour Court and this has to be reflected in the legislation. The amendment proposed would have the effect of maintaining the present situation whereby disputes can be referred readily for formal investigation to the court.</P>
      <P>The wording in the amendment proposed by Deputy O'Sullivan would create the same difficulties in interpretation which arose with an earlier wording in the proposals which required the parties to make bona fide attempts at settlement. The words &ldquo;made a genuine attempt&rdquo; could also give rise to disagreements as to whether or not an attempt at settlement has been made.  The wording in the Bill requiring the commission to be satisfied that no further efforts on its part will advance the resolution of a dispute gets over the difficulty of interpretation. If operated flexibly and in a common sense way, as is the intention, the provision should not give rise to problems while at the same time making it clear that as many disputes as possible should be settled at conciliation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat unhappy about the thrust of this section and the way it is being interpreted in so far as it seems to remove from parties to a dispute the possibility of having access to the court and they will have to go through the commission.  A lot depends on how the commission will function and how it is perceived in the industrial relations culture.  That culture will take some time to develop and I have no doubt that during that time there will be many test <Col N="944" /> cases and litigation.  Will the Minister explain to the House why he wants to curtail access to the courts which, in effect, will restore the <i>status quo?</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that the court is resorted to too early in the process and that more work could be done in some instances at the conciliation stage.  This raises the wider question of the role of the Labour Relations Commission. As we have no track record on how they will conduct their affairs it is important that we should have a discussion on the topic referred to in the amendment.  I do not have a definite disposition on whether the amendment is necessary but the Minister ought to address the questions it raises.</P>
      <P>The conciliation service of the Labour Court has served us well, despite some reservations expressed in certain areas. One could describe the Labour Relations Commission as a good solution but one could follow that by asking, what is the problem?  However, it is important to put on record that the conciliation service has served us well.  It is usual that if the matter in dispute proceeds to the court at an earlier stage than we would like, it is because both parties to the dispute want a forum at which a finding will be made rather than requiring the parties to voluntarily agree at conciliation.  On occasions it can be helpful to take the agreement out of the voluntary arena and to have it referred, by agreement, to the court where a finding is made and, in 99 per cent of cases, is automatically accepted.  I have an open mind on the amendment but I should like to hear the Minister's response to the points raised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I withdrew my amendments because the Minister met most of my points in his amendment.  We do not want every dispute ending up in the Labour Court with the agreement of both parties to be followed by a call to the Minister to intervene in the dispute.  That was the case for too long and it undermined labour relations.  One of the better developments in the last ten years is that Ministers do not intervene in disputes <Col N="945" /> very often.  Ministerial intervention should only take place in exceptional circumstances, such as in the case of the Waterford Glass dispute.</P>
      <P>It would be bad if the new Labour Relations Commission were bypassed frequently.  That should only be done if the commission have exhausted their conciliation efforts or if the circumstances of the dispute are so exceptional that they should be bypassed.  The Minister's proposal goes a long way to meet the points raised in the amendments before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quinn has asked me to explain the procedures and I will endeavour to do so without taking up too much time of the House.  The establishment of the commission has four principle objectives, first, to give a new general responsibility for the promotion of good industrial relations to the appropriate body; second, to encourage and facilitate a more active approach to dispute prevention resolution; third, to seek to restore the original purpose and status of the court investigation and recommendations; and, fourth, to make provision for a number of new functions and services.</P>
      <P>The debates on the 1946 Act make interesting reading for many reasons. They explain clearly why our predecessors felt that the court should be an appeal of last resort.  Many of the arguments advanced then are compelling today.  The intention was that the court should be something special and final. The debates explain how our predecessors felt the conciliation machinery should develop.  That was developed in other minor Acts, such as the 1969 Act. The workload, new procedures and developments, require that there should be a professional facility to deal with current disputes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who sat at the Cabinet table, and Deputy Rabbitte who was involved in disputes from a different perspective, will accept that there are lessons to be <Col N="946" /> learned from every dispute.  It is important that they are followed up.  I mentioned before that the same files tend to pass the desks of the Labour Court, the conciliation service and Ministers for Labour.  One often wonders if the lessons learned in disputes made any difference to later disputes.  One could ask if the reasons for disputes in the sixties were the same for disputes in the eighties, and I have no doubt that the same reasons will surface in disputes in the nineties.  It is important that people work on good industrial relations and learn from other disputes.  I agree with Deputies that the conciliation service has served us very well and the Bill does not seek to downgrade that service.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The court has served industrial relations well.  However, it is clear that there is a change in the structure and approach to our conciliation service. It is important that the court should be the final authoritative tribunal in industrial relations and it was always intended that that should be the case. The establishment of the new Labour Relations Commission, separate from the court, will enable them to adopt a central role in guiding and encouraging the parties concerned to make the necessary improvements in structures, practices and procedures.  The fact that they are made up of the social partners means that the best people on both sides will be involved.</P>
    <P>Section 26 states that the courts may not investigate a trade dispute until the Commission have endeavoured, without success, to resolve it.  The section also requires the commission to provide a report to the court giving it all the relevant information in relation to the dispute and the attempts to resolve it.</P>
    <P>Someone suggested earlier that the flexibility which has existed up to now might now be removed.  That is not the case.  The chairman of the commission may waive the requirement for prior conciliation talks in circumstances where it is considered appropriate to do so and must inform the court of the circumstances in which the requirement was waived.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="947" /> The section also contains a waiver for appeals from the rights commissioners and the recommendations of equality officers in cases which the court had begun to investigate before the establishment of the commission.  This is a minor point but it will ensure that ongoing business is not affected.  The implementation by the commission of the section will, to a large extent, determine whether a more aggressive conciliation service can restore the original status of the court as a court of last resort by reducing the number of cases referred to it.</P>
    <P>There will be a response, in a later amendment, to points made by Deputy Mitchell that the Labour Court should have the power to intervene on its own initiative in exceptional circumstances which would warrant this.  The conciliation service will deal with all disputes and will try to resolve them.  If they do not succeed the chairman of the Commission &mdash; or an appropriate officer &mdash; will transfer the case to the court.  If it is a dispute affecting the national interest and the chairman of the commission feels he should waive basic conciliation and bring it straight to the court, there is provision for doing that.</P>
    <P>The new function of the Labour Relations Commission will be in drafting and implementing codes of practice and trying to promote good industrial relations.  They will also try to improve individual companies and sectors.  At all times, the present flexibility and good practice by industrial relations officers, the head of the conciliation service and the court will be maintained, as that is clearly my wish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The task now proposed to be given to the commission is very substantial.  We have seen &mdash; regrettably but perhaps not inevitably &mdash; an increase against the trend in figures for industrial relations disputes and days lost through strikes.  If there is not a successfully negotiated programme for the continuation of some kind of social partnership the probability is that that will increase instead of decreasing.  My worry is that <Col N="948" /> we will simply have the current role of the Labour Court transferred &mdash; with some changes &mdash; to a constricted staff resource. This may not be the time or place to raise these matters but it is obvious from the fine print in the various sections and in the Fourth Schedule that this will be an extension of the Civil Service in real terms.  All the constraints <i>vis-à-vis</i> the embargo and resources will impact very heavily on the commission.  The commission are being asked to carry out the functions from (a) to (i), inclusive, set out on pages 14 and 15, which is an enormous task.</P>
      <P>Earlier on we talked about encouraging the amalgamation of trade unions. One of the factors which clearly prevents unions from coming together is the personnel implications for certain union officials who may not have a role in the amalgamated unions.  It has always been my view &mdash; I am not saying this for the first time &mdash; that, having regard to the need to employ people with good industrial relations experience, there would be considerable merit in the Minister having the power to appoint someone in their fifties on a contract basis.  This could be a trade union official who could facilitate a merger on one side and work for the commission on the other.  He would add to the resources of the commission and bring a lot of expertise to the industrial relations area from a practical point of view.  He could also be paid a decent wage which perhaps he did not have in a smaller union.  Indeed, low wages make smaller trade unions very vulnerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is talking about having the commission up and running by the end of October.  Unless additional staff resources can be made available to the commission it will be the Labour Court under another name with basically the same personnel.  There will be extra staff and more cash but there will be long and difficult negotiations with the Department of Finance because they do not change, irrespective of what Minister is in office.  The money and resources will be expended on senior staff.  I do not know to what extent the Minister has thought this through but, unless we can <Col N="949" /> get new people who have some feel for industrial relations to assist those currently in the conciliation and industrial relations services in the Labour Court, the objectives of the Commission &mdash; which the Labour Party fully support &mdash; will not be readily achieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with Deputy Quinn but I have a few brief points to make.  It is a very sensitive area. In negotiations over the last few years the number of cases was reduced.  I suppose there was a justifiable reason for reducing the numbers but I saw what was coming in regard to the additional workload.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn made a valid point about recruitment of staff.  I have looked at my powers and the procedures which must be followed and we will have to examine the matter further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the establishment of the commission will not create a barrier between practitioners and the conciliation service.  The very informal, flexible arrangement to which the Minister referred served our industrial relations well.  I would hope there would not be a new bureaucracy created which would render that personal relationship between conciliation officers and practitioners, whether they be employed by the FIE or the trade union movement, more difficult.  It has been suggested to me that it will be sufficiently difficult to retain that personal relationship, that one will have to go through a set of procedures, bureaucracy and so on, whereas, to date, even when one did not intend to involve the conciliation service, the practice would have been that very often one would have briefed the conciliation officer in the Labour Court on what was happening in a particular dispute, or the Labour Court would telephone the trade union official and ask: do you think it would be timely for me to intervene or what is the story?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the labour relations commission concept is to work, it will have to have dynamic leadership.  Otherwise I cannot readily see what would be different about <Col N="950" /> their function.  I commented earlier today on conservatism within the trade union movement.  All of us in this House, privately, would agree that there is no more conservative institution, in many respects, than the trade union movement; they are very traditionalist and conservative in their approach.  Just because we give something a new name does not mean that trade union officials generally will approach the position in a different fashion.  If they find themselves before a conciliation officer who is working to the Labour Relations Commission rather than to the Labour Court, I do not think it will make a great deal of difference to the attitudes of the trade union officials. If the conciliation officer were to say: I am sorry, I do not think you can go through the court because we have not teased it out sufficiently, he may receive a fairly traditional answer in blunt terms. Therefore, a great deal of homework will have to be done, under dynamic leadership, to encourage the view that things have changed, that there is a different expectation.</P>
    <P>On occasion there is a real problem encountered: for example, an employer will find his hands are tied in circumstances in which he will say: I would like to agree this across the table at conciliation but, for a variety of reasons, I cannot do so.  It is then referred to the next stage of the Labour Court.  The Labour Court having available to them the report of the industrial relations officer, very often enables them to make a recommendation which will prove acceptable to both sides, which lets the employer off the hook in a way that he would not be free voluntarily to agree at conciliation stage.  Obviously the Labour Relations Commission will have to feel their way.  It is a new concept.  The commission will require dynamic leadership but they should not necessarily throw out the baby with the bath water; where flexible, informal arrangements work they ought to be allowed to continue to work.</P>
    <P>I am reminded of an anecdote cited by a man who has now risen in the Civil Service to the position of Secretary of a Department, who was a prominent figure <Col N="951" /> in public service negotiations when I was dealing with them.  He told me, having agreed one particular national understanding, he had been sent on a course to Oxford.  At the end of the course one of the key questions posed by the tutor was: how could you identify the bottom line of the other side; how could you know when the trade union side had reached its bottom line?  All the English chaps gave very elaborate, scientific answers about how this could be done. Our Irish colleague in the Department of the Public Service &mdash; as it was then &mdash; put up his hand when the tutor remarked: I see our Irish friend has a contribution to make.  The tutor asked him: How would you identify it and he replied: I would ask them in the pub afterwards.  A lot of that takes place in Irish industrial relations where the informality and flexibility that enables somebody in that position to ascertain the union position in the pub or wherever ought not be discarded in favour of a very bureaucratic, stylised procedure alien to our culture.</P>

      <P>Deputies would not have too much difficulty identifying which pub, whatever about which Secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have emphasised the need for maintaining the flexible, informal relationship, the close contacts, the work with practitioners, what might be described as the day-to-day looseness in formalities, all of which we discussed pending the introduction of this Bill.  We have all discussed how the conciliation service, the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court itself should work.  Since the time the proposals were announced, well over a year ago, until the introduction of the Bill we have been able to make progress and highlight the issues and arrangements well worth maintaining; people have argued against very <Col N="952" /> little in that respect.  I agree fully with Deputies that we are talking about people who would be flexible perhaps in taking people on contract, being able to benefit from the experiences of the best people available, the attitude of the member of the commission and their leadership.  As long as I have been involved with the Labour Court we have been extremely lucky in its membership.  Largely the people who have served have been very experienced and have had a very good feel for the normal day-to-day issues that arise in industrial relations.</P>
    <P>The conciliation service provided to date by the Labour Court will continue to be provided by the proposed Labour Relations Commission who will facilitate the provision of an even more active conciliation service.  It is worth recording that a previous attempt to broaden the role of the conciliation service within the Labour Court structure &mdash; under the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act, 1969 &mdash; failed.  The concept of a new Labour Relations Commission was born in order to reap the full potential of such conciliation service.</P>
    <P>I might add that the Labour Relations Commission will also provide an advisory service, something mentioned by Deputies Rabbitte and Jim Mitchell.  Indeed, the conciliation service has been involved in a continuous fire-fighting role over the years in that industrial relations officers have been able to give limited advice only even where they have been aware of serious deficiencies in industrial relations in the workplace.  Those who have served with the Labour Court &mdash; now back in mine and other Departments &mdash; will tell you that they knew, time and time again, what they could do and what should be done; in many such instances it was not what they would say to trade unions but rather what they would say to management. We will all have had similar personal experience.  From my experience I would have to say that often in the more serious disputes it is not trade union officials who create the difficulty but rather the management.  That has been a feature of many of our major industrial relations institutions &mdash; that <Col N="953" /> there were people who perhaps are never told, who have very little expertise or experience in personnel matters, never mind industrial relations.  If one does not talk to people involved in the personnel function, it is unlikely one will form a relationship with them in regard to the industrial relations function.</P>
    <P>I spoke recently at an Irish Personnel Management conference &mdash; indeed the management advisory report highlighted this issue &mdash; to the effect that boardroom management in Ireland tends to confuse the personnel with the industrial relations functions whereas they are two distinct functions.  Then, on the other side, if they are not prepared to allocate sufficient resources to the personnel function in order to develop a proper industrial relations function, one breeds difficulties for the other.  If one does not get one's personnel management and procedures right, I do not see how one can ever get one's industrial relations function right. That is something that can be done by the Labour Relations Commission through their advisory service.  It is envisaged that that advisory service, comprised of a small unit within the commission, will carefully target their endeavours in areas in which they can do something useful.</P>
    <P>I accept those advisory points made by all Deputies.</P>

      <P>In page 16, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) Where the Court, following consultation with the Commission, is of opinion, in relation to a trade dispute which but for this subsection it would be precluded by virtue of subsection (1) from investigating, that there are exceptional circumstances which warrant it so doing, it may investigate the dispute.&rdquo;.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="954" /> This amendment arises from our earlier debate.  From the arguments advanced then I am satisfied that the Labour Court should have power to intervene, on their own initiative, when exceptional circumstances so warrant.  The amendment proposed is modelled closely on the provisions of section 18 of the Industrial Relations Act and meets the requests of all Deputies who raised this matter on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>On the question of the chief executive &mdash; I am not about to mention names or anything like that &mdash; but I do have a very strong view about combining the roles of chief executives with those of chairmen of bodies, particularly when they are tripartite.  I have a very strong view about combining the role of chief executive with the chairmanship of the body, particularly when they are tripartite bodies.  Indeed, Deputy Mitchell and I share an experience of a body that recently decided that the chairman of the Custom House Docks Board will not be the chief executive.  One will see also from the report on the Employment Equality Agency that the experience of combining the role of chief executive and chairperson in the one person was not satisfactory.  One could argue the converse in relation to the Labour Court.  In fact different chairmen of the Labour Court combined those two functions.  I would agree with Deputy Rabbitte that for the commission to be a dynamic new positive feature on the Irish personnel and industrial relations field, it has to be dramatically different from the Labour Court.  If codes of practice are going to be developed, if is it to be a tripartite relationship, the composition will be two, <Col N="955" /> two and two.  I have no problem with the section <i>per se</i> but I would like to hear the Minister's comments on this.</P>

I am aware of the experience of the Employment Equality Agency and other bodies, but there are some other arguments in favour of the office of the chairman and the post of chief executive being held by the same person.  I think the Deputy will remember some other agencies within the Department where people argued in the opposite way, but I will take Deputies' views into account.</P>

      <P>What is proposed in this section is a little unusual in that the Minister will appoint the first chief executive, which is the usual procedure, but the Minister and not the commission will appoint subsequent chief executives after consultation with the commission.  This is most unusual.  The normal procedure when a State agency are set up and running is that they appoint the chief executive subject to the approval of the Minister rather than the Minister appointing the chief executive having consulted the board.  Does this mean that the commission could end up with a chief executive who has pleased the Minister but is not pleasing to them?</P>

I think the commission ought to be able to select their own chief executive, albeit with the approval of the Minister.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the office of chief executive should be held by a young, dynamic and adventurous man who will confront the whole industrial relations personnel management establishment.  If that person in his role as chairman comes into a meeting proposing something to the social partners and the Minister's nominees who invariably will be cautious and will try to protect their Minister, irrespective of who it is, it is very difficult for the person to divide his personality into two parts, on the one hand to have enthusiasm of the person proposing and the restraint of a chairman in trying to keep everybody together.  It is a very unusual and exceptional personality that can do both those tasks.  In areas where they have not succeeded, the organisations have run into trouble so that in general the functions have been allocated to two people.</P>

I believe in democracy.  One can get rid of Ministers but it is very difficult to get rid of civil servants, with all due respect to the people in this Chamber.  We are accountable and I have never had any problems accepting responsibility for appointing people.  I suggest that would be a better way to do it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 87:</P>
      <P>In page 18, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Reference of issues which are not covered by arbitration procedures for public service employees can be made to a rights commissioner, provided relevant conciliation procedures for such employees have been observed.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a follow up to the point discussed earlier in relation to providing some access for people covered by conciliation and arbitration schemes generally where the mechanism of those schemes is unsatisfactory or where the operation of the schemes is very slow.  Deputy Rabbitte has already commented on this matter in some detail and I will not take up the time with it now.  This amendment is similar in principle to our proposals in amendment No. 77a regarding access to the rights <Col N="959" /> commissioners.  I would like to hear the Minister's view on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad this matter has been revived under this section.  I lost my concentration momentarily on section 23.  My amendment No. 77 was designed to meet the same cause and was worded: &ldquo;Notwithstanding the provisions of this section the meaning of `worker' shall for the purposes of section 35&rdquo;&mdash; which we are now dealing with &mdash;&ldquo;include any officer of a Local Authority or a Health Board&rdquo;.  I did not appreciate at the time that we were taking that with a number of other amendments.  It is appropriate that it has been revived under section 35 because it is very important.  I will refer again to the letter from Phil Flynn, most of which Deputy Quinn read into the record today.  I have a covering letter from him which refers to the deficiencies in the conciliation and arbitration scheme, the damage it is doing to morale, festering discontent in the service and so on. He says:</P>
      <P>A significant improvement could be achieved through availing of the opportunity presented by the current Industrial Relations Bill.  A simple amendment could give access to the rights commissioners to those within the ambit of our scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be prepared at this stage to accept the Minister's argument that it is not for him to impose a new bargaining system on the entire public service.  If he was to take on board the spirit of this amendment it would greatly release the steam and aggravation that is building up as a result of there being no safety valve for these people who constitute a very large segment of the workforce.  There is no independent arbitrator and no forum that can arbitrate on small grievances The rights commissioner is a tremendous service. Phil Flynn is writing on behalf of the group of ten or 12 unions that are involved.  I think access to the rights commissioner service would be a major breakthrough and would be greatly <Col N="960" /> appreciated throughout the public services. I would ask the Minister to take the spirit of the amendment on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>We dealt with this matter to some extent earlier but it is very useful to raise it here.  I agree with Deputy Rabbitte what the rights commissioner service has been a considerable success and certainly has met the objectives envisaged in the 1969 Act.  The Minister is in a different position from any other individual Deputy.  This is not the place, in the context of this Bill, to talk about access to the rights commissioner service at large but rather we should draw it to the attention of the interested parties under the conciliation and arbitration schemes, and indicate the goodwill and open mind of the Minister in this respect.  No doubt the Minister would be eager to hear a consensus view from that quarter.</P>

      <P>As I have already said on a number of occasions, I would have no objection in principle to allowing public servants covered by conciliation and arbitration schemes to have access to a rights commissioner service provided there was agreement between the parties to the schemes.  This is a matter for discussion between the Ministers directly concerned.  As with the earlier point, in the absence of an agreement I am not in a position to alter the terms and conditions of the negotiating machinery which is at present in place.  These negotiations are ongoing.  I see the validity of the point and I see the difficulties that arise on fairly small issues, particularly those that could be dealt with by a rights commissioner.  I will bring this point, along with the earlier one of access to the Labour Court generally, to the attention of the Minister for Finance and the relevant Ministers.  As I have already said, I have highlighted the points in relation to Phil Flynn's letter on behalf of the Local Government and Public Services Union and the municipal unions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, access to the rights commissioner has the agreement of the staff side of the conciliation and <Col N="961" /> arbitration scheme.  Is the Minister saying that if the agreement of the official side was forthcoming, it would be possible, by ministerial order, following the enactment of this Bill, to afford that facility?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is necessarily the case, and I hesitate to appear to know more than some of the advisers.  The definition of worker would have to be changed by order to include different categories.  By changing the definition of worker we would also be giving them access to the Labour Court, which would pose much more problems for some of the management side on the question of providing access.  We are saying that as an interim measure there should be access to the rights commissioner only.  Let us go back to the relevant section where the Minister may, by order, change the category of workers, that will undoubtedly be refused by the Department of Finance, whatever about the other Departments, but in the case of access to the rights commissioners, whose recommendations are not binding, that cannot be as vehemently opposed.  I would ask the Minister, that between now and Report Stage, he would not only act as a neutral referee in relation to this but to convey to the relevant Departments what we know to be the position of the staff side.  He should, in the interests of good industrial relations &mdash; I think he has a view which diplomacy prevents him from expressing in public but he is certainly capable of doing so in private &mdash; urge the Departments to which the conciliation and arbitration schemes apply &mdash; Finance, Health, the Environment and, to a lesser extent, the Marine and Agriculture and Food &mdash; to accept the provision regarding access to the rights commissioner service.  We would have to amend the Bill to do this. I do not think the Departments will agree to change the definition of worker but they will more readily accept the provision regarding the rights commissioners.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quinn is right. <Col N="962" /> If both sides agree, and there is also agreement by the Department of Finance, by order I can give them access to the Labour Court.  If we were to give them access to the rights commissioner only, as has been suggested, that would necessitate a specific amendment to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Would such an order giving access to the Labour Court automatically give access to the rights commissioner service?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking into account what the Deputy has said, that that issue is a far wider one.  We would be talking about giving direct access to the Labour Court to the whole public service in its broadest sense. That carries with it many changes in many traditions and all the questions I raised earlier about the C &amp; A scheme.  If the Deputy is talking about the rights commissioner that would be a specific section in the Act.  The other matter could still arise for individual sections over a number of years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not all the more imperative then that we should repeat the appeal to the Minister from this side of the House to consider taking the rights commissioner issue on board for Report Stage?  In other words, if it would necessitate an amendment to the Act subsequently, why can we not deal with it now?  It is not a particular controversial matter.  It will not bring the establishment tumbling down.  If one were to broaden the definition of &ldquo;worker&rdquo; there are people who would think and would argue that it would do precisely that, but access to the rights commissioner service would not bring the edifice tumbling down on top of us.  Why do we not take <Col N="963" /> the opportunity presented to us now to open up the rights commissioner service?</P>

The question is: &ldquo;That the amendments set down by the Minister for Labour to section 36 are hereby made to the Bill and in respect of each of these sections undisposed of up to and including section 41, that the section, or as appropriate, the section as amended, is hereby agreed.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The codes of practice can emerge from the commission itself suggesting that such codes are needed or, in fact, the Minister may request that such codes be proposed.  Has the Minister any indication at this stage of the codes of practice that would be proposed?  This Bill is a long time in gestation and people have thought it through in advance.  Can the Minister give any indication of the areas of the codes of practice that he would request the incoming commission to identify and work on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This section empowers the commission to draw up codes of practice in industrial relations in consultation with trade unions, employers' organisatins and other interested parties.  It also provides for promulgation of codes by the Minister and allows codes to be taken into acount in proceedings before the courts and industrial relations bodies. However, failure to observe a provision of a code will not in itself entitle anyone to take legal action.  The formulation of <Col N="964" /> codes of practice will enable good practice in certain areas or on certain issues to be highlighted and promoted, so that these good practices can be adapted for use generally.</P>
      <P>Section 11 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1969, gave the Labour Court power to draw up fair employment rules which were intended to fulfil much the same function as codes of practice.  The section has not been used on any occasion since its enactment and as a consequence of this section it will be repealed.  There are a great number of areas to be looked at, particularly those in which there would be agreement.  These areas include: a dispute procedure setting out the procedural stages to be followed before industrial action is taken; provision of information to and consultation with employees on the activities of the undertaking and on decisions likely to affect employees; levels of cover to be provided in the case of disputes in essential services; protection and facilities for workers' representatives in the company.  On Second Stage I indicated that at a later stage the commission would consider codes on individual grievance procedures and disciplinary procedures.  There are a great number of codes of practice but these are the main ones which I think are long overdue.  They are useful and would command a certain amount of agreement and there would be much public support to deal with those areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  What is the Government's position regarding the action programme for the implementation of the Social Charter? My perception of the present Minister for Labour is that he supports the voluntarist tradition, which I do not.  Incidentally, I would prefer to see more directives, that is a legitimate difference point of view, but this will be for the people within the social partnership structure.  This will be the only place where the voluntarist tradition can be actively pursued as far as I see it.  I do not know whether the Minister would share that view.  If codes of practice on access to information in relation to discussing long-term plans &mdash; some of <Col N="965" /> the so-called Uredeling directives &mdash; are all issues on a broad range of the Social Charter and its aspirations, does the Minister see that this is the area where such advances on social information and protection could be advanced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the action programme will be dealt with differently. There are a number of directives and there are also common positions and regulations.  In reply to the Deputy, during recent months we got agreement that the social partners will be consulted two months before the Council on the various initiatives regardless of what status they would have in law.  They will have a direct input.  In an effort to avoid obstacles that would be encountered after a Council decision perhaps, individual stances taken up at the Council can now be resolved by the ETUC and UNICE in that two month period.  That perhaps has delayed some of the adaptation working time and information on some of those more important codes but it certainly helps the voluntarist approach.  I hold the optimistic view that the issues of the Social Charter will be dealt with in that form.  I would prefer that they be dealt with in that form because it is important that they have as near to unanimity as they can have rather than have a mere individual national State to deal with them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that the whole concept behind codes of practice or national standards of good industrial practice or whatever can vary, depending on where authorship rests and what is the political climate of the day and so on.  I agree that the concept and the idea are good.  Perhaps too late in the day we are coming to set down realistic national standards of good industrial practice to provide codes of conduct in several areas. I would like to see subjects included for such codes of practice governing areas like grievance procedures, discipline and dismissal, procedures for multi-union employments, closed shop agreement and transfer of members, shop stewards <Col N="966" /> facilities, voting procedures, dispute procedures, interpretation of agreements and emergency services during industrial disputes.  For example, if one could get voluntary agreement to codes of practice in some of those areas it would greatly minimise the extent of disputes that occur.  The trouble, to some extent, is in the eye of the beholder.</P>
      <P>I instanced the case this morning of the codes of practice that were drafted in the United Kingdom.  It is very interesting to see how they have turned out and how they can be more rigorous than the actual law passed by Parliament.  I refer to the draft code of practice on trade union industrial balloting which was published by the Secretary of State for Employment in October 1988.  The assessment of the institute that I quoted this morning on this matter was pithily put in three sentences. First, they found there were obligations laid upon unions at all five stages of the ballot procedure in addition to those which Parliament had put into law.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the code suffered from four main defects, confusion, quietism &mdash; I am glad Deputy Hillery is in the House because I am not sure what quietism means &mdash; impracticability and bias.  It totally neglects &ldquo;the moral problems and strategic choices facing a union executive&rdquo; when asked to respond to rank and file demands for support, and that can be quite a dilemma for a union executive faced with very emotive and strongly expressed demands from the rank and file on occasion.  Finally, they opined that unless the code is amended to place at least some burdens on employers as well as trade unionists in the interests of a much wider and more balanced concept of good practice, it cannot be expected to be taken seriously by those with a sense of equity and a knowledge of the subject. Factors like this have to be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of my general criticisms is that where the Bill goes out of its way on many occasions to expressly provide for restrictions on trade union manoeuvrability, it rarely, if ever, imposes a corresponding restriction on employers' freedom of manoeuvrability.  It would be <Col N="967" /> a very sad day if under a different Minister one found that the existing Bill could be used to devise codes of practice that would have the effect of diminishing the rights of trade unions further and enhancing the power position of employers.</P>

      <P>I was proposing to speak before Deputy Rabbitte spoke but now I rise to speak in support of what he said latterly.  Much of this legislation imposes duties, limitations and restrictions on the trade union movement and there is very little in it in relation to the employer's side of industrial relations. There is plenty of evidence to suggest that where there are persistent industrial relations problems, where there are repeated strikes at a place of work, bad management is almost always a factor.</P>
      <P>On the first day we discussed Committee Stage of this Bill I raised the question with the Minister as to the onus on employers to have within the organisation first of all a personnel policy and a sufficiently senior and staffed section to deal with industrial relations.  Of course, that would not be relevant to very small employers, but it is pertinent and relevant to most Irish industry.  In too many cases the industrial relations dimension, the whole personnel function, is not given the attention or priority it deserves.  Even within the Government service frequently financial considerations are given a disproportionate priority over proper personnel considerations.  The Government's own house is not completely in order, and that is not just a recent problem.</P>
      <P>The point Deputy Rabbitte raised is valid.  We need balanced legislation.  The Bill before us by its very nature, I suppose, has to address issues of trade union practices, rules and regulations, but it seems that under these codes of practice there is an opportunity for the commission to address the rights, responsibilities, practices etc., in respect of the workers and of industrial relations.  I hope the Minister can assure us that this will be a consideration for the commissioner.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to the 1969 Act and the fair employment rules, and it is disappointing that that legislation which, 21 years ago provided for something similar to the codes of practice, was never really activated. However, there is an opportunity here for a fresh start.  The fact that the commission &ldquo;shall prepare draft codes of practice&rdquo; gives us grounds for hope.  The fact that employers and employees and their trade union representatives will be consulted in advance is vital under our voluntary system in order to develop ownership and, consequently, commitment to the application of these codes of practice.  Fair enough, we hope we will have codes of practice on disputes, grievances, discipline and so on.</P>
      <P>I would like to mention disclosure of information.  When Deputy Quinn was Minister for Labour and I was in the Seanad this matter was discussed more than once in the context of legislation. Employees are key stake-holders in an organisation and more often than not they have the most to lose when organisations fail.  I think we underestimate the ideas, expertise and commitment that can be forthcoming if they understand the state of play in organisations.  Furthermore, the more advanced and enlightened of employers show that they have copped on to this, as it were, and that even in some of the best managed companies there is total disclosure of information, warts and all, so that employees can gain a fuller understanding of corporate objectives and where people jointly can move together.</P>
      <P>I regard this as a particularly important section of the Bill and I hope the Minister and the new commission will do everything to advance the implementation of codes of practice while taking fully into account consultation with both sides so that the codes when put in place will have a better opportunity of full practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of questions were raised on that.  I mentioned a few areas where codes of practice might be desirable and where there could be a certain consensus, but it is no doubt likely <Col N="969" /> that the active commission we all hope to see will have ideas to formulate their own codes of practice.  The social partners no doubt will bring their long agenda at an early date.  The question of what they can usefully do and, more important, what they have to turn their minds to has been there for a number of years.  It is essential that codes have a wide degree of acceptability among the partners because if they were to start to get into difficulties there would be objections from both employers and workers at an early date and the commission themselves could run into difficulty.  I agree with Deputy Quinn that development of a code of practice would not be dependent on the achievement of total consensus.  If I have learned anything from this Bill, from the safety and health legislation, the worker participation legislation and a few more pieces of legislation, it is that that is not possible, that there is no such thing. Deputy Quinn is quite right.  Even in regard to codes of practice there has to be debate.  Debate is important in this area.  In this debate today we have not had strong line arguments of what employers have been.  It is not always the biggest employers who shout the loudest. In fact you can make a great deal of progress with some of the big employers and you can have fairly straight talk with them.</P>

      <P>Figures prove that the large multinationals who came in here under the IDA policy some years ago were encouraged into the trade union movement.  Perhaps that does not happen now to the same extent as then.  I joined my name to it as much as anyone else here.  These multinationals do not have bad records; they have very good industrial relations.  Perhaps we do not sell ourselves well enough in that our modern <Col N="970" /> companies, the companies that have had the greatest structural and technological changes and have coped with the cost effectiveness and the restructuring that has been essential in the last 15 years have tended not to have had industrial relations problems.  They are still making money but perhaps do not have as many people in employment as they used to have.  They do not create problems for the Labour Court, the Minister or the public generally.  Smaller management concerns tend to drive the whole system out of control.</P>
      <P>I could answer in several ways Deputy Mitchell's question about what employers have lost and gained.  I do not want to put restrictions on employers that would entail sanctions and similar restrictions and sanctions on workers.  That would not be a good idea.  I do not want sanctions other than those in the legislation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte spoke about procedures in the UK.  There is a big distinction in what we are doing in this legislation and I differ from Norman Tibbet.  Deputy Rabbitte was referring to ministerial codes of practice.  We are talking about the Labour Relations Commission, which is similar to ACAS. Under the code the Deputy mentioned the Minister would arbitrarily decide the way something should be done.  That is the Thatcherite <i>diktat</i> approach.</P>

      <P>We will not go into that. I accept the arguments which have been made about the chairman and chief executive of the Labour Relations Commission. The Labour Relations Commission representing employers and trade unions could set good standards. Deputy Mitchell referred to personnel. The Labour Relations Commission would be an appropriate body to set out standards and procedures to be operated <Col N="971" /> by management.  The employers could not quibble with that.  The advisory services of the employer organisations set out these standards.  Perhaps they would not always stand over them afterwards when they run into difficulties.  It would be quite easy for responsible trade union and employer leaders to put together a code of practice on management and personnel industrial relations functions.</P>

      <P>A code of practice can be used in evidence.  That subsection enables courts of law and industrial relations bodies to take account of relevant provisions of codes of practice in proceedings before them but does not permit any proceedings to be taken for failure to implement a provision of a code.  In this fashion industrial relations bodies and particularly courts of law will have broad criteria to judge good industrial relations practice in particular cases without being bound by the letter of a code of practice.  These bodies will also retain discretion whether to take account of a provision of a code or what weight to give to a provision in a particular case. If the Labour Relations Commission were in due course to have a clearly set out code of practice which would be the norm and if one side or the other were not proceeding by that norm, it would be very useful and could stop much of the legal bombardment.  Although it is not in the legislation it would carry the strength and power of a code of practice set up under legislation.  It will prove to be very important.</P>

      <P>In the event of the Deputy failing to appear I shall continue to entertain the House.</P>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to raise this matter and I should like to express my appreciation to the Minister for the Marine for being present in the House this evening.  Basically I am seeking clarification in relation to a matter which I and the offshore fishermen consider to be one of urgency.  As I understand it, the delay in issuing offshore fishing licences has placed many fishermen in serious difficulties. The Department of the Marine have all the information and facts and basically these fishermen are only awaiting a decision from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of licences must be issued by the Department for increased boat sizes.  I understand &mdash; the Minister can either confirm or deny this &mdash; that because of the size of our fishing fleet, we were not in a position during the last fishing season to take up our full quota <Col N="974" /> in a number of areas.  In the Porcupine, I understand we fished under quota up to 800 tonnes of prawns to the value of £2.5 million, and that we fished under quota up to 21,000 tonnes of white fish, whiting and monk fish to the value of between £6 million and £7 million.</P>
    <P>I have been led to believe that if we increase the size, length and tonnage of our boats we will have a better chance of competing and filling our quotas, thus enabling our fishermen to get on with their business.  Perhaps the Minister will indicate to the House the total number of applications which have been submitted to his Department.  I do not envy the Minister his job in issuing those licences: it would appear far more applications for licences have been submitted than the number of licences at the Minister's disposal.  Perhaps the Minister can give us some indication of the number of applications and the number of licences he intends to issue.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about the fishermen who heretofore were using boats up to 50-60 ft. in length and who, because of the opportunities which exist in regard to the under fished aspects of our quota, now intend buying 90-100 ft. boats which cost in the region of £200,000.  The applications submitted by these fishermen should already have received approval from the Minister.  A number of these fishermen have been fishing for many years and are legitimate applicants for these licences.  I am at a loss to understand why the Department &mdash; perhaps the Minister can clarify this point &mdash; are not in a position to issue licences to these applicants.  A number of people in the Kerry area who have been involved in the fishing industry for 20 to 30 years regard this as an opportunity to become more competitive and increase their boat size.  I believe there is ample scope for up to 30 extra boats of 90-100 ft. in length.</P>
    <P>I am at a loss to understand why the Minister, who has the ultimate responsibility, has not made a decision to award these licences.  I understand why there could be difficulties in relation to some of the applicants who are perhaps trying <Col N="975" /> to get into this area for the first time and who regard this as an opportunity to do so &mdash; there may be some difficulties in the Department about their trustworthiness and ability to become full-time fishermen &mdash; but I appeal to the Minister to make a decision in relation to those genuine fishermen who have been fishing for a number of years and who have made a straight application to bring in larger boats.</P>
    <P>I am glad of the opportunity to bring this matter to the attention of the House because some of these people will be in severe financial difficulties if their applications are not accepted by the Department.  These people have deposits of £40,000 and upwards paid on boats and their livelihoods are being put in jeopardy because of the failure of the Department to make a decision on their applications.  I understand the closing date for applications was 31 December 1989.  I ask the Minister to explain to the House why decisions have not been made.  I have tried to raise this matter at various times but unfortunately I have received no satisfactory answers.  I appeal to the Minister to indicate to the House as to when a decision will be made.  Too many people are waiting for a decision whose livelihoods are in jeopardy.  The Minister should make this decision as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Spring for sharing his time with me.  This very important issue has been on the agenda of the Department of the Marine for quite some time.  On various occasions during Question Time and on the Order of Business I have sought clarification on this matter but without success to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been established that about 300 applicants are awaiting the issue of licences and that a committee has been set up to examine these applications. However, nothing more is clear.  What is happening on the ground is quite serious. A number of people in the fishing industry want to change their boats and in some instances, to increase the length and tonnage of them.  I know a fisherman <Col N="976" /> who wants to reduce the tonnage of his boat but the licence has not been transferred from one boat to another.  When I tabled a Parliamentary Question on this matter I was told it was being reviewed by the committee.  I believe the consideration of such an application should be straightforward, particularly as the applicant already has a licence which he merely wants to transfer to another boat and reduce his tonnage.  I do not understand why there could be a difficulty with the issue of a licence in this case.</P>
    <P>A year and a half ago the Government announced the creation of 4,400 jobs in the fishing industry.  Yet those people who want to create a livelihood in fishing are not afforded the opportunity to do so.  I refer in particular to young applicants who are applying for a licence to get into the fishing industry.  For these people, particularly in the rural coastal regions, it is one of the few areas where they can make a living because industry is slow to come to these areas and jobs are difficult to secure.  They have been hoping for an opportunity in this area but to date, despite many promises by the Minister, his predecessor and the Taoiseach, they have been unable to do so.</P>
    <P>There is total chaos in issuing fishing boat licences.  There is a stalemate.  We are told it depends on the GRT and that we have been told by the EC Commission to reduce our GRT, everything seems to centre on this.  I would ask the Minister tonight to take the opportunity to clarify once and for all whether he and his Department will be in a position this year to issue fishing boat licences or do we have to reduce our tonnage substantially before any new licences can issue to the fishing industry.  It is a straightforward situation but to the people who are suffering severe hardship as a result of this indecision it is not so clear.  They are not in a position to plan.  Those who have put deposits on boats are now in serious financial difficulty and are under-increasing pressure to get rid of the boats because they are not in a position to use them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to make quite clear what the situation is in regard to boat licences.  In dealing with this question it is, I feel, essential to remind Deputies of the overall framework within which the future issue of sea fishing boat licences must be handled.</P>
      <P>First, it has to be recognised that there are segments of our fishing fleet where there is clear over-capacity.  To allow uncontrolled access into these segments would simply undermine the viability of existing fishermen and add to the already severe pressures on scarce fish stocks. Future licensing policy must, therefore, take cognisance of this situation in the interests of the industry as a whole.  As Deputies will be aware, it has already been established policy for some years now only to allow boats enter the pelagic and beamer fleets where equivalent tonnage is being withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Second, there are major constraints on capacity arising from European Community fishing fleets policy.  That policy is designed to address the problem of the serious over-capacity which exists in the Community as a whole.  Recently there was an additional cause for concern arising from the fact that the fishing fleet of East Germany is double the size of the federal German fleet.  Herr von Geldern, the Federal German Fisheries Minister on a visit to Dublin two weeks ago reassured me that a united Germany would not be making any extra demand on quotas.  We must be very thankful for this relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All member states are required to reduce their fleet capacities by 3 per cent below the end 1984 level, and that was too low in the first place.  This requirement <Col N="978" /> poses very real difficulties for a number of member states, including Ireland, whose fleets had increased since 1984.  In Ireland's case, the cutback in capacity requires that the fleet be reduced to 43,941 gross registered tonnes by the end of 1991.  To date we have achieved the interim target of 57,355 tonnes set for the end of 1989.  A substantial further reduction of about 6,000 tonnes is required by the end of 1990 to be followed next year by another of about the same order, in fact slightly greater.  I am not happy with these restrictions and will continue to fight to have them revised. However, the same restrictions apply to all member states, and a lone voice is seldom heard.  Moreover, there are linkages with other elements of policy and specifically the availability of significant financial assistance for the fishery sector generally.  Countries which fail to reduce the GRT will not receive any financial aid from Structural Funds to modernise and refurbish their fleet.</P>
    <P>It is obvious, therefore, that the scope for allowing new entrants into the fleet is strictly limited.  Future decisions and policy guidelines to be applied in the assessment of licence applications must be consistent as far as possible with available unexploited fishing opportunities and be consistent as far as possible with EC parameters.</P>
    <P>Against that background future licensing policy must of necessity be highly selective.  In that context it is inevitable that in future licences will be issued generally on a replacement basis in the first instances.  The rate of replacement will be determined primarily by the types of vessels involved and the species to be fished.  That is the general policy that has been recommended to me by an expert group which I set up last year to advise on this issue.</P>
    <P>I have, however, on hands some 240 applications seeking licences for boats which in aggregate would amount to about 18,000 tonnes or the equivalent of about a third of the existing fleet.  Clearly only a small fraction of these applications will be successful.  As the House is aware <Col N="979" /> I recently established a special vetting committee under the chairmanship of the secretary of my Department to examine the applications on hand in the light of the general policy guidelines to apply for the future.  I am now advised by that committee that, on the basis of a 100 per cent replacement policy only a handful of licences is allowable.  These are to be issued shortly.</P>
    <P>It is evident to me, and I am supported in this by scientific advice, that there are unexploited fishing opportunities available particularly in the white fish sector in deep waters which existing boats cannot catch.  I am now specifically addressing the question of how best to structure my decisions on licensing policy so as, on the one hand, to facilitate the catching of these unexploited resources while on the other respecting the wider EC constraints. The House will see that that is in the nature of squaring the circle.  I can assure the Deputy that my sole objective in deciding on licences is to safeguard the long term interests of Irish fishermen and of the Irish fishing industry as a whole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you very much indeed, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity to raise this very important health issue.  I do not often raise matters on the Adjournment but this is a matter of very deep concern to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I tabled a Dáil question last week about the total number awaiting cardiac surgery nationally and I was told that the number on the waiting list as of the end of April was 743.  I am afraid that statistic does not detail the type of difficulties I have come across through individual patients, <Col N="980" /> and when I pursued this with the medical personnel and the hospital authorities I was quite shocked to hear the current state of events.</P>
    <P>I am advised that some patients have to wait up to three and four years for heart surgery.  These patients are called elective patients and are placed on a waiting list.  We have a national cardiac centre at the Mater Hospital.  It does most of the public patients in Dublin.  The others are done in Cork Regional Hospital and the children are done in Crumlin.  The waiting list in Crumlin is over 600.  The precise difficulty is that last December the number of heart surgery operations was reduced from three cases per day to two cases per day.  This was because prior to December patients were being discharged from the Mater Hospital to their referring hospital after three to four days. However, in some cases the health of the patient relapsed while in other cases litigation was threatened by patients and their families because of the shortness of their stay.</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted by cardiologists and cardiac surgeons that the normal recuperating period is ten or 11 days in the intensive care unit of a cardiac hospital. The consultants decided, and quite rightly, that they could not leave themselves open to litigation by discharging those patients after three to four days. They insisted that they would have to reduce the number of operations from three to two and allow patients to stay ten to 12 days in the Mater Hospital.  The problem is that there are only 25 beds in the cardiac unit of that hospital.  Therefore, if people stay longer in those beds after their operation, fewer operations will be carried out.  This has meant that a bad situation has become chaotic.</P>
    <P>I have been advised by a variety of medical personnel that patients on the waiting list have died and that the lives of those on the waiting list are at risk because of the delay and the limited access to cardiac surgery.  We have reached a critical stage and I understand that the position is deteriorating weekly. No impact can be made on the waiting <Col N="981" /> list.  The minimum number of additional beds required to stop the problem getting worse is ten beds bringing the number to 35.  Four consultant cardiac surgeons operate out of that unit and they have six beds each.  Their position has been made impossible.  Some of them share appointments with St. James's Hospital and with Our Lady's Hospital in Crumlin.  We are all aware of the problem highlighted last week in regard to a quintuplet who was due to have a heart operation on a Sunday but the surgeon stated that he could only perform the operation on a Friday.  The delay was critical but, fortunately, all is well.  The surgeons have advised me that however bad the situation is in Crumlin and it is bad, it is a lot worse in the Mater Hospital, the national cardiac centre.</P>
    <P>Even if the 35 beds were approved the number of operations annually would rise to 750 compared with 1,000 per annum four years ago.  If the Minister responds by allocating an extra ten beds it will be short of what is required.  We should remember that we have the highest mortality rate among those 50 years of age in OECD countries and that we have one of the lowest life expectancies.  According to international statistics one out of two people here die from heart related diseases. About 2,500 adults require heart surgery each year here and if we allow for 750 operations in the Mater Hospital &mdash; they will carry out fewer operations this year; 500 in private hospitals; almost 200 in the regional hospitals and 150 in Our Lady's Hospital in Crumlin that means that we will be 1,000 operations short of the requirement.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that in the Mater Hospital surgeons work under primeval conditions.  I have been advised by medical, and other health services personnel working in the hospital, that because there are only 25 beds, incoming patients must queue up in corridors until patients are discharged.  That is unacceptable. I have also been advised that when transplant operations take place two or three beds are taken up in one room leading to further difficulties on the waiting list.  That is unacceptable but the <Col N="982" /> staff have had to work under those conditions for a number of years.  The bottom line in terms of the treatment of patients is that if one of the 600 on the waiting list is told by the consultant that there are more urgent cases ahead of him and that it will not be possible to treat him that patient is advised by the hospital authorities that if he becomes seriously ill, gets a relapse, a stroke or a heart attack he should contact his local general practitioner. That is unacceptable, particularly when we are dealing with people at risk.</P>
    <P>My information is that the consultants with six beds each can only deal with emergency cases, patients rushed in by ambulances.  As a result those on the waiting list are being moved further away from treatment.  I have been patient since the House held a debate on a motion of no confidence in the Minister for Health some months ago and I was waiting for reports of committees under Mr. Fox and Mr. Kennedy but I cannot allow this drift any further.  I saw reports in the <i>Medical News</i> and the <i>Irish Medical Times</i> as far back as last January that the matter would be dealt with shortly but I was advised no later than to day that the problem is getting worse.  I regret that the Minister is not present to give us his views on this matter and I should like to ask the Minister of State to give a commitment that within a matter of days an extra ten beds will be made available. The Department should make adequate long-term provision for the speciality of cardiac surgery.  They should ensure that patients who cannot afford to go to Blackrock Clinic at a moment's notice and do not have access to private health care because they cannot afford to be in the VHI, are protected.  This is unacceptable and I am seeking an immediate response from the Minister of State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am present on behalf of the Minister for Health to show our concern about the problem.  Shortly after the appointment of Deputy O'Hanlon as Minister for Health in 1987 it was agreed between the Department of <Col N="983" /> Health and the Mater Hospital that 750 coronary artery by-pass grafts procedures per annum was a reasonable and attainable target level of provision in respect of eligible patients and within agreed level of funding.  The Minister for Health included sufficient funds in the 1990 financial allocation to the Mater Hospital for this agreed programme of cardiac surgery. The present position is that, since January 1990, a temporary reduction in the number of heart operations has taken place at the Mater Hospital, due to a change in medical practice.  This had the obvious effect of increasing the waiting lists.  Prior to January last patients referred to the Mater Hospital from other hospitals for coronary artery by-pass surgery were referred back to the other hospitals after a few days for after care.</P>
      <P>However, on 24 January 1990 the cardiac consultants at the Mater Hospital unilaterally advised the hospital administration that in future they intended to hold their cardiac patients for the full duration of the post-operative stay in the Mater Hospital.  This created a longer use of key cardiac beds and a consequential reduction in the throughput of cardiac patients.  That decision was taken suddenly and without consultation with my Department.  On learning of the situation in the Mater Hospital the Minister for Health instructed the officials of our Department to explore, as a matter of urgency, with the hospital's management and consultants ways and means in which to improve the overall position with a view to restoring the activity of the cardiac surgery unit to its previous agreed level.  There is general agreement on all sides that the throughput for coronary artery by-pass grafts should be brought back up to 750 per annum as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>As was indicated in a reply to a parliamentary question, answered on 25 April last &mdash; Official Report, volume 397, column 2310 &mdash; by the Minister for Health, the achievement of this objective is an early priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="984" /> I have listened with interest to what Deputy Yates had to say and I must state that it is incumbent on all Members who represent the public to give the facts when making a contribution in the House.  Deputy Yates told us that there is a waiting list in excess of 600 patients in Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that the record be put right.  As a result of the change in medical practice ten additional beds are required at the Mater Hospital to enable an additional 200 heart by-pass cases to be treated this year.  Based on estimates this would involve capital of £200,000, additional equipment costs of £200,000 and revenue costs of £400,000. The Deputy, and the House, will appreciate that those costs, totaling £800,000, are not insignificant.  I am examining proposals from the hospital in this regard in consultation with the Minister and his officials and we hope to resolve the problem satisfactorily and with agreement on all sides.  Deputy Yates should direct his talents to ensuring that all sides adopt a positive attitude to this.  Neither the Minister, nor I, are satisfied with the position at the hospital but with goodwill and flexibility on all sides this important issue can be resolved.</P>

      <P>This is primarily a planning matter.  The booklet published by my Department is intended as a guide to MMDS for the general public.  The references to tower heights in the booklet are generalisations rather than specifications. My Department expects most MMDS operators to maximise coverage from their transmitters by siting them as high as possible.</P>
      <P>The technical conditions to which MMDS operators must adhere do not specify a minimum height.  Transmitter antenna heights are limited to those heights necessary to give adequate coverage of the area within range of the transmitter. Operators are also required to adhere to guidelines laid down by the international non-ionising radiation committee of the International Radiation Protection Association &mdash; IRPA &mdash; on the limits to exposure to radio frequency magnetic fields in the frequency range 100 kilohertz to 300 gigahertz.  A tower height of 21 metres would not necessarily conflict with the requirements to observe IRPA guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="814" /> I understand that the operator concerned commissioned an independent study of the levels of radio frequency radiation which would be emitted from the installation in question.  The study has shown that even when making very pessimistic assumptions, the maximum level of exposure of humans is over 100 times lower than the levels considered safe by the IRPA.  I understand that the study has been made available to Cork County Council.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy in relation to the number of prisoners admitted to hospitals in a year is not readily available and compilation of this information would require the expenditure of staff time to an extent that could not be warranted.</P>
      <P>Security of prisoners in hospitals &mdash; with the exception of the Central Mental Hospital &mdash; is maintained by means of an escort by prison staff.  Where considered necessary, the Prison Service escort is augmented by members of the Garda and Army.  As the security measures involve only personnel from the security forces, the question of recoupment of the costs of security measures to hospitals or health agencies does not arise.  The administration of the Central Mental Hospital, including the provision of security, is primarily a matter for the authorities there under the aegis of the Eastern Health Board.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy's concern is with witnesses' expenses in criminal cases.  Lay witnesses who appear on behalf of the State, or on behalf of defendants who have been granted legal aid, are reimbursed loss of salary.  Self-employed persons receive an amount which approximates to the average industrial wage.  Non-income earning persons, excluding children under 16, receive fixed sums which are adjusted from time to time in line with the cost of living.  In addition to these amounts, a witness may be paid the cost of employing a deputy during attendance at court.  Witnesses are also entitled to subsistence and travelling expenses which are also adjusted from time to time in line with the cost of living. It is open to a judge or justice to direct payment of expenses above or below the prescribed amounts but, in fact, the vast majority of lay witnesses receive the fixed amounts.</P>
      <P>Experts witnesses called by the State are paid fees, the level of which is increased from time to time in line with general wage increases.  Again, discretion to award greater or smaller amounts rests with the court.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the payments to witnesses are equitable.</P>

      <P>I am, of course, conscious of the trauma and loss suffered by the victims of crime and that is a main motivation for the actions I have taken to strengthen the capability of the Garda Síochána in all that they do in the area of crime prevention.

      <P>Financial support for persons who suffer injury as a result of the activities of criminals is provided for under the scheme of compensation for personal injuries criminally inflicted.  As the Deputies will be aware, it was found necessary to amend this scheme with effect from 1 April 1986 to provide that compensation would not be payable in respect of pain and suffering attributable to injuries sustained on or after that date.</P>
      <P>As regards legal aid, a scheme of civil legal aid and advice is already in existence and it would be possible for a victim of crime who wished to seek civil damages against the prepetrator of a criminal injury to obtain legal aid under this scheme provided that the applicant fulfilled the eligibility and other criteria of the scheme.</P>

      <P>In accordance with a decision by the Government some years ago, certain cash movements are escorted by the Garda and the Defence Forces to ensure that the cash does not fall into the wrong hands.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that details of the cost of providing escorts or the numbers of personnel engaged on such duties are not separately compiled and that an effort to do so would require expenditure of garda time to an extent that could not be warranted.</P>
      <P>The escorts are regarded as necessary in the public interest and have not been requested by the security companies or the financial institutions.  In addition, substantial amounts of the cash escorted are for distribution as social welfare payments. In these circumstances, recoupment of the cost of the escorts is not sought.</P>

      <P>I believe that the reply I gave on that occasion will have allayed some of the concerns previously expressed about the implications which those court decisions may have for future cases.

    </Speaker>
    <P>In August 1988, Morocco and the Polisario Front accepted a UN peace plan whose key feature was a referendum on self-determination.  At the UN General Assembly last year, the Resolution on Western Sahara was adopted by consensus for the first time in many years. Ireland and the Twelve consider the parties concerned to be bound by the terms of that Resolution, which stressed the importance of the UN peace plan, including the holding of a referendum oganised and supervised by the United Nations in co-operation with the Organisation of African Unity.  I stressed this point in my meeting with the Foreign Minister of <Col N="824" /> Morocco, His Excellency Mr. Abd Al-Latif Filali last week.</P>
    <P>The visit of the UN Secretary General to Morocco, Algeria and the Western Sahara in March increased the momentum. Concrete modalities for the referendum are now under discussion.  The Twelve strongly support the efforts of the UN Secretary General to secure the co-operation of all parties concerned so that the timetable envisaged for the preparation of the referendum can be respected.  I am satisfied that this is to the benefit of the Sahrawi people.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the hardship caused to those whose social welfare entitlements have been reduced as a result of the new dependency arrangements which were brought into force in 1986 by the EC Equality Directive and whose social welfare increased in the last number of budgets have not kept pace with this reduction; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>When the new definition of dependency in line with the requirements of equal treatment was introduced in November 1986 an adult dependant allowance ceased to be payable in respect of any person who was in receipt of a social welfare payment in their own right or working and earning in excess of £50 per week.  Also the rate of child dependant allowance payable to any recipient in these circumstances was reduced to half the standard rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Transitional alleviating payments were introduced to cushion the loss of the adult dependant allowance to the families involved.  A payment of £20 per week was made to recipients where, at November 1986, both spouses were in receipt of a social welfare payment.  Any child dependant allowance in this situation was split 50:50 between the two claimants.  A payment of £10 per week was made to a <Col N="831" /> person whose wife was working and could no longer qualify as a dependant and the claimant was allowed to retain the full child dependant allowance.</P>
    <P>In addition, where both spouses were in receipt of a social welfare payment, and the husband was entitled to a £20 alleviating payment, he could also qualify for additional assistance, special equal treatment payment, in respect of rent, mortgage or agreements for the purchase of essential household goods entered into prior to the introduction of the new dependency arrangements in November 1986.  The amount payable was the amount of the loss suffered by the family or of the reckonable outgoings whichever was the less.</P>
    <P>The transitional payments when introduced were intended to last for 12 months only.  In view, however, of the hardship that would have resulted for families by the abrupt ending of the payments, the Government decided that they should be phased out over a longer period, in line with annual budget increases.  This method of reduction in the alleviating payment ensures that there is no overall loss of social welfare income to the household.</P>
    <P>The £20 payment was reduced to £18 and to £16 in line with the increases in the 1988 and 1989 budgets respectively. The £10 element of the other alleviating payment was reduced to £9 and to £8 in these budgets.  From end July 1990 the transitional payments will be £14 where both spouses are in receipt of a social welfare payment, and £7 plus half the child dependant allowance rate where the wife earns over £55 per week, increased from £50 from the beginning of June 1990.  There has been no reduction in the special payments since their introduction in November 1986.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, it is vitally <Col N="839" /> important that any hospital should have, and be seen to have, the full confidence of the public who avail of its services and who, in the case of a public voluntary hospital, as taxpayers provide the bulk of its finances.</P>
      <P>A situation has now arisen where the circumstances surrounding the tragic case of the Dunne family have given rise to comment which might undermine public confidence in the overall services provided by the hospital.  As I indicated in my reply to an earlier question on this issue, if the circumstances of this or any other case point to the need for a review of polices or procedures in a particular service it will be dealt with as part of an overall review of the service concerned.</P>
      <P>I reiterated these views and my concern that public confidence in the hospital should not be undermined when I met recently with the deputy chairman and the master of the hospital.</P>
      <P>I was pleased therefore to learn last week of the decision by the hospital to invite a distinguished nominee of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists from the United Kingdom to undertake within the coming weeks an independent review of the hospital's practices and procedures.</P>
