      <P>It is proposed to take No. 9.  Private Members' Business shall be No. 19.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, Sir, could I ask you if you will reconsider your decision on the question I put down to the Taoiseach on 1 February asking if he had made any arrangements to meet the UK Prime Minister?  I received a reply from you, Sir, saying that the question was disallowed and I quote:</P>
      <P>It is a repeat in view of the reply to Question 12 of 5 December 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite sure, Sir, that you will point out to me that Standing Orders forbid repeats of this kind &mdash; that is a perfectly sensible rule &mdash; but, I submit, Sir, in the circumstances we are in today, and particularly over the last couple of months when the Taoiseach was evolving his thinking about Anglo-Irish relations, that they are two entirely separate questions. The question on 5 December 1989 was to ascertain whether the Taoiseach had any plans then to meet the UK Prime Minister, and the question of 1 February 1990 asked whether the Taoiseach had any plans now to meet the UK Prime Minister.  It is an evolving situation, so I <Col N="890" /> put it to you, Sir, that that kind of question should be allowed on the basis that it is not a repeat and that the Taoiseach can occasionally change his mind and catch up with changing circumstances.  I would like to ask you, Sir, to reconsider, and allow the question today.</P>

      <P>I will look at the matter again, Deputy, but I think the Deputy knows full well that the utmost care and attention is given to questions of this kind.  However, I will look at it again in the light of what you have said.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>There is widespread speculation at present that some changes will be brought about to the Fisheries (Amendment) Act (No. 32), 1987.  May I ask the Taoiseach if this is so and if he will give an assurance that if changes are to be made they will be made in this House.  This is an assurance he always sought when he was Leader of the Opposition, that important announcements would be made in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled a similar question to the one Deputy Spring has just asked the Taoiseach, and on that occasion the Taoiseach answered the question.  If it was answered previously, I cannot see why it cannot be answered this morning in view of the great anxiety that exists among everybody concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, with your assent I wish to ask the Taoiseach two questions about impending legislation.  The first is if the competition Bill, which is particularly urgent in view of the necessity of ensuring that the consumer benefits to the full from the value-added tax reductions and improvements in the strength of our currency, will be introduced this session?  This Bill has been promised for some time.  The Taoiseach's office very kindly conveyed to my secretary the information that this Bill will not be introduced in this session. Could I ask the Taoiseach if he will ensure that it is introduced this session in view of the urgency of dealing with the problem of inflation against the background of the need for moderate pay settlements?</P>

We are lucky to be here, a Cheann Comhairle as most of the town of Clonmel, especially at the lower end, is flooded and cars are now submerged and roads are damaged.</P>

      <P>The budget has been described by the Government as a green budget.  In support of that description the Government have drawn our attention to the Environment Action Programme published a few days before the introduction of the budget in this House.  The environment action programme itself has already achieved its first and principal objective, esentially a public relations exercise.  Its second objective will be achieved over the next five months or so, which is to put the Government on side <Col N="899" /> for the duration of the Green Presidency. In his speech to the Environment Committee of the European Parliament on Wednesday, 24 January the Minister for the Environment highlighted, in large print, 13 issues which he hoped the Presidency would advance.  Is it purely coincidental that these are also the main areas for action in the Minister's plan and that, by and large, they cover areas already in train within the European Community?</P>
      <P>My party fully support most of the objectives of the plan, that is the banning of smokey coal, the proper treatment of sewage, the quality of drinking water, the provision of information on the environment generally, the promotion of recycling, all of which have represented our policy on the environment for some time.</P>
      <P>It is much too soon for anybody to start claiming a victory.  Fianna Fáil Governments have a long record of making very laudable policy declarations but failing to implement them in practice.  In the environment area alone there are several examples.  Last summer when dead fish were being hauled out of rivers we were promised tough new laws on water pollution. The water pollution Bill now before the House has been considerably weakened by a deal between the Government and the IFA.</P>
      <P>Two years ago we were told the Government were going to take Britain to the European Court over Sellafield. Now we are told that that idea has been dropped.  We were told there would be introduced strict new building regulations to ensure public safety and value for money for home buyers.  The Building Control Bill still before the Seanad, if anything, undermines building control in major urban areas.  It has been the same with planning compensation, water rates, local government reform and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any serious assessment of the Government's Environment Action Programme has to take account of this record, of the practice not matching the promise.  In the programme the small print does not confirm the exciting promises which are in the big print.  The impression is being <Col N="900" /> given that an extra £1,000 million is being provided for the environment, but this is not so.  The Public Capital Programme for the environment is simply being extended over the course of the ten years. What has been done is that a forward projection has been made of what the Public Capital Programme will be over the next ten years and that is £1,000 million. If, for example, we look at the area of sewage treatment and water quality we find that in 1989 £65 million was provided for sanitary services and £70 million is provided in 1990.  The £300 million and £400 million provided for sewage treatment and water supply is simply a projection of what the Public Capital Programme will be over the next ten years.</P>
    <P>The reality is that the budget is providing £20 million for the environment.  That is welcome, but it is not £1,000 million as was promised.  Secondly, the £20 million has to be seen in the context of the severe cutbacks which have taken place in the environment allocation for the past number of years, particularly the allocations to local authorities, the bodies in the front line of environment protection. The £20 million that is being allocated in the budget will not make up for the severe cuts which taken place in financing and staffing of local authorities, the bodies in the front line of environment protection. The £20 million that is being allocated in the budget will not make up for the severe cuts which have taken place in financing and staffing of local authorities.</P>
    <P>The extent to which the £20 million will contribute to an improvement in the environment is very marginal indeed.  Let us take the question of the banning of bituminous coal.  Three years ago the smog problem merited only a defective Air Pollution Act, from the same Minister who is now promising to ban bituminous coal.  At that time he was told, indeed by some of his own back benchers, that the Bill he was then putting through the House would not be sufficient to deal with the smog problem in Dublin.  A few weeks ago the Taoiseach dismissed the smog problem and now suddenly it is so serious that bituminous coal must be <Col N="901" /> banned by 1 October.  Does all this mean that Dublin's air will be clean next winter?  I think it does not.  First of all, what is being banned is the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal. Many households stock up with coal during the summer and there is nothing to stop CDL from selling as much bituminous coal as they wish before 1 October.  The winter of 1990-91 could still be fairly smoggy.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the principal reason why most householders have not voluntarily switched to low smoke fuels is that they are dearer.  The Environment Action Plan and the budget do not tackle the price of and profits from low smoke fuels. What has happened to the Government's inquiry into the prices charged by the CDL monopoly?  Why was the opportunity not taken in the budget to reduce VAT on low smoke fuels?  Why did the budget increase VAT on one of the low smoke fuels &mdash; electricity &mdash; which could be used as a substitute for bituminous coal?</P>
    <P>In the budget, £3 million is being provided to offset the extra financial burden on householders but that is simply not adequate.  Ironically, it is the same as the cost of security at Dublin Castle for the duration of the EC Presidency.  The Minister does not appear to have thought out the implications of the allocation of such a small amount of money.  There was a statement, reported in the press, that the £3 million would be allocated through the national fuel scheme.  If that is the case, the vast majority of people on low incomes will not benefit from it at all because, as we all know, the national fuel scheme applies only to certain categories of social welfare recipients.  Following the budget, there will be 15,000 people on social employment schemes.  These people do not qualify for the national fuel scheme and apparently will not qualify for assistance from the £3 million.  When the Minister for the Environment spoke here on the budget he did not take the opportunity to clarify exactly who will benefit from this, who will be assisted and how it will be done.</P>
    <P>In the area of conversion grants the <Col N="902" /> Minister is proposing to halt the conversion to smokeless heating systems. The amount allocated in the budget for conversion grants is £4 million.  That is made up of the £3 million which was already included in the 1990 Estimates and the £1 million which had not been spent in 1989.  Therefore no extra money is being provided for conversion to smokeless heating systems.</P>
    <P>We have been told that no further special control area orders will be confirmed. In other words, the Government are abandoning the Air Pollution Act. Outside of Ballyfermot, no new smoke control zones will be made.  I have been informed that the surveys which were being carried out by Dublin Corporation to establish additional smoke control zones have been abandoned because the corporation have interpreted that the Air Pollution Act is being abandoned and that no further smoke control zones will be made.</P>
    <P>The position of workers in the coal industry has not been taken into account. It is far too glib simply to state that these people can transfer to selling low smoke fuels.  The implications of the ban on their jobs and earnings will have to be negotiated with them and, again, no provision is made in the budget for any of these implications.</P>
    <P>Of the £20 million, £1 million is being made available for the provision of environmental information.  The bulk of this is to be provided through the new service, ENFO.  I have no doubt that the various publications and brochures which will be distributed and published and the surveys which will be carried out by this body will feature the Minister's name, if not his photograph quite prominently. The problem of environment information is not one of distribution.  The Minister for the Environment came in here and made great play of the fact that everybody from children doing school projects to the general public would be able to walk into this one-stop-shop in downtown Dublin and get all kinds of information on the environment.  I would suggest that the problem is not with the distribution of environmental information.  In many <Col N="903" /> ways the media already provide to the public such information as is available about the environment.</P>
    <P>The problem with environmental information is that it is not available in the first place either because there is inadequate monitoring or because the results of monitoring are not made available to the public.  Again, no provision has been made, either in the Environment Action Plan or in the budget, to deal with that problem.  The question of assembling the information is dealt with in one sentence which states that this will be a matter for the Environment Protection Agency. Ironically, the £500,000 provided for in the Estimates for the proposed Environment Protection Agency is less than the amount being provided for the establishment of the one-stop-shop.</P>
    <P>Great play has been made about the money being provided for recycling.  We have been told that £500,000 will be provided for what is called small scale recycling. That is a term that is very aptly chosen because I cannot see how the recycling projects could be anything other than small scale due to the amount of money being provided.  The £500,000 would work out at an average of £5,000 per local authority.  How much recycling would a local authority carry out for £5,000?  The reality is that most local authorities are already in a crisis situation as regards waste disposal.  They do not have the money to replace refuse trucks in order to carry out the normal collection and disposal of domestic refuse, which they have been engaged in for years.</P>
    <P>Quite a number of rural local authorities are getting out of the business of collecting and disposing of refuse and are handing it over to private companies who will charge householders individually for it.  As a result of cuts during the past couple of years local authorities are getting out of waste disposal and on the other hand £500,000 in a nice public relations exercise is being provided for the recycling of water.  That will work out at about £5,000 per local authority and will not provide for much recycling.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="904" /> The Minister referred to the number of appeals to An Bord Pleanála and drew attention to the fact that in 1989 appeals had increased by 34 per cent over 1988 and by 24 per cent over 1987.  To deal with the number of appeals going through An Bord Pleanála the Minister decided to increase the charges so as to discourage the public from making appeals.  A charge of £100 for a large developer could probably be paid from petty cash but it is a lot when it comes to an individual or a residents' association making an appeal. Apart from the £100-£50 to make the appeal and a further £50 for an oral hearing &mdash; people may have already been charged for the distribution of planning lists by the local authorities concerned. We are getting here a disincentive to the public to exercise their right to lodge appeals against developments with which they are not happy.  It is in fact a charge on democracy.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment laid emphasis on what he considered to be a recovery in the construction industry. There is no doubt that the increased employment in the construction industry is to be welcomed but we have to look closely at housing policy.  Quite a lot of the construction activity has been taking place at the upper end of the market.  In my constituency we have 800 people on the local authority waiting lists between Dún Laoghaire Corporation and the county council, and we have young families who cannot afford to buy their own homes while at the same time great activity is taking place at the upper end of the market and houses are going for £750,000.  Ironically, the former home of the late President de Valera a man who was on record as having said that nobody was worth more than £1,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I appreciate that.  Houses are being built on that ground in the order of the huge prices mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People want to see the value of their houses increasing but we have to look at the effect of that.  A house which cost <Col N="905" /> £30,000 a year ago now costs £50,000.  A young couple who could afford to buy a house a year ago can no longer afford to buy one.  On the other hand what is happening in the local authority area is scandalous.  We are told that there are now 20,000 applicants throughout the country waiting for local authority houses.  Just over 300 houses were built last year even though we had been promised 900 houses.  The Minister in his statement promised that 4,000 houses would be built this year.  That is dishonest first because he double counted.  The Minister said there would be 1,200 house starts and 1,200 house finishes and made 2,400 out of that and he also said that another 1,600 people would be vacating their houses.  None of that will happen. If we go by last year's experience a promise of 1,200 house starts will end up in the order of 400 starts and 1,600 people will not vacate their houses.  Any local authority will say that the number of casual vacancies occurring are down to a trickle.  Even looking at the most optimistic scenario and assuming that 1,000 houses will be built, at that rate it would take 20 years to clear the existing local authority housing lists.</P>
    <P>There is a serious crisis in the provision of local authorities.  In my constituency we have applied for sanction for a small scheme of 50 houses and a contractor is already lined up to build the houses.  The application has been with the Department of the Environment since February 1987 and there is still no sign of sanction being given.  If 1,200 houses are to be built this year the Minister should quickly tell local authorities that they have the sanction to go ahead and build schemes they have already submitted.  Even if the Minister were to give that go ahead today it would be some time before construction could commence and houses would be ready for occupation.</P>
    <P>There has been no mention of the need for refurbishment of older housing stock. In reply to me in the House last week the Minister for the Environment gave information which showed that there are 3,000 local authority houses throughout the country which do not have indoor <Col N="906" /> toilets and that there are 8,000 local authority houses without bathrooms. Approaching the 21st century it is a scandal that we still have houses built by the British in Victorian times under a Victorian housing policy which have not been renovated and refurbished, after 70 years of native Government.</P>

      <P>In the time left I will deal with the issue of people on social employment schemes.  The Minister informed us that he intended to have an additional 5,000 people on social employment schemes bringing the total to 15,000.  That is welcomed and very much appreciated by many communities in which social employment schemes are doing good work.  Many of the people on social employment schemes get considerable benefit from them.  However, many people on these schemes suffer a worsening in their living standards.  They are caught in a no man's land between people on social welfare and those who are employed.  They are not employees nor are they on social welfare.  There are serious anomalies in the conditions which apply to people on social employment schemes, and they should be addressed. These people are not insured and when they come off the schemes they go on to unemployment assistance.  They do not have the benefits of people who are on social welfare.  They do not get the free fuel and if money for low smoke fuels is to be distributed through that scheme they will not qualify for that either.  They do not qualify for free meat or for the Christmas bonus.  Many of the people on these schemes feel sore that they are caught in this in-between situation without the benefits of regular employment and without the benefits of being on social welfare.  I hope that will be addressed by the Ministers for Labour and Social Welfare when they introduce legislation in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Our task in this year's <Col N="907" /> budget was to maintain economic progress, to encourage and facilitate the continuation of social consensus, and to spread the gains of recovery so that all the people, but in particular the less well-off, could benefit from it.</P>
      <P>That we are in a position to introduce a budget of this kind is a vindication of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> It was established because all concerned were, in the words of the programme, &ldquo;conscious of the grave state of our economic and social life&rdquo;.  The commitments made by the Government to the social partners in relation to overall economic policy, tax reform, social equity and employment creation have been honoured and in many cases exceeded.  The budget itself is based on the achievements of the programme over the past two and a half years.  Many of the things that are included in it would have been impossible at the start, but are possible now because Government, trade unions, employers and farmers have been able to work together successfully for the benefit of all.</P>
      <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> represents a new successful formula for national economic management, better than anything we have ever tried before. The programme involves the social partners in deciding at national level the main economic and social policy objectives over a three-year period, and provides for regular consultation during its implementation.  Consensus between Government and the social partners where it has been successfully developed is the key to progress all over Western Europe, and has brought new levels of prosperity through industrial peace.  Here in Ireland the progress it has brought is impressive and unprecedented.  Its potential, if sustained, is even greater still.  I have no doubt that the fastest route to higher employment and higher living standards is to continue along this road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consensus behind the programme is reflected in the budget.  The programme requires that parallel progress be made on a number of fronts; employment, debt reduction, tax reform and <Col N="908" /> social equity.  They are all seen as interdependent. The budget is prudent, responsive and caring, but it is also carefully designed to underpin economic progress and to propel it forward.  For us the annual budget must not be just an economic and financial document, but a social programme as well.</P>
    <P>The 1990 budget and Estimates provide for: further consolidation of the financial position; significant personal tax relief; a downward pressure on inflation; a move towward tax harmonisation; economic growth and employment creation; major development of the economic and social infrastructure; a series of integrated measures to improve the position of all those on low incomes; assistance for families, the elderly, persons living alone and groups in special need of assistance; further resources for priorities in health care and education and a comprehensive programme for the improvement of our environment.</P>
    <P>Nineteen eighty-nine was another milestone on the road to national recovery. There was strong economic growth and investment, a healthy trade balance, and a further improvement in employment.</P>
    <P>Last year saw another major improvement in the position of the public finances, the prudent management of which remains crucial for national recovery. The restoration of investment and consumer confidence, created directly by the policy of budgetary discipline, were predominant in securing the improvements that have taken place in the economy. The decision to restore the public finances within the agreed framework of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was fundamental and the fountain from which everything else flowed.</P>
    <P>For the third year running, the outturn of the 1989 budget was substantially better than had been targeted for. Government borrowing is now reduced to its lowest level for about 40 years.  In just three years the Exchequer borrowing requirement was drastically reduced from £2,145 million in 1986 to £479 million in 1989 and from 13 per cent to 2.4 per cent of GNP.  The target set for 1993 <Col N="909" /> in the National Development Plan has therefore been achieved in the first year of the plan, four years ahead of schedule.</P>
    <P>The current budget deficit in 1989 is 1.3 per cent of GNP, the lowest since 1973.  We are now on course to have a balance in the current budget by 1993. The relationship of national debt to GNP, a key indicator, has improved dramatically. It has fallen sharply from 131 per cent in 1988 to 123 per cent in 1989, very close to the National Development Plan target of 120 per cent by 1993.  It must be understood, however, that figures are provisional at this stage, but they represent a vitally important turnaround. This reduction, however, is only a start, and we must take advantage of the present favourable circumstances and trends to continue unremittingly in our efforts to keep it moving steadily downwards.</P>
    <P>Under no circumstances must we ease up on budgetary discipline or allow any interruption of the steady progress now being made.  As the EC Commission's <i>Annual Economic Report</i> states: &ldquo;In Belgium, Ireland, and, to a lesser extent, in The Netherlands budget consolidation needs to be continued.  These countries should exploit better the present strength of economic growth to reduce their budgetary imbalances&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In 1990 overall borrowing by the Exchequer will be down to £449 million or 2.1 per cent of GNP, and the current budget deficit will be reduced to 1.2 per cent of GNP, marginally below last year's outturn.  In assessing the adequacy of these targets some of the commentators have predicted that they may well be bettered during the course of the year, and the Government will make every effort to achieve such an outcome.  To measure the distance we have travelled in three years, it is necessary to recall that in the 1987 budget the borrowing target was set at well over £1,800 million and the current budget deficit target at almost 7 per cent of GNP.  In this year's budget we have built on the large improvement that took place in 1989, and on the strength of it we have revised our <Col N="910" /> medium-term targets.  The new objectives are to eliminate the current budget deficit and reduce the debt-GNP ratio to about 100 per cent by 1993.</P>
    <P>We are now clearly stating that we intend to revert to the practice of balancing the current budget as soon as possible. The practice of deficit budgeting on the current side embarked on since 1973 has brought disaster.  It was very much in vogue as an economic doctrine at that time.  Claims that it would promote growth and employment have proved to be a fraud and the very opposite has been the case.  We intend to draw a line under that unhappy 20 year period, and to get back to balanced annual budgets.  When we do I am certain that no Government will ever again dare depart from that essential discipline.</P>
    <P>In the light of all that requires to be done in the intervening period, both domestically and in response to EC requirements, we have set ourselves challenging and ambitious financial targets by 1993.  They are, however, necessary, because we must make ourselves less vulnerable to unforeseen changes in international interest rates and exchange rate movements.</P>
    <P>The foreign debt, at just over £9 billion, is £100 million below its 1986 level. This, in fact, represents a rapid fall in the proportion of foreign debt to GNP. Fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates contributed significantly in the past to the build-up of the foreign debt and to the high cost of servicing the national debt as a whole.  They were responsible for some of the financial setbacks experienced in the mid-eighties.  A further reduction in borrowing, leading to a lessening of our exposure to unfavourable international financial developments, is therefore a vital priority.  It is essential that we continue to make good use of the present relatively favourable climate to insulate ourselves from dangers that may arise in the future and ensure that we will not find ourselves once again in an unsustainable external financial position.</P>
    <P>Everyone should fully understand that it is still costing the taxpayer well over £2 <Col N="911" /> billion to pay the cost each year of the national debt.  Because of higher international interest rates, this cost was set to increase by slightly over £200 million in 1990.  In these circumstances it is essential that the total national debt of £25 billion be reduced.  In the meantime it must be managed to the highest professional standards, so as to keep the annual cost of the debt down to the minimum.  Last year over £100 million was saved on debt servicing, partly due to lower borrowing than anticipated, but also due to efficient debt management.</P>
    <P>New sources of funding our borrowing requirements have been introduced, and the programme of refinancing foreign loans at lower cost through swaps and other arrangements is continuing to be implemented with considerable success. Market conditions have been changing significantly, as restrictions on capital movements are dismantled.  Perhaps the most significant development in the past few years has been the large inflow from overseas into the Irish gilt market, as confidence in the management of the Irish economy and in the stability of our currency grows.</P>
    <P>The new national debt office, which will become fully operational this year, will recruit highly-expert, professional personnel with modern financial services market skills.  This addition to the capacity of the Department of Finance is necessary for the cost-efficient management of our operations in today's complex sophisticated international financial markets.  It can provide further significant savings from the employment of market expertise and techniques in the day-to-day management of the portfolio.</P>
    <P>The key element in the recent transformation of the public finances and the economy generally has been the reduction in public expenditure over a three year period by over 11 per cent of GNP.  It is dangerous folly to forget this simple truth or to talk and act now as if it were not the reality.  Those who are now stridently condemning some of the difficulties caused by reductions in expenditure without acknowledging the need <Col N="912" /> for the overall reduction are simply deceiving the general public, no matter what their status or role in our community. The increasingly high levels of expenditure, borrowing and taxation that obtained prior to 1987 could not be sustained. The drastic change of policy in 1987 came just in time.</P>
    <P>Taken together, all these demands to restore this or that particular service to their 1986 levels of expenditure amount in effect to a demand to put the whole process of financial recovery into reverse by spending more, taxing more and borrowing more.  To allow the country to slide back again into that disastrous sort of situation, having pulled ourselves out of it at such cost, would be unforgiveable.</P>
    <P>The process of recovery over the last three years has been difficult and has, of necessity, caused problems in a number of areas.  But these have not been nearly so great as might have been expected, and the basic fabric of our public services has been maintained and, in the case of social welfare, significantly improved.</P>
    <P>It is still essential, and will be for many years, to exercise very disciplined control over public expenditure in order to achieve substantial reductions in the national debt as well as coping with other major demands that will arise.</P>
    <P>Strict control of State expenditure was imposed and is still being maintained for no other reason than to safeguard the future economic well-being of the people of this country, which was in serious jeopardy and must still be carefully watched over.  The choice had to be made between continuing with chronic economic and financial problems and being left behind, as Europe moves to economic and monetary union, or take the tough and difficult course of correcting the public finances, improve our economic performance and provide real prospects for a worthwhile future.  We took the right decision and, as a result, the present economic recovery is solidly based and offers real prospects of finally overcoming our problems no matter how difficult and intractable some of them still seem.</P>
    <P>It is, however, vital to appreciate that, despite the encouraging progress <Col N="913" /> achieved to date, the reduction of the national debt, which is proportionally the second largest in Europe after Belgium, must remain a major priority.  We cannot be content to leave a £25 billion debt continuing to impede social as well as economic progress indefinitely.  Our debt-GNP ratio at 123 per cent is over double the OECD average, which is below 60 per cent.  Too many interest groups falsely claiming that our financial problems are over are now demanding greatly increased expenditure over a whole range of services that must ultimately be paid for by the taxpayer.  The reality is that continued economic progress absolutely depends on continuing tight control of public expenditure.  Without that, confidence, particularly international confidence, would rapidly dissipate, and we would soon be back into a poverty trap that would encompass the whole nation.</P>
    <P>This Government are firmly committed to reducing the burden of taxation. But experience in Britain demonstrates clearly that tax reductions must be prudently geared to the overall budgetary situation and their effect on the economy.  In the year 1987, for instance, we could not attempt tax reductions because of the state of the public finances and the size of the current budget deficit.  Subsequent progress has vindicated the wisdom of that decision. Despite the dramatic improvements since, it would be unwise to rush into precipitate tax reductions that would have serious adverse effects on overall economic stability and on the balance of payments.  Our policy must be to achieve the overall reduction that is required over an agreed time span.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the progress already made and prudent economic management, we can now look forward to a future of lower taxes, increasing employment, and a steady reduction in the burden of debt.  This will require realism and responsibility by Government and the social partners, so that in our impatience to eliminate our current economic and social problems we do not attempt to do more than can be financed <Col N="914" /> and sustained by the level of resources available to us.  It is vital in the competitive world of 1992 with exchange controls removed, a Community-imposed limit on budgetary deficits, and the demands of tax harmonisation, that the fundamentals of our economy be kept in good order, as otherwise we are likely to fall seriously behind our European partners.</P>
    <P>In 1989, for the third year running, there was positive economic growth. Compared to the complete stagnation of most of the 1980s, economic growth in the years 1987 to 1989 averaged 3.5 per cent.  This is a better performance than anyone would have considered possible at the beginning of 1987.  There is every sign that economic growth will continue around this level in 1990.  This level of growth has been made possible by the improved financial position, while growth itself has in turn contributed to further improving the financial situation creating what is now known as the &ldquo;virtuous circle&rdquo;.  This has also enabled us to start catching up with our EC partners.  The <i>Annual Economic Report</i> of the EC Commission shows that GDP per head at current prices and purchasing power standards in Ireland rose from 63.4 per cent of the EC average in 1986 to 66 per cent in 1989 and is expected to reach 67.3 per cent in 1990.  Together with Spain, we have started to gain ground faster than anyone else.  We have a long way to go, however, and will need sustained growth over the 1990s.</P>
    <P>Inflation, while rising to 4 per cent in 1989, remained below the EC and OECD average, and several points below the British inflation rate of 7 to 8 per cent, and only 1 per cent above the German rate.  Our position as one of &ldquo;the better performing member states&rdquo; is the subject of some favourable comment in the Commission's <i>Annual Economic Report,</i> which states:</P>
    <P>The narrow band countries of the EMS (of which we are one) form a group in which the present degree of price convergence and monetary cohesion, despite the recent acceleration of <Col N="915" /> inflation, is broadly satisfactory.  In these countries, the priority during the first stage of EMU should be to win back the ground lost and subsequently to maintain this result.</P>
    <P>There are signs that inflation will ease back in the course of 1990 towards 3 per cent or less by year's end.</P>
    <P>The budget is specifically designed to help reduce the rate of inflation.  This year there has been no increase in excise duties, in fact there have been some reductions.  Nothing demonstrates more clearly the change in this country's public finances than the decision to reduce the standard rate of VAT from 25 per cent to 23 per cent.  This is not alone a first step on the difficult road to EC tax harmonisation, but it is also a contribution to keeping down the rate of inflation. Even though last December's ECOFIN Council acknowledged that the budgetary difficulties posed by harmonisation for Ireland need to be addressed, and will be studied by the Commission, tax harmonisation will still present us with a major budgetary problem in the years immediately ahead.  The net result of the changes announced in the budget will be to reduce the consumer price index by 0.75 per cent.</P>
    <P>There will be a significant further increase in real incomes, as a result of the wage provisions of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the significant personal tax concessions and the antiinflation thrust of this budget.  Under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, real take home pay for workers on average industrial earnings will have increased by between 4 per cent and 8.5 per cent over the three years of the programme, taking tax reductions into account.  It is very important to keep inflation down, not only for reasons of competitiveness and currency stability, when exchange controls will no longer provide the same degree of protection as in the past, but also, of course in the special interest of all those on low incomes.</P>
    <P>The fall in interest rates of 5 to 6 per cent in 1987-88 gave an initial boost to <Col N="916" /> economic recovery, when it was most needed.  The rise in interest rates over the last nine months has been due to international factors, in particular the rise in interest rates in Germany and the weakness of sterling.  Nevertheless, compared with 1986, the differential with UK interest rates has improved by 6 per cent and with German interest rates by 5 per cent.  This is the result of our better domestic situation.  Roughly a quarter of the domestic national debt is now held by non-residents, mainly in the Community. This development is directly related to the Government's firm commitment to a policy of exchange rate stability, and a strong currency policy within the European Monetary System, as well as the financial discipline that must go with it.</P>
    <P>Nineteen eighty-nine was a third year of buoyant export growth.  The 15 per cent growth in exports achieved in 1987 and 1988 is likely to have been exceeded in 1989, with the trade surplus continuing well in excess of £2 billion and with the balance of payments also remaining in surplus for the third year running.  This is clear evidence of our status as a successful trading nation.  Relatively few OECD countries have both balance of trade and balance of payments surpluses at the present time, Japan, Germany, Benelux, Norway, New Zealand, and ourselves.</P>
    <P>With the rest of the Community we have built up a £2.5 billion trade surplus, including a £500 million surplus with the Federal Republic of Germany.  Our exports to Japan, though less than half imports, were up by a third in 1989, and are over £300 million.  An interesting feature of our expanding export trade is the fact that exports to the Soviet Union in 1989 have increased by two and a half times the 1988 level.</P>
    <P>Industrial production over the last three years has put in its best sustained performance ever, with 10 per cent growth or more in volume over the last three years.  With the renewed flow of investment during the past two years, there is no reason why our good export performance should not be sustained, with any weakness in the UK market <Col N="917" /> this year being offset by more buoyant markets in Europe.</P>
    <P>Translating economic growth and improved conditions into a more rapid rate of employment creation is now the Government's top priority.  Our aim must be to step up the level of net job creation, as envisaged in the National Development Plan.</P>
    <P>The employment situation since 1987 has been turned round, though the pace of progress is not anything like as fast as we would wish.  In the year to December 1988 unemployment fell by 7,000.  In the year to December 1989 the fall was nearly 12,000.  Average unemployment at 231,500 fell by 10,000 last year compared with 6,000 the previous year.  The fall in unemployment has therefore been accelerating. Average unemployment this year is estimated to fall to 222,000.</P>
    <P>In the two years to mid-April 1989 net employment rose by 10,000.  When the drop in public sector employment and the numbers on FÁS employment schemes are taken into account, underlying net job creation outside of farming was over 30,000.  All forecasters are predicting a rise in numbers employed of at least 13,000 in the year to April 1990, figures that will only be published by the autumn. On an annual basis net growth in employment is estimated to accelerate from 5,000 in 1988, to 10,000 in 1989 and to 13,000 in 1990.  Further progress in increasing employment is projected thereafter, and will have an impact in reducing unemployment and emigration. To assist in our own efforts to translate higher economic growth into employment we have sought the advice of the European Commission about additional measures and approaches that might be adopted.</P>
    <P>Our policy of creating the maximum possible level of jobs is based on the following elements:</P>
    <P>First, the pursuit of the correct macroeconomic policies, so as to create a favourable climate for investment and job creation.</P>
    <P>Secondly, to maintain the growth of <Col N="918" /> the economy which the Programme for National Recovery has brought about.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, to maintain the social consensus so as to continue to improve competitiveness in a climate of industrial peace.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, to reduce disincentives to employment by the reform and streamlining of the tax and social welfare systems.</P>
    <P>Fifthly, through the National Development Plan to actively encourage investment, improve the efficiency and capacity of the economy and to provide the structures and the trained personnel necessary to secure maximum development in key sectors.</P>
    <P>On the personnel side the Government plan to increase the capacity of our universities in consultation with the colleges themselves, so that an extra 3,600 student places can be provided over the next three to four years.  The social employment scheme is being expanded by 5,000 places and a new and interesting employment training scheme is being introduced, which will provide places in private firms for an additional 1,000 people with specific job opportunities in mind.</P>
    <P>The outstanding characteristic of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> is that almost all its objectives have been successfully achieved, something not very common with national economic plans here or elsewhere.  Between them the industrial agencies are estimated to have created about 21,500 new jobs in manufacturing and international services in 1989, in excess of the target set in the programme.  In all, some 60,000 new jobs have been provided to date under the programme.  Net employment in manufacturing industry increased by over 6,000 in the course of 1989.  The number of redundancies was down by 42 per cent in 1989 from 23,000 to marginally over 13,000.  This compares with redundancies of 30,000 or more in 1983-84.  This means that gross job creation will have a far more positive impact on net employment <Col N="919" /> creation.  The number of days lost in industrial disputes is the lowest ever.</P>
    <P>The trade unions can justifiably claim to have delivered on their side of the agreement, and the effect of good industrial relations cannot be overestimated in their effect on efficiency, security of employment, investment and frequently on the very survival of enterprises.  The European Commission have again recently stressed the importance of maintaining conditions favourable to job-creating investment, and the essential contribution that moderate real wage increases have made to this objective.</P>
    <P>The programme has made a major contribution to the improvement in the climate for investment, and investment has materialised.  Investment as a whole increased by 10 per cent last year, and is forecast to increase by a similar amount this year, the first increase since the early eighties, and the surest sign of recovery. 1989 was a buoyant year for industrial investment.  The large Intel semi-conductor manufacturing project which will in time create 2,600 jobs, Motorola, and the Fujitsu Isotec project from Japan are examples of some of the outstanding projects won by Ireland.  It may be of interest to the House to know that the German economics minister, speaking in the Bundestag recently, advised, in relation to direct investment, &ldquo;the responsible authorities in the GDR should look at what countries like Ireland and Spain have achieved in recent years&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus is going ahead with a major aircraft servicing project to create 560 jobs, which is evidence of the Government's commitment to job creation by expansion in the State sector.  An even larger project is planned by GPA and leading continental airlines in Shannon. There have also been significant investments in the food processing sector and in computers and clothing.</P>
    <P>In 1990 the job creation targets for industry agreed with the social partners will also be met.  There is a continuing inflow of new industrial investment, and there is a very strong pipeline of overseas projects to carry forward the current <Col N="920" /> momentum as a number of recent announcements have shown.  During 1989, in fact, Ireland increased its market share of international mobile investment. We will be continuing to look for suitable new niche activities, where we can obtain a market lead, such as remote data processing. We also need to intensify the linkages of overseas industry with the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>However, the key to industrial success in the nineties will be the presence of a strong indigenous industrial sector, of small, medium and large scale companies, that are capable of becoming a force in the European market.  Success will depend on such factors as the quality and commitment of management, the skills and training of the workforce, the overall efficiency of the enterprise, good industrial relations, professional marketing and a well-focused range of back-up services from the Government and their agencies.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the International Financial Services Centre in Dublin is well and successfully underway.  It represents the Government's determination to take up any opportunity which exists for Ireland to share in the worldwide expansion of activity in the services sector.  Right from the start, our priority has been to create in the centre the right environment with the right combination of a high standard of regulation and supervision and an attractive fiscal incentive regime based on the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax.</P>
    <P>Our strategy in this regard has been justified by the success to date of the centre.  At the end of January, a total of 86 projects had been approved &mdash; of which up to 50 have already begun to trade in temporary premises outside the Custom House Docks area.  These projects will transfer into the area, once suitable accommodation is available there. The projects include many of the leading Japanese, German and US banks and financial institutions.</P>
    <P>The 86 projects approved to date involve commitments to a total of over 1,500 new jobs over the next few years, and the Government are hopeful that <Col N="921" /> many companies will exceed their commitments, as the full potential of the centre is realised by the companies coming into it.</P>
    <P>There continues to be significant interest from both domestic and international financial services companies in locating new international business in the general area of the Custom House Docks.  These further projects will add to the employment opportunities there, and the Government are confident that the employment targets will rise to at least 2,000 new jobs during this coming year.</P>
    <P>Nineteen hundred and eighty-nine witnessed a strong revival of the construction industry, with current sales up by 20 per cent, the number of new house completions up by 13 per cent, and employment in construction firms with five or more employees up by 10 per cent.  The general improvement in the domestic economy, increased investment including finance from the Structural Funds, and the urban renewal scheme have all contributed to a greatly improved outlook for the construction industry.  While reductions in Government capital expenditure and in various housing subsidies in 1987-88 caused some difficulties and disappointment at that time, there can be little doubt that in the event we now have a much healthier and more securely based construction industry.</P>
    <P>Investment in all sectors of the economy will be underpinned by the National Development Plan, which will absorb over £3 billion from the EC Structural Funds over the period 1989 to 1993.  Commitments are set to increase from £462 million in 1989 to £557 million in 1990, a 54 per cent increase over the £361 million figure for 1988.  These funds will provide a significant boost to the economy at present, and enable us to carry out many urgent projects that would otherwise have been delayed by lack of funds.  We have been able to increase the Public Capital Programme by 18 per cent for the first time since 1982, but without increasing Exchequer capital borrowing.  We intend to revert to the situation that obtained up to 1973, that borrowing, if <Col N="922" /> any, after 1993 will be in principle for capital purposes only.</P>
    <P>Tourism is another success story of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  In the last three years tourism numbers have increased by 50 per cent, and it is estimated that over 10,000 additional jobs have been created in 1988-89 as a result. The principal policy instruments have been the liberalisation of air transport, lower access fares, the extension of external routes and internal access within Ireland, investment in facilities, activities by means of the business expansion scheme, Structural Funds aid, and assistance for cultural and heritage amenities from the national lottery.  Our plans for the expansion of tourism are on target, and we have provided an additional £2.7 million in the budget this year for increased promotional activities.</P>
    <P>Another undoubted success story of recent years has been the growth of the forestry sector, since we gave new emphasis to it in 1987 by setting up Coillte Teoranta.  Planting, which was only 9,000 hectares in 1986, is expected to be 18,000 hectares in 1989, with the sector now employing 13,000 people.</P>
    <P>Significant progress has also been made in the food industry, the marine sector and horticulture.  In agriculture, while dairying and pig production did well last year, and sheep numbers continued to expand, difficulties were experienced in the beef sector, with the result that a modest but still positive increase in farm incomes of about 5 per cent took place in 1989, bringing the cumulative increase since 1987 close to 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>There is a number of specific measures to assist agriculture in the budget including the increase in the VAT refund to farmers to 2.3 per cent, the placing of agricultural trainees on residential courses on an equal footing with other vocational trainees in regard to payment of fees, and changes in stock relief rules to accommodate farmers whose herds are affected by disease eradication.  In addition, the indexation of capital acquisition tax thresholds in 1990 and future years are intended to be of particular assistance to farmers in facilitating the <Col N="923" /> orderly transfer of farms from one generation to another.</P>
    <P>Most of the specific measures to support employment creation in particular sectors are, of course, contained in the Book of Estimates and the Public Capital Programme.  However, many of the tax changes announced in the budget also have important implications for employment.</P>
    <P>The reduction of tax to reasonable and acceptable levels is an urgent Government priority, but one which will necessarily take time to achieve.</P>
    <P>It is generally acknowledged that the weight of personal taxation and the high levels of indirect tax represent a heavy burden on individuals and families and are also an obstacle to economic development. There can be no serious argument about the disincentive effect of high taxes on employment, about the fact that some of our most skilled people are attracted abroad by more favourable tax regimes to the detriment of our capacity to develop. High levels of indirect tax have also created great difficulties, especially in the Border regions, for business.  Taxation, therefore, is an important aspect of competitiveness, and unfortunately during much of the eighties the severe financial imbalances were translated into an ever increasing burden on the taxpayer.  That is why the improvement in the public finances was of crucial importance as an essential context for any programme of tax reduction.</P>
    <P>The right balance has to be struck between the provision of public services and the impositions the taxpayer can reasonably be asked to bear.  We live in a mixed economy.  Our people expect a satisfactory level of public services, and they also wish to see reasonable provision made for the basic needs and the dignity of pensioners, the unemployed, and those who are in some way deprived or disadvantaged.  We have dearly learned the lesson that these services should be paid for through taxation, and not by borrowing.  In addition, the more advanced countries of Europe show us that the best level of services will be <Col N="924" /> provided by the State that is best able to increase its production of goods and services.  Experience everywhere has shown that the tax system can help or hinder economic development, investment and employment and that changes in taxation should take place gradually. Sudden, major changes in the system can be disruptive of family budgets, corporate investment plans and general economic equilibrium.</P>
    <P>The Government face formidable challenges in relation to taxation, including the reduction of the standard tax rate to 25 per cent, the introduction of a single higher rate, and the requirements of EC tax harmonisation and economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>Over the past few budgets, we have initiated a steady programme of tax reform and tax reduction.  Our first step in 1988 was to widen the standard rate band so that it covered 63 per cent or nearly two-thirds of taxpayers, as we envisaged in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  The standard rate band has been widened again this year so as to maintain that position.</P>
    <P>In last year's budget we began the process of reducing for the first time in over 20 years the standard rate band, and we are continuing the downward process this year.  In the two budgets, 1989 and 1990, the standard rate of tax has been reduced by 5 per cent, from 35 per cent to 30 per cent.  In parallel with this, we have reduced the top rate of tax, which is now paid by many skilled workers, expecially those who are single, by 5 per cent also, from 58 per cent to 53 per cent.  The value of the cumulative concessions made under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> amounts to well over £800 million. That compares with an actual undertaking in the programme of a reduction of £225 million.</P>
    <P>The tax yield from the self-employed has been substantially increased through the introduction of self-assessment, the withholding tax on professional fees and increased powers for the Revenue Commissioners to combat fraud or non-compliance. Although the latest figures available only go as far as 1988, they <Col N="925" /> indicate that the average tax paid by business and professional self-employed taxpayers, which up to and including 1986 was substantially less than the average tax payment by PAYE taxpayers, was significantly more in 1988.  This is an important step towards the equity in our tax system.</P>
    <P>The average income tax payment by self-employed business and professional taxpayers, excluding the impact of the tax amnesty, was 54 per cent higher in 1988 than in 1986.  The Government since 1987 have in fact gone a long way towards redressing the balance between these two sectors.  As a further step the Minister for Finance has announced that every effort will be made to introduce income tax assessment on a current year basis for the self-employed in this year's Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>The Government have in the 1988 budget and again in this year's budget introduced major reforms in corporate taxation.  As a result of a halving of accelerated capital allowances and a corresponding reduction in the rate of corporation tax, the yield from this tax, which in real terms was static or falling during the mid-eighties, has increased by a third from £257 million in 1987 to an expected yield of £338 million this year.</P>
    <P>The measures in this budget will, leaving aside any increased yield from the ending of export sales relief that will not have full impact till 1992, of themselves increase the amount paid by the corporate sector.  Within two years, accelerated capital allowances will be phased out which will result in an increased yield each year of about £45 million from 1992 to 1995.  The ceiling of section 84 lending is being reduced by a quarter.  These changes will both increase revenue and enable the rate of corporation tax to be reduced from 43 per cent to 40 per cent this year.  This will be of benefit, particularly to the services sector which is the sector to which we are looking for many of the new jobs that must be created.</P>
    <P>There are some who have argued that there ought to be a minimum tax paid by corporations, benefiting from the 10 per cent rate.  However, a minimum tax <Col N="926" /> would be very complicated.  Its main purpose would be to restrict, in a very indirect way, section 84 loans, and accelerated capital allowances, but the budget does this directly.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw attention once again to the very considerable achievement of the Government in increasing the yield in 1990 and over the last three years under the three headings of the self-employed, capital taxes and the corporate sector.  These increases have had a very real impact on introducing a great deal more equity into the system.</P>
    <P>Our excise duties and VAT rates are among the highest in the European Community. With the exception of the extension of the 10 per cent VAT base to electricity and telecommunications, which will not be passed on to the consumer, there have been no increases in indirect taxes this year, and as I have already mentioned, we have cut the standard rate of VAT from 25 per cent to 23 per cent.  Apart from the positive impact on inflation, and the wider EC dimension, the changes in the budget should have a positive employment impact on a wide range of businesses and industries. The reduction of excise duty on soft drinks, for instance, will have a positive impact on an industry that employs 2,750 in 30 manufacturing plants.</P>
    <P>The changes in indirect tax are also designed to reduce smuggling and other distortions in cross-Border trade.  The severe increases in indirect taxes, especially in the 1983 budget, had a devastating impact on the commercial life of the Border towns, and indeed a negative effect on centres much further inland. This led us in 1987 to introduce the 48-hour rule which removed some of the worst effects of the gap between indirect tax rates North and South.  The measures taken in the budget affecting many of the consumer items involved should improve the situation further, and the abolition of excise duties on gramophone records and compact discs have already been widely welcomed by the music industry.</P>
    <P>The tax increases in this budget which amount to just £22 million are far the lowest of any recent year, while the gross <Col N="927" /> tax reductions amounting to £200 million are much the highest.  The cost of this is of course reduced by buoyancy of £91 million, which is an indication of the multiplier effect of the tax and expenditure improvements given in the budget.  We have clearly moved into a period, where, provided economic progress is maintained, we can continue to lighten the overall burden of tax.</P>
    <P>The welfare of the poor and the less well-off, and ensuring that they benefit from the improvement in our economic circumstances, was one of the major priorities of this budget.</P>
    <P>The Government have more than fulfilled their commitments on social welfare under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  Over the past three years there has been a consistent policy of giving general increases in line with the expected rate of inflation, together with much bigger increases for the groups that need extra assistance most.</P>
    <P>This year, reflecting the general improvement in the economy over the past twelve months, we have introduced a major programme of social improvements, the most comprehensive of its kind for many years, amounting to £235 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>We have initiated a new type of co-ordinated approach to improving the situation of those on lower pay which will be followed up in future years.  To broaden its impact, we have further extended the exemption scheme introduced in the budget last year for low income families.  As a result a married couple with five children and an income of £8,000 or under will be completely exempt from tax.  There will be further assistance for lower income families through the family income supplement. We have also introduced a limited PRSI exemption scheme for low paid, and in the main part-time workers who are outside the tax net.  Those on low incomes will of course benefit most from the reduction in VAT by 2 per cent on the cost of a wide range of daily necessities. Our intention is that these different measures and others will combine to <Col N="928" /> assist lower-paid families significantly, including small farmers and shopkeepers.</P>
    <P>The 5 per cent increase in general rate of social welfare is well in excess of the expected rate of inflation in the coming year of around 3¼ per cent.</P>
    <P>The long-term unemployed, particularly those with families, have been identified as a category most in need of special assistance.  The personal long term unemployment assistance rate has been increased from £36.70 in the first half of 1987 to £52 later this year.  This has involved successive increases of about 11 per cent for each of the last three years in payment levels.  Taking child benefit into account, an unemployed person with five children will by October be receiving approximately £150 a week.</P>
    <P>The successive changes that have been made since 1988 have been in line with the Commission on Social Welfare Report, as its former chairman has acknowledged.  It has not been possible to implement these recommendations in one attempt.  In a situation where our primary social aim is to maximise employment, it would obviously be wrong to have a situation where any significant number of persons would be better off unemployed than at work.  That sort of situation brings disillusionment and demoralisation.  That is why we wish to move towards a closer integration of the tax and social welfare systems, and improve the position of those in employment on low incomes.</P>
    <P>For the first time this year, apart from special increases for the long-term unemployed, there have been additional topup payments, for instance, for pensioners, and lone parents on long-term assistance.</P>
    <P>In this year's budget we have paid particular attention to the position of spouses in the home.  We have been able to give a child benefit increase this year; £500,000 has been provided to support programmes for women in the home, to help them develop their skills.  In this sum is included £150,000 for the work of the Rape Crisis Centres.</P>
    <P>For families on social welfare the child dependant allowance has been increased <Col N="929" /> in most cases by up to a pound a week. A new clothing allowance often advocated is being introduced in September to help disadvantaged families with the cost of clothing children for school.</P>
    <P>Another significant measure is the increase in the carer's allowance of those who look after elderly relatives, who are semi-invalid.  When combined with the extra £5 million provided for improved services for the elderly and £2 million for the mentally handicapped service, it strengthens the implementation of the concept of community care.</P>
    <P>In comparison with the original health estimate for 1989, we are now providing substantially increased resources in 1990, a gross expenditure increase of over £130 million.  Even allowing for inflation, this is a substantial real increase, which fully matches any reasonable and responsible expectations that may have been created. Health now in fact enjoys the same real level of resources as it did in 1986, measured against inflation, and the proportion of total net Exchequer spending on health provision has risen from 19 per cent in 1986 to 21.3 per cent in 1990.</P>
    <P>Any discussion of health must begin by recognising that resources are finite.  The fundamental issue is not the amount of the resources but the most efficient and best use of the resources we can provide for the benefit of patients who need care and attention.</P>
    <P>The correction of the public finances in 1987 was urgently necessary, otherwise it would soon have become impossible to maintain any health service or any other social service.  With health care accounting for about one-fifth of Exchequer spending, the general principle had to be applied to health as well as to all the other services.  The emphasis for the past three years has had to be on streamlining services, seeking out efficiencies, increasing productivity and protecting key services. Resources are now becoming available to improve the situation, and the last six months have seen real improvements. There have been three increases in health funding since last September.  Firstly, in 1989 there was an additional £15 million <Col N="930" /> to deal with specific priority areas in the acute hospital services; secondly, the 1990 Estimates show an increase of £120 million, or almost 10 per cent, in non-capital expenditure on the health services for 1990 as compared to the original 1989 provision; and last week's budget allocated a further £13 million, including, as Deputies know, £5 million for services for the elderly, £3 million for the dental services, £2 million for the mental handicap services and over £3 million for substantial increases in the various health allowances from next July.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that this country has, overall, a comprehensive health service.  There are, of course, areas which need considerable improvement and development.  Technologies change; demands and expectations change; new developments, new services and new ways of delivering them are constantly needed.  But this is a feature of healthcare in every society.  I think Deputy John O'Connell gave us a very expert and mature analysis of the whole situation last night.</P>
    <P>There is no country at our level of economic development which can boast of facilities or personnel of a quality even approaching ours.  The report of the Commission on Health Funding, which makes many recommendations concerning improvements in services and the methods of delivering them, confirms at the very outset that we do indeed have a high standard of health services.</P>
    <P>Under the present Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, the necessary changes are being made in order to direct more resources to the new priority areas.  The productivity of the health services has been greatly increased.  The steps that have been taken in the last three years are the basis of longer-term development and improvement.</P>
    <P>There are many other measures in the budget designed to deal with specific social problems, aid for the voluntary housing organisations, the Simon Community, the extension of the very worth-while scheme for extra teachers in <Col N="931" /> disadvantaged schools, for local enterprise, for adult literacy and for the welfare of emigrants.</P>
    <P>The budget represents a significant social advance.  We have ensured that pensioners, spouses working in the home; single parents; the unemployed and their families and other disadvantaged groups are able to share in the general economic progress that this country is making. Economic progress must always be accompanied by social advance in any society which wishes to be regarded as enlightened.</P>
    <P>The quality of life today is deeply affected by the state of our natural environment. It is now widely accepted that economic growth cannot be at the expense of the quality of the environment. This principle has been implemented by the introduction of the environmental impact assessment requirement for development projects.</P>
    <P>As we all know, last week the Minister for the Environment launched the Government's bold and imaginative Environment Action Programme which clearly set out our concern and priorities. The Government have agreed on an expenditure of over £1,000 million to be spent during the next decade on the implementation of this plan, and the necessary funding for this year has been provided in this year's budget.</P>
    <P>The budget is both a reflection of progress made and a pointer to the progress that will be made in the future.  It fits into a much wider context.  It represents the final phase of the current <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  It is, from a budgetary point of view, the first full instalment of the National Development Plan.  It is also the first budget in the new Government's programme, while carrying forward the successful economic policies of the last Government into their next phase.  It represents as much as it is possible or prudent for us to attempt at this stage.</P>
    <P>In out budgetary plans taken as a whole we have consolidated the improvement in the national finances and in general economic conditions; we have provided <Col N="932" /> a stimulus for employment through increased investment and restoring growth to the economy; we have given the most significant tax relief of recent years; we have introduced important social advances; and we have provided a comprehensive programme to tackle the problems of the environment.  All these objectives are set against the background of closer European integration and the increasing demands that this will place upon us.</P>
    <P>I would appeal for the widest possible understanding of the extent to which the progress we have made can be attributed to social consensus.  The social partners, who have contributed so much to the success of the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> should now have the opportunity in a continued partnership with the Government to determine how these growing benefits will be distributed.  With consensus there is really no limit to what we can achieve in the economy and socially and in tackling all those problems that are still with us.  We have developed in the national programme something new; a formula that works and produces results and benefits.  I sincerely hope that we will hold on to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is fairly general acceptance about the financial direction in which we should travel.  With the exception of my colleagues on my extreme right, who are actually on the extreme Left of the political spectrum, I think we are all in general agreement, even though we may disagree in detail, that the thrust of the Government's financial strategy is basically correct.  I believe the public also accept the Government's financial strategy because they understand that we went off the rails for something like ten years, for a few years prior to 1977 and in subsequent years.  There is now a general acceptance that matters should be put in order and the thrust of this is that there have been and will be fairly significant cuts in public expenditure and rather minor adjustments in the taxation system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one aspect of the budget which I found quite alarming and I am surprised <Col N="933" /> more reference has not been made to this in the House.  It was alluded to by our spokesman on Finance on the day of the budget.  It is the question of leaks.  The Budget Statement is a highly confidential document and no details of what it contains should become public knowledge prior to the Budget Statement in this House by the Minister for Finance. However, on the morning of the budget this year, that is, 31 January, I clearly heard the financial correspondent of RTE giving explicit details on the 9 a.m. radio bulletin on RTE I of what the Budget Statement contained in regard to personal taxation.  I should like to know if the Taoiseach and the Government have carried out an investigation into how this qualified and precise leak occurred.</P>
    <P>Obviously this leak was a breach of the Official Secrets Act.  There were no &ldquo;ifs&rdquo; and &ldquo;buts&rdquo; about it or statements to the effect that &ldquo;rumours had it&rdquo; or &ldquo;we believe the changes will be as follows&rdquo;. It was an explicit statement to the effect that the personal rates of taxation were going to be reduced as follows: the higher rate would be reduced from 56 to 53 per cent and the standard rate would be reduced from 32 to 30 per cent.  Of course, that is exactly what happened and there must have been a deliberate leak to the person in question or to some other person who passed the information on to this individual.</P>
    <P>This was clearly a breach of the Official Secrets Act and also a breach of Dáil privilege.  If the Government are not taking action by way of an internal inquiry I believe the Director of Public Prosecutions has an obligation to institute an investigation, or to ask the relevant authorities to institute an investigation, into the matter.  Nothing like this has ever happened before during my time in this House.</P>
    <P>The implications of this leak of information are extremely serious.  As it so happened, there were no major changes in the rates of excise duties in the budget &mdash; there were some changes in the rates of excise duties on television sets, videos and gramophone records &mdash; but if there had been major changes in the rates of <Col N="934" /> excise duties on the old reliables, as we refer to them, such as beer, spirits and cigarettes, there could be very serious implications.  A number of people could make a killing, in other words, a large profit.  What worries me with regard to leaks is that the excise duty being charged on liquid petroleum gas was reduced by 50 per cent.  If somebody on the outside had that type of information, they could well have speculated on the Stock Exchange on companies which import, manufacture or distribute that gas.  That is the one area where there could have been a major abuse.  If there had been big changes in excise duties on the commodities I have referred to, including petrol, drink and cigarettes, somebody could have made a lot of money.  This would have been a crime.  What it constitutes at the moment I am not legally qualified to say but some statement should be issued to clarify what type of investigation is taking place within the Government or through the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>During Question Time in the Dáil on Thursday of last week.  I referred to the reluctance of the Government to recognise that immense damage was done to our coastal defences during the storm on the night of 16-17 December last.  It has occurred to me that because the worst of the storm did not occur in the vicinity of Dublin or in a constituency where there is a Government Minister, its consequences are being conveniently ignored.  If they were being faced up to the financial bill would be quite considerable.  They will have to be faced up to at some stage. I recall that when we had storms of a different type in the vicinity of Dublin not too many years ago: we had Micky O'Leary's snow blizzard and a few years later we had Hurricance Charlie and the media were falling head over heels demanding some action on the part of the Government because they were happening on their own doorsteps.  When it is out of sight and out of reach people in high places do not give a damn.</P>
    <P>What happened, a Cheann Comhairle, not too far away from your back door <Col N="935" /> and mine was considerably more damaging and harmful than either of the two other occurrences I have referred to.  In my own county, the extent of the damage is put at £11.5 million.  In neighbouring counties, such as Cork and Wexford, it is quite considerable, but what have we got. We have got no recognition and no promise of any assistance.  We have not even got an acknowledgement of the problems created and the damage which has been done.  I am putting down a marker to the effect that if the Government cannot put up the money themselves, they will have to get the money from the EC, be it through the Regional Fund or the Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>Specific reference was made in the Budget Statement to what happened on the night of 16-17 December.  The Minister stated that &ldquo;the storms in December 1989 caused severe damage to the coast, harbours and boats on the south-eastern seaboard&rdquo;.  He went on to state that just two locations will receive financial assistance, £950,000 to Arklow and £100,000 to Kilmore Quay in County Wexford.  We probably all know from the pictures on television that there was substantial damage done to boats in Kilmore Quay but if the Government had properly appraised themselves of the overall situation they would know that harbours, beaches, roads and many other coastal installations right along the Cork, Waterford and Wexford coast was absolutely wrecked.</P>
    <P>The only saving grace is that there has not been a subsequent south-easterly gale since the night of 16-17 December.  We have had some ferocious gales, even storms, in recent weeks but they have all come from what is for us a safe direction, the south-west.  However, there will be south-easterly gales and storms.  They could come next week, next month or next year and there will be no protection for areas like Tramore, Ballycotton, Ardmore or Bonmahon. The coastal communities of the south and south-east are being left at the mercy of the sea and the wind and the Government are clearly hoping that the weather will <Col N="936" /> improve and the problem will go away. What I am saying here is that the problem will not go away.  The sea defences have been shattered and it will not take much to penetrate them and cause not just tens of millions of pounds worth of damage &mdash; as is the case at present &mdash; but hundreds of millions of pounds worth of damage with whole communities, harbours and villages being swept away.</P>
    <P>One of the better legacies the British left us was a fine system of harbours and sea defences.  We could call them bulwarks, sea walls or embankments but what have we done in 68 years of self government?  We have witnessed and allowed those very fine harbours and sea protection works to disintegrate and, in many places, to fall into the sea.  We have looked on and done nothing.  Now we are paying the price which will be considerably greater unless something is done immediately.  I was amazed yesterday when a Private Notice Question of mine on this matter was ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle on the basis that it was not of sufficient urgency under the Standing Orders of this House.  I see Private Notice Questions being allowed day in and day out here on every item to every Tom, Dick and Harry many of which do not border on the same element of importance or urgency as the matter I wanted to raise here yesterday.</P>
    <P>The future of the people living in coastal communities who primarily depend on the fishing and tourism industries is in grave jeopardy.  I want to see somebody in Government or the Government collectively taking action to ensure that something is done.  If we want the local authorities, by which I mean the relevant county councils, to do something, then we can forget about it, but not totally. We can forget about them doing anything significant or worthwhile because through no fault of their own they are being bled of finance.  They have only buttons.  They put up a few mounds of sand in the hope that the sea will not be too severe and will not flatten them in a day or two.  When it comes to real coastal protection works they have not the money to do it.  It will have to be a major <Col N="937" /> operation undertaken by the Government hopefully with with the help of EC funds.  We want to know fairly quickly if that money will be available, when it will be available and how much will be available.  For starters, it might not be such a bad idea if we asked the EC for something very minimal, that is to let us have some of their experts on coastal protection to assess the situation at first hand and let us know here in this country and let the EC know what needs to be done and what the cost of the work will be.  It is a case of totally ignoring a very major problem.</P>
    <P>There is legislation which allows local authorities in conjunction with the Government to carry out major coastal protection works.  The legislation is known as the Coastal Protection Act, 1963 and it is not worth the paper it is written on at the moment because it requires the local authority who put forward the scheme to provide 50 per cent of the finance.  That legislation has become self-defeating because of lack of funds in local authorities.  If Waterford County Council, for instance, were to put forward a scheme for £11.5 million they then would have to put up something like £5.75 million themselves.  They do not have £575,000; they do not have £57,500. It is crazy.  They put such a scheme up to the Government when they had more money, when they were more self-sufficient, when they had more means of raising money through rates.  They put up a scheme in 1966, 24 years ago, to protect the most vulnerable part of the coast. What has happened?  Nothing.  The Coastal Protection Act, 1963 is redundant, and we are at the mercy of the elements. Therefore I raise the matter here today. I raised it last week and I am going to keep raising it until something is done. For the life of me, I cannot understand the selectivity of last week's budget where one part of the country got money and areas which were worst affected got nothing.  It is a disgrace.  I can only deduce that what happened was brought about by strong political lobbying of the Minister for Finance.  If that is how you run <Col N="938" /> a country then let God help us, because that is not how it should be done.</P>
    <P>We all know it should not be done, but for the Taoiseach and the other members of the Government to allow it to happen is a total disgrace.  I will be seeking the support of my colleagues in the south and south-east irrespective of party affiliation when we move a motion on this item in the coming weeks or months because it affects us all.  The public in those southern and south-eastern regions are outraged at the Government's total neglect of, and indifference to, this matter.  It is as if they do not want to know it happened.  Even with communications like television and local community or independent radio stations and all the media-related activities nowadays, rather than becoming a more compact country we are becoming more provincial in many ways.</P>

      <P>Well, insular or isolated.  If you are not at the hub of the action, that is Dublin, where the Government sit and the moneys are distributed, you are going to suffer.  That is what it amounts to.  If you are not at the hub you are in trouble, you are ignored and if you have not a Government Minister or some very strong influence within the Government you are just dead.  <i>The Cork Examiner,</i> for instance, can rant and rave about the neglect of Cork and the south, but they are whistling in the dark, nobody is listening to them.  They might get a mention in &ldquo;It Says in the Papers&rdquo;.  <i>The Cork Examiner</i> is a national paper, much as some people might not like to admit, but as far as it and provincial papers and provincial radio stations are concerned, there is nobody in Dublin listening, and that is becoming more the case every day. Unless we highlight the problem I cannot see that we are going to solve it.  I do not think all the citizens are being treated equally as the Constitution lays down. There is discrimination against certain areas.  If they have not pull, muscle or input at Cabinet level or whatever, they are just ignored.  The Taoiseach and the Government should rectify that.  That is <Col N="939" /> not as it should be, and that is a sad reflection on our society and our political system and because of that all we are going to get is increased cynicism and hostility from the public in those areas, as if we did not have enough of that already.  It seems to be the &ldquo;in thing&rdquo; to castigate politicians and political institutions, but sometimes happenings that take place encourage this type of activity. It is the duty of Government and all of us to see that it does not happen. However, it is happening.  The episode of the coastal damage I have referred to is a graphic illustration of what is happening.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach in his statement referred to the Government's Environment Action Programme.  As part of that plan I notice that the price of unleaded petrol is coming down 5p per gallon and the excise duty on auto LPG is being reduced by 50 per cent.  That will contribute in some small way to a lessening of smog, particularly in urban areas such as Dublin, but I wonder if anybody has done an equation or calculation to determine what really is causing smog in Dublin, for instance.  Is it bituminous coal or other smoke emitting fuels or is the emission of fumes from lorries, buses and cars a very major element?  I do not know if anybody has ever done a calculation on that, but I suspect the emission of fumes is a major element in the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take Dublin Bus.  Did anyone here ever walk or stand or drive in close proximity to the rear of a Dublin bus in recent times?  You would be lucky if you were not suffocated by the emission of noxious fumes.  I suspect it is because the Dublin Bus fleet has not been updated, replaced or upgraded for many years, and that although laws governing the emission of offensive fumes exist, I do not believe they are enforced.  I believe that a large part of the smog problem in Dublin, and in Ballyfermot in particular, is due to the non-enforcement of the law governing the emission of fumes from vehicles.  We are getting hot and bothered about the emissions from bituminous coal and other smokey fuels but while it is a major <Col N="940" /> element it is only one aspect of the problem. We should look at every aspect of the problem and not just look at one area in isolation.</P>
    <P>Recently, I tabled a question to the Minister for the Environment about traffic congestion and the enforcement of the parking laws as they apply to vehicles loading and unloading in busy city centre streets, many of which are the main arteries from the heavily populated suburbs. In reply, the Minister said there were no specific laws dealing with vehicles parking while they were loading or unloading goods.  However, in every civilised country of the world where you have large urban populations and dense traffic, there are laws which prohibit the loading or unloading of goods at peak rush hour periods.  At St. Stephen's Green or at any of the important entry points to the city, it would not be uncommon to see three or four parked delivery lorries loading and unloading goods, creating a traffic jam between 8.30 a.m. and 10.30 a.m. Yet nobody pays any heed.  The traffic builds up a mile or so back and then there is chaos.</P>
    <P>We wonder whether we should restrict traffic into the city centre.  There is no need to restrict traffic into a city the size of Dublin.  The roads are not great but they are capable of carrying the volume of traffic we generate.  However, the laws governing parking while vehicles are being loaded and unloaded are non-existent. Legislation should be brought in to ensure that goods can only be loaded or unloaded during non peak periods.</P>
    <P>You would think it was a deliberate policy on the part of Dublin Corporation, Bord Gáis, the ESB or other public bodies to cause the maximum inconvenience to the general public.  Every week one sees their lorries parked out in the middle of the street and after placing their bollards they then start digging up the street for days on end.  We had this in Suffolk Street last year.  It was happening in Dawson Street and Kildare Street a few months ago.</P>

The leaks in this year's budget are highly undesirable and the source of the leaks must be traced, because if it is allowed to happen once, it will become endemic. Leaks of that type can only lead to one thing, that is, corruption of the highest order and we certainly do not want to see that.  I wish to state publicly that if the Government do not do something about it, the Director of Public Prosecutions should make it his business to see that the source of the leaks is traced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>In the short time available to me I do not intend to be repetitious and go into detail on the very lengthy speeches made by the Minister for Finance on the Budget Statement and by the Taoiseach this morning.  Various Government Ministers will dwell at great length <Col N="942" /> on the detailed fiscal aspect of the background to the 1990 budget.</P>
      <P>The detail of the budget has been well documented and reported in all our newspapers. The situation has been analysed on television programmes.  The human and business perspectives have been well and truly explored and debated.  I would like to give a quick analysis of the background to the 1990 budget.  The political system collectively, which the Taoiseach referred to this morning, set off on the course of deficit budgeting which became the &ldquo;in thing&rdquo; in the seventies.  This became the cornerstone of all financial planning.  There were pertinent reasons that the then Minister for Finance, Mr. Richie Ryan, when confronted with the dilemma of the oil crisis, took the immediate necessary action and set us on a particular course.  That Government endeavoured, as did a later Government comprised of the same parties, to grapple with the difficulty that confronted them. We went into Government in the period 1977-81 and share responsibility for the difficulties we are now endeavouring to grapple with in the nineties.  I heard a former Minister for Finance, Deputy Bruton, refer to the fact that when his Government resumed office after the 1977-81 period they had to deal with inherited debt and fiscal problems.  There could well be an element of accuracy and correctness in those comments.  Be that as it may, we now head into the nineties with a debt burden which has been well analysed and we are now trying to manage it more efficiently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One could well analyse what we achieved by going into debt.  Was the investment well spent?  We have improved our telecommunications, and this obviously added to our level of debt. We have in place a fairly excellent structure of primary and post-primary educational facilities, which is a positive investment.  Indeed one could say that money was well spent on a whole range of areas.  However there are a number of major areas where one could be quite critical of the results of huge investment. The disease eradication programme is a <Col N="943" /> case in point.  There has been ever-increasing spending on disease eradication, which is a huge cost to the taxpayer but yet all we seem to hear are excuses.  We have had new policies and various reports on their implementation, but this area of Government spending does not appear to have been taken under control and it would not appear that the taxpayer is getting value for his hard earned money.</P>
    <P>The Tallaght strategy must be viewed against the background.  It was desirable that a consensus emerged on economic policy towards the end of the eighties.  Of course there was a certain political reality about it, and I must pay tribute to Deputy Dukes, Deputy John Bruton and their colleagues in the Fine Gael Party.  When we assumed office after a period in which they had been in office we were faced with the stark reality of endeavouring to manage the country; probably because of the lack of economic consensus within the two parties in that Government they did not really tackle or grapple with the issues.  This was probably best emphasised by the then Minister for Finance, the present Leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Dukes, when he made a statement after the formation of that Government to the effect that he hoped the then current budget deficit could be held at £500 million. The present Leader of the Labour Party, the then Tanáiste, Deputy Spring, visited the Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, in hospital and came away from that discussion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the other way round.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it was.  He came away from that discussion with agreement on £800 million deficit which, as I recall, rose to over £900 million.  We were still on the same treadmill of being unable to pay our way and increasing that deficit. In turn this means that, when the global economy improves, our recovery is that much slower because we must pay for our past sins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My party, in a minority position during <Col N="944" /> that period, got the consensus support of the Tallaght strategy.  For good economic and national reasons Fine Gael are to be complimented on that strategy compounded by the political reasons of having endured the sharp shock of having lost ten or 15 Dáil seats, with a new Leader who wanted to consolidate his position.  He had damn all political option but to do so.  An acceptable consensus emerged clouded in political reality.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance and his colleagues in the Department framed the 1990 budget we are now discussing.  It is a matter of personal regret to me that, in the period from 1977 to 1981, I and my colleagues, then on this side of the House, in the month of October nodded through Supplementary Estimate after Supplementary Estimate increasing that debt without questioning, debating or considering whether it constituted prudent management.  In that period I cannot recall the Secretary of the Department of Finance or any of his colleagues over there threaten to resign or resigning in protest at the political mismanagement of the past 20 years.  Whether there was a consensus that the debt should have been allowed to roll up in that fashion, collectively we are all to blame.</P>

      <P>In the same way one must now question the acceptability of the good news of the past 12 months when a tax amnesty yield was calculated at a certain figure when in fact the amount returned amounted to four or five times that estimate.  That begs the question: who calculated that figure in the first place?  How can one accept his authentic capacity to provide factual financial information and plan accordingly?  The fact that the eventual yield was £400 million greater than the estimate is good news.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1989 budget carried a borrowing requirement of something in the region of £800 million or £900 million which turned out to be in the region of £405 million or £490 million, again amounting <Col N="945" /> to £400 million or £500 million of inaccurate estimation.  In turn that begs the question: is it prudent fiscal management to under-calculate and announce the good news later?  Provided the position remains that way I suppose it is partly acceptable but should it go to the opposite direction it would throw our national finances into a rather sorry state. It is quite unacceptable that the political arm of Government should be acting on figures provided.  Probably we should have our own method of scrutinising such calculations because we must accept responsibility for them.  They are provided for us by the permanent executive arm of the Government.  Some of those calculations have been widely inaccurate in recent times.  I want to put on the record that that fact does not go unnoticed.  They have been inaccurate; whether because of imprudent fiscal management or an inadvertent error I do not know.</P>
    <P>Probably all Members of this House reflect on how the 1990 budget directly affects the people who elect them and whom they represent.  In my constituency of Dublin West there are two Government Deputies, one a senior member of the Government, two Fine Gael Deputies and the former Leader of The Workers' Party.  It is the most highly populated constituency in the country. There is a general consensus that we lobby for and represent our constituency to the best of our ability, gaining maximum investment whether in education, schools or whatever.  That being said, we then tend to divide on where we go from there.</P>
    <P>On this side of the House we would claim that this most recent budget has quite a human face.  In its provisions we are recognising the less fortunate members of our community, giving them substantial increases.  We are endeavouring to address the unacceptably low levels of income of the long-term unemployed and of those who find themselves in the poverty trap.  However, because of different political ideologies, my colleagues on the other side of the House might well disagree with me in that <Col N="946" /> respect.  Within reason the provisions of this budget are just about acceptable.  We have effected improvements but we need to effect others.  With regard to the potential for further improvement in the economy generally, in the area of financial management, I have been saying to my colleagues at party meetings and so on that if the Government would cease spending then they could cease taxing. Otherwise they cannot achieve that objective.  We must examine every pound of expenditure, whether it is comprised of taxpayers' revenue or borrowing, to ascertain whether the taxpayer is getting value for each pound expended.</P>
    <P>There are a number of areas still warranting examination, one of them is in regard to local authorities.  We have been arguing in a petty fashion over the past six or seven months about the establishment of an all-party committee on local authority financing.  I have been led to believe that the Fine Gael Party are arguing about membership, numbers; anyhow, somebody is delaying the task that needs to be undertaken.  I am a member of a local authority with 700 or 800 fewer staff which probably is functioning more efficiently today than heretofore. Dublin Corporation is a massive spender of funds.  Local authorities around the country are short of funds. Who analyses value for money?  Who will contend that the electric lighting repairs system under monopoly to the ESB represents the best value we can obtain? Who will contend that various other aspects of those services constitute value for money?  When we endeavour to examine such issues we run into the ideological argument that one must keep within local authority control, that one cannot do this, that or the other without incurring union confrontation, all putting the matter on a semi-long finger.  This means we do not make the urgent progress warranted in so many of these areas.  That is what we must achieve in the nineties.  We must be big enough to put many political differences aside to achieve the common goal of improving the lot of the people we represent.</P>
    <P>The chairman of the Sugar Company <Col N="947" /> suggested the other day that that company needs additional revenue for growth and development.  Hopefully we will not get into another ideological argument in that respect that in Opposition we were against doing anything in the semi-State sector, probably irresponsibly making a definitive statement about it whereas now, we might have a different view on it.  We must examine these areas and bring an open mind to bear on them.</P>
    <P>We did not hear anybody becoming excited when SIPTU, a massive union, was formed.  One might well ask will it amount to a monopoly?  Will it be too strong?  Is that wrong?  The strengthening of many of our organisations so that we can compete internationally is an issue of great concern to many people.  In a rapidly changing world we must endeavour to stop fighting in our own backyard.</P>
    <P>I might now deal with education for which Deputy John Bruton is responsible on behalf of his party.  This is all very much entwined with budgetary provisions and the future of this country.  I recognise Deputy Bruton's commitment in this respect.  He visited an area in my constituency which is worthy of visitation. Additional investment and a recognition of the difficulties experienced is needed in the greater Neilstown and Quarryvale areas.  A large urban community has been located there by Dublin Corporation, comprising three parishes, 6,000 homes, which constitute black spots of unemployment and so on.  All of the capabilities and resources of Government, State and other sectors should be brought to bear to resolve the types of problems obtaining there and, indeed, in other areas.</P>
    <P>Very belatedly the budgetary provisions recognise the need to improve opportunities for third level places.  If the young people I represent &mdash; and there are more in my constituency than in any other constitutency in the country &mdash; are ever to have any real job opportunities they must be given the benefit of those extra two or three years' education.  We have been pussy-footing around for a <Col N="948" /> long time, trying to get an RTC for Tallaght where there are 80,000 or 90,000 people.  The decision regarding the Lucan-Clondalkin satellite towns has been deferred and we are head-scratching about Blanchardstown.  Those who can afford it will ensure that their sons and daughters receive third level education but those who cannot will be denied it.  This is an area of urgent need and I have made vigorous representations on the matter.  I have also made a recent submission to the Ministers for Education and Labour on the very substantial FÁS training centre in Tallaght and the proposed building of an RTC next door to it.  The people in FÁS are concerned that there will be duplication.  Should these two establishments not be situated on the one campus?  The Departments of Education and Labour should get together to ensure that the work can be carried out efficiently.  That is a matter on which we should be seen to have a consensus.</P>
    <P>As regards industrial policy for the nineties, there is a great need for change. Enough analysis has taken place in the last 20 years.  The Telesis report has been published and different studies have been carried out.  The IDA travel the world looking for international investment and have been successful in that regard.  We may say that too much of the profits is repatriated and we wonder if this is the right policy, will it continue in the nineties or should some changes be made.  This morning the Taoiseach referred to the Intel project.  There is now a condition attached to the receipt of a grant by that industry &mdash; the multinationals must source £1 million worth of products weekly into the Irish economy.  There is no doubt that the major multinational companies repatriate their profits for future expansion.  If they are doing well and making a profit in Ireland they invest that profit in places such as the Far East, which is now emerging as a developing area.</P>
    <P>Will we continue to see this industry as one of the major platforms for job creaton?  Everybody agrees that jobs are not being created quickly enough.  I do not think anybody is satisfied with the <Col N="949" /> rate of job creation.  The Taoiseach told us this morning that the number unemployed would be reduced to 220,000 but that is only a small improvement and is nothing when compared to what we need to achieve.  That figure does not include all the bright young people who have emigrated, people whom we would like to have been able to employ in this country.  We have to bridge the gap between investment involved in importing raw material products and exporting them.  The export figures may look well but we must consider the trickle on effects such as employment, taxes to the Exchequer from employers, the 10 per cent corporation tax and VAT on purchases. At the end of the day can we refine that policy without breaking agreements? There should be a greater incentive to retain profits within the country. I have no doubt the IDA have considered that matter but the solution must come from the Government.</P>
    <P>The great cliché of the seventies and eighties has been added value, great quality, the green basket of Europe and the export of quality food products.  There should be a concerted commitment to make that a reality.  As regards the dairy sector, Bord Bainne have been the flag carrier and have made great achievements in the seventies and the eighties but what are they doing today?  They are probably in the High Court petty arguing with Avonmore about who should share what spoils, who should sit on what boards and so on.  That is a complete waste of time.  In the north-east there have been problems with milk quotas and this has become a major national debate. We do not know the wood from the trees. The whole dairy industry should be orientated towards exports which would result in increased jobs.  There should be some reorganisation of this industry so that the producers can get a better deal.  We continually say that we must prepare for the single market but what are we doing? Our strengths are being dissipated.  If we made an improvement in this industry we would then be able to compete with some of the large multinational food corporations which dominate this whole <Col N="950" /> area.  Hopefully in the nineties there will be a consensus on this matter and the reality of 1 January 1993 will shock us into putting our differences behind us and mobilising our strengths towards growth, investment and development.</P>
    <P>When dealing with agriculture the Taoiseach mentioned that the dairy and pig farmers are doing well but the cattle farmers have not been doing so well. There has been major investments in this area but there has been a depletion of the herd.  The biggest requirement in Eastern Europe is food particularly meat, but we do not have the cattle numbers to meet these requirements.  How long more are we going to stay arguing among ourselves about what we need to do?  Why are we in such a position in the early nineties? Have we not had enough reports on these matters in the eighties?  Who is responsible for this?  These are the issues we really need to focus in on and address. We should do everything we can to capitalise on what is happening in the Eastern Bloc countries and the Soviet Union.  We should be able to supply those countries with the products they need.  If they succeed in managing their affairs efficiently, by the year 2000 and beyond they will become our great competitors.  Countries such as Poland and Hungary have the potential to be great food producing countries.  We should do what we can to improve our position in this regard but it is painstakingly difficult to get co-operation. It is much easier to put millions of pounds into the multinational organisations which will create more jobs. They will get priority over the other urgent needs.  It is very difficult for the IDA and the politicians to bring together commercial organisations who wish to retain their independence, and understandably so.  They do not want to become bigger because they may lose out.  These are the issues we must address.</P>
    <P>There is probably a need for an all-party committee of this House which would come up with solutions to some of these thorny issues.  You have your own ideologies and attitudes, a Chathaoirligh, as have Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael but <Col N="951" /> these attitudes are rapidly changing. Your own Party leader, at your last annual conference, said there must be a mixed economy and that we have to refine State monopoly and State control. That was a far seeing address because we did not predict at that time what would happen in Eastern Europe.  The ideology of The Workers' Party has been allied to that type of management of those countries for many years.</P>
    <P>Are we prepared to change where necessary?  Change is not needed in any area more than it is needed in relation to our attitude to Northern Ireland.  This has not been mentioned in any budget but it is one of the single biggest financial drains in the country.  How many more times will we invite the representatives of that community to talks?  How much longer will it take the Secretary of State to get Unionist leaders together?  The Secretary of State has been there for five or six months.  We do not expect him to make progress in five or six months after lack of progress over 700 or 800 years, but we could all get rather impatient at the lack of progress in these areas.  Should the Taoiseach and the leaders of the main parties not embark on some sort of concilatory trip to some part of Ireland and break the mould, as did Seán Lemass at one time, and do something dramatic, something big to bridge the gaps?  In the nineties these issues must be addressed by all politicians.</P>
    <P>We must be brave in our attitude and pragmatic and honest in our approach. We must be prepared to put behind us the major political differences.  We on this side of the House had to put our differences behind when we formed this Government, although we did so reluctantly. I did not like to have to go to the Comhairle Dáil Ceanntar and defend that bulwark of principle in our party of never forming other than a single party Government.  We did not wish to form a Coalition but we had to do so because that is what the people wanted.  We were able to put differences behind and form a Government which is working.  While <Col N="952" /> the party people might not have wanted this we must be prepared to change.  The changes we have seen in Eastern Europe and in the Soviet Union should present a sobering lesson to all of us showing us how we can come together to work in the interests of the people we represent.  We can put aside our political differences and give public expression to an effort to get a great consensus moving forward in order to, for instance, reduce the 220,000 unemployment figure.  We need a major imaginative change in attitude to progress in that area.</P>

      <P>The leaking of this budget to a journalist is something that has not happened before in this way.  It constitutes one of the most grave breaches of the privileges of this House for many years.  It is well accepted that legislation shall not be published before it is introduced here and that the details of a budget shall not be published before they are announced in this House.  As Deputy Deasy outlined, there are very good reasons for this.  One wishes to ensure that no individual has the opportunity to make financial gain from having privileged access to information in advance of that information being made available generally in this House.  The fact that this information was leaked to a newspaper clearly indicates that it was allowed to be in common circulation.  The Minister is personally responsible for this and he should consider his position in view of that.  I would remind the Minister that it is a well established principle that a Minister who finds himself in the position of having leaked his budget resigns.  The practice was followed in the forties on a famous occasion by probably one of the most able British Chancellors of the Exchequer, Mr. Dalton.  He resigned. The fact that there were leaks of this budget in which I believe the Minister had a hand &mdash; I may not be accurate in that &mdash; calls into question whether Deputy Reynolds should continue as Minister for Finance.  I intend to raise this matter with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  The reasons for the concern were ably stated by Deputy Deasy <Col N="953" /> and need not be further embellished.  Be that as it may, we must debate the budget as leaked and subsequently presented.</P>
      <P>A leading independent economist, Mr. Joe Durcan of Universiy College Dublin, said in regard to the budget that the danger with the current strategy is that it provides a fiscal stimulous to a fast growing economy and leaves us exposed again to a downturn in activity worldwide.  That is a very accurate statement.  When one makes the necessary adjustment for carry forward of revenue and so on, the Minister opened with a small budget surplus but when he sat down, despite the fact that we have a national debt larger than any in Europe with the exception of Belgium, he had created, in the space of not much more than an hour and a half an Exchequer borrowing requirement to the extent of 2.1 per cent of GNP.  That is not a wise policy and it recalls some of the mistakes made in fiscal policy in the seventies.  In the mid seventies the Government in which I was a junior Minister were very concerned as are the present Government to obtain agreement to a national wage accord and they introduced a range of measures which subsequently proved to be extremely expensive, one of which was food subsidies. All of this was justified on the basis that it would be for the greater good of the country because it would facilitate obtaining a wage agreement.  The result as we know was that while there may have been some slight improvement in the negotiating atmosphere, the wage agreement that was subsequently obtained was not influenced to any degree by the introduction of food subsidies, and food subsidies continued&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We continued with food <Col N="954" /> subsidies along with other fiscal expansions introduced at that time to obtain a national wage agreement and we ended up with borrowing being greatly aggravated and with the necessity of introducing a succession of harsh budgets in the eighties, overtaxing our country and cutting spending as well, subsequently. All that can be traced back to the decisions of the mid seventies to borrow more money to finance certain concessions in order to get agreement to a national wage agreement.</P>
      <P>The Minister, having converted an opening budget surplus into a significant deficit in the space of an hour and a half, was engaging in exactly the same sort of exercise.  He was doing it on the basis of good figures for one or two years.  He told us that the budget revenue for 1989 had been particularly good due, among other things, to a 25 per cent increase in the purchase of cars.  I imagine that people had postponed buying cars for a number of years and that there was then a once-off increase in their purchase.  A lot of suppressed spending also took place during 1989 but to assume that that level of spending, which represents the release of certain pent up demands will continue every year, is a mistaken assumption. Other threats hang over us about which we should not be unduly complacent.  We are very much in the hands of German Central Bank, the Bundesbank, in regard to the level of interest rates charged in this country.</P>
      <P>The level of interest rates in Germany relates to a concern about inflation and the stability of currencies in the European Monetary System.  I read a report of the economic research department of the Commerzbank, one of the big German banks, which predicted a realignment of the EMS in 1990.  In the lead up to that, and because of the uncertainty which will prevail if that prediction is true, there will be upward pressure on interest rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also aware that the German Government are scheduled to introduce a major tax cut during 1990 under a programme set down by the current Christian Democrat-Free Democrat Government.  That will fuel inflation in <Col N="955" /> Germany to some degree and the Bundesbank &mdash; which are totally independent of the government and care not a whit for the fortunes of any government &mdash; may well use that as a basis for further pushing up interest rates in order to mop up any extra demand that may have been created by the tax cut.</P>
    <P>We could enter an era of quite significant pressures on interest rates.  As the Minister pointed out, the cost of existing interest payments by the Government goes up this year by 9 per cent, in the region of three times the rate of inflation. Any further increase or upward pressure on interest rates in any of the currencies from which we are borrowing would have a disproportionately severe effect on our finances.  It is also fair to say that we are budgeting for continued substantial injections from the European Community. I have no doubt that we will get what we have already been promised, I do not think that that is under threat. However, the opening up of Eastern Europe will mean two things, the first is that many projects which might otherwise have come here from continental Europe to avail of our tax concessions will now go to Eastern Europe which is, after all, on the European mainland.  It is easier to get from Warsaw to Paris than from Dublin to Paris.</P>
    <P>I also believe that because of the very great economic interests of Germany in Eastern Europe there will be a tendency to divert significant sums of prospective EC revenues, not towards Irish farmers through the Common Agricultural Policy, not towards structural developments in Portugal, Spain or Ireland &mdash; the existing poorer members of the present EC &mdash; but into Eastern Europe. Therefore, any additional funds which come on stream will not tend to come into the Irish Exchequer, they will tend to go east.</P>
    <P>There are three vulnerabilities which the Minister should have considered when deciding to go for the extra borrowing over and above the budget surplus. The first is that the tax revenue increases are short term and once-off to <Col N="956" /> some degree; second, the situation in relation to interest rates and, third, the long-term prospects as far as EC funds are concerned.  Against that background there is a resumption in the growth of public spending.  If you give tax concessions and increase public spending in a budget it is easy to be temporarily popular, especially if you are doing it on the back of a general upsurge in economic confidence, something that is the case and about which everybody in the House is pleased.  However, it is not necessarily good budgetary policy.  It is ironic but true that it is more difficult to do the right thing in good times in budget terms than in bad times.  In bad times everybody recognises that there is a crisis and is prepared to tighten their belts.  There is a general anxiety to deal with the problem. In one sense the job of Minister for Finance in bad times is a little bit easier. I speak as a former Minister who had that experience twice.  In a sense the job of a Minister for Finance in good times is more difficult because, in trying to preach prudence and a concern about the medium term at a time when everybody is feeling very confident, the Minister is like a Jeremiah, to use a biblical reference. He is seen as preaching a doctrine that nobody wants to hear.  That is what happened in this case.  The Minister for Finance may have started on the route of wishing to look to the medium term but he gave up under the accumulated pressures for a loosening.</P>
    <P>I refer to that because pressure and pressure groups are the source of the fact that Ireland as an economy has underperformed. This budget is not one from the Minister for Finance but from the pressure groups in this House and outside it who look for concessions.  The Minister has assembled a sort of dolly mixture of sweets by picking one or two of the nuggets from the different suggestions made to him from different groups.  He has obviously picked something from virtually everybody's bag of demands, the IFA, the ICTU, the Conference of Major Religious Superiors and, indeed, from the suggestions of Fine Gael.  Quite a number of our suggestions of last year <Col N="957" /> have been incorporated in this year's budget without any acknowledgement. However, I did not expect it and I do not criticise the Minister for Finance for failing to acknowledge that he borrowed some of our idea.  That is normal procedure.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the Minister has been inclined to curry popularity by picking other people's ideas in order to get all the vested interests lined up so that he will get the wage agreement he wants.  I am not saying that we should not look for a wage agreement but I am saying that we should analyse it in terms of the costs and the benefits.  There was an opportunity this year to once and for all get the problem of our finances under control finally, and we must weigh that against the disadvantage of not doing it but, perhaps, getting a wage agreement.  Are the benefits greater on the one side than on the other?  It is my view that the Minister has taken the wrong option particularly at this stage in the life of the Government, assuming that it will last four years.  To introduce this type of budget in the first year of what the Minister hopes will be a three to four year Government is politically, as well as economically, mistaken. That is not something that others will say to the Minister but I am prepared to do so.</P>
    <P>It is the power of vested interests here that has meant that Ireland has under-performed as an economy over the last 70 years.  Vested interests have always had the ear of Government.  Their short term concerns have tended to predominate to the disadvantage and to the cost of the long term development potential of the economy.  I should like to illustrate that by a few brief historical references.  We fought a War of Independence in order to gain independence. In 1918 the majority rejected Home Rule in favour of what they wanted, a republic. What they got was a free state and, ultimately a republic.  The main fiscal or economic difference between Home Rule that would have occurred if we had not had the War of Independence and what we got, a free state and, ultimately, a republic, was that what we got gave us <Col N="958" /> the capacity to impose tariffs on imports from Britain whereas a Home Rule Government initially would not have had that power.</P>
    <P>We got the power in 1922 but for ten years we did not use it because it was felt that if we did our cattle export market would be jeopardised.  One of the strong vested interests in Irish society in the twenties were the cattle exporters with whom I am quite familiar.  They succeeded as a pressure group in getting the then Government not to use the power, the main economic lever that we had fought the War of Independence for, namely, tariffs.  I happen to believe that they were right, that the imposition of tariffs would have been a mistake but it was in terms of economics, the issue over which we fought the War of Independence, and we did not use it because of pressure groups.</P>
    <P>In 1932 Fianna Fáil came to office and they imposed tariffs but instead of those tariffs being used to create a dynamic economy they created a new vested interest, namely, the protected industrialists who produced poor quality shoes at twice the price one could have bought them on the world market.  They succeeded in keeping those tariffs in place until 1963 to the extent that Ireland failed to benefit from the post World War trade boom which was founded on free trade and the Bretton Woods system of international currency alignments.  Ireland failed to develop, as other European countries did after the Second World War, because we persisted in protectionism due to vested interests.  That is another example of vested interests in our society.</P>
    <P>In the seventies we made tremendous savings on our agricultural budget as a result of joining the EC.  Irish agricultural spending went down from 13 per cent of Government spending to about 3 per cent releasing huge sums of money.  The two Governments, the Coalition and Fianna Fáil, used those savings not to develop our economy but to recruit large numbers of public servants of various kinds.  They, in turn, became another vested interest in our society, one which is now extremely <Col N="959" /> powerful to the extent that the Government had to design last week's budget specifically to get them to agree to a wage agreement.  We are now in the position where the public sector is absorbing ever increasing amounts of money.  It is worth noting that, despite the fact that the budget contains some individual tax concessions, the amount of tax to be collected in 1990 will increase over that collected in 1989 by an amount well in excess of the rate of inflation between 1989 and 1990.  In other words, the tax take this year will be bigger than it was last year.  Again, that has to be done as long as the vested interests have to be kept happy.</P>
    <P>The reason Ireland has under-performed is because the Legislature, which represents the general interest in our society, has failed to assert itself against the special interests in our society.  We have not been able to govern the country in the interests of the people of Ireland and generations of Irish people yet unborn.  Instead we have governed it in the interests of relatively small but well informed vested interests.  That is why I describe the budget as a vested interests budget.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a number of points about taxation.  There are those who will say that this country is not overtaxed. The Conference of Major Religious Superiors made the point that in assessing tax changes in the budget a number of points needed to be borne in mind.  They said that we are far from being the most taxed nation in Europe. They made comparisons to indicate that the Irish proportion of GDP is less than that in Luxembourg and France but is, of course, greater than that of Germany and the UK.  To some extent that is to miss the point.  People in a richer country can afford to have a higher proportion of income taken in tax because the individual will have a sufficient amount to fulfil his or her aspirations.  If one's income is twice what it now is, as is the case of the average person in Luxembourg, that person can afford to pay a higher proportion of income in taxes because he or <Col N="960" /> she will have more than enough with the amount they are left with.  That is not the case in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Another point needs to be made about tax.  The relevant comparison is with the country to which the Irish taxpayer has the option of emigrating.  We must bear in mind that single people are the people who tend to emigrate.  On a pre-tax income of £15,000 an Irish single person will take home £9,100.  If that Irish person goes to Britain with the same income he or she will be able to keep almost £11,000.  If that person goes to the United States he or she will be able to keep £11,500 and if that person goes to Australia he or she will be able to keep £11,000.  That is a factor that we must bear in mind.  In Europe after 1992, and in a world in which free movement is accepted, we will be in the position where our tax base can emigrate.  If our rates are significantly out of line with those that apply in other countries to which people can emigrate then they are too high because people will leave.  Some people will agree with that and suggest that we should reduce income tax and put tax on other items.  However, the other items that we would put tax on may also emigrate.  For instance, if we put tax on financial assets once exchange controls are removed people will be in a position to move their bank account from an Irish bank to a bank in the Isle of Man and if the tax rate in the Isle of Man is half what it is here they have escaped.</P>

      <Quest>if he is satisfied with the progress to date of the Programme for Government 1989-1993 In the National Interest; the aspects of that programme which will be given priority by his Government in 1990; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I am satisfied with the progress to date of the implementation of the <i>Programme for Government 1989-1993 In the National Interest</i> and, indeed, of the Government's programme as a whole, which of course incorporates the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the National Development Plan.  The Government's aim will be to continue in 1990 the steady progress already made in implementing the programme.  Many of the specific commitments were reflected in last week's budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach is aware that the average mortgage for home owners increased by £50 last year. How does the Taoiseach reconcile that fact with one of the statements in the early part of the document in question: namely, that they would pursue macro-economic policies to keep interest rates and inflation to a minimum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That we are doing. Particularly, the Deputy will note with great relief the very specific action taken by the Government in this budget to keep down the rate of inflation.  For the first time in a long time the Government have acted directly and specifically in a budget to reduce the rate of inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously we will have to wait, but time will judge that.  In relation to last year's performance, the increase in mortgage rates speak for themselves, which is a very basic test for the average home owner, and in that the Government have obviously failed.  May I ask the Taoiseach if, as promised in the joint programme, any changes in the ownership structure of the commercial State enterprises would be carried out only following consultation with the social partners?  We hear a lot about potential changes in Irish Steel, the Sugar Company and Irish Life. Has any consultation taken place with the social partners to date?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it from the Taoiseach's last reply that it is also, perhaps, not axiomatic but conclusive to a reasonable conclusion?  That statement would mean that there has been no consultation to date.  In relation to the joint programme for Government there was a commitment to look at the housing programme with particular reference to the local authority housing programme. Is the Taoiseach or his Government satisfied that the present programme as contained in the Book of Estimates &mdash; and which remains unchanged after the budget &mdash; with a commitment to a sum in the order of £6 million satisfies the 30,000 people now on housing lists?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Nílimid ag smaoineamh ar athrú polasaí.  Is é an polasaí atá againn ná seirbhís trí Ghaeilge a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na tíre.  Tá ceithre scór míle duine sa Ghaeltacht agus tá suas le milliún duine taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht a bhfuil Gaeilge acu agus a bhfuil suim acu sa teanga agus sa chultúr.  Anois tá ceist MMDS ann agus tá ceist RDL ann.  Má bhaintear úsáid as an RDL agus an MMDS, bíonn seirbhís ar fáil do 80 faoin gcéad de mhuintir na Gaeltachta, agus, ar ndóigh, bíonn an 20 faoin gcéad eile chomh tábhachtach leis an 80 faoin gcéad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bíonn seirbhís ar fáil do 50 faoin gcéad de mhuintir na tíre agus an 50 faoin gcéad <Col N="966" /> eile chomh tábhachtach.  Is é an polasaí atá againne ná seirbhís trí Ghaeilge a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na tíre go léir agus níl an t-eolas go léir againn i Roinn na Gaeltachta.  Mar a dúirt mé, táimid i gcomhairle anois leis an Roinn Chumarsáide agus beimid i gcomhairle le RTÉ. Caithfear a rá, áfach, go bhfuil costas ar seo chomh maith.  Níl sé éasca a rá, ach caithfear a rá agus caithfear bheith réadúil sa lá atá inniu ann.  Ní deas an rud a rá go caithfear luach a chur ar an teanga agus an chultúr, ach caithfear é sin a thabhairt isteach san áireamh chomh maith.

      <P>The latest events regarding Mr. Stalker have been raised with the British authorities.  These developments, notably the collapse of the trial of Mr. Taylor, have again highlighted the negative impact which the Stalker affair continues to have on public confidence.  I am sure the Deputy will have noted the decision of the Manchester Police Authority to initiate their own inquiry into the affair, and the call made by the British Director of Public Prosecutions for the Chief Constable of Manchester to conduct an investigation into the matter.  The Government welcome these latter developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that reply with which I agree.  In regard to the Colin Wallace affair that has come to light in the last 10 days or so, I want to ask the Minister to impress on his UK <Col N="967" /> co-chairman of the Anglo-Irish Conference the difficulties this places on the way of our telling the Nationalists in the North that they must have confidence in the security forces there; and how essential it is that there be a security force in the North in which all sections of the community can have full confidence.  I regret that these two incidents I have just referred to have diminished that confidence and our ability to rebuild it down here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Barry for the comments he has just made. I agree wholeheartedly with him.  I recognise that the incident mentioned in the question is only one of a number of incidents that have seriously interfered with the confidence of the minority population that the security forces will administer law and order in the North in an even-handed way.</P>
      <P>I have availed of every opportunity to impress on the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and other members of the UK Government with whom I have an opportunity on occasions to discuss matters like this that if that confidence, which Deputy Barry and I believe to be essential, is not there there will be no political progress.  If there is no confidence in the evenhandedness of the security forces, how can the people believe they will be given the type of protection they need for their own safety and that of their families?  If that confidence is not there it is replaced by fear. That fear is the best breeding ground for the IRA who will move into that vacuum, and that is something we must try to prevent at all costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept totally the comments made by Deputy Barry and thank him for them.  I assure the Deputy and the House that at every opportunity I try as hard as anybody can to get the British side to understand that, irrespective of whatever difficult decisions they must make, the question of confidence in the security forces is vital.  This came very much to the fore in recent times with the allegation of collusion against the UDR, a matter <Col N="968" /> which still has to be addressed and which will be addressed as soon as we have the report from the Stevens committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to prolong this.  I am satisfied with the Minister's reply and the seriousness with which he is taking this issue.  I would like to extend what he has said here.  I am happy that he will ensure that the comments made here will be brought to the attention of the British Government.  Besides the fear that these incidents send through the hearts of Nationalists in the North, they also send a chill through those of us down here who believe in democracy and in the solution of problems, not by way of violence but by way of political means. It is essential that we be helped in our commitment to bring about a just political solution to the problems in the North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Deputy says.  Again I say to him that at every opportunity I will proceed as I have done because I, too, genuinely believe that when confidence is replaced by fear the obvious logical development is that the vacuum created by the fear is filled by those involved in terrorism and violence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>During the Irish Presidency three EPC ministerial meetings are scheduled, one of them the informal weekend meeting.  The agenda of those meetings is not set this far in advance and will largely be a function of international <Col N="969" /> developments.  Obviously events in Central and Eastern Europe and the future shape of our continent will be a leading priority, but the other priorities will include human rights, the Middle East, South Africa, Central America and the promotion of a political solution in Cambodia. As the Deputy will be aware, in addition to the normal programme of ministerial meetings, the Presidency also called an informal ministerial meeting on 20 Janaury to discuss the Twelve's response to these events.</P>
      <P>In addition to the meetings at Ministerial level, at official level there will be monthly meetings of the Political Committee and some 40 meetings of EPC working groups during the course of the six months.  These working groups include some which deal with specific geographical regions and some which deal with particular subjects such as the conference on security and Disarmament in Europe and Non-Proliferation.  The agenda of these meetings, like all consultations within EPC, is confidential.</P>
      <P>Apart from this there are many hundreds of meetings which take place within the framework of EPC each semester between EC missions in third countries, within the United Nations and other fora.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for his detailed reply.  Does the Minister accept that the EPC process and procedures now in place since the Single European Act have a separate secretariat attached to them?  In that regard I want to ask him very directly, in so far as I understand that the recent informal meetings of Foreign Ministers and political directors was an innovation in the process, when there will be an opportunity for the elected Members of this House to have access to the workings of the EPC secretariat.  What I am really asking is whether the Presidency will be an open Presidency for us also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the meeting at ministerial level which took place in Dublin Castle in January, a series of conclusions on the different issues discussed at that meeting was presented by <Col N="970" /> me on behalf of the Twelve after that meeting.  There is no question whatsoever but that this was an elaborate set of conclusions which was accepted by all those who were present at the time.  I think something in the region of 300 journalists accepted what I said at that time.  If the Deputy wishes I can make arrangments to let him have a note on the outcome of the meeting which I am sure will be helpful to him.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for his offer of co-operation but I want to re-emphasise my point.  If the Minister looks at the balance of the meetings which will take place during the Irish Presidency, and in the context of the European Community, he will see that there is an enormous number of EPC meetings.  My point is a legal one; the EPC process assumed a separate secretariat from the Single European Act and it is the right of the elected members of these Houses to have access in some way or another, for example, by way of summary report, to the workings and proceedings of the EPC process.  It is not sufficient to say that journalists were present for the press communique afterwards. I am simply saying that this House should enjoy the rights of elected members all over Europe have to the openess I have referred to.  Perhaps an initiative can be taken during the Irish Presidency so that reports of these meetings can be presented to us here for our perusal and consideration.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the recent Amnesty International report which found evidence of systematic violation of the human rights of Palestinians in the occupied territories by the Israeli security forces; to the fact that the use of force has often been excessive and indiscriminate; that unarmed Palestinian civilians are being shot dead almost daily by the Israeli security forces; if he has made any representations to the Israeli Government regarding these practices; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The Government are deeply concerned at events in the Occupied Territories and, together with our partners in the Twelve, continue to monitor closely developments there.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the report to which the Deputy has referred and, at Ireland's suggestion, the Twelve made a demarche on 14 January to Israel in which:</P>
      <P>(i)  We expressed our concern</P>
      <P>&mdash;at the unjustified use of generalised violence against hundreds of people during authorised and peaceful demonstrations in Jerusalem on 29-30 December 1989; and</P>
      <P>&mdash;that the current guidelines appear to permit use of firearms in situations that are not life threatening;</P>
      <P>(ii)  We appealed to Israel</P>
      <P>&mdash;to allow peaceful demonstrations to proceed freely;</P>
      <P>&mdash;to cease using excessive force to put down demonstrations and other manifestations of the uprising;</P>
      <P>&mdash;to ensure that law-enforcement officials do not exceed their powers;</P>
      <P>&mdash;to review urgently the guidelines on opening fire; and</P>
      <P>&mdash;to implement Security Council Resolutions Nos. 605 (1987), 607 (1988), 608 (1988) and 636 (1989).</P>
      <P>(iii)  We emphasised</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;the importance for Twelve relations with Israel of full respect of the <Col N="972" /> human rights of the Palestinians of the Occupied Territories;</P>
    <P>(iv)  We reiterated</P>
    <P>&mdash;that the provisions of the Geneva Conventions on the Protection of the Civilian Population in Time of War are applicable to the Occupied Territories.</P>
    <P>(v)  We recalled</P>
    <P>&mdash;the need to open dialogue in order to reach a peace settlement which alone can ensure the rights and legitimate aspiration of each of the parties;</P>
    <P>&mdash;that measures recently taken against leading Palestinians in the Occupied Territories are not conducive to the climate of confidence necessary for any negotiation.</P>
    <P>At a joint meeting between members of the Israeli Knesset (parliament) and the European Parliament, I took the opportunity to re-emphasise these points, in particular the importance for the full spectrum of the Twelve's relations with Israel of all matters affecting the human rights of the Palestinians of the Occupied Territories.</P>
    <P>Bilaterally, our Ambassador in Athens, who is accredited to Israel, in the course of an official visit there from 22 January to 1 February conveyed to the Israeli authorities Ireland's deep concern at the current position in the Occupied Territories.</P>
    <P>I cannot overestimate the need to open dialogue in order to reach a peace settlement which alone can ensure the rights and legitimate aspirations of each of the parties.  It is my firm conviction that the measures currently being applied by Israel in the Occupied Territories are not conducive to the climate of confidence necessary for any negotiation.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his detailed reply.  It is very encouraging to see him taking a keen interest in the situation in Israel and the Occupied Territories.  The Amnesty International report gave particular cause for alarm.  Is the Minister aware <Col N="973" /> that more than half the 540 people shot dead were under 18 years of age, 110 were under 16 years of age and that some children as young as three and four years were shot dead?  As well as pursuing this matter through the European Community would the Minister undertake for Ireland to take up with the Israeli Ambassador in Britain, who has responsibility for relations with Ireland, these matters which arise from the Amnesty International report?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 10 and 25 together.  The Government's deep concern about the Birmingham Six case has been repeatedly and forcefully made clear to the British authorities.  The Taoiseach raised the case with the British Prime Minister when they met at the European Council on 9 December.  I myself raised the case last month with both the Home Secretary, Mr. David Waddington, and the Foreign Secretary, Mr. Douglas Hurd and, as late as last Sunday, discussed it with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Peter Brooke.</P>
      <P>The Government's priority lies in having the British authorities re-open this case.  In this regard, it is not our intention at present to have it raised at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my meeting with the Home Secretary on 8 January, I conveyed the Government's strong view that the current investigation into the West Midlands Serious Crime Squad should be extended to include the Birmingham Six case. While this investigation does not at present go back as far as 1974, the Home Secretary assured me that, if anything emerged from it which was relative to the Birmingham Six case, he would be <Col N="976" /> prepared to have the investigation extended back in time to cover this case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that a case could be made for extending this inquiry as far back as 1974 since a number of officers are common to both cases?  A further factor has now entered the picture, the dropping of charges against McBrearty which were based on very doubtful forensic evidence.  Two members of the Birmingham Six were convicted on what I consider to be doubtful forensic evidence also.  This is a further factor which the Minister might draw to the attention of the Home Secretary in Britain in an effort to convince him to re-open the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the view being offered by Deputy Barry and I can assure him that as early as 13 September I made that case to the then Home Secretary, Douglas Hurd, and that I made the same case to Mr. Waddington.  As the Deputy knows, Mr. Hurd, following my discussion with him, did say that if anything emerged from the investigation into the West Midlands Police he was prepared to allow the investigation go back to 1974. He was not in a position then nor has his successor, Mr. Waddington, been in a position to state officially that they would broaden the investigation and allow it to go back to that date.  I made the case which was suggested by Deputy Barry having regard to the fact that certain members of the specialist squad of that police force were also involved in the case of the Birmingham Six.  There is no doubt in my mind about that.  As I say, this was put to him on a number of occasions and the position is as I have outlined to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The proposal to establish a European Environment Agency was made last year by the EC Commission.

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us hear the rest of it. If the Deputy does not have faith in his own capital city, it is hard to understand how others will.  Our interest in hosting the agency has also been brought to the attention of the relevant authorities in the other member states.  The question of the location of the agency is an issue to be considered during our Presidency.</P>
      <P>The various submissions from member states are currently being examined within the Council framework and the agency's location is likely to be discussed at next month's General Affairs Council. In line with our commitment to paying special attention to the environment during our Presidency, we would hope to settle this issue quickly so that the establishment of the agency will not be delayed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In thanking the Minister for his reply may I ask him if he would agree that the success or failure of the Government in delivering this agency to some venue on this island, let us not be specific about the site, will be testimony to how serious our European partners are taking our pretentions towards maintaining a green Presidency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say to Deputy Quinn, who is extremely knowledgeable in this area, that a number of decisions on the location of Community agencies have not been resolved.  The fact that they have not been resolved does not reflect on the member states which held the Presidency during the particular periods. Deputy De Rossa is living witness to the fact that the European Parliament is in Strasbourg.  The headquarters of the Parliament are in Luxembourg while the Commission is in Brussels.  We have quite a number of decisions to make and this is regrettable.  When talking about the Parliament we should also refer to some of the other ones.  At least they have a working arrangement there.  I hope that when the Commission comes to evaluate, <Col N="980" /> as it has been charged to do, the applications on the site location of this agency, we will try as best we can to ensure there is consensus as it would not be to the credit of any member of the Community if the decision on the location of the agency were to be delayed because of a failure to agree.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two supplementary questions which I will try to ask together. Will the Minister agree that the decision to locate the agency will be made in the six month period, that it is widely known in the corridors of Brussels that agreement in principle has been made in favour of Copenhagen and that that decision is tantamount to a slap in the face to the Irish Government whose pretentions to a &ldquo;green&rdquo; Presidency have been paraded around the halls of Europe?  Secondly, out of desperation could he not offer the vacant premises of the truncated and executed An Foras Forbartha who were the only environmental protection agency this country had and whose offices are now empty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will ignore the political barbs of the Deputy's questions and say to him that Copenhagen has a very strong case.  It has no agency of the Community whatsoever and it is considered a front runner.  That is no secret; it is fact and that fact cannot in any way be regarded by anybody as a slap in the face for the Irish Presidency, so I had best ignore that, otherwise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I feel, and the Deputy should know because it has been said before now, that it is the intention <Col N="981" /> of the Irish Presidency to get consensus on the location of this agency.  The Irish Presidency can do no more than be genuine in its efforts to get consensus, and that we will be.  I am sure the Deputy and other Members will agree that the important thing is that we get it established, up and running.  I believe there are 48 locations being examined from all the member states.  I do not know how many meet but at least we have one and no more than one.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister indicate to the House in synopsis form the substance of the submission made on behalf of the Irish Government in July last seeking the siting of the European environmental protection agency in this country? Would he not agree that if the Government removed their opposition to the Fine Gael Environmental Protection Agency Bill which comes before this House next week and permitted the passage of that Bill to establish such an agency in this country, it would land both weight and credibility to the Government's application to Europe and would lend weight and credibility with other member states in their indicated support to us for the siting of such a European agency in this country?</P>

      <P>I am sure the Deputy realises full well that only one part of his supplementary question is relevant as far <Col N="982" /> as the Minister for Foreign Affairs is concerned. The other part he can take up at another time with other people.  The main points made on Ireland's submission in our bid for locating the agency in Dublin is that Ireland is inherently suitable from the environmental point of view in that we have an international reputation as a country with an unspoiled environment, the availability of high standard accommodation at the Custom House Docks, low operating costs, and an attractive living and working environment with accessibility to all amenities as well as full co-operation with Government agencies and universities, and substantial Government financial assistance and support from the IDA for local employment to be generated.</P>

      <P>I hope the Commission's thinking will not be as centralised as the Minister's or we have no hope.  I am amused by the Minister describing Dublin as environmentally clean.  I could put a stronger case for Cork.  Will the Minister agree that if the Commission agree to site the agency in Ireland it would be a major act of decentralisation in a Community which is over-centralised? We just have to look at Brussels, Strasbourg and Luxembourg to see how centralised the Community is to date.  Will he make that point to the Commission before a decision is made?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary) Sean Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 72, 81 and 82 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="984" /> Nicaragua is given aid in the general context of Community aid to Asia and Latin America, as well as food aid and emergency assistance. In addition projects undertaken by non-governmental organisations are often co-financed by the Community.</P>
    <P>Nicaragua is the largest single recipient of EC aid, accounting for about 40 per cent of payments since 1980. Last year the Community provided 15.625 million ECUS in aid, including food aid of 9.4 million ECU and co-financing with NGOs of 4.4 million ECUS.</P>
    <P>It is correct that in recent years the proportion of financial and technical assistance has declined relative to some other recipients in the Central American region. There are two principal reasons for this.</P>
    <P>First, there is a perception that this form of aid should be spread more evenly over the various countries and that Nicaragua has in recent years received a very large proportion of it. For example, while Guatemala received 8.5 million ECU in 1988, Nicaragua was the only other country in the region to receive any funds for financial and technical co-operation in that year. El Salvador which, exceptionally, was allotted 18 million ECU in 1987 received nothing the following year and indeed has received only an additional 3.3 million ECU in the entire period 1983-88. Honduras received no financial or technical assistance during 1987 or 1988.</P>
    <P>The second, and more important, reason is that since the Hamburg meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Central American countries and the Contadora Group with the European Community, which was held in 1988, aid, in accordance with proposals put forward by the Central American countries, has increasingly been focused on regional projects. This regional approach was confirmed at the similar meeting which was held in San Pedro Sula in February last year. Regional assistance amounted to 39.1 million ECU in 1988, or 35 per cent of total commitments, compared with 22 million ECU in 1987 and only 3.15 million ECU the previous year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="985" /> At the Hamburg meeting the Central American states presented their plan of action, which was designed to support the peace process in the region by promoting regional integration and reconstruction. The Community made clear its willingness to respond to a number of aspects of the emergency plan.</P>
    <P>At the meeting in San Pedro Sula I expressed support for a well-founded project having a regional dimension. Since then the Community has agreed the first instalment of a 150 million ECU commitment towards the setting up of a regional payments system in Central America. This project should be of significant direct benefit to Nicaragua and other countries in reviving trade between themselves.</P>
    <P>Within the Community, Ireland has always supported the rebuilding of social programmes and the granting of all forms of development aid to Nicaragua. We intend to continue to do so while worthwhile projects of assistance to the Nicaraguan people are proposed.</P>
    <P>The question of compliance by the various countries in the region with the peace accords is not directly related to the distribution of aid, which is decided purely on developmental grounds.</P>
    <P>Finally I would like to deal with the issue of the European Investment Bank. The bank operates within Europe, and, by way of derogation, in Mediterranean countries under the terms of co-operation agreements with the state concerned. It also lends to ACP countries with whom the Community has contractual commitments and obligations through the Lome convention. While the Community is anxious to expand its relationship with Latin America the agreements with Asian and Latin American countries do not provide for loans from the EIB. As the bank does not have the resources to expand its operations to these regions, I have to say I feel that the council would be unable to accede to any request of this nature, whether from Nicaragua or the Central American area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his very long considered reply. However, <Col N="986" /> is the Minister aware that the Nicaraguan Government are dissatisfied that the proportion of aid, although substantial, has been considerably reduced and that the conclusion they have come to is that it has been reduced because they seem to threaten the United States which is a major partner of the EC?</P>
      <P>While I accept the Minister's assertion that there is no relationship between the countries which comply with the peace accords and those who do not when aid is being granted, would he not agree that Nicaragua has been outstandingly co-operative in all the peace accords, which is more than can be said for a great number of the other countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to tell the Deputy that the United States is not a partner of the Community. I know that Deputy was present at the meeting held this morning so he should have been listening to what the Minister for Foreign Affairs was saying. As I have stated, the general orientation of aid to the Central American region is changing to regional aid rather than aid to individual countries, and this is at the request of the Central American countries and not of the Community. I feel very happy to co-operate with this situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to respond to the Minister by saying that we would be very naive if we thought the United States is not exerting pressure. Does the Minister for Foreign Affairs have plans to launch his own initiative for the region during our term of Presidency of the EC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs will have the opportunity, as <Col N="987" /> indeed will the other Community Ministers for Foreign Affairs, of meeting representatives from the Central American states in Dublin in the very near future.  At that stage, the Community will be prepared to listen to suggestions from the Central American states on the agenda.  As I have said already, Ireland has always considered any worthwhile projects, as has the Community and, indeed, we will continue to do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>My question relates to the change in policy which has just been announced.  The Hamburg Accord was very clear, Nicaragua got a great proportion of aid in the early days because it had a good record of ensuring efficient distribution of the aid internally and it, more than other countries, had complied with the terms of the peace accord.  It had specific problems, one of which was a breach of the GATT Agreement by the United States, which has not been attacked by Ireland or the Community. I understand that what the Minister of State is saying is that irrespective of compliance with the peace initiatives or with the spirit that informed the Hamburg Accord, the basis for giving funds to Central America will be the proportion one country is getting in comparison with another.  For that reason may I place on record that in the past three years El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, who have done least and, in fact, some have done a great deal to wreck the peace accord, have got increased aid while the aid to Nicaragua has been decreased?  It is a scandalous change in policy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Along with other Ministers of the Community who attended the meetings, I am quite happy to go along with what these countries are saying, that is that they would much prefer to see the aid being given on a regional basis rather than on the individual country basis.  There is an awful lot of sense in that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 69, 90, 92 and 93 together. In 1989 total Polish coal imports amounted to approximately 606,000 tonnes with a value of IR£41.5 million. In 1990 we expect that these figures will be more than halved in view of the introduction of the controls announced by the Minister for the Environment on 26 January 1990 for the Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to bilateral aid to Eastern Europe, the Government has made available a special provision of IR£650,000 for 1990 for bilateral aid projects in Poland and Hungary.  These funds have been added to the Bilateral Aid Fund under the Fund for International Co-operation. In addition, the Government will contribute their share of the European Communities programme of assistance to Poland and Hungary.  We have already disbursed some of the bilateral aid and I expect to make further allocations shortly in the light of identified needs in these countries.  In addition, the Government allocated IR£100,000 for disaster relief for Romania in the aftermath of the December revolution there.  This was provided to the Irish Red Cross for the purchase of medical supplies, and has <Col N="990" /> been paid from the disaster relief fund. No funds have been allocated for East Germany.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister clarify for the House the budget from which the money that went to Poland, Romania and East Germany came?  The Minister referred to a special provision of IR£650,000 but where was provision made for this in the Estimates?  Would the Minister confirm that the aid of £100,000 to Romania actually came from the emergency aid budget for our overseas development programme and would he not agree with me that this allocation should have come from elsewhere than the already depleted overseas development fund?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The allocation of economic assistance for Poland and Hungary was a special extra allocation made by the Government in the 1990 Estimates. The provision of disaster relief for Romania was made from the 1990 allocation for disaster relief.  Normally such funds are used for developing countries, but the disaster relief fund is not specifically tied to use in these countries only. Amounts provided to non-developing countries are excluded from the calculation of the official development assistance.</P>

Would he agree it is important that such fears be allayed by his giving the House a categoric assurance that that will not happen, at least in relation to Irish aid and in regard to his influence within the European Community?

      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's supplementary question is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;; there is and has been concern among Community members, among the membership of the ACP, among the Mediterranean group of countries, that Community funds would be diverted from these areas to Central and Eastern Europe.  Efforts have been made to try to allay that concern.  Indeed, one Member of this House who was present up to a few minutes ago &mdash; Deputy Garland &mdash; raised that issue this morning at a meeting chaired by Deputy Barry, that is the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Secondary Legislation of the EC.  There I was able to say that it is certainly not the intention of the Community &mdash; and I think Deputy De Rossa was present in the European Parliament when President Jacques Delors said something similar &mdash; that this would happen.  In fact moneys already provided by the Community will not interfere in any way with the allocations agreed to the ACP or to any of the other obligations <Col N="992" /> the Community must honour.  On a bilateral basis I readily understand Members' concern, even taking into account the low level of our contributions in this area &mdash; I think this matter appears on the Order Paper for later today but I accept readily that we should not weaken our position with regard to our bilateral aid.  The only mechanism available to us at the particular time to meet the request for immediate aid &mdash; this answers the latter part of Deputy De Rossa's supplementary question &mdash; of a humanitarian nature was the only one available to us in our endeavour to help out in those circumstances.  I presume Deputy De Rossa means that there would be certain conditions attached to Community aid generally, that is Community aid to some of the developing countries in Central and Eastern Europe, that they must be countries that show clearly they are on the path to a market-orientated economy, that they are on the road to a multiparty electoral system&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think one gets points for that, if one is on the road to a market-orientated economy.  Being on the road to implementing human rights is another matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course human rights constitute another important element. These are the requirements that have to be met and will be essential to the allocation of the type of aid Deputy De Rossa has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think it somewhat odd that we are giving aid to Poland &mdash; which I am glad to support &mdash; while at the same time another arm of Government is introducing a measure which will damage their economy because coal constitutes one of their major currency earners?  Would the Minister agree that many people would subscribe to the view that it is damaging the least well off in our own country and that there is a contradiction between all of these elements which should be resolved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the logic of the <Col N="993" /> point made by Deputy Barry.  When I suggested some five or ten minutes ago that Dublin be considered a possible location for the environmental agency there was a titter from certain benches, obviously because of the smog with which we have to deal.  I accept that.  Some Members might regard those proposed measures as not sufficient but they constitute a very good start.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not the point I was making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to it.  Coal imports from Poland obviously play a major part in the smog with which we must contend.  Of course, if we reduce our imports of coal from Poland by 50 per cent, as is envisaged by the Department of the Environment, that will have a very serious effect on the Polish economy. Therefore, one may well ask if there is any alternative.</P>

Can he now give the House an assurance that he will immediately restore that money to the ODA fund because, in reply to a parliamentary question on 23 November last, the Minister made big play of the fact that the budget was £0.9 million over 1989 whereas now it is £200,000 less than 1989?</P>

      <P>My Department continue to support the valuable work of UNICEF &mdash; UN Children's Fund &mdash; in developing countries through their annual voluntary contribution to the budget of the organisation.  The Government also respond to requests from UNICEF for emergency assistance.  The voluntary allocation to UNICEF for 1990 is IR£123,000.  This figure represents an increase of over 4 per cent on last year's contribution.</P>
      <P>The amount of Ireland's contribution to UNICEF &mdash; as to the other UN development and relief agencies &mdash; is reviewed annually.  As budgetary circumstances permit it is hoped to increase Ireland's contribution in real terms to UNICEF.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I find the Minister's reply very disappointing in view of the fact that in 1985 the allocation by the then Coalition Government of Fine Gael and Labour amounted to £380,000.  In 1986 that figure was increased to £420,000.  In the first year of the Fianna Fáil administration that figure was reduced by £100,000 to £320,000.  In 1988 there was a further reduction bringing the figure to £105,000, in 1989 the figure was £120,000 and, alleluia, we see a 4 per cent increase this year bringing the figure to £123,000.  In view of the fact that 14 million children die annually and of the very spontaneous, generous outpouring by the public here in response to such famine catastrophes, would the Minister not agree that the response of the Government, to put it mildly, is unChristian, niggardly and parsimonious?</P>

In addition we contribute to UNICEF from the disaster relief fund for emergencies and have done so in 1988 and 1989.  I might remind Deputy Higgins that the Estimates for 1987 about which he spoke, in the main, were prepared by the Coalition Government who went out of office in January 1987&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 17 and 68 together.</P>
      <P>The Government, who do not maintain diplomatic relations with South Africa, have not made any recent specific approach to the South African authorities regarding the release of Nelson Mandela. However, we have joined in regular calls by the Twelve for his release.  In the light of the announcement last Friday by President de Klerk that Nelson Mandela will soon be freed unconditionally, the Government hope that further representations for his release are now unnecessary.  However, on behalf of the Government, I wish to take this opportunity to urge President de Klerk to follow through on his announcement without further delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nelson Mandela, if he is indeed released in the near future, will be a very <Col N="998" /> welcome visitor to Ireland at any time. The Government would be more than happy to welcome and receive Mr. Mandela should he decide he would like to come to Ireland.</P>
    <P>Should Mr. Mandela be released, it would be my intention, on behalf of the Government and people of Ireland, to welcome publicly a development which so many people have sought for so many years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Will the Minister accept that a distinction must be drawn between saying that Nelson Mandela would be welcome if he came to Ireland and doing what I am asking him to do which is to extend a formal invitation from the Government to him to visit Ireland?  Will the Minister confirm that he will issue an invitation to Nelson Mandela to visit Ireland and to perhaps address a joint assembly of the Dáil and the Seanad?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy understands that I would need a formal Government decision on that.  As of now, I have not got that, but I am prepared to recommend that decision to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister confirm that policy in the Department of Foreign Affairs is now changed, and that they and the Minister are willing to meet members of the ANC now that that organisation is no longer banned?  It has been the policy of successive heads of Department not to directly meet members of the ANC. Since Nelson Mandela is a member of the ANC and seeing that the Minister is prepared to meet him, is he also prepared to meet ANC members?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister assure the House that while we all welcome the intention of the South African authorities to release Nelson Mandela, since he is still in prison and the state of emergency is still largely in place as is the apartheid system, this Government, <Col N="999" /> especially in our role in the European Community, will ensure that normalisation of affairs with South Africa will not take place until the apartheid system is dismantled and confirm that simply having a market economy is not sufficient to guarantee our support for them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's supplementary is very relevant and I thank him for it.  The question of sanctions has been raised recently and there is much speculation that the sanctions will be lifted.  The 12 Heads of Government in 1985 at the summit in the second half of 1985 agreed in principle on the sanctions that were to be maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  There has been an announcement by President De Klerk that Nelson Mandela will be released.  We await his release.  This Government and previous Governments are committed to the abolition of apartheid. There is a long way to go yet but at least there are indications of a shift in policy in South Africa.  Obviously a number of legislative measures must be passed.  The classification legislation is still there for instance.  There were discussions, lasting no longer than a few minutes at our meeting in Brussels on Monday on the question of sanctions. There is a view held by one or two of our colleagues in the Community that sanctions should be lifted somewhat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not get into the guessing game for obvious reasons, but the Deputy will agree that the statement I issued on behalf of the Twelve on Monday night clearly sets out our position bearing in mind our obligations and our commitment to the abolition of apartheid. The first step has been made on a long road towards the abolition of apartheid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>

      <P>Before we adjourned I was making the point that in comparing our tax system with other countries, the most relevant comparison is not between, for instance, the tax situation here and in Sweden or the tax situation here and in Luxembourg or Austria, because the average Irish person who is contemplating relocation &mdash; either to work in another industry or of their money &mdash; does not think of Sweden, Austria or the Nordic countries, the relevant comparison is with the English-speaking world.  As I said, taking an average income of £15,000, the single Irish person has a significantly less take home pay &mdash; perhaps as much as £1,500 less &mdash; than the person on the same salary in the UK. Indeed, the Irish person earning that salary has about £3,000 less than his <Col N="1060" /> counterpart in the United States or Australia.</P>
      <P>When calls are made for a greater tax on the corporate sector or property, one must bear in mind that, with the exception of certain types of real property, that is, land and buildings, which cannot be moved to another tax jurisdiction, it is increasingly easy for people to move other forms of property and corporations to different jurisdictions.  If our corporation tax is significantly higher in terms of the rate or in terms of the absence of allowances from the tax that applies in Northern Ireland, it is quite possible to envisage companies relocating their warehouses and operations in Newry and trading freely across the open EC boundary throughout this island.</P>
      <P>The same applies to people who, as a result of the removal of exchange controls, can move their financial assets to a jurisdiction where the taxes are less. Rather than setting our sights in terms of taxation on the basis of comparisons with GDP in Scandinavian countries, the relevant consideration in regard to corporation tax, income tax and &mdash; although not to the same extent &mdash; taxes on wealth, we must consider the comparative tax level in other jurisdictions to which the person, his corporation or his assets could readily be moved.  If our tax levels are significantly higher or more onerous than in the competing jurisdiction, the system simply will not work.  There will be a flight of individuals, assets and corporations to other jurisdictions.</P>
      <P>Those who think that there is an unlimited availability of tax revenue to fund all sorts of suggested schemes &mdash; usually good, sensible and worthy schemes &mdash; should bear in mind that in the Europe of 1992, all these things can be readily moved to avoid tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Interest rates being charged to people on mortgages and to those borrowing money from the bank in this country are 2 to 3 percentage points higher than they need be.  In some cases, they are 4 or 5 percentage points higher than necessary. There are a number of reasons for this. There have been four increases in interest rates in 1989, the first two were necessary <Col N="1061" /> in order to keep our interest rates in line with the Deutsche Mark interest rates, which we must do as long as we are in the EMS because, essentially the Deutsche Mark runs the EMS.  However, in the latter half of 1989 there were two further unnecessary increases in interest rates which did not occur in Germany.  They were justified on the grounds of loss of reserves but that loss could easily have been replenished by the Central Bank if they had borrowed German Deutsche Marks.</P>
    <P>In view of the obvious and sustainable determination of the Irish authorities to maintain the relationship between the IR£ and the Deutsche Mark there would have been no risk involved as far as the Central Bank were concerned.  Having done that, they could have replenished the reserves without any need to increase interest rates.  A mistaken interest rate policy in the second half of 1989 is responsible for the fact that interest rates currently being paid by people on a mortgage are 2 percentage points higher than they need be.  This is borne out by the fact that the gap between Irish and German interest rates expanded by two points during 1989 over and above what it was at the beginning of the year.</P>
    <P>I know it will be said that the Minister has no direct responsibility for this, that interest rates policy is a matter for the Central Bank.  It is the case, however, that the Central Bank consult on a daily basis the Department of Finance in regard to the interest rate policy.  The Central Bank would not take a decision on the interest rate policy which was contrary to the Minister's wishes.  While the Minister may not have been the initiator of the extra loaded interest rates in the latter half of 1989, I believe he was a willing participant in the extra interest rate hike which was unnecessary and which can be reversed.</P>
    <P>Interest rates in this country are too high for another reason, because of the inefficiency of our financial sector.  Overheads in the Irish banking system represent 4 per cent of their total activity whereas overheads in the system of the building societies represent only 2 per <Col N="1062" /> cent of their activity.  In other words, the building societies, which are able to provide more or less the same services as the bank, have only half the overheads. Furthermore, overheads in our banking system &mdash; and indeed in the system of the building societies &mdash; are significantly higher in proportion than the overheads of the competing banking and building society systems in the United Kingdom. This means in essence that the Irish borrower and/or depositor is paying more than he needs because of inefficiency in what has been in the past a protected financial services industry, a protection which will soon disappear.</P>
    <P>There is considerable evidence that the banks are in a position to determine their own prices in the absence of competition. I understand one bank has spent a huge sum of money &mdash; figures of many millions have been quoted &mdash; on launching a new logo.  Any company that can spend such a huge sum of money on changing their brand image and on advertising is clearly not in the position of being buffeted regularly by price competition.  They obviously have a captive market and can afford to spend such large sums of money on promotion.</P>
    <P>I also believe that the rules which apply to access for new participants to the clearing banks system for cheques is unduly restrictive and that new entrants, for example, building societies who wish to become participants in clearing systems find difficulty in doing so.  There is a fear on the part of some that, in the absence of their participation, by having to use other people's services information will pass from the building society to a competing bank whose clearing facilities they are using.  They are also worried that the fact that a particular client has moved money from the bank to the building society will perhaps become known to the banks because the building society have to use the clearing house system at secondhand.</P>
    <P>When one adds the extra overheads and costs of the relative inefficiencies of our banking system to the unnecessary increase of 2 per cent in interest rates in <Col N="1063" /> the second half of last year, one can see that interest rates being paid by mortgage holders are 2, 3 or 4 per cent higher than they need be.  It is important to put that in context and compare it with the small increases which have occurred in income tax relief in the budget.  A married couple with an income of £16,000 will, according to the Minister, gain £216 per year under the budget.  If they have a recent mortgage of £35,000 the additional increases in interest rates last year will cost them somewhere in the region of £100 per month or £1,200 per year in extra interest, as against a gain of a mere £216 as a result of the fall in income tax. Deficiencies in interest rates policy are a good deal more important than many of the concessions about which so much noise was made in the budget debate.</P>
    <P>There are other areas which require rigorous scrutiny.  In other debates in the House evidence has been produced indicating that we could have a better health service for the same amount of money if we were to have one national health board rather than the large number of duplicating boards we have at present. We would have a better service if we were to have proper internal management with one person in charge rather than a multifarious number of people in charge of each hospital, and if we were to use private nursing homes rather than acute hospital beds for elderly people, many of whom are retained in hospital because they cannot be accommodated elsewhere. In that way they are costing everybody, including their families, a good deal more money than they would if they could be accommodated in nursing homes.</P>
    <P>Relatively simple changes could be made to get better value for money and a better health service, such as by the administrative changes I have mentioned. The Government are not taking the necessary structural decisions to reform the delivery of the service that they should be taking.  They have pruned money off the top and are trying to avoid offending people so that they will get a wage agreement.  They are trying to leave <Col N="1064" /> things as they are for as long as possible and that is a mistaken policy.</P>
    <P>There is evidence of substantial waste of money in road building.  Under the present system national primary roads are paid for by the taxpayer nationally but decisions in regard to stretches of roads are carried through by the engineering departments of the county councils. I am advised that that has led to certain stretches of our national primary routes costing 50 or 100 per cent more than they would cost if we had a single national roads authority.  The Department of the Environment are trying to kill the National Roads Authority.  They do not want that body to have statutory power to take over the national direction of road building.  The Department, local authority engineers and county managers want to preserve an inefficient system because it retains a measure of power for them.  That will cost the country a huge and unnecessary amount of money.</P>
    <P>There is considerable pressure from all sides of the House to spend more money on housing.  There is no doubt that the waiting list for local authority houses is extremely long but I must ask whether a resumption of local authority housing as conventionally understood is the right answer to the housing crisis.  If we have highly subsidised housing provided &mdash; if we have 100 units provided with 1,000 on the waiting list &mdash; there will be a huge queue because if we subsidise enough the waiting lists will get longer and longer.  It would be more sensible if instead of giving the subsidy to the local authority to build a house to be allocated to an individual we gave that subsidy to the individual to pay for his own housing needs.  We should give that person the freedom to use that subsidy in the form of a housing credit to buy a house, rent a dwelling or make the arrangement he or she wishes to make.</P>
    <P>The housing subsidy or credit should be based on the housing needs of the applicant, such as the size of the family, the income of the family and such factors. A housing credit system would be sensible, more efficient and would not create waiting lists.  It would allow a mix of <Col N="1065" /> private and public provision competing with one another for the most efficient provision of appropriate housing.  It would avoid the creation of huge local authority ghettos and, indeed, private sector ghettos which exist in some of our surburbs.  In places like Foxrock, where there is the one type of housing, the people never meet in their area people from a different social background.  Likewise, people in large local authority housing estates do not mix with people from a different social background.  That is unhealthy, divisive and unnecessary.  It is a direct result of a commitment to local authority housing being provided by county councils rather than by means of a housing credit to individuals.  I have not worked out the details of such a scheme and I am sure other Members could point to difficulties that would arise.  However, one must recognise that the present housing policy is not a good one.  It is leading to huge waiting lists, to expensive provision for the few rather than large scale provision for the many.  People have to live in dreadful conditions for five or six years waiting to be housed.  A different policy, costing the same amount of money, could get them a house quicker. I urge the Government to consider such a scheme.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister, after all the talk about employees' PRSI being a tax on work and preventing the creation of jobs, announced in the budget that he intends this year to carry out a detailed inter-Departmental study on the operation of the PRSI system.  What has he been doing for the last two years? He has known about the problem.  The Minister should have abolished employees' PRSI and incorporated it in income tax.  Then we would have automatic personal allowances against employees' PRSI and incorporated it in continue with employers' PRSI if he considered it necessary to establish it as a means of title to various benefits. However, there is no need to have a separate system of employees' PRSI with a system of income tax.  I do not see why the Minister did not abolish it and incorporate it in income tax.  We do <Col N="1066" /> not need another examination to produce such a simple and sensible solution.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to social policy issues.  It will not surprise Members to hear me suggest that we should have a recognition of children in the tax code.  If a person has a dependent spouse he or she gets a substantial tax allowance.  In my view it should be a tax credit because in that case there would not be extra benefits for those on a high income. There is a tax allowance also for any other dependent individual and it is known as a dependent relative allowance. However, we do not have an allowance for a dependent child.  The only species of person for whom a taxpayer does not get an allowance is a child.  That does not make sense.  The only argument against such an allowance is that if we were to reintroduce child tax allowances the people with large incomes would gain most because they would be paying more tax than the person on low income.  I accept that but that is also an argument against tax allowances for a spouse.  If that argument is valid it should lead to the abolition of the spouse tax allowance as well and, indeed, the individual's own tax allowance.  There is no justification, in my view, for the discrimination which exists against children in the tax code at present.  Let me anticipate the Minister of State.  It is a situation which has existed for many years and which was not improved in any way by the Government of which I was a member, so I will concede my disarmed status in regard to that matter.  I will not, as I have not published my book yet, say what I said about capitalists.</P>

      <P>It will not be for a very long time.  Perhaps sometime in the <Col N="1067" /> middle of the next century Deputy Lawlor and I will get together and we will do a joint study.  I regret very much that the Minister has not taken advice from this side of the House and gone for a graduated medical card.  The position is that when one reaches a certain level of income one loses the medical card in its entirety.  I believe there should be a graduated loss of medical card entitlements with, perhaps, a small charge at one level and so on.  At present the loss of the medical card is a disincentive to taking up employment.  There is no doubt about that.  A simple thing to do would be to graduate the loss of benefit in an easier way and it would not cause great administrative difficulties to introduce a stepwise reduction.  That is another matter that relates to the poverty trap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer now to the office of the management of the national debt.  I know this is a most unfashionable thing to say but I have the gravest reservations about setting up a special office in the Department of Finance in order to give one category of the officers of the Department of Finance higher salaries while the rest of the staff do not get the same increase in salaries.  In my view the officers who work in the public expenditure division in the Department of Finance are just as valuable to the State as those who work in the finance division borrowing money.  The people who work in the finance division can save only a margin on the interest rate by good negotiation. Good work in the public expenditure division of the Department can save a net sum of money by eliminating a programme altogether or recasting that programme.  Why should one section of the Civil Service who deal regularly with bankers wearing upmarket suits by a rather high fashion tailor have twice the salary of those who are dealing with people who wear perhaps off the peg suits and who are doing equally valuable work on behalf of the State?  I do not think it is fair or that it is good for morale in the Department of Finance.  I am very conscious &mdash; and I say this with some strength of feeling &mdash; of the high quality <Col N="1068" /> of all the people working in all areas of the Department of Finance and we should not make fish of one and flesh of the other.  I am very doubtful about the saving of £35 million extra which the Minister said would be achieved because of the setting up of this office.  He will either save that money in any event or he will not; I do not think it has anything to do with paying these officers more.</P>
    <P>I am not happy about the fact that the Government will receive the money for the increase in VAT from the ESB's own coffers.  We have been hearing from this Government, and particularly from the Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds, long sermons about the need to promote enterprise and independent thinking in the semi-State sector, an enterprise culture, marketing and so on.  Yet he comes along to the ESB which owes something of the order of £400 million, every penny of which is guaranteed by the taxpayer, and says to them: &ldquo;You must carry the cost of an increase in electricity; you must pay the VAT, without any increase in the price to the consumer&rdquo;.  This is a body who are already deeply in debt &mdash; all of which is guaranteed by the State &mdash; and who are being asked to pay up another £11 million on top of their debt.  They will probably borrow that money, thereby adding to their existing borrowings. Therefore, this is essentially a book-keeping transaction, transferring from the debts of the State to the debts of the ESB &mdash; which are guaranteed chiefly by the State &mdash; a sum of £11 million. It is fraudulent budgeting.  It is a rerun of the sort of approach that was so characteristic of Fianna Fáil in Government in the early part of the eighties and it was something I had hoped I would never see again.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the grave crisis that occurs in agriculture at present.  I am glad to see three Deputies facing me from rural constituencies who are familiar with this situation.  It is well known that those who are engaged in dry stock, so far as agriculture is concerned, are in grave difficulties at present.  Those who are engaged in winter fattening, the people who provide the essential outlet for those <Col N="1069" /> in the store cattle production system, are losing money again for the fourth year running.  They will not continue.  The cost of making silage, the cost of borrowing money to carry cattle over the winter makes it prohibitive to continue winter fattening at present prices.  That is aggravated by the fact that the system of EC support is skewed in favour of summer production and is artificially depressing the price available for those who engage in the most expensive form of production, that is, winter production without which there would be no outlet for the summer production and without which the cattle economy would collapse.  The failure to achieve &mdash; I realise it is not of the Government's doing &mdash; a readjustment in the system of support for beef will have grave national consequences.  This is not a problem that is faced by other European countries because wintering cattle is not as expensive, relatively speaking, in those countries as in Ireland for a variety of climatic reasons to which I will not refer.  It is a specific and grave Irish national interest.</P>
    <P>The crisis now developing in agricultural incomes will be aggravated by the fall in milk prices and further aggravated by the results of the GATT talks which must soon come to a conclusion, and which will involve further diminution of agricultural support.  The consequent extra cost to the State in social welfare for poverty-stricken farmers not only in the west but in every part of Ireland is incalculable.  This whole budget does not sufficiently take into account the major losses that are down the road for the Irish economy as a result of the difficulties now facing Irish agriculture.  I hope we will see some action on that point during the Irish Presidency.  During the Irish Presidency, we have the ball at our feet.  I hope we will see something better than the pathetic agenda for the Presidency set out by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in his Strasbourg speech when he might not have been an Irish Minister at all, he could have been a Portuguese Minister, a French Minister or an Italian Minister for all the relevance or input there was <Col N="1070" /> from what he had to say concerning the needs of this country.</P>
    <P>A major priority for the Irish Presidency must be to have something done to protect the long-term interests of small and medium-sized farmers in Ireland because they are facing a crisis on an unprecedented scale.</P>
    <P>Another priority &mdash; which I know will be one of interest to the present occupant of the Chair &mdash; is to get the EC to accept some responsibility for funding Irish education.  The Irish taxpayer is subsidising the British economy by providing them with ready-educated, highly skilled graduates, virtually all of whose education has been paid for by the Irish taxpayer and all of whose earning and all of whose tax paying will be taking place in Britain or in some other EC country. That is a straight subsidy by the Irish taxpayer to the British economy or to the economies of the other countries to which young people emigrate.  Clearly there is a Community responsibility as a result of that if we are to promote free movement of labour.  That is the reason I say there should be Community support for the education budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sat here and listened, ultra interestedly, to Deputy Bruton's contribution to the budget debate. Deputy Bruton is not known to me personally but he is a man for whom I have tremendous respect and whose political career I have followed carefully over the years.  He occupies the No. 2 position on the Opposition benches.  Perhaps it would be better for this country as one of the Twelve of the European Community if he were in the No. 1 position, or if anybody other than the man who is in that position at the moment were there.  I may be naive, a mere backbencher who is hardly the proverbial wet day in the Dáil, but I would have expected that when we had an unprecedented opportunity to put ourselves on the European map, figuratively speaking, it would be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Geographically we are right out on the periphery of Europe, and that worries me at times in the context of my own area of expertise, if that is not a more than <Col N="1071" /> modest expression to use.  I worry about what is ahead of us in the years to come in the European context.  I thought, however, we had one wonderful opportunity to really set ourselves up in this year of the Presidency.  It sickens me to see the trivia engaged in by the man in the No. 1 position over there since this House resumed.</P>

      <P>I will leave that.  In regard to statesmen, thanks be to God we have Europe's best in this House in the person of Deputy Charles J. Haughey who is trying his damndest to override the situation as put by Deputy Dukes and get on with doing his job of leading this country through the Presidency and into Europe in a positive and efficient fashion.  I have no doubt that he can do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with much of what Deputy Bruton said; but there is a lot I would not agree with.  He said it was easy to present a budget when good times are prevailing but he seems to forget that these good times did not just happen.  Since 21 February 1987 that was worked for with great resolution by a great leader of a great <Col N="1072" /> party in a minority Government.  Today, our Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds, can present this budget because of the work that was done in the period since February 1987.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton said the Minister was currying popularity.  There is no question of that.  The Minister had addressed the macro-economic situation in a way that only he, with his own particular background, could.  He is a man who is generally respected around the country as having great business acumen.  He is a man who knows what economics are about.  He is not one of those pseudointellectuals we have had here in the past. He has built his life in business and came to politics armed with that background. The favour does not have to be curried.  This is an excellent budget which addresses the problems on a national basis in a futuristic way in the context of Europe.  Any goodies available are going to the people who ought to get them, under a great Minister for Finance, a Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>I will take that comment to heart.  Before I leave Deputy Bruton's contribution there is one other point I would like to make.  He spoke about housing and I would agree with much of what he had to say about ghetto creation. On the matter of roads, I would have thought that he or any member of the 1982 to 1987 Government would flee from the prospect of mentioning roads. In 1986 they put aside a paltry £8 million for county roads.  An asset that taxpayers had built up over decades and put in place for future generations was allowed deteriorate.  Nobody knows this better than my colleague from County Kildare because the roads in his constituency are in ribbons and I have to sympathise with the Deputy because of that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1986 that is what that party laid aside for roads.  In 1987 we came into power.  In the context of trying to put the economy back into some kind of order, £15 million was provided.  In 1988 there was a further £15 million, and in the three-year period, 1989 to 1991, £150 million is promised.  That amount has been surpassed in the interim and it seems that in excess of £150 million will have been expended on our roads during that three-year period.  I thought Deputy Bruton would have been more prudent and not have mentioned that topic, but as I have said he is an honest man about whom we will hear more in the future.</P>
      <P>I should like to welcome the improvements in regard to agricultural education contained in the budget.  There were anomalies in the education of agricultural students <i>vis-à-vis</i> the rest of the community and the Minister in his wisdom has corrected those anomalies.  I know that our rural friends and colleagues in the agricultural industry will welcome this development.</P>
      <P>There have been some very welcome changes in agriculture over the past couple of years.  Some commonsense was applied in regard to the off-farm income, which is a hobbyhorse of mine, by the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy.  I hope the Minister will be in good form tonight.  Perhaps the best wishes of all Members of this House did not go to the Minister and I want to offer him my best wishes now and to congratualte him on the excellent work he has carried out and his commitment to his job, which, please God he can continue to do for many years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food sought and achieved an increase in our milk quota of 11 million gallons.  He has the right idea about the allocation of the 11 million gallons and has decided it will go to the people who ought to get it, that is, young farmers and small scale producers.  During the lifetime of the previous administration we got an increase <Col N="1074" /> of 4½ per cent in our milk quota but it was totally mishandled, and that is appreciated by all those involved in agriculture today.  I welcome the Minister's decision in this matter and I am sure it is welcomed also by the farmers in my constituency.</P>
    <P>Some people referred to the application to Brussels for an extension and reclassification of the disadvantaged areas scheme.  Once again I was surprised to hear these people refer to this issue and to the delay of a few days or so in the submission of the application to Brussels.  This application was made in the most efficient way possible and there was an intense examination of 4½ million acres of land.  Perhaps as I speak this application has already gone to Brussels and is being dealt with there.</P>

      <P>The previous submission to Brussels was hastily sent three weeks before the 1987 general election by the previous administration.  That submission was thrown back in the faces of the Irish Government because it was ill timed, badly put together and done for political purposes on the eve of an election.  A proper approach was adopted in regard to the application now being submitted to Brussels and, as indicated by the Taoiseach, we will have a response from there within the lifetime of the Irish Presidency. I look forward to a very positive response to our application because this is a very important issue to many people throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Bruton that there are difficulties in agriculture.  He referred to difficulties in the beef area and I could mention difficulties in other areas but I do not want to spend all my time talking about agriculture.  There have been some innovations in the area of agri-tourism, etc., which needed to be approached in a very serious way by farmers and I believe the inclusion of additional areas in the disadvantaged area scheme will enable many farmers to get involved in these areas.</P>

    <P>The tourism industry has never been approached as positively as it has been <Col N="1075" /> by this Government.  This industry was taken by the scruff of the neck by the Taoiseach in 1987 and has already begun to pay dividends.  The Taoiseach referred to this industry this morning and I am not going to go back over what he said.</P>
    <P>We in County Wicklow have been totally laid back about tourism during the past couple of years but this will not be the case any more.  We have taken our cue from the Taoiseach and the Government and we have undertaken major activities in the tourism industry in our county.  We have an awful lot going for us, for example, beautiful scenery and a heritage we can be proud of.  In modern terminology people talk about our heritage industry, an industry within the tourism industry which can be explored and developed.  That is precisely what we are doing in County Wicklow.  We have come to our senses and we are putting a major effort into this aspect of our economy. Next year is the centenary of the death of Charles Stewart Parnell and we in County Wicklow propose to make it a memorable year.  We want the home of Charles Stewart Parnell, which is situated at Avondale in County Wicklow, to be made a place of pilgrimage for the 365 days of 1991 so that tribute can be paid to that man and at the same time the people of County Wicklow can avail of the tourism fall-out of such an initiative.</P>
    <P>We have earmarked the setting up of a national park for County Wicklow and I think a sum of £1.3 million has been set aside by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Daly, for this park.  This will be an extension of the park opened by the Taoiseach in the vale of Glendalough a couple of years ago and will be a very important asset to my constituency.  I share the concerns which have been expressed by some farmers about this park.  It is very important that proper consideration be given to the treatment of landowners, their animals and property and to how their families will cope after the establishment of the park.  I regard the establishment of the park as a very positive development which will be of benefit to landowners <Col N="1076" /> and all the people of the community.  I will be keeping a very close watch on the development of this park.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the closest thing to my heart since the day I became a public representative has been the question of jobs. Unemployment has been a problem in this country for quite a while and it is something of a phenomenon that while the economy has improved dramatically &mdash; this is appreciated both at home and abroad &mdash; and our credibility in the eyes of the world has been restored the rate of job creation has been disappointingly low.</P>
    <P>I would again like to refer to my own constituency, in particular to an area in the south-west of the county which was a hive of activity in the seventies, that is the Arklow and south Wicklow hinterland. Traditionally this was an industrial centre but with the run down of the pottery and fertiliser industries it has become a black spot.  This problem is being addressed and here I wish to say a sincere word of thanks to the Government for recognising that a problem exists there. Deputy Reynolds, when Minister for Industry and Commerce, provided us with the designation instrument to ensure that it would receive priority and the right profile.  I have been ultra-critical of the Industrial Development Authority and have said both in this House and elsewhere that they were not doing enough even though the designation instrument had been provided and given the facilities available within the county and the confidence which the Government of 1987-89 injected into the economy.  Since then the Arklow and south Wicklow area has been allocated top priority by the Industrial Development Authority who have deemed that area as meriting attention more than any other area in the country. I welcome this and over coming months &mdash; I am talking in months rather than in years &mdash; I will be watching to see if improvements are being brought about.</P>
    <P>Coming as I do from the county with most land planted I wish to refer to forestry. Since 1987, the Government have placed emphasis on this sector of the economy.  The man mainly responsible <Col N="1077" /> for this, the former Minister for Energy, Deputy Smith, was present in the Chamber today.  He took this portfolio by the scruff of the neck and brought new lateral and progressive thinking into this area with the result that in the interim period we have witnessed unprecedented planting.</P>
    <P>The construction industry now have a new perception of the quality of Irish timber.  However, I am concerned about small scale operators in the timber business. While I do not have statistics in front of me we are talking about 3,500 to 4,000 jobs in small, family-run sawmills. I am concerned that these people will be frozen out.  In my constituency 700 people are employed in small family businesses which have been involved for generations in the timber industry in County Wicklow.  While we must try to upgrade the product and look for quality and added value, which the new agency Coillte Teoranta are seeking to achieve &mdash; which I agree with &mdash; we must ensure that small businesses in existence long before most of us were born and which have been handed on from father to son down through the years, continue to operate well into the next century.  This goes hand in hand with all the other things Coillte Teoranta are endeavouring to achieve.  I wish them well in their efforts to upgrade the quality of the product, to achieve added value and to secure an increase in public and private sector planting and in their management of the commercial aspects of the forestry business. I hope my words will not fall on deaf ears when I call on everybody concerned to ensure that the small businessman working effectively, efficiently and within the law remains in business for further generations.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment recently launched the Environment Action Programme.  This is a marvellous plan.  He is responsible also for the construction industry in which there is a buzz at present.  In recent years in the run-up to the presentation of a budget I would meet with builders.  Invariably they were very disillusioned because since 1981, the construction industry had taken one hell <Col N="1078" /> of a battering.  Many people went to the wall during that period.  When I met those same people this year there was a different atmosphere in the room.  Things were buzzing and moving.  They also had confidence.</P>

      <P>As I say, all sectors of the economy are benefiting from the increase in activity in that industry.  Recently the Construction Industry Federation presented me with an excellent submission in which they outlined what they saw as the way forward for their industry and the economy.  I wish to repeat that this industry is of vital importance to the economy.  I forwarded this excellent submission to my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, with my comments and an indication that I would like to see many of the recommendations of that august body taken on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Minister for Justice was to speak before me but there was a change in the agenda for the day.  I look forward to hearing his speech as within my county at present some extraordinary and sad things are happening.  We see an escalation in violent crime and deterioration in law and order.  I have discussed this matter with the Minister and will discuss it again with him.  It is countrywide; it is not confined to my constituency but it is prevalent there.  In my home town of Rathdrum, a beautiful country town where I live and have raised my family, we have had some horrible <Col N="1079" /> experiences in recent times.  We have problems there and also in the west of the county, in the Blessington and Baltinglass area and in the towns of Arklow and Wicklow.  I want to have further discussions with the Minister and with senior gardaí to have those matters addressed with a view to the position being resolved satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>I must express my thanks to another Member in the House today for an item in the budget.  Coastal damage in my constituency was extreme and the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Wilson, had a sympathetic approach to the situation. He got into his car, came down and visited there, put his finger in the wound, so to speak, and saw for himself the damage done and the hardship suffered in Wicklow.  He put into that budget almost £1 million for the town of Arklow. I thank him from the bottom of my heart on behalf of the people of Arklow and the people of the Wicklow constituency. We have other difficulties in Wicklow town, and in Bray the esplanade is ready to fall into the water.  I will continue to talk to the Minister about that.  For now I thank him most sincerely and ask him to have another look at the matter of the harbour in Arklow.  He has looked after the north beach for us but I want him to look after the harbour which was much damaged by recent storms.</P>
    <P>I will finish now as I see you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, looking at me with that glint in your eye.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I noticed that the Budget Statement &mdash; the first I have been here for &mdash; was greeted by prolonged applause from Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. I suspect it was greeted with some relief by those Coalition parties because it ensured that their position with the electorate would not deteriorate further. The budget had an eye on forthcoming elections and was geared to give a little here and a little there, but it did nothing really to get to grips with the serious social problems which are escalating day by day and making this society of ours into a divided society of rich and very rich and poor and very poor.  It is a society which is a million miles from the dreams and aspirations of the founders of this State.  The present policies of the conservative parties show unsympathetic <Col N="1081" /> attitudes to the many thousands of our people who are forced to live below the poverty line.  This budget does nothing for the many thousands who are struggling to pay mortgages or trying desperately to educate their children or for the vast numbers of people on local authority waiting lists waiting for decent accommodation.  On health the budget does nothing to reduce the huge queues mounting at our hospitals throughout the country.  Only this morning a constituent of mine phoned to ask me if I could do something about her young son who would be waiting 12 months for an appointment to see a specialist about his tonsils.  God only knows how long he will be waiting for surgery.</P>
    <P>While other speakers in the House have referred to these matters I think it important to emphasise again that this budget could have given real hope to the thousands of people caught in the poverty trap who have been forced to make sacrifices over the past number of years so that the accounts at national level could be rectified.  For these people who made these sacrifices there is very little in the budget.  It gives no real hope of reform.  It gives no hope of equal distribution of the wealth of this country and I think it is calculated not to rock the boat in an election year.</P>
    <P>In my constituency of Cork North-Central, judging from the comments of the people I represent, the budget was classed as a non-event because it did nothing to tackle the serious unemployment problem which affects the city and county of Cork.  God knows, if every group of people know what unemployment and frustration are the people of Cork city and county can give lessons to other areas.  Cork has seen its closures over the years, traditional industries going to the wall with huge loss of jobs. This budget has done nothing to give redundant workers forced on to the Live Register any real hope of a job.  It is sad to see so many with skills and talent being wasted and destined for the human scrapheap.</P>
    <P>It is a sad reflection on this Government that last year we had a total of one <Col N="1082" /> house completed by Cork Corporation, a local authority who have 1,200 on their waiting list.  I consider that a disgraceful record and as Chairman of Cork Corporation's Housing Committee I think it is shameful that a corporation and local authority with so many people on the waiting list should produce one single house completion in 1989.  While we welcome the allocation for refurbishment, long overdue, I think it would be a good exercise &mdash; and I may table a question in this regard &mdash; to see how much money was wasted by Government in trying to rectify the major problems that low cost housing was causing Cork City Council.  I think the figure would be horrendous.  I may ask the Minister to produce that figure at some future date?</P>
    <P>At present Cork is facing a housing crisis with the result that Cork Corporation have requested an urgent meeting with the Minister for the Environment to discuss the serious implications of the allocation for housing in the city.</P>
    <P>Cork people were bittelry disappointed that there was no reference in the budget to the downstream river crossing.  If the go-ahead was given to Cork Corporation, the harbour board and Cork County Council to proceed with the downstream river crossing, hundreds of jobs would have been created in an area that badly needs them.  The construction industry, Irish Steel and other sectors of the economy would have benefited from that boost.  I appeal to the Minister and to the Cabinet to make this decision without delay so that the local authorities and all those involved, especially and more importantly the unemployed of Cork city and county, will have the opportunity of getting a job for at least a number of months and, hopefully, for a number of years.</P>
    <P>I would draw the attention of the House to the serious situation in my constituency where one of the last traditional industries is now under threat.  The receiver has been called into Sunbeam and 500 jobs are now at risk.  In the event <Col N="1083" /> of a package being put together, I would like the Minister for Finance to give an assurance to this House that money will be made available so that those vital jobs can be saved and the community, already hammered by unemployment, will be saved from the devasating effect of this closure.  It is a fact that the breadwinner in many of these families is the mother or girl working in Sunbeam.  I am sure the budget did nothing to lift the gloom over Blackpool, Farranree, Churchfield and the Gurranabraher area of Cork North Central.</P>
    <P>Last July the Labour Party called for a commitment from Government to the funding of the Cork-Swansea ferry service. We felt that a company would need a certain time span to market and promote the service before it could be profitable.  At present, the money has been allocated, but we still have no ship. It is unfair to ask any company to make a profit on the service in such a short space of time.  I believe it is essential that a solid commitment should be given for a three-year period so that a proper marketing strategy can be devised, thus giving the service the opportunity to at least break even.  A commitment was given to the Racing Board and Bord na gCon in the budget so I do not see any reason that the Cork-Swansea ferry service should not get the same treatment. They could then devise a strategy over a three- year period that would be fruitful. Not alone would Cork city and county benefit but the whole south-west region would derive a tremendous benefit from a service they knew would be provided for at least three years.  It is very importhan that such a commitment be given in the budget and the vast majority of people in the south-west area were disappointed that this commitment was not given.</P>
    <P>I will also refer briefly to another aspect of tourism which is very important. The Government have stressed over and over again that tourism is probably our greatest asset.  We have a clean environment and a good natured people who would welcome tourists to their area, but <Col N="1084" /> yet over the past two years &mdash; I am glad to see the Minister for Tourism and Transport in the House &mdash; the rod licence dispute has cost this country millions of pounds.  The Exchequer has lost quite a sum of money in taxes, and hotels, guesthouses and employment have also suffered.  I think the legislation was ill-conceived but today's headlines tell us that a solution is imminent.  As the spokesperson for the Marine, I hope that headline is true.  If it is not true, the Labour Party will have no option but to put before the House an amendment to the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1988. We are confident that a majority of Members of this House will support it. The rod licence dispute has gone on for far too long but I recognise that the present Minister has done trojan work to bring it to a happy conclusion.  I hope his work is fruitful and that he will make an announcement in the coming days.  This is very important not alone for the people directly involved in fishing but for the thousands of people who depend on tourists visiting this country.  Again I wish to state that this is the most ill-conceived legislation that has ever come before this House and I hope to see the end of it in the coming days.</P>
    <P>I will not stay much longer on my feet as this is my first budget speech and I am sure that people with a great deal more experience are offering.  The most damning part of the budget is that the Government have given £500,000 for emigrant services in Britain and £200,000 for emigrant services in the United States.  We have heard the Minister outline policies for an upswing in the economy.  He presented figures which show there has been an increase in investment and he stated that employment trends and prospects are the most favourable for decades. This is merely a repetition of what past Governments and Ministers have said and will do nothing to lighten the burden, dispel the disillusionment and restore the faith of young people forced to seek a living in New York, Boston, Birmingham and Camden Town.</P>
    <P>At present we are experiencing an <Col N="1085" /> upsurge in the economy, principally benefiting a select few and the benefits have not trickled down to the people who are desperately searching for a job.  There are thousands of young people in their twenties who have never known what it is to work, whose only prospect is to seek a living abroad.  We have failed them before and unless there is a completely new approach we will fail them again and again.  Young children having attended schools and colleges will have no alternative but to take the boat or plane to Britain, Europe or the United States in the hope that the education they have received will enable them to survive and prosper in a foreign land.</P>
    <P>Like other Members of this House I have visited emigrants abroad and always the forceful message I received was, &ldquo;for God's sake, stop playing political football with our lives.&rdquo;  For that reason, the Labour Party tabled a motion calling for the establishment of an all party-committee once and for all to seek a solution to one of the greatest tragedies this country has experienced.  We have noted all-party committees established to formulate certain aspects of foreign policy, another established on Women's Rights &mdash; these are very important issues &mdash; but I fail to understand why all parties in this Dáil cannot sit down and establish an all-party committee to tackle a problem that has affected every house and home in the country.  It is disgraceful that that tide of emigration is allowed continue year in, year out, generation after generation.</P>
    <P>The figures for emigration recently disclosed are horrific &mdash; in the region of 40,000 young people being forced to leave.  However, these are mere statistics and do not illustrate the heartbreak, hopelessness, frustration and anger felt by many of our people.  They conceal a very human problem which previous Governments failed to remedy or never had the will to tackle.  Rather emigration constituted an easy way of solving the unemployment problem, a classic case of out of sight, out of mind.</P>
    <P>In this morning's <i>Cork Examiner</i> there appears an article entitled &ldquo;Dozens of <Col N="1086" /> emigrants stopped&rdquo; which begins by saying:</P>
    <P>Dozens of emigrant hopefuls bound for the United States were turned back at Shannon airport by Immigration agents over the last month or so.  INS officials snared &ldquo;several dozen&rdquo; people heading for New York and Boston because of visa irregularities, the US Embassy in Dublin said.  However, a whopping 13,610 people passed safely through the INS checkpoint at Shannon from December 25 to January 15.</P>
    <P>Some may have been going to the United States on holiday, others with the hope of getting a job there.  What an indictment of this country to see people slipping through the net in an endeavour to find work while we at home do nothing beyond giving various organisations £200,000 to get them out of trouble.</P>
    <P>Another paragraph in that article reads:</P>
    <P>We've been receiving an awful lot of calls about this at our hotline number &mdash; far more than last year, a spokesperson for the Irish Immigration Reform Movement stated.</P>
    <P>Welcome and all as is that £200,000 &mdash; I do not deny that that money was needed &mdash; it constitutes merely a drop in the ocean.  I contend that the problem does not exist in the United States, in Birmingham or in Camden Town but here. Until such time as elected representatives of all parties &mdash; and I say this deliberately and advisedly here this afternoon &mdash; sit down and say this is no longer good enough; we cannot continue to shed our young people abroad; we cannot continue to hunt them from this country, then we cannot sit in this Chamber with an easy conscience and applaud a Budget Statement that contains one small paragraph only on emigration.  For those people who pass through Shannon, those on the housing waiting lists, those in hospital queues, those in queues at labour exchanges there was no applause; all there was for them was a deafening silence. That is why I have endeavoured to highlight their case in this House in the <Col N="1087" /> hope that somebody somewhere along the line will listen and say enough is enough.</P>

      <P>Tá an-áthas orm faill bheith agam labhairt faoin cháinaisnéis sa díospóireacht seo agus mo thacaíocht a thaispeáint don Teachta Reynolds, Aire Airgeadais, mo chomharsa bhéal dorais, san obair atá ar siúl aige.  Thaispeáin sé go soiléir go dtuigeann sé fadhbanna eacnamaíochta na tíre seo, agus ní amháin sin ach go bhfuil fuascailt na bhfadhbanna sin freisin ar eolas aige.</P>
      <P>The fiscal framework for 1990 marks, in many respects, a return to financial stability.  After almost two decades of gross instability, a certain degree of normality has returned.  If we have learned well the hard lessons of recent years, then we should be set fair to continue on our present path for some years to come.</P>
      <P>Short-term pressures, rising expectations and demands to pursue desirable objectives by inappropriate policies will, however, have to continue to be resisted. Tight financial and economic discipline are crucial to sustaining the recovery and, in particular, improving employment prospects.</P>
      <P>Despite the apparent national consensus on fiscal objectives, there are many pent-up demands particularly for improved public services, enhanced public infrastructures and tax reductions as well as for increased social services. Conceding even a fraction of these emerging demands, if the concessions are not soundly based on sustainable improvements in economic performance, over a short period would threaten financial stability.</P>
      <P>The greatest danger to sustained employment growth would be the adoption of policies to create jobs artificially. Sustainable employment will be created only by improvements in competitiveness in all its aspects.  In this context, wage moderation is a key factor in the equation. Policies which do not improve competitiveness will undermine employment growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1088" /> The <i>Programme for Government, 1989-1993</i> has sustainable job creation as the major priority of this Government. The pursuit of this objective has, accordingly, strongly influenced the structure of the budget.  The budget aims to promote more economic growth which will in turn generate jobs, an improved standard of living for those already in work and the basis for increased social services.</P>
    <P>The number of persons unemployed in the country remains too high We must get it down.  There I agree with Deputy G. O'Sullivan who has just spoken.  To that end, our policies are strongly coloured by a desire to increase employment. Our room for movement remains constrained by reason of our national debt interest burden &mdash; just £2 billion plus for 1989 &mdash; and the need to improve our competitiveness as we move towards 1992 &mdash; the completion of the internal market.  With Monsieur Delors in full stride, we have economic and monetary union on the central agenda.  In this context, financial discipline must remain a key characteristic of our general policy framework.</P>
    <P>Our economic performance in 1989 has continued the recovery that commenced in 1987.  Real GNP is estimated to have grown by 3.25 per cent with a reasonable balance between growth in domestic and external demand.  The current account remains in surplus in spite of the growth in domestic demand &mdash; personal consumer spending grew by 5 per cent &mdash; and an upturn in the rate of profit expatriation which probably will have to be examined &mdash; £2,385 million for 1989 against £1,908 million for 1988.  Inflation remains low, indeed, only half that of the UK rate.</P>
    <P>Latest employment data indicate that non-agricultural employment is estimated to have grown by some 13,000 in 1989 while the numbers on the Live Register had declined by almost 12,000.</P>
    <P>Much of economic policy has been dominated in the eighties by the need to reverse the rise in the debt-GNP ratio. Reduced levels of Exchequer borrowings in recent years have meant that the rise in the national debt has slowed markedly; not eliminated, slowed.  At the same <Col N="1089" /> time, economic growth speeded up. Accordingly, the debt ratio has begun to fall.  This is a remarkable story.  Having peaked at 131.4 per cent of GNP in 1987, it fell to 123 per cent last year and is likely to be around 117 this year.  Welcome though this development is, it still leaves Ireland's relative position substantially worse than in other industrialised economies &mdash; twice the EC average in relation to GNP.  That continues to absorb a large amount of resources in interest payments &mdash; as I specified above &mdash; and leaves the economy and the public finances severely exposed to external pressures.</P>
    <P>Where resources are scarce we must, in our policies, give the highest priority to ensuring that they are allocated efficiently.  Given the inevitable conflict of interest between various groups in our society and between the welfare of some and the greater good, the process will continue to give rise to tensions and difficulties. We are not prepared to shirk such responsibilities in ensuring that Irish economic development continues and that all its citizens share in the rewards of its growth.</P>
    <P>Confidence in our economy in 1990 must be maintained.  We must strive to maintain our competitiveness against our trading partners &mdash; the difference between the punt and the £ sterling has to be balanced some way; the fact that inflation is kept in check is a help &mdash; in anticipation of a tougher trade regime when we reach 1992.  This means ensuring that our inflation rate is kept low and continuous discipline of our public finances which should, in conjunction with international factors, exert downward pressure on interest rates.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> will continue to play a large part in achieving the requisite consensus between the social partners and Government essential to continuous harmonious economic development.</P>
    <P>The EC annual economic report which we received recently in the post indicates &mdash; and it is always better to have an outside witness lest one be accused of <i>ex parte</i> pleading &mdash; that in 1990 investment in construction which is so prolific of jobs <Col N="1090" /> should have increased by 10½ per cent; total investment, by 10 per cent and total investment in equipment, by 10 per cent. When considering imports it is important to see what kind of items we are importing and whether they are aiming at productivity. The EC report shows that there is an incease in the employment figure and estimates an increase of 4½ per cent in GDP.  This makes heartening reading from a body to which we belong but which has a kind of Olympian view and cannot be accused of arguing from a party political viewpoint.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> has to date been very successful.  With almost a year of the programme remaining the following are the achievements: targets for Exchequer borrowing reached; targets for stabilising Government debt-GNP ratio; commitment to tax concessions have been exceeded; commitment to the poorest sections of society has been delivered on, and pay provisions of the programme have been widely observed.  This has contributed to an improvement in labour competitiveness and has helped moderate the rate of increase in the consumer price index.  In the European Community report it is indicated that large wage increases not backed by productivity caused the Greek economy to have a heavy deficit.</P>
    <P>I would like to reiterate the views of my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Albert Reynolds, as to the necessity to continue the consensus achieved in economic management by way of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  To that end, a consensus approach, if it does not shrink from facing realities, can work to the benefit of us all. It is the Government's hope that when the current arrangement expires, we can evolve, in discussion with the social partners, a follow-up programme which reconciles the legitimate concerns and aspirations of the various interests with the requirements for sustained economic and social progress.  This budget makes a significant contribution to creating the right environment for such future development and it is very important to achieve that consensus.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1091" /> I am an amateur student of Spain where Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez is doing a very good job for the Spanish economy but he has not been able to deliver on that consensus.  He has had to carry on with his economic policies despite the fact that he came to power with the aid of Senores Redondo and Gutiérrez, the two great Labour leaders. He realised the importance of that consensus. I am very glad that the various participants in this country also realise its importance and I am sure they will deliver on it for the good of themselves and of the country generally.</P>
    <P>Ireland is an island nation with consequent advantages and disadvantages which derive from its status. Roinn na Mara was established with a view to advancing the development of this sector.  I believe that much work has been done in this regard and the marine area is now nicely poised to capitalise on opportunities provided by the more favourable economic conditions.  This year will be yet another of investment, funding and commitment to the development of this sector.</P>
    <P>The Government's central objective is the creation of lasting new employment. This requires selective development policies for key sectors such as the key fishing industry and aquaculture.  The fishing industry plays a key role in sustaining the economies of coastal regions.  This industry is thus of major regional significance not only in this country but in the Community as a whole.  In these circumstances, I would like here and now to restate the Government's total commitment to the development of the fishing industry.  The national plan recognises the considerable potential for the further development of this industry and the Government therefore have committed a significant level of Exchequer funding towards such development.  In 1990 the Government are providing a total of £11.4 million in funding to Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  This funding will be targeted at the following areas: fleet development and modernisation; exploratory and experimental fishing, <Col N="1092" /> which is very important when there are tight quotas; aquaculture and marketing as well as manpower training.</P>
    <P>The development strategy for the fishing industry adopted by the Government in 1988 sets a target for the creation of 4,400 new and part-time jobs in the sea fish, aquaculture, processing and ancillary industries by 1991.  It is an ambitious programme.  The protection and enhancement of fish stocks as well as the discovery and exploitation of new stocks is vital.  This has taken place to some extent particularly in the area of horse mackerel or scad, argentines and blue whiting.  I am glad to say that our fleet caught 35,000 tonnes of horse mackerel last year.  Whereas this is regarded as rough fish for fishmeal, the Japanese are paying a high price for it for human consumption. There is no quota on it yet but it is expected that a quota will be put on it.  I hope our fishermen will continue to fish heavily in that area so that if a quota has to be decided we will be in line for a reasonably sized quota.  Since 1980 total catches of stocks of major importance to the Community have dwindled, often substantially.  Without proper controls and conservation policies fisheries will not survive.  As President of the Council of Fisheries Ministers, I am making a major effort to have the research facilities co-ordinated and strengthened in the Community because they are very important with regard to the control and conservation of stocks.</P>
    <P>It was against this backdrop that the 1990 fish quotas were negotiated and agreed at the December Fisheries Council. There were severe cutbacks in fishing activity generally within Community waters this year because of unfavourable scientific advice which indicated that stocks were not available.  In this tough negotiating climate we succeeded in winning the best overall fisheries deal for Ireland.  We obtained agreement to a complete reversal of the general trend in the Commission's initial quota package, as it affected Ireland, by turning a 12 per cent reduction into a net gain.  This was <Col N="1093" /> most impressive when compared with the very sizeable reductions in quotas for most member states.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the establishment of a new fleet register is well advanced and will give an accurate picture of fleet capacity.  This exercise has made it possible to meet the 1989 EC capacity objectives set for Ireland and will make a significant contribution towards facilitives. I also expect to receive proposals shortly for a national boat licensing proposals for a national boat licensing policy which will further the aim of the official development of the fishery industry.</P>
    <P>In recognition of progress on the GRT front, the Commission has recently approved EC grant aid towards the construction of eight new Irish fishing vessels. The owners of vessels wrecked during recent storms in the south-east will be accommodated in replacing their vessels within the new GRT arrangements. Such replacement vessels may be entitled to both EC and national grant assistance for boat construction.  I am pleased to say in this regard that a total of £100,000 in increased provision to BIM was made in the budget for repair and replacement of damaged boats in the fishing fleet.</P>
    <P>I am responsible for the regulation and development of the aquaculture industry in the State and my main objective is to maximise the industry's contribution to the economy in harmony with environmental excellence.  The aquaculture sector remains on a strong growth path and we are now beginning to reap the rewards of jobs, exports and growth.</P>
    <P>Production from the industry in 1989 was worth almost £30 million with 850 people employed full-time and 1,300 employed on a part-time basis in the industry.  Our achievable target for 1991 is an output level of over 14,000 tonnes worth in excess of £71 million and some 3,500 jobs.  There will also be sustainable indirect employment gains in related industries and services.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the aquaculture industry and in particular salmon farming has been the subject of widespread and often <Col N="1094" /> ill-informed criticism in recent times particularly from an environmental point of view.  I would like to state here and now that aquaculture is not a dirty industry. Indeed, no sustainable evidence exists to indicate that these farms impact adversely on the environment.  It is my policy to make sure that developments will progress without damaging our environment which is a precious inheritance.</P>
    <P>I would emphasise in the strongest possible terms that the Government are fully committed to the development of this industry and will continue to support environmentally sound developments. Those will create employment particularly in remote rural areas which otherwise have little opportunity of attracting alternative industries.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that the siting, the numbers and impact of salmon farms in particular have to be carefully researched and monitored in the interest of the environment and, not least, of the salmon farmers themselves, who pride themselves on their premium product.  To achieve this, fin-fish farmers are now required to commission thorough environmental impact assessments in advance of licence approvals by my Department.  The results of these assessments are made public by my Department. An additional sum of £200,000 was allocated in the budget to ensure adequate environmental monitoring of the industry and to regularise all existing operations.  This allocation will enable us to put in place very quickly effective systems for assessing and monitoring all operations and will underpin the combined strong growth of the sector with additional jobs and at no cost to any other sector or the environment.</P>
    <P>A very ambitious programme of fisheries research is planned for 1990 with an overall allocation of over one million pounds by the Exchequer.  In particular, moneys have been set aside to carry out new surveys of the herring in the Celtic Sea, using special scientific echo sounders to obtain a direct count of the numbers of herring in the sea during the spawning season.  These surveys are intended to protect those sectors <Col N="1095" /> of the industry which fish the Celtic Sea herring which had to close down a few years ago and ensure the best possible management of the resource. On top of this funding which is specifically for the fisheries sector, I recently announced that seven Irishled marine research projects are to receive EC funding of £1,700,000.  A further six projects with Irish participation are among the 98 successful projects to be funded by the EC's Marine Science and Technology and Fisheries and Aquaculture Research Programme.</P>
    <P>The 13 projects funded cover a wide range of marine scientific activities including aquaculture, oceanography, upgrading fishery products, coastal zone engineering, marine instrumentation, fisheries management and gene technology. The Irish beneficiaries include UCG, UCC, UCD, the College of Catering, my Department's Fisheries Research Centre and Bord Iascaigh Mhara.</P>
    <P>Inland fisheries is widely acknowledged as one of our finest natural resources with potential to generate significant sustainable employment.  This Government continue their commitment to developing and improving the resource and have provided a sum of £6.272 million in the 1990 Estimates for this purpose. In addition, £50,000 was made available in the budget for the monitoring of Lough Sheelin.  The continued development and conservation of inland fisheries, however, can only be achieved through co-operation between interested parties and through full support for fisheries boards staff in their difficult task.  The Environment Action Programme will be of considerable benefit to inland fisheries by reducing pollution of inland waterways.  This should help create a basis for sustained long term expansion of the angling resource particularly as pollution has severely damaged fisheries in the past.</P>
    <P>I recently launched 11 new fisheries patrol boats at Howth.  The boats costing £400,000 were purchased by the Central Fisheries Board with grant aid from the European Community and with special funding from the Exchequer.  The boats <Col N="1096" /> will be deployed by the seven regional fisheries boards at various locations to patrol coastal waters out to the 12 mile limit.  While the main purpose of these boats is to combat illegal salmon fishing and the protection of salmon stocks, they come with the welcome bonus of being suitable for sea rescue operations, as well.</P>
    <P>On the rod licence dispute, we are working very hard to bring this to an early resolution on a basis which should be reasonably satisfactory to most of those involved.</P>
    <P>The advent of the internal market in 1992 and the opening of the Channel Tunnel in 1993 will result in Ireland being the only island European Community member state.  Ireland's peripheral location at the edge of Europe puts us at a natural disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> our EC partners.  It is therefore imperative that we have appropriate port capacity, and quality port infrastructure, strategically located in relation to the main internal arteries.</P>
    <P>Plans for the development of commercial harbours are, therefore, an integral part of the Government's broad development strategy to overcome the structural weaknesses in the Irish economy and to offset the effects of peripherality.  Provision has been made in the National Development Plan for substantial expenditure between now and 1993 on developments at Irish commercial harbours. Expenditure will be concentrated particularly on Dublin, Rosslare, Waterford and Cork ports and will involve the following elements: berthing facilities; investment in improved facilities, including bulk cranes; and lift-on/lift-off equipment.</P>
    <P>The objective is to make our ports cost efficient and to introduce the type of equipment which will facilitate the quick and economical loading and unloading of ships.  These measures should of themselves make our ports more attractive to shipping lines and hopefully increase the tonnage of ships prepared to use our ports.  We would want to pull up our socks on that one.</P>
    <P>Subject to approval of the Peripherality Programme by the EC a total <Col N="1097" /> investment of approximately £60 million in commercial ports is proposed during the period of the plan.  Capital expenditure by harbour authorities under the aegis of my Department will be in excess of £12 million in 1990 with a direct Exchequer contribution of £0.50 million.</P>
    <P>In order to enhance the effectiveness and productivity of the fishing fleet I am committed to a programme of substantial investment to provide adequate infrastructure at strategically located harbours around our coast.</P>
    <P>This programme for development of fishery harbours concentrates on: the Fishery Harbour Centres, owned and managed by the Department, at Killybegs, Rossaveal, Castletownbere, Dunmore East and Howth; a number of strategically placed secondary harbours such as Greencastle, County Donegal and Dingle, County Kerry; small harbours and piers which cater for needs which cannot be satisfied elsewhere and which require improvement works.</P>
    <P>Of the allocation of £4.5 million for fishery harbour development in 1990 over £2.5 million will be used to continue major development projects at Rossaveal and Greencastle.  In particular, I am pleased to state that my Department are paying Wexford County Council a 50 per cent grant amounting to £40,000 in respect of the reinstatement of the stormwall at Kilmore Quay Harbour, which was damaged in the recent storms.  Provision is also made for the funding of surveys and investigations at a number of locations to enable detailed engineering assessments to be prepared.</P>
    <P>Maintenance of Dún Laoghaire harbour together with a number of small piers, navigational lights and beacons around our coasts will require a sum estimated at £1.555 million in 1990.  I recently announced the membership of the interim Dún Laoghaire Harbour Board and I am fully confident that, with the help of this board, Dún Laoghaire harbour can be managed and developed for the benefit of the people at Dún Laoghaire and for the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>State funds, amounting to £150,000 for coast protection were transferred from <Col N="1098" /> the Office of Public Works to my Department from 1 January, 1990.  The vast bulk of this money has already been earmarked for maintenance and direct protection works at Rosslare Strand and for studies of the erosion problem being undertaken by the Wallingford Research Institute.</P>
    <P>However, following my examination of the emergency situation that has arisen at Arklow, County Wicklow, the Minister for Finance announced, in his budget speech, the further allocation of £950,000 to enable my Department to pay a 50 per cent grant to Wicklow County Council for coast protection works at the North Beach, Arklow.  At the moment there are three business premises at risk, also a caravan park, major sports facilities, several private houses and local roads.</P>
    <P>Deputies should understand that progress on coast protection is slow.  It is a specialised engineering activity and the causes of any erosion problem can seldom be judged without close study and observation, often over a long period, while remedial measures sometimes involve trial and error.  I shall try in the coming months to decide on an appropriate role for my Department to facilitate the implementation of permanent coast protection schemes, to prevent progressive erosion by the sea, where these are warranted.</P>
    <P>The importance of Irish seaports to the economy is highlighted by the level of total trade in volume and value terms, 73 per cent and 64 per cent respectively, handled by seaports in 1988.  More specifically, the commercial seaports handled over £14 billion of Ireland's total external trade of £22 billion in 1988 and almost £8 billion of Ireland's total export trade of £12 billion in the same year.  Fast, efficient and inexpensive shipping is a pre-requisite for our success as a trading nation.</P>
    <P>Funding of £1.34 million has been provided for in the 1990 Estimates for shipping investment grants.  This compares with £0.515 million last year and together with the 10 per cent rate and continuing access to the business expansion scheme <Col N="1099" /> for companies engaged in shipping operations, services to underscore this Government's on-going commitment to the Irish shipping industry.</P>
    <P>The question of marine search and rescue is particularly topical at this time of year.  I am awaiting the report of the Review Group on Air-Sea Rescue Services set up to examine the operation of air-sea rescue services and to make recommendations to ensure a cost effective and efficient service to meet national and international requirements. This report is expected within a fortnight. I should like, in the meantime, to assure the House that I am fully committed to securing whatever resources I consider necessary to implement the recommendations of the review group.  I wish to pay a tribute to the sterling work of the men and women of our rescue services who risk their lives to save others.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment on the summary in the ESRI quarterly commentary of December 1989.  Emphasis was laid on the 5 per cent increase in GNP, the substantial reduction in the debt-GNP ratio and the comfortable surplus in our balance of payments despite the large increases in expatriation.  The report is not infallible but, as far as 1990 is concerned, it pointed out that barring a recession in Britain &mdash; they are hoping for, at worst, stagnation &mdash; the real GNP will increase by 4 per cent.  The report said that the rate of inflation will be 3.5 per cent and commentators have indicated that it might, with luck, fall further towards the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The report also called for an improvement in public finances.  There was special emphasis &mdash; which I also emphasised &mdash; on the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the consensus of all the social partners is essential.  This includes farmers, workers, industrialists, trade unions and everybody involved in the economic life of the country.  This is a <i>sine qua non</i> of the kind of progress that all sides of the House desire.  Confidence in economic activity will attract more investment and create more employment.  I come from an area which has been very badly <Col N="1100" /> hit over the years by emigration &mdash; although we do not whine and whinge about it &mdash; and I know that that is our <i>desideratum</i> in this House.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of the Government's policies continues to be the restoration and improvement of confidence in our economy, thus creating a climate conducive to the generation of employment. Continued attention, however, to the strict control and management of public expenditure is being accompanied, hand in hand, by a concentrated emphasis on sectors with development potential.  The 1990 Estimates provision for the Marine Vote, with the additional provisions made available in the budget, reflect these policies.  Tá áthas orm mo thacaíocht a thabhairt don bhuiséad seo.</P>

      <P>The dispute has done considerable damage to tourism and the game fishing industry.  Having listened to previous speakers, particularly Deputy Jacob, I could not let the occasion pass without reference to the refusal by my party Leader to allow pairing, under certain conditions, in the past week or so.  I smiled when I heard the cries of anguish from the Government benches and saw the beating of breasts, the tearing of hair and the míle ulagón.</P>
      <P>I was a deputy Whip for some time when my party were in Government and I recall that seriously ill people were brought into this House to vote.  I did not agree with the practice and my party were not in favour of it but the majority Opposition party at that time saw fit to ensure that pairs were not available on certain occasions.  The crocodile tears shed on the Fianna Fáil benches over the past week do not influence me.  Having said that, I wish the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, a very speedy recovery and return to business as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to challenge the continued perception in some quarters &mdash; especially on the Fianna Fáil benches &mdash; that economic recovery started about three years <Col N="1102" /> ago.  Economic recovery started in 1982 when the Government who took over found that the economy was in a shambles. The previous Government ran away from their responsibilities and refused to accept anything to which people might have some antipathy.  Because of their lack of courage and commitment they allowed the country to slide into financial decay, the like of which had not been experienced since the foundation of the State.  When I hear people say that economic recovery started in the last three years and that everything in the garden is rosy I smile to myself.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to local authorities and the environment.  We heard a lot about them in the course of this debate. Where are our local authorities going? The last speaker referred to improvements in the workings of our local authorities but in my view there have been dramatic decreases in the last three years in the rates support grant, the fundamental hub of the funding of local authorities since domestic rates were abolished.  Those who do not accept that are not facing facts.  Those who have been members of local authorities in the last ten years must recognise that there has been a gradual erosion of the powers of local authorities as a result of the unwillingness of the Government to recognise their position.  That process was speeded up in the last three years.</P>

      <P>Under his system local authorities were responsible for raising money and were rewarded for their efforts.  However, the new Minister, in order to protect his majority in Dublin changed the system.  He did not want any <Col N="1103" /> cold winds of reality blowing through the corridors of power in Dublin city.  There should not be any fudging on this issue because we are aware of how the Government stand in regard to giving power to local authorities.  They are unwilling to assist them.</P>
      <P>Government speakers were proud of the improvements to our roads but I would prefer if they did not mention the condition of roads in my company.  It grieves me greatly to have to drive on the bad roads in my constituency.  In the last three years, the period of the so-called economic revival, our roads have been allowed to deteriorate.  I do not know any civilised country with roads in such a sorry state.  Before Government Members praise themselves for the improvements in our roads they should look at the entire picture, warts and all, and accept that our roads have deteriorated. They should not try to hide the fact that when they were in Opposition and we were attempting to steer the national economy from the rocks of disaster and reverse the trends that were well established they did not give us much help.  I do not think Members on the Government benches need to be reminded of the rate of inflation and interest rates when they left office.  I will not go down that road because I know it will hurt Members on the Government side.</P>

      <P>The Government have claimed a lot of credit for the revival in the building industry.  It was easy to revive it for the simple reason that those employed in the building industry between 1987 and 1989 had left the country.  Every building site had closed down and local authority housing loans were virtually abolished.  The Minister found new ways to build houses without the need to advance loans, according to himself.  During that time building <Col N="1104" /> workers emigrated to London, Birmingham and elsewhere.  I accept that the building industry has made some strides in the last eight months but if that revival had not taken place the industry would have disappeared.  The building industry is important to the economy.  It appears that nobody is providing houses for those in the lower income group, those with an income of £10,000 or less. There was much in the Minister's speech about the tax concessions to such people but I wonder what the Government are doing to provide them with houses.  From what I have seen the Government have done little to advance loans to them or to encourage local authorities to build houses for them.  If there is buoyancy in the building industry it is not because of the number of houses being built for those in that income bracket.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The buoyancy in the industry is because of the demand by those who can afford to move up in the market, those who can afford to pay between £90,00 and £120,000 for houses. One must conclude that the people in the lower income bracket no longer exist or do not matter.  I appeal to the Government to accept their responsibilities to provide houses for the needy.  They should not divide society.  If they continue on the path they are travelling they will cater for one sector and the country will be a lot poorer for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget received a mixed reception from commentators.  Some described it as a good budget, others said it was reasonable while others said it was a bad budget.  One or two minor adjustments were positive.  We all accept that we must have a harmonisation of taxes.  That is progressive and the sooner it takes place the better but I would prefer to see the positive elements of harmonisation emerging.  It is unfortunate that to date we have only seen the negative aspects of harmonisation.  My description of the budget is that it was a less than middling budget.  It was reasonable for those who <Col N="1105" /> were not old, young, sick, handicapped, poor, unemployed, homeless, a housewife, a farmer, a young child at school, a business person or a single person paying the high rate of tax.  It was good for those who had not taken out life insurance policies in order to benefit under the taxation system.  Those with a mortgage got very little recognition in the budget.  The Minister did not restore the mortgage interest relief that was taken away in recent years although there was a sharp increase in interest rates last year.</P>
    <P>The result is that we had a mish-mash, an excuse for a budget.  It was introduced to smooth over the cracks and give the people a false sense of security.  The Government hope that the masses will not raise their voices too loud, will go away quietly and peacefully and not bother them.  The administration is now heading and targeting much higher plateaux and I suppose they will not want to hear very much about what we have to say in this House for the next six months. That is a a matter for another arena but it is something which is equally important.</P>

      <P>In relation to this matter.  I raised a number of questions on the time allocation motion last night and I requested the Government Chief Whip to look at the issue of the closing of the debate.  I pointed out that four parties had appended their names to the motion &mdash; the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party, The Workers' Party and Jim Kemmy's Party &mdash; but that only two parties were being enabled to reply to the debate tonight and were given 15 minute slots. On the understanding that the question of the sharing of time would be addressed today I asked that time be allocated to both The Workers' Party and Jim Kemmy's Party along with the other two parties closing the debate.  I understand from the arrangement arrived at that time will be shared but it has not been agreed that we will be given an allocation of time to close the debate.  We are in a position now, although I took only 25 minutes last night, in which even though we were entitled to 40 minutes on the understanding that we would be enabled to share our time and on the understanding that we would be considered for a slot at the end of the debate, we now have no slot except on the good offices of a number of other speakers in this House, namely, Deputy Kemmy and a Fine Gael spokesperson.</P>

      <P>I have made my statement in the House and I stand over it.  I hope it will be remedied immediately.  I was dealing with the paediatric unit which is still not operable.  Children are being brought into the hospital and transferred to Drogheda, Dublin and to Ballinasloe in County Galway.  This is totally unheard of and is unacceptable.  I have no doubt that the Minister would be willing to address the problems I highlighted last night but I believe he does not have the commitment of his Government or the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>I hope that by bringing these matters to the attention of this House the Government will have a change of heart. If a Government can afford to send a Minister of State on a winter holiday to South Africa so that he can improve his complexion, at enormous cost to the taxpayers, and if a Government can afford to hire or lease a jet to take the Taoiseach and the Ministers on glorified trips to the capitals of Europe, and if a Government can afford to hire a press secretary to bolster their own image, surely to God they can afford to provide the people who have given a lifetime of service &mdash; the aged in our population &mdash; a decent and reasonable health service at the end of their days, places to which they can go to be treated?</P>
      <P>It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that these problems can be dealt with.  I am leaving it now in the hands of the Government, the Minister and the people on this side of the House.  It must be remembered that the division has not yet taken place and it is not too late for people to change their minds when they fully realise the problems that confront us and to do the right thing when they walk through the lobbies tonight.  When they have done that they will have done a service to the country.</P>

      <P>I must say, in common with Deputies on the Opposition sides, I listened with total incredulity to the Minister last night.  After all the evidence, after all the graphics, after all the details, all the facts and the figures had been produced, the Minister still came into this House last night not with any new response, not with any positive gestures, but the same stale, jaded, jargon, bureaucratic answer, saying &ldquo;What crisis?  No crisis&rdquo;.  At the end of the day the Minister's theme was essentially the same: &ldquo;I will do it my way&rdquo;.  The Minister said that in his health career he had learned a lot from his patients.  He had learned a lot from his practice, he had learned a lot from involvement.  I think he used the verb &ldquo;learned&rdquo; on 12 occasions but the one salutary lesson the Minister did not learn is the salutary lesson of the last election.  It was his refusal to listen to facts that lost Fianna Fáil the last election.  It is his refusal to listen now to the problems facing the health service that will cost them the next election.</P>
      <P>I have here a letter from nurses in the Sacred Heart Home in my county.  It states:</P>
      <P>We, the Nurses in the Sacred Heart Home, are desperate for extra nurses and staff.  We find that we are unable to carry out our duty adequately.</P>
      <P>At the moment we are working at times at a nurse patient ratio of 1-58. The teacher ratio is 1-18, one person, aged 23, has 58 patients.</P>
      <P>We cannot accept responsibility for patient care or security any longer.</P>
      <P>The type of patients we are now nursing are dependent, 70 per cent bed bound, 30 per cent ambulant with assistance.  We have the same number of staff now as twenty years ago when the dependent rate was 30 per cent and independent rate 70 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have brought our case to the <Col N="1110" /> Western Health Board and they are sympathetic towards us, but we will need public awareness to change that to money as extra staff are badly needed.  This is where we need you to help to highlight the situation for us.</P>
    <P>That letter was not invited or solicited. That was soliciting on the part of nurses who simply cannot give basic nursing care, which means even washing.  On one night, two nights before that letter was written, one nurse had to look after 58 patients most of whom were incontinent and some of whom were doubly incontinent. During the course of the night two patients died.  She had to lay out both patients, contact the relatives, comfort the relatives, make various arrangements and at the same time bring bed pans to the other patients.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister tonight if that is the standard of care he would desire for his grandmother or his grandfather? Is that the type of care one would prescribe or stand over for one's mother?  He would not, and he could not, because it is not an adequate standard of care for a person to whom we ascribe human dignity. Each and every one is entitled to a certain independence in his or her own right.  They have come through life and they have the right to expect at least the minimum standard of care.  It is bad enough to be old, sick, handicapped, lonely, but to be made to feel guilty about it is not good enough. In that hospital not alone is there not the basic nursing care but there is no chiropodist and there has been no occupational therapist for the past two years. That is one geriatric home in this county. That is the situation that prevails throughout the length and breadth of the country and it is simply not good enough. It is a scandal.  It is a dereliction of duty and it is one of the main reasons we have this motion before the House tonight. There are people in mental institutions who should not be there; there are people with Alzheimer's disease in psychiatric homes who should not be there; there are people with mental handicap mixing with <Col N="1111" /> people suffering from dementia in psychiatric institutions and they should not be there.  There are square pegs in round holes all over the medical service.</P>
    <P>In Mayo alone we have 1,600 people who suffer from mental handicap and 600 of them cannot get service.  Some of those are severely mentally handicapped.  Last year application was made by the Government for a grant from the European Social Fund.  This grant, according to the new structures, is on a basis of 65 per cent ESF and 35 per cent local or national contribution but because the Government were not able to come up with the 35 per cent contribution we lost the maximum rate due to us.  Thereby hangs a tale and that is what constitutes the neglect we see in the medical service.</P>
    <P>The mentally handicapped do not have a vote.  They are very handy when it comes to slogans and posters.  It is all very well to depict them on the top of billboards and shout that health cuts hit the old, the sick and the handicapped; but when it comes to delivering basic services they simply do not count.  They are grand on posters, but shun them.  In Galway Regional Hospital there are 919 people waiting for urology treatment going back as far as 1987.  There are cancer patients waiting who will not and cannot be called back because the consultants do not have the resources, and some of these people will die.  In ophthalmology alone there are 646 people on waiting lists since 1987.  There are 370 awaiting cataract operations, 90 of whom have gone blind and are beyond redemption. That is a sad testimony to the type of health service we have.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister derided Deputies Howlin and Yates saying that they were jumping on the backs of the patients.  We are not jumping on anybody's back.  Collectively, as Opposition parties, we are putting before the Minister the reality that when he was in Opposition he derided Deputy Barry Desmond day after day and made him the <i>bete noir</i> of the Coalition so that at the end of the day he was seen as &ldquo;Dr. No&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dr. Bad Man&rdquo; or even, &ldquo;Dr. <Col N="1112" /> Death&rdquo;.  The Minister in Opposition said he would introduce changes to make painless savings and bring about radical improvements in the health service.  We have seen some painless savings in the past two years under the jurisdiction of the Minister, Deputy Rory O'Hanlon. The Minister stands over a whole monololith of bureaucracy in administration.</P>
    <P>We have a population of 3.2 million, a little more than the Greater Manchester area.  We have eight health boards from Manorhamilton to Waterford, from Dundalk down as far as Killarney.  There are eight CEOs all drawing about £40,000 per annum.  There are deputy CEOs and a plethora of managers of programmes. Underneath we have a whole list of senior staff officers and thousands of community welfare officers.  There is a dual system of assessment for basic necessities such as medical cards and social welfare entitlements.  There is duplication, triplication, quadruplication.  We have eight times the structures we need, and we have a health bill that is costing £1.3 billion and all the Minister can offer by way of solace to the people on the health lists and on the corridors of the hospitals is two committees, one of which is presided over by somebody from Aer Lingus; it is possible he is familiar with aeroplanes but it is doubtful if he has the necessary sensitivity to untangle the difficulties in the health service.</P>

      <P>We have £10 million divided eight ways by eight health boards. That is the answer the Minister has. People have died who need not have died.  People will die who need not die and yet the Minister refuses to listen. That is the rationale behind this motion before the House this evening.  If the Minister thinks it is going to end here then he has heard nothing yet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Deputy Boylan for sharing his time with me.  Having listened to the Minister I am compelled to rise to say that he <Col N="1113" /> seems totally unaware of what is happening to the health services.  I want to put on the record the situation in my own constituency, recognising that what is happening in Clare is happening throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The manner in which the Government have treated the health service is absolutely disgraceful.  The people of Clare are appalled at the way the Government have failed to deliver a health service to them. County Clare has been stripped of a health service since the last Fianna Fáil Government and the present Coalition Government took office.  Since 1987 the number of beds in Clare has been reduced from 1,100 to 543.  Clare has been stripped of its maternity service and its psychiatric service, and its geriatric service has been greatly reduced.  The general hospital had its number of beds reduced from 127 to 78.  All the flesh has been taken off the health service in County Clare.  We are left with a skeleton health service and this Minister has supervised that abysmal situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to that we have no community services.  The effect on the county has been disastrous.  Let me cite one incident of a person 70 miles from Limerick, west of Carrickaholt, who got sick some time after Christmas.  When the local GP contacted Ennis General Hospital he was told that not alone was the hospital full but it was overcrowded with every stretcher full and that there was an accident a few miles outside Ennis and patients were on their way into the hospital that night.  Despite the fact that the man was suffering from respiratory failure and had severe chest pains he could not be admitted to Ennis General Hospital. Despite the pleadings of the GP, that patient had to be send down to Limerick, 70 miles from his home, that night. On New Year's eve a nephew of an old woman in another part of the country contacted me at 12.45 p.m. to say that his aunt had just been returned from Ennis General Hospital having lain on a stretcher all day hoping to gain admission to that hospital.  She was eventually sent home because there was no bed, not even a stretcher to accommodate her for the <Col N="1114" /> night.  She was sent back to an empty, cold house where she lived by herself.</P>
    <P>These are just examples of what is happening right across the county.  In addition, nurses in the general hospital in Ennis find it impossible to manage in the circumstances in which they are forced to operate.  The admissions nurse is under terrible strain and is forced to make extremely difficult decisions.  The nurses in the ward are working in terrible conditions. Beds are squashed up against beds and it is almost impossible to work. At one stage over the Christmas period there were 13 beds squashed into a six bed ward in the day centre with none of the facilities necessary in a regular ward.  This is some of what is going on in County Clare.</P>
    <P>There is one consultant who, for the first time in eight years had no surgery in the general hospital in Ennis during one week, and absolutely no elective surgery has taken place in the past month in Ennis General Hospital.  All that has taken place there is acute surgery and emergency surgery, with the result that an excellent team of professional consultants in Ennis General Hospital are totally frustrated by the present circumstances. This is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The people of County Clare are tired of the overall situation and they are sickened by what was said in this House last night about the provision of another committee. They are sick and tired of committees and the buck being passed between the Department of Health and the health board.  There are over 200 patients in County Clare now awaiting surgery.  Can the Minister tell those people when they will be called for their operations in order to give them some hope?  Can he also tell them when he will open the ward that should be open in Ennis General Hospital?  I should like to bring to the Minister's attention that during the course of the last general election his party promised &mdash; I have this document with me &mdash; that they would increase the number of beds in Ennis General Hospital from 78 to 100.  This promise was contained in the document presented by the Fianna Fáil Party at the <Col N="1115" /> time of the general election.  I hope the Minister will stand by that promise and will deliver those extra beds now and not a week before the next general election. I can guarantee the Minister that the people of County Clare are not a crowd of shoneens; they will not fall for that kind of politics.  Too many families will have been hurt and too many people in the county will have been affected for the Minister's promise to have any political effect at that stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister's party are the people who in 1984 were calling for 200 beds in Ennis General Hospital but they now have the audacity to tell us that 78 beds are adequate.  I should like to know how the Government can justify this claim when the population in some parts of County Clare has remained the same and increased in other parts.  This does not make any sense to me.  The same situation pertains in every other county and it is totally unacceptable to tell the people of County Clare that they can go to the hospitals in Galway and Limerick.</P>
    <P>I am pleading here this evening with the Minister to reopen the ward he closed in Ennis General Hospital in order to re-establish some kind of health service in County Clare.  The people there are now seeking legal advice and have considered resorting to taking legal action about the lack of a health service in the county. They wonder what their legal rights are under the Health Acts and their present position as a result of mismanagement by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the foundation of the Progressive Democrats just four years ago, the party have constantly advocated equality of access to essential health care for everybody in this country irrespective of means.  In the intervening <Col N="1116" /> four years, we have put forward many proposals to alleviate and/or resolve the outstanding problems in the health services. I am very proud of the practical role the Progressive Democrats have played in ensuring, for instance, that extra resources were made available in the agreed Programme for Government last July to tackle some of the foremost problems in this area.</P>
      <P>It is also obvious, and indeed it is conceded by spokespersons for the various parties in this House, that simply throwing more money at our health services provides no panacea or cure-all.  The key focus of health policy in this country now must be to ensure greater efficiency in using the resources devoted to health care, and ensuring that the various health care procedures are carried out in the most cost efficient and caring manner possible.</P>
      <P>One clear implication of this has to be the greater development of community-based facilities, focused on the general practitioner.  This in turn can greatly reduce the burden currently falling on the more costly acute hospitals and other institution-based services.  To the extent that extra financial resources have been necessary to tackle some of the most pressing and immediate problems, I am very pleased that the Progressive Democrats, as partners in the present Government, have provided significant additional resources to the health budget in the latter half of last year and again this year.</P>
      <P>It is important, therefore, to bear some fundamental facts in mind in this debate. To that end I wish to first recall to the House the particular measures agreed and undertaken as part of the <i>Programme for Government</i> in July last year.</P>
      <P>An extra £15 million was provided to tackle the unacceptable waiting lists, particularly in the areas of hip replacement operations and child deafness procedures and also to provide accident and emergency services on a 24-hour basis in all the major Dublin hospitals from 1 September last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are also committed to ensuring that the management of the health services is improved and, to that <Col N="1117" /> end, are prepared to review the entire system by which the services are managed and delivered.  It is the consistent view of the Progressive Democrats that the present health board structure is cumbersome, uneven and does not ensure the most efficient use of the extensive financial resources devoted to health care.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Government also agreed that it was necessary to improve the management information systems within the health service so that they could be reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis.  A practical example of what we have in mind is the problem of waiting lists.  I and my party believe that if there was a continuous review of the waiting lists, a lot of the backlog could be more efficiently dealt with, and a lot of human suffering and anxiety accordingly allayed.  The Programme for Government also calls for the publication of a national drugs formulary by the Department of Health and urges the greater prescription of generic drugs so that greater savings can be effected in this area.</P>
    <P>All of these measures, of course, are set down in the Programme for Government to ensure compliance with the basic principle of equality of access to health services for our people, irrespective of means.</P>
    <P>I and the Progressive Democrats have also been concerned that the specific hardship needs of particular groups should also be dealt with, whether by tackling outstanding waiting lists in certain areas or by dealing with the particular needs of special groups.  The most obvious case in point here, which was immediately addressed in the context of the formation of the present Government, was the decision last July to provide £1 million for the Haemophiliacs Society.</P>
    <P>Specific targeting of resources on the particular needs of other sectors has also been carried on in last week's budget by the provision of £5 million to develop services for the elderly; by providing an additional £3 million to improve the dental services and there by deal with <Col N="1118" /> the extraordinary long waiting lists for children's orthodontic services; through the allocation of £2 million extra to provide additional places for the mentally handicapped and the provision of a special carer's allowance of £45 a week for people who look after the sick and elderly at home.  The provision of this additional sum of £13 million last week was on top of an increased allocation of £120 million provided on the non-capital expenditure side for health in the Estimates for this year compared with last year. By any yardstick this amounts to a massive deployment of funding for health care in this country.  It is also worth bearing in mind that spending on health now represents over one-fifth of all Government spending.  What this underlines, as I have signalled earlier, is that the mere deployment of money is not the answer to the problems in our health services.  The key issues to be addressed in this debate, and which have to be tackled by Government, and I am satisfied that the present Government are beginning to tackle them, is to ensure the optimum deployment of these financial resources; the most efficient management systems possible in our services; the proper and equitable treatment of all staff working in the health area; and the creation of a proper balance &mdash; which clearly does not exist at present &mdash; between community-based services and institutional services.  I would like to address these various issues in turn and to highlight the kind of practical proposals the Progressive Democrats are advancing in Government with a view to having the problems resolved.</P>
    <P>The hospital waiting lists for treatments like hip replacement, heart by-pass operations, optical care and other procedures, need to be totally reviewed and constantly updated.  This is essential in the interest of the dignity and peace of mind of the people concerned.  What I have in mind is that different categories of waiting list be drawn up, which naturally gives priority to those in need of immediate treatment, and which also sets out subsequent categories of people less in need of urgent attention.  In consultation with the hospital authorities and <Col N="1119" /> the medical and nursing staffs, the urgent cases must be immediately dealt with, while the people further down the waiting lists are written to, and given a clear indication of the time that is likely to elapse before their own admission date.</P>
    <P>This should be done by all hospitals, and such a procedure requres constant revision and updating.  It would greatly reduce the anxiety, worry and hardship faced by many families who at present are left in a no-mans-land, worried about their particular ailment, yet not knowing when precisely they are likely to secure a hospital bed and the appropriate treatment. This highlights a major priority of the Progressive Democrats.  It is vital that in all sectors of the health system the needs of the patient and his or her family are uppermost.  That, too, is why I warmly welcome the Minister for Health's proposal for a proper hospital appointments system.</P>
    <P>It is incredible that all over the country, whole batches of outpatients should be told to show up at 9 o'clock in the morning, or 2 o'clock in the afternoon where they have to sit for hours and wait their turn for an appointment.  Surely in this day and age it is possible for our hospitals to administer a sensible waiting list system in its various clinics which does not have people sitting around for hours. The very fact that we are only getting around now to tackling this relatively simple problem highlights the totally inadequate management systems which have prevailed in our hospitals up to now. Clearly another aspect of this situation which the Minister, his officials and hospital managements will have to grapple with is the role of the consultant in the hospitals if proper appointment procedures are to be put in place.</P>
    <P>It is important that all the people engaged in the delivery of the health service &mdash; from hospital management to doctors, nurses and consultants &mdash; develop a patient-service ethos.  I appreciate the pressures on the hospital specialists and consultants.  Nevertheless, the present bias in the hospital management system which is geared around <Col N="1120" /> suiting consultants, their time and availability, must be turned around to ensure that it is the patient who is given foremost attention.</P>
    <P>Another issue that has to be tackled effectively is the increased use of part-time and casual staff in hospitals, particularly in the nursing area.  This has led to serious morale problems among the nursing profession.  It is wrong that nurses, with many years qualifications, have their career and salary prospects severely limited because they are classified as casual or temporary staff.</P>
    <P>Again, I am pleased with the progress which has been promised in this area and the commitment from the Department of Health to increae the level of permanent staffing in the health services on a phased basis to close on 90 per cent of total staffing.  There can be no delay in moving in this direction and, in particular, in tackling the imbalance in the employment of nursing staff.</P>
    <P>All in all, I and my party welcome the thrust of the reforms outlined, and charted by the Minister for Health in his contribution to this debate last night, but I cannot overlook the fact that the very necessity for the introduction of so many initiatives of itself clearly underlines the weaknesses and the inadequacies in the existing health care delivery system in this country.</P>
    <P>I believe, in particular, that the Efficiency Review of Acute Hospitals, to be conducted by Mr. Noel Fox, and the review of the admissions, out-patient and discharge policies in the Dublin hospitals to be carried out under Mr. David Kennedy are very worth-while moves, as is the proposal for an appeals system for medical card applicants.  I also note that the Minister will be bringing forward before the summer recess, proposals to change the administrative structure of the health services.</P>
    <P>I also believe that all parties in this House must, and will welcome, the increased allocation of resources this year for the development of community based services to do with the care of the elderly, the care of mentally handicapped persons, and the improvement of the dental <Col N="1121" /> services.  The provision of additional home-care nursing, and home-help support systems is to be greatly welcomed, as of course is the provision of extra residential places for the mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>I hope what we are now seeing emerge is the beginning of the more proper balance between community based and insti-tutional-hospital services.  This is not only more cost efficient, but also enables people who are either sick, elderly or handicapped to be catered for in their own homes and in their local communities to the greatest extent possible. That objective is one we must always strive for.  Moreover, the administrative and structural reviews of the health system outlined by the Minister for Health must be a first step towards the evolution of a more efficient, value-for-money, and above all, patient-orientated system, from top to bottom.</P>
    <P>In that context, too, a more disciplined approach to hospital admissions, particularly through the casualty system, must be put in place, and cases which are not emergency or accidents should be referred back to GPs.  This will obviously require that the person making the decision in casualty must be a person of a senior house officer or consultant rank, and there must also be a formal system of liaison with local GPs in such cases.</P>
    <P>The present system that has evolved in many cases is nothing more than queue jumping &mdash; which is understandable from the point of view of the patient &mdash; but it is setting in train a vicious cycle which runs as follows: there are more and more admissions through the accident and emergency systems in our hospitals; that puts greater pressure on beds, which in turn means that elective admissions through GPs become impossible.  When the GP cannot get a patient into hospital, the patient is naturally tempted to take the casualty route in.</P>
    <P>In this context, too, my party are very concerned about the new system of payment for GPs.  We expressed strong opposition to the introduction of the new capitation system a year ago and we still <Col N="1122" /> hold the view that some form of fee-pervisit, even if combined with a capitation system, would be a better way to proceed than the present one.</P>
    <P>This is not a reflection on the professionalism of the dedication of our GPs, but it is important that there be a proper reward system for domiciliary and out-of-hours visiting, or the inevitable result must be a greater tendency to refer some patients for institutional care in hospitals.</P>
    <P>I will sum up by quoting from a recent letter to <i>The Irish Times</i> by a former chairman of the Irish College of General Practitioners, Dr. Michael Boland, in which he stated:</P>
    <P>The solution (to the health problems) does not involve extra beds in hospitals, but a return to more rational admission policies, and an improvement of facilities for care at home.</P>
    <P>In particular the abuse of the Casualty Department must cease and urgent measures must be introduced to resume traditional referral.  The public must come to regard a visit to their GP as more promising (and better value) than going directly to Casualty.  Standards of premises and equipment in general practice must also be urgently improved.</P>
    <P>The proposals outlined by my Government colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, are a step in the right direction, but more needs to be done.  As is generally acknowledged, and indeed as was underlined in the conclusions of the Hederman report on health funding, the solution to the problem is not one of continuing to deploy more financial resources to the health services.</P>
    <P>The emphasis from now on must be to ensure the maximum efficiency in the use of the resources already deployed to our health services and the provision for all our people of a caring, sensitive and responsive health service at all levels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I greatly welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion. During the past few months fantasy has to a large extent been perceived as fact, illusion as reality and nonsense as truth. <Col N="1123" /> The health service has been built up during the years &mdash; and this is the reality &mdash; to be one of the finest in the world. Indeed since the establishment of the health boards in 1971 we have witnessed the building of the most modern hospitals in the world up and down the length and breadth of the country.  We have also witnessed the creation of a sophisticated community care programme and have succeeded in changing not just Victorian buildings in which the mentally ill were often cared for but also Victorian attitudes towards the same group of people.</P>
      <P>In short we have built up a sophisticated system which can match any in the world but if we are to be absolutely truthful with the people we must now decide as a people what kind of service we want in the future and in doing so we must also decide how much we are prepared to pay.  Truly, there is no such thing as a free lunch.  Unfortunately, there is not even such a thing as a free medical card or a free bed or any kind of free service.  Somebody has to pay and it is best that those who pay the piper call the tune.  In this context one way or another every man, woman and child, whether employed or unemployed, disadvantaged or privileged, rich or poor pays in the end.</P>
      <P>In recent times the utopian view that you can have a perfect service has been expressed.  I recall when I became a member of the Southern Health Board in 1982 that the overtime payments alone in Our Lady's psychiatric hospital in Cork city amounted to in excess of £1 million. I also recall that at the same time the overtime payments in St. Finan's Hospital in Killarney were virtually negligible. When ultimately the overtime ended not a bed was closed, not a ward was shut and the service continued as before.  If anything old buildings such as Our Lady's Hospital had been closed down and the patients transferred to better care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be foolhardy to say and more foolhardy to believe that waiting lists grew up overnight.  Whether we like it or not, there have been waiting lists in the <Col N="1124" /> Irish health service for more years than we care to remember.  There have been waiting lists for orthodontic treatment for years.  The same may be said for speech therapy, orthopaedic and ENT services. Waiting lists have been part and parcel of the health system for generations.  It is not true to say, therefore, that this Minister or this Government created the waiting lists.  When I went into the health board in 1982 for the first time there was a very long waiting list for orthodontic treatment, a child would grow into an adult and still not get treatment, a child could wait then for speech therapy for months on end, and a child could wait for ENT surgery in a Cork hospital for years. This Minister introduced an ENT service for the very first time in Tralee General Hospital in my county.  He also for the first time improved speech therapy in County Kerry.</P>
    <P>In regard to the mentally handicapped, with whom I have the greatest personal sympathy and empathy, let no Member of this House tell the Irish people that the adult mentally handicapped were ever properly treated by any Government at any time.  It simply is not true.  There was never a coherent policy for the adult mentally handicapped, and this Minister in justice, in so far as he could within the resources available to him, tried to improve their situation in whatever way he could.  Much more needs to be done about the mentally handicapped but let nobody come in here with a bleeding heart stating that those people were in any way adversely affected by health cutbacks. There never was a coherent policy for them, or if a coherent policy was ever introduced I challenge any Member of this House to say where it is.  This Minister for Health contacted the health boards and sought a policy in relation to the mentally handicapped and boards, such as the Southern Health Board, are examining those proposals at present.</P>
    <P>Much has been made over what happened in the last few months by many people who had an opportunity of remedying the situation over the years.  In Tralee General Hospital and in many sections of the Southern Health Board <Col N="1125" /> region there was an increase in activity at the Christmas period of 40 per cent.  That was an emergency if ever there was one. The service was put to what can only be described as the ultimate test and the question is whether it responded to that test.  The answer is irrefutably &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  I have listened to experts in health speak about what can only be described as the emergency situation.  I heard an eminent nurse of 30 years' standing, saying in public: &ldquo;I have worked in the health service for 30 years of my life.  In the period of those 30 years I can safely say this: we have always had overcrowding at one stage or another; we have always had emergencies at one stage or another; we have always had our difficulties at one stage or another, but throughout those difficulties, we always survived.  We survived then and we will survive now&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It would be grossly unfair to let the perception go out to elderly people that there would be no bed in hospital for them if they became ill.  The truth is different. I do not believe any health board would say that any sick man or woman would be turned away at the door.  I accept that there are waiting lists &mdash; we have always had waiting lists &mdash; but let us not frighten the elderly with talk about them not getting a bed if they were seriously ill tomorrow morning.</P>
    <P>There has been a call for the centralisation of health boards, to remove the power from the local to the centre. We have centralised enough over the years.  In fact, we have centralised so much that my view is we are over-centralised. Regional health boards make an enormous contribution and they have made that over several years, and the members of those boards are more often than not best equipped to articulate the problems and views which exist in a local health board area.  For example, Comhairle na nOspidéal are a centralised body but I do not believe Comhairle na nOspidéal would be as informed or advised as health boards would be.  It is strange to hear people who would call for the centralisation of the health service condemn the centralisation of the agricultural service, for example.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1126" /> There is a need to improve management procedures in many hospitals and this need has been recognised by the Minister.  Only on Monday at a Southern Health Board meeting in Tralee it was stated that a manager would be appointed to the regional hospital in Cork.  That could be extended to many of the larger hospitals, sometimes with budgets of almost £30 million, the equivalent of what a local authority's budget, on average, might be.</P>
    <P>I would like to take the opportunity of paying a very special tribute to those involved in community care.  In this regard, none has been more important or active than community service groups throughout the length and breadth of the country.  They have provided on the ground tremendous comfort and aid to the elderly, whether in relation to special housing aid schemes for the elderly, meals on wheels or other charitable works.  I pay tribute, too, to other organisations such as the Rehabilitation Institute who have over the years done a tremendous amount for people with disability, mental or physical.</P>

      <P>The motion of no confidence in the Minister for Health tabled by the Opposition parties is clearly a diversionary tactic by those who have no clear view of what direction health policies should take in future.  Listening to the debate last night I could not but be struck by the poor standard of contribution by some, not all.  It demonstrated to me that this no confidence motion is concerned primarily with deflecting attention from the Opposition parties since they have little concrete to say about how our health service should be delivered.  It is highly constructive to contrast what the Opposition parties have been saying with what the Minister for Health has been doing.  There is an immense difference between the futile and often misleading statements of Fine Gael, Labour and The Workers' Party representatives and the Minister's solid, efficient actions.  While the Opposition have been talking, and fantasising the Minister has been getting on with the <Col N="1127" /> job and doing it very well despite the constraints that we all face.  Even a brief examination of the progress made in improving services since the Minister came to office in 1987 illustrates what has been achieved.  There is no doubt that development in the major service areas has been significant.  In 1990 alone, the allocation to health boards has been increased by £65 million or almost 9 per cent while the moneys allocated to voluntary hospitals have been increased to £36 million, or over 14 per cent.  The increased allocation continues the improvement of the services commenced in autumn of last year, when additional resources of £15 million were made available. In the 1990 budget Deputies will recall that the Government allocated an additional £10 million to the services for the elderly, mentally handicapped and health board dental provisions.  In addition there is a new carer's allowance which is a recognition of the invaluable contribution of family members who look after their elderly relatives.  Within the additional £10 million, £2 million has been provided in the current year for the further development of services for the mentally handicapped.  As I have said before, the Minister is to be commended for this.  To assist matters further, co-ordinating committees of the voluntary and statutory agencies have been established in each health board area.  The committees will formulate five year plans to meet development needs.</P>
      <P>It is clear therefore, that in spite of the limited resources available, the Minister has demonstrated his ability to channel funds into improving services; more importantly, he has also ensured that the money is spent in the most cost effective way by putting in place appropriate mechanisms for identifying service needs and by pinpointing the best approach to meet these needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no Utopia in the health service or indeed in any other services but in so far as the service can be improved we must do so within the resources available to the Minister.  To that end far from putting down a motion of no confidence <Col N="1128" /> in this Minister, I would have hoped the Opposition would have recognised his tremendous contribution to Irish life which will be recognised in the years to come.</P>

      <P>I seldom have the luxury of sharing time with anybody in this House; indeed the opposite is often the case and I have tried to get time from the other parties.

Tonight I have the rare luxury of being able to share my time with a few of my backbench colleagues.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a relatively short debate on a very important issue.  The debate is long overdue and I am very pleased to have the opportunity of making my contribution to it.</P>
      <P>There is a crisis in the health services. I do not use that word lightly.  The word &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; is often bandied about in our society, but there is a crisis in the health service and we should say so.  There is no point in denying it.  There has been a great deal of criticism of the flaws, shortcomings and defects of our present health system.  There is no point in my listing a long catalogue of the flaws and shortcomings in the service over the past three years.  I come from a constituency which has suffered the effects of the cutbacks. As people know, I come from Limerick where Barrington's Hospital was closed down two years ago, and the matter was debated in this House at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a realist at all times.  We live in a world of change.  We live in a country that has a great many problems.  It would be foolish to expect that health expenditure would remain immune from Government action.  It is understandable that society has to use equipment and <Col N="1129" /> services in a co-ordinated and centralised way to ensure as far as possible that efficiency and value for money is obtained.  Everybody who lives in the real world knows that.</P>
    <P>While cold, hard economic decisions will invariably clash with humanitarian considerations, no civilised society should ever lose its sense of anger when faced with preventable suffering.  We have plenty of preventable suffering and anguish in our society.</P>
    <P>I did not come into this House to make a personal attack on the Minister or the Minister of State, that would be very foolish of me and I do not believe in that. I do not believe in tagging the Minister with names such as &ldquo;Dr. Death&rdquo; or the other names that he is being called because that is a cop-out for serious thinking.  I have never used this House to attack any Member in a personal way and I would not do so.</P>
    <P>I would be lacking in my public duty if I did not say that health services are very inadequate.  I also know that a great deal of unnecessary suffering and distress is being caused to people, mainly poor people, by these shortcomings.  Every TD in the country knows that people are suffering because of the cutbacks.  Unfortunately, the Minister has taken a stand and has decided to brazen it out and hope that the crisis will go away.  There is no virtue in denying that there are shortcomings in the service.  Unfortunately as in so many areas of society, money can buy immunity from worry and secondclass treatment.  Money cannot keep one alive but it can certainly do the next best thing, keep you alive for as long as possible.</P>
    <P>When one thinks of health, one thinks of doctors who take the Hippocratic oath and nurses who dedicate their lives in a selfless way to people.  We may think of people like Florence Nightingale, Elizabeth Fry and people like that, but when some people think of health and hospitals, they think of money and profit. There is plenty of money to be made despite the Minister's cutbacks.  There is plenty of money being made, but it is being made by the wrong people &mdash;<Col N="1130" /> people involved with international drug or pharmaceutical companies, the professional people who cream off the VHI and the health boards.  When the Minister attempted to prune the service, he started at the bottom with the casual workers, the nurses and the ordinary working people instead of at the top where the money is being made.  We must certainly have reform but we should be thorough and start at the top where the money is being made.  That did not happen, as we all know, but very few people will say that in this House.  The casualties are the poor, people who are queuing up in waiting rooms in hospitals, those on long waiting lists for operations and treatments. Indeed many people have died while waiting for treatment.  You will not find wealthy people on waiting lists or you will not find them waiting at midnight for casualty treatment at the Regional Hospital in Limerick, but you might find a few of them in the Blackrock Clinic or places like that.  It is wrong that money, power and influence should be a factor of health care, but that is what is happening with the development of a two-tier system along American lines.</P>
    <P>I know something about the health service in Limerick.  I should know because there is pressure on me every day to make telephone calls to hospital administrators, admissions officers, matrons, asking them to admit people, so I know the score.  I know that the waiting lists are growing.  I did not come here tonight to rehash the debate on the closure of Barrington's Hospital, which would be a fruitless exercise, but I can say for certain that if Barrington's Hospital had remained open there would be fewer on the waiting lists for the regional hospital, St. John's Hospital or Croome Hospital. That is a modest statement.  I can guarantee that the queues would be far shorter if Barrington's Hospital had remained open.  Limerick people have suffered, indeed Clare people have suffered, and they are paying the price for the closure of Barrington's Hospital since then.</P>
    <P>I have tried to be as low key and unemotional as possible.  Indeed many of the Fianna Fáil Deputies with whom I <Col N="1131" /> have spoken in private would agree with much of what I have said.  Most of them have taken the medicine fairly well on the ground but one or two, one certainly has been running with the hare and chasing with the hounds.  He condemns the cutbacks, the Minister and the Department in his own constituency but comes into this House, votes for all the cutbacks and will troop in here tonight behind the Minister to vote on the motion of no confidence.  I see no virtue at all in that. We could all do that; we could all have our loaf and eat it; we could all run with the hare and chase with the hounds.</P>
    <P>I suggest that some Members should put their house in order in that respect. One of the Minister's loudest critics in my area is a member of his own party. Hardly a week goes past without the papers publishing his attacks on these cutbacks.  Indeed the same Deputy speaks much more than do the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Noonan, Deputy Clohessy and myself on this issue.  Every week the three newspapers are filled with his attacks on these cutbacks.  I see no virtue in that at all, it is a useless exercise and certainly does not help matters.</P>
    <P>I see little point in the Minister stone-walling. Indeed it is fair to say that the Minister would have made a fine stonewall batsman had he ever taken up the game of cricket.  The time has come to end that stone-walling.  The time has come to face reality.  The time has come for the relief of suffering and hardship in our society, for the expenditure of as much money as possible on reducing hospital waiting lists, giving people access to the operations and treatment to which they are entitled.  The time has come to relieve the fear and anxiety, especially of the elderly, many of whom come to departmental offices clutching VHI documents and booklets terrorised that they will not receive hospital treatment.  That psychological pressure on elderly people is totally wrong.</P>
    <P>In summary the time has come to end this crisis, the time has come for the <Col N="1132" /> expenditure of as much money as possible, be that lottery or lotto money, on essential items.  We cannot stand by in this House and see money spent on nonessential items while so many people continue to suffer.  Money must be spent on essentials.</P>
    <P>I thought Fianna Fáil had learned a lesson in the course of the last General Election.  They had a close shave then and will have a close shave this evening. They cannot continue these close shaves or continue to play with people's lives.  I hope the Minister will learn a lesson from this debate.  Action always speaks louder than words.  I listened to what the Minister said last evening &mdash; I read his remarks carefully &mdash; but that is not sufficient unless there is a follow-through in the reduction of waiting lists and ensuring that our people have a decent health service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am unimpressed with the Minister's latest panic response to the health service shambles by appointing Mr. Noel Fox, a well known accountant, who specialises in receiverships and liquidations. Perhaps he will recommend the closure of the hospitals and all of the Department of Health on the grounds that they are loss-making.  This is the type of ad hockery we can do without.</P>
      <P>Whilst I can accept some of the statements of the Fine Gael spokesman, Deputy Yates, particularly in the area of community care, I would remind the House that the Fine Gael Party were totally supportive of the 1987 Fianna Fáil Government's running down of the health services.  As usual, Deputy Howlin, on behalf of the Labour Party and Deputy De Rossa on behalf of The Workers' Party, simply bleat about how much more money is needed in the health services without &mdash; as is their wont &mdash; saying where the money will come from to prop up this system which is wasteful and unworkable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem is not one <Col N="1133" /> of finance but of structure and commitment. The Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, believe that the health service is adequately funded but grossly mismanaged. Last year over £1.2 billion was spent on health.  Every year this figure rises but there has been no corresponding improvement effected in the health status of our population.</P>
      <P>The Green Party have the solution to the problems obtaining in the health service tody, those being (1) the financial crisis of the health service, (2) the failure of the present system to deal with the prevailing disease patterns in society and (3) inequities in health.  The primary goal of the Green Party health policy is the preservation of health, not the cure of sickness.  It would be our aim to radically restructure the health service in order to establish decentralised, community-based, democratically accountable health services which allow for local variations and minimised dependence on expensive, high technology hospital-based medicine, developing the promoton of health services instead of the present repair services; in other words, a complete reversal of present trends.</P>
      <P>Why do the Department of Health continue to target their resources into top-heavy, high technology, costly, chaotic hospitals?  Is there not a need for community hospitals which would provide care for the elderly, the dying, for those with minor ailments who need the presence of friends, families and nursing care instead of high-powered casualty hospitals? We believe the reason for the current policy is the involvement of vested interests &mdash; the pharmaceutical companies, the medical establishment and the vote-catching tactics of politicians, such as Deputy Foxe in Roscommon and the latest Fahey deal in Waterford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the House will allow me retrace our steps somewhat.  In 1978 Ireland, as a member of the World Health Organisation, was signatory to the ALMA and ATA Declaration, which stated that primary health care was the key to attaining health for all by the year 2000.  The declaration called on all <Col N="1134" /> Governments to formulate national strategies, policies and plans of action to launch and sustain primary health care as part of a comprehensive health service. Successive Governments have paid lip service to this declaration.  In order to shift from institution to community-based services the former Minister for Health Deputy Barry Desmond, made a start, as Minister for Health, by tackling vested interests and overseeing the publication of two very important documents, namely, <i>Promoting Health through Public Policy</i> and <i>Health: the Wider Dimensions.</i>  These documents were consultative and should have formed the basis of a radical restructuring of our services.  Unfortunately these reviews merely seem to have served as a substitute for rather than a prelude to action.</P>
    <P>In its primary and secondary forms the public health care system is declining in quality.  People are responding by turning, where possible, to the private sector. In fact the State is subsidising this shift to private medicine by providing tax relief to VHI subscribers or income tax relief on hospital bills, allowing consultants free use of public facilities.  This is not leading toward health for all but rather toward health for those who can pay for it.  As a matter of urgency the Green Party demand that tax relief be withdrawn from all but the cost of the basic VHI plan, that is Plan A, or the equivalent income tax relief.</P>
    <P>When will the Minister come up with a master plan?  How much longer must we move from crisis to crisis?  The Minister cannot remain forever with his fingers stuck in the hole in the dam endeavouring to hold back the flood gates.</P>
    <P>One provision of the budget the Green Party would applaud is the increase in the carers' allowance.  We see this as a step in the right direction.  However, it is a drop in the ocean only.  We need real commitment to primary health care. There is no national plan or strategy, but rather consultative documents, personal reviews and reports only.  Structures for <Col N="1135" /> the promotion of health have been instituted at the top of the health pyramid but not at the bottom.</P>
    <P>Finally, and most importantly, resources vital to the development of primary health care have been committed. Until this commitment is honoured the Green Party have no choice but to support the vote of no confidence in the Minister for Health.  It is with some reluctance I support this motion.  Of course, a mere change in the person of the Minister for Health will not fundamentally change the direction in which the health service is travelling.  Nevertheless, as an expression of my dissatisfaction with Government policy in this area, I support this motion.</P>

      <P>If anybody remained in any doubt about the unsuitability of Dr. O'Hanlon to hold the important office of Minister for Health the matter must have been put beyond doubt by his extraordinary speech in this House last evening. I am a member of the Southern Health Board which, in the year 1989, had a deficit of £500,000.  In 1990 that health board chief executive informed the board that it had been agreed with Department of Health officials that the requirement of the Southern Health Board for 1990 was £146 million.  The Department told the health board: you will get £143 million; you can make do with it because that is all you will receive.  That would mean an increase of approximately £6.6 million over last year, £6 million of which would be expended on wages.  Indeed that makes no provision for an increase in the cost of living in excess of 4 per cent.  In the Southern Health Board area there has been a reduction of 1,000 staff in the last three years, from 1987 to 1990, and there has been a reduction of 599 beds in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How could anyone say that the finance being provided is adequate when that is happening?  The Minister said that an appeals system will be set up for people who are disallowed their application for full eligibility.  That appeals system exists already.  Let the Minister tell the House that tax and PRSI is deductible when <Col N="1136" /> assessing a person's eligibility.  I have seen people being turned away from health boards.  Mothers of small children cannot afford to go to the chemist with a prescription from their doctor and that is a scandal to say the least.</P>
    <P>Much play has been made of the prescribed relative's allowance which is being increased to £45.  Is it a great honour to this Department to give £45 a week to people who have dedicated their lives to looking after their relatives?  I would ask the Minister why the drugs subsidy scheme which he promised last year has not been implemented.  People, especially asthmatic sufferers, are spending up to £100 a month, and sometimes in excess of that, on medicines.</P>
    <P>It appears that the only section of the Health Act that will be complied with by the Minister for Health in 1990 is section 30.  Health board officials are required to live within their budget and if they do not do so section 30 will be applied against them.  The reduction in expenditure in the health board area which I represent will result in a reduction in general hospital services.  We had to go to the High Court in 1989 to save the general hospital in the Mallow area.  There will be a reduction in community care also because the number of public health nurses is well below the national average and no effort is being made to redress this problem.  All the services within the Southern Health Board area will be affected.</P>
    <P>The Minister has failed totally to come up with a programme of immediate steps necessary to deal with the near collapse of hospital services in many parts of the country, or the range of imaginative and innovative long-term measures necessary to give the country the sort of health service our people need.  What we got instead was the announcement of the allocation of an extra few million pounds &mdash; a sum totally inadequate to the scale of the problem facing the health service &mdash; and the appointment of yet more consultants, experts and committees.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that the one thing the health service was not short of was reports and recommendations.  What it is <Col N="1137" /> short of is money and resources.  Over the years successive Governments have appointed a whole series of consultants, experts, committees and working groups. Many of them have produced excellent reports &mdash; indeed there must be a library full of reports in the Department of Health &mdash; but virtually none of them has been implemented.  Without the will to act, more reports will be useless.</P>
    <P>The Minister clearly believes that attack is the best form of defence and instead of dealing with the issues the main thrust of his speech last night was an attack on the Opposition parties in this House for continuing to raise the health cuts as a political question.  The Minister accused the Opposition parties of exploiting the problem and causing fear among the old, the sick and the handicapped. There is genuine fear among these groups but the fear has not been caused by the Opposition parties.  The fear is caused by what the Minister has done to the health service.  The fear is caused by the knowledge that if they are ill, there may not be a bed for them.  The fear is that if they need an operation they may have to spend many painful months on a waiting list.  The fear among the parents of the mentally handicapped is that if they die there will be no-one to look after their dependants.  There is no need for the Opposition parties to stir up fear and concern among those who are dependent on the public health services.  The fear is genuine.  The fear is real.  Only someone who is out of touch, as the Minister for Health is, could deny that it is there.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister for Health has some nerve to accuse the Opposition parties of exploiting the problem.  The Minister's party is, after all, the one which based its 1987 election campaign around the slogan &ldquo;Health cuts hurt the old, the sick and the handicapped&rdquo;.  The slogan was right.  Health cuts do hurt the old, the sick and the handicapped.  They hurt them in 1987 and they are hurting them even more severely now due to the cuts imposed by this Minister.  What makes people in this country so cynical about politics is that they see parties adopting certain positions in opposition and then <Col N="1138" /> doing the direct opposite when they get into government.  The Fianna Fáil performance before and after the 1987 election is the most outrageous example of this in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>Back in 1984, when the health cuts introduced by the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition were still at a relatively minor level, the Fianna Fáil Leader, Deputy Haughey, gave an interview to <i>The Irish Press.</i>  In the course of that interview he said: &ldquo;The health services have been reduced to dangerously inadequate levels, and I think that if it hasn't happened already, people will die because of the unavailability of particular services in certain areas&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach says little about the health services these days &mdash; understandably enough considering the roasting he got on the matter during the last general election campaign.  Perhaps at some stage soon he might take some time off from his role as President of Europe to let the country know how many people he believes have died because of the far more severe round of cuts introduced by his Government.</P>
    <P>What really shocked me about the Minister's speech last night was his statement that health care must be run as a business.  Is the Minister really serious? Is he really suggesting that the health service, the quality of which affects the interests of hundreds of thousands of people and which can in fact determine whether people will live or die can be run in the same way that Ben Dunne runs his supermarket chain or Larry Goodman runs his meat business.  In business the amount of money at your disposal determines the speed and quality of the service you get.  This is, of course, increasingly the case in the health service also, but it is the first time we have heard a Minister for Health prepared to admit it.</P>
    <P>If Ben Dunne has a supermarket which is not making money, he will simply close it down.  Is the Minister seriously suggesting that the same approach can be adopted in relation to hospitals or health centres?  I believe the Minister's statement reflects an underlying hostility in Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats to the concept of a comprehensive <Col N="1139" /> public health service.  The real objective of the health cuts has been to create in this country a US style health service where the amount of money in your pocket determines the quality of the health care you receive: a service where only the poorest of the poor qualify for a limited public service and where everyone else must take out private medical insurance or pay themselves.</P>
    <P>Families have to go to credit unions or banks to borrow money to enable their relatives to have operations.  That happened just today in my own constituency in the case of a person who has full eligibility and should be treated under the public health system.  This must not be allowed to continue.  We are totally opposed to this approach.  We believe that any civilised society has an obligation to provide the best possible standard of health service for its people on the basis of need rather than wealth.  We are in favour of a more efficient health service and the more effective use of scarce public resources but we are opposed to cuts which diminish the standard of health care for those who need it.  We opposed the health cuts of the Fine Gael-Labour Government, we opposed the health cuts of the last Fianna Fáil Government and we will oppose the health cuts of this Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foxe</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I would like to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me time to speak and I would also like to pay tribute to my colleague, Deputy Jim Kemmy, for sharing his time with me.  I have no political allegiance to any party, but seven months ago the people in my constituency in Roscommon elected me almost solely on the health issues.  It was not a decision they took lightly.  After all, to topple an experienced political figure was not an easy task.  But when people saw what was happening in the health services they realised that unless they had one of their own to work for them their chances of getting fair play, even in our own health board area, was almost nil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1140" /> Over the last five or six weeks it has been the in-thing to criticise over-crowding and under-staffing in hospitals.  That is not new in Roscommon hospital.  Since the health cuts were first introduced three years ago there has been continual over-crowding and a shortage of nurses in our hospital.  There have been seven beds in four bed wards and sometimes six beds in a four bed ward and so on.  That, along with under-staffing, has left the health services in Roscommon in a dire state. The fate of Roscommon hospital was never highlighted by many of our politicians or our health board representatives but the moment it came to light that there was over-crowding in the Regional Hospital in Galway and a scarcity of nurses, the boys jumped onto the bandwagon immediately.  Maybe the TV cameras were an incentive.  Even Western Health Board representatives from my own county failed to highlight the disadvantages faced by Roscommon hospital for one reason or another.  However, we in Roscommon are not now surprised at the furore that is being kicked up throughout the country due to the shortage of hospital beds.</P>
    <P>It may be unfair to blame the Minister for Health alone for the shortages and the under-staffing because after all he is a member of the Government which, I am sure, took a collective decision to do what he has taken responsibility for.  The Minister strikes me as an honest man, a believing man and indeed he must be a believing man if he can say with apparent honesty that there is no over-crowding in certain hospitals and in particular in Roscommon hospital.  I gather than the Minister genuinely believes that, so I would advise him to seek new advisers and to get rid of the guys who are continually feeding him untruths, to say the least.  I will not use a stronger term.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFoxe" hpid="Mr. Foxe Mr. Foxe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foxe</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the Minister believes what he says when he comes on television with an angelic face and says that there is no over-crowding in <Col N="1141" /> Roscommon hospital, but I would advise him to seek his advice elsewhere the next time.</P>
      <P>We did not jump on the bandwagon at Christmas to talk about the over-crowding due to the flu epidemic.  We have not been suffering a flu epidemic in Roscommon for the past three years and during every month of 1989 there was over-crowding in Roscommon hospital.  We have 25 surgical beds, 27 medical beds and eight beds for coronary care, a total of 60 beds, although the Minister thought that total was 70 beds.  It is quite common to have 45 patients for the 27 beds. Obviously, somebody must suffer and the people who suffer most are the patients and then the working staff, the doctors and nurses in the hospitals.  It is grossly unfair to put the onus for discharging patients prematurely on any doctor or matron.  In the not-too-distant future the day will come when some doctor will be had by the &ldquo;short and curlies&rdquo; for discharging a patient prematurely.  I wonder who will face the reality then? Who will foot the bill &mdash; the doctor who discharged the patient, the health board or the Minister for Finance?  It is unfair to put such an onus on one person when there is a simple answer.</P>
      <P>In Roscommon hospital it is hard to explain to patients that they cannot be admitted because of bed shortages when they can look around and see a ward with 30 or 40 beds completely locked up.  The Minister spoke about loving care and preventive medicine.  Preventive medicine is a good line to take but one will not get far with preventive medicine if patients are turned away from hospital because of bed shortages, or if one puts the onus on the doctors to examine patients to see which two or three of them might be less deserving of a bed so that they can discharge them to allow in others.  The sooner we get away from that type of thing the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would wonder if our health services are being administered by the proper authorities in the proper manner. One would question the structure of the health boards and of the health board areas.  The Minister spoke about review <Col N="1142" /> bodies.  The first review body should review the health boards and the health board areas because, as I see it, there are many mini-Hitlers in the health boards. The Minister talks about loving care but those people never heard of it.  Maybe they have as much loving care for the patients as Herr Adolf had for the Jews.</P>
    <P>We have been told that the sense of panic has been heightened amongst patients by people highlighting the over-crowding. Highlighting that problem will not cause as much panic amongst people as would a refusal of admission to hospital or the knowledge that nurses are unavailable to tend to the needs of patients because they are so over-worked.  More panic is caused if a person who has been involved in a car accident is brought into casualty and is left there for a few hours because of the shortage of nurses to take care of the problems.  If we are talking about heightening panic that is the way to do it.  The way to solve that problem would be to employ a few more nurses and open up some of the locked wards.</P>

It is true, unfortunately, that our population is dwindling but despite that we have an increasing ageing population &mdash; the parents of people who have hit the boat trail and emigrated.  Instead of decreasing the number of beds for elderly people we should be increasing them.  The Minister should take full responsibility for preventive medicine and put it into proper perspective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was tardy in recognising the shortcomings in the health services, especially in Roscommon, the area about which I know most.  I am delighted, however, that he is now facing reality and that when we discuss the health services in perhaps six months' time the situation <Col N="1143" /> will be much different in Roscommon.  It will not then be at the bottom of the pile, the forgotten county of the health service, as it has been for the past three years.</P>

      <P>There can be few public debates which have engendered so much bad feeling, bad blood and gross misrepresentation as this debate.  We all accept that there are problems in the health services &mdash; certainly I do and I would never suggest to the contrary &mdash; and we all equally accept that there is no such thing as a perfect public service because the day we claim a service is perfect is the day we accept that there can be no change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no such thing as a service that cannot be improved by thoughtful analysis and timely action.  There can be no doubt, however, that the public debate was called for by Fine Gael and some of the key vested interests &mdash; a number of the minority parties spoke here tonight about vested interests and I will be focusing on them &mdash; in medicine, most notably the Hospital Consultants' Association.  The debate is not aimed at improving the health service, it has been destructive, ill focused, untruthful, bullying and, at the end of the day, sterile. Their aim, collectively, is base.  On the one hand the aim has been politically destructive and on the other it has been to defend the honey pot which has been used to line private pockets from public funds.  Neither Fine Gael nor the consultants' association have had much regard for the common good in their sometimes indistinguishable antics over the last few months.  That party and the association share another distressingly common feature which is new to public <Col N="1144" /> debate, a total and absolute disregard for the truth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>They have put about the view that our health service is a Third World service.  That is a lie and all Deputies in the House should know that that is the case.  The lie undermines the work done by the tens of thousands of men and women who contribute to the service.  It also undermines the contributions of the taxpayers to the service.  Between them they have shaken public confidence to the core in our public health institutions.  Our public health institutions are not perfect, they are extremely large and costly.  In the current year the non-capital costs, without taking into account the recent budget changes, will amount to £1,397 million, 21.3 per cent of total Government expenditure.</P>
      <P>In the current year the increase will be of the order of 9.6 per cent or just double the rate of inflation.  I am not saying that that is enough, if we had more money we should &mdash; and could &mdash; put more money into the services.  However, it is a significant amount of public funds.  Yet these figures have been dismissed as insufficient. Deputy De Rossa, gracing us with one of his occasional visits from Europe, not only suggested that the figures were insufficient but 50 per cent lower than they should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Current health expenditure costs the average PAYE taxpayer about £1,500 per annum.  Would the average taxpayer agree to put a further £750 into that service? Somehow, I doubt it.  I have some sympathy with Deputy De Rossa as in recent times he has become a little removed from the realities of life here. He is beginning to sound like his party <Col N="1145" /> colleagues on Bray Urban District Council who, for the last two years have been calling for this and that service but, when it came to voting for the services, were missing.</P>

      <P>The Workers' Party can be forgiven because they can always say they have not been in Government and cannot influence decisions here.  However, at local government level they cannot make that play.  Last year the health spokesman for The Workers' Party in Bray went to Fassaroe and Wolfe Tone Square in Bray and promised the people they would get support for certain community services but, when it came to putting £1 on charges to support the services, he was nowhere to be seen; he reneged on his promise and turned his back on the people.  The same applies to The Workers' Party in the House because, when it comes to supporting any budget, they will always be in the &ldquo;Nil&rdquo; lobby. That applies no matter what Government are in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public confidence in the health service has been severely dented in this debate and truth has been the first and final victim.  At a very early stage in this debate the main Opposition party, the consultants and other vested interests decided that exaggerations, misrepresentations and common lies would set the tome of the debate.  I will give a couple of examples and I am pleased that Deputy Yates is here.  On a recent &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; Deputy Yates said: &ldquo;a consultant physician for diabetes in Beaumont Hospital has 56 of his 57 beds filled with accident and emergency patients and is unable to admit patients with diabetes&rdquo;. The following day the consultant, Mr. Devlin, wrote to the CEO of Beaumont Hospital &mdash; and Deputy Yates &mdash; to say that the allegations were totally untrue.  He went on to categorically refute the claims made by Deputy Yates. He categorised the allegations as instilling a lack of confidence in the hospital and a lack of concern for patients.  Beaumont Hospital took the unusual step of <Col N="1146" /> issuing a press statement categorically refuting the statement of the Fine Gael spokesman.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that in a moment.  Faced with the truth, did Deputy Yates blush or apologise?  No. He simply dismissed the fact and suggested that it was a slip of the tongue. He said that he referred to Beaumont Hospital when he meant the Mater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Mater have the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>This proves what we all suspected about Deputy Yates.  Not only has the gentleman a brass neck and a contemptuous disregard for the truth or accuracy, he does not even know his Beaumont from his Mater.  I could be rude and say that he does not know other things too.  The issue of truths and misrepresentations is not confined to Deputy Yates.  Politicians of all hues, including local government level &mdash; some from my own party, to their eternal discredit &mdash; have also been engaged in this.  For example, in Clare County Council on 8 January a full debate was televised by RTE which dealt with the unfortunate case of a man who died on 5 January. We were told that he had been refused admission to Ennis Hospital on Christmas Day because there were no beds available.  There is an old saying that the truth does not have its boots on when the lie is three quarters way around the world.  If anything ever proved this saying this case is it.</P>
      <P>On 9 January we had a full report on the issue from the Mid-Western Health Board.  It seems &mdash; this is an interesting point &mdash; that the decision was a clinical one and had nothing to do with&mdash;</P>

      <P>I reminded the House last night &mdash; and it should not be necessary to remind adults too often &mdash; of the need for a civilised debate.  This has been the case so far and it will continue.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Chair.  My apologies if I contributed to the heat to any extent.  The fact is that if the Deputy opposite took the trouble to read the press statement of the Mid-Western Health Board of 9 January he would see that the last sentence he uttered was a total untruth.  That case did not have anything to do with the availability or non-availability of beds. The final paragraph of that press release indicates that there were beds available that week and that there were admissions where clinical judgments suggested that admissions were in order.</P>
      <P>That proves once again that Deputy Yates has scant regard for the facts and only a passing acquaintanceship with the truth.  Unfortunately, Deputy Yates and local councillors were not the only people to jump on that bandwagon.  Our national public broadcasting system, RTE, was very quick to relay all of what they described as the sordid details of that matter.  So too was the local press.  The distressing point about this is that there was a disregard on all sides for what must inevitably be the consequences on families and people who were seeking medical care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One does not always expect accuracy from RTE and local newspapers can occasionally go over the top.  Deputy Yates is, of course, always over the top. However, one does not expect that a certain standard relating to truth will be observed by professional bodies such as the organisation which represents hospital consultants.  I should like to deal with some of the statements they circulated in recent times.  Increasingly in <Col N="1148" /> recent times the hospital consultants' organisation have operated in their public performance in a manner more like a new and vigorous political party than a caring and professional organisation.  When the association's performance and the antics of some of the consultants are examined one is forced to ask who they are caring for.</P>
    <P>Controversies between vested and well heeled medical interests and Ministers for Health are nothing new in Ireland. We all recall that former Deputy Noel Browne had a tempestuous relationship with medical interests.  That is part of the political history of the State.  In more recent times, former Deputy Barry Desmond had difficulty opening Beaumont Hospital not least because of problems he had with the consultants.  What concerns me about the operations of the consultants in recent times is the disturbing amount of evidence which suggests that the association, and some key members, are not just prepared to misrepresent the facts but are prepared to manipulate them in a way that will further exacerbate a problem in a circus which is cash hungry and against cash limits.</P>
    <P>I am sure I am not the only TD who has worried public patients calling to his office with a totally distorted view of reality presented to that public patient, or the parents of a child, by a hospital consultant.  I would be willing to make public outside the House details of two cases, one concerning a tonsillotomy and a consultant and the other concerning a patient with more dire consequences in another hospital.  I will deal with those matters at health board level.</P>
    <P>Certainly, some of the stories going the rounds at present regarding the antics of consultants demand investigation.  There is, for example, the suggestion that two consultants in one of the major accident and emergency hospitals in this city packed clinics artificially with public patients when they learned that the Minister might visit that hospital.  I will be asking the Eastern Health Board to investigate that.  If it is true it is a scandal. The two men in question were caught on <Col N="1149" /> the hop because on the day in question the Minister visited two other hospitals.</P>
    <P>There is also the consultants' collective response to the recent flu epidemic.  To say the least it was remarkable because of its disingenuous nature, particularly in Dublin.  The six accident and emergency hospitals in Dublin coped well with that dramatic event, a flu epidemic of unusual proportions which resulted in a 40 per cent increase in hospital intake through accident and emergency departments over two weeks.  The work of the staff of those hospitals was dismissed by the consultants and their associations.  Why have they such contempt for their fellow health workers?  Who are they serving? Who are they defending?</P>
    <P>One of the extraordinary things about the flu epidemic is that if one examines the studies carried out by the Eastern Health Board on daily admissions &mdash; the health board monitor admissions &mdash; one will find that during that period there was a surprisingly high level of what are called misadmissions or inappropriate admissions, to use the health board's phrases. Indeed, throughout that period there was never a day when inappropriate admissions went below 10 per cent.  As the consultants are in the driving seat for admissions that raises a number of questions, particularly given the volume of admissions over the period of the flu epidemic. Do the statistics denote a lack of competence amongst the highest paid group of workers in the public service?  It should be remembered that some of them are topping the £250,000 per year mark. Do the statistics suggest that some consultants were packing the wards?  We will have to wait for the conclusion of the analysis by the Eastern Health Board to get answers to those questions.  I wait that analysis with interest.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of the consultant's operations which warrant attention. There are close on 1,100 consultants in the country and their total take from the health service last year was almost £100 million.  There is something extraordinarily perverse about 1,100 people sharing £100 million in one year.  There are many honourable consultants who do <Col N="1150" /> not lace their pockets.  I am aware of one consultant, a professor, who will not accept any fees from private patients but reverts these back to the teaching hospital or the institution where he is available. He is an exception.  I do not doubt that consultants work hard but I doubt that they work as hard at their public sector services as they do in their private practice.  There was a ray of familiarity in the cases highlighted in one of the British &ldquo;quality&rdquo; newspapers recently. That newspaper highlighted abuses in the British NHS by consultants.  Any Deputy who is honest will recognise that those allegations had a disturbing ring of truth. The suggestion was made that there should be an audit of consultants over there.  That is long overdue in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Gleeson Committee are looking into the pay and conditions of consultants and I do not wish to anticipate recommendations that will be brought by that group.  One thing I would like to see would be a new consultants' contract being offered.  I would like that contract to set out in specific, objective and measurable criteria the amount of service consultants will be expected to produce for the large pay they get.  Under such a contract we could judge efficiency.  We would know when the consultants are due in the hospitals and the number of hours they are expected to work there.</P>
    <P>I listened to what Deputy Yates said last night.  While I disagree radically with the way he has behaved in recent times I would not brush off all he said.  For example, I was interested in what he had to say about the use of generic drugs because the Minister told us that he intends going that route.  It was interesting too that he seemed to be unaware that the Minister in the last Government his party supported was the person who was responsible for the cosy deal with the drug companies.  I listened to what Deputy Yates said about institutional changes in the health services.  I would not agree with him in regard to that.  I listened in vain for the Deputy to say anything about consultants.  Would that <Col N="1151" /> have anything to do with the person who now heads their organisation?</P>

      <P>The sponsors of the motion said that they could do better than the Minister.  We have no objective criteria against which to judge the attitude of the minority parties but we do in the case of the two major Opposition parties, the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party. In all truth they cannot say that they would do better because in the past they most definitely did not.  This point has been taken up by some of the minority Opposition parties and I will not pursue it but if one looks at their past performance one will see that they do not have the cure-all available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not open any in County Wicklow.  The Fine Gael cure-all for this problem is to produce another State-sponsored body.  This is an institutional matter and something on which I would like to spend the next three or four minutes before passing over to Deputy Flood.  That party has a touching faith in State-sponsored bodies.  At present Deputy O'Keeffe is promoting a State-sponsored body to replace the Land Registry, admittedly it could not do a whole lot worse.  The idea has surfaced from time to time.  Every time we have a problem in any public sector institution <Col N="1152" /> in this country Fine Gael suggests a State-sponsored body.  What does this mean? It needs teasing out because the facts are that the Deputy opposite &mdash; Deputy Yates &mdash; has never spelt out how a non-commercial State-sponsored body would improve the public health services.</P>
      <P>Let us look at what a non-commercial State-sponsored body would do.  The fundamental reason we have established non-commercial State-sponsored bodies is to free areas of administration from ministerial responsibility.  Thus we free them from answerability to Dáil Éireann. If Deputy Yates does not know this, there are people in his party who know it, and I would refer him to the book which was written some 20 years ago on the subject by Deputy Garret FitzGerald.  The idea is that the State-sponsored body frees the day-to-day operating managers from &ldquo;political interference and allows them to get on with the task&rdquo;.  There are other advantages organisationally and in terms of personnel.  However, the central issue is freedom from ministerial responsibility and freedom from answerability to Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>Does any Deputy believe that if total democratic answerability is removed from the State-sponsored bodies in day-to-day matters, that would improve our health services?  I do not think so.  Would any Deputy, for example, Deputy Bell &mdash; be willing to accept a situation where he could not ask a question about a matter that concerns him in a hospital or in a health centre in his constituency? No, he would not accept it.  I would not accept it in my constituency and neither would Deputy Yates in Wexford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an ill-thought-through proposal and one which would have disastrous bureaucratising influences on health services. It is easy for people to come forward with meaningless suggestions such as this.  I do not want to go over all the failures of past Ministers for Health because that is fundamentally arid.  I do not suggest that the present Minister for Health has all the answers immediately. Of course he does not, he is human.  Some of the suggestions he has made will work and others will not but, at least, he is <Col N="1153" /> making an honest effort.  The attitude of this whole debate was well summed up in a recent edition of the <i>Irish Medical News</i> dated Monday 15 January in an article by David Nowlan in which he said:</P>
    <P>Only the Minister, his Department and the health board executives, it seemed, were actually trying to analyse and understand the situation.  While the shouting went on around them they were trying ... I thought that they held their nerve well and they did considerably more for the patients than most of the roaring opponents.</P>
    <P>That is the case.  Which Deputy in the Opposition had the generosity, a few minutes ago &mdash; I think it was Deputy Foxe &mdash; to say that he believed that the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, was a good man.  I believe he is a good man.  I believe he is an extremely good Minister.  I believe that if we searched the whole 166 of us and if we were honest with ourselves we would not get from amongst our membership a better Minister. He is a Minister who has a difficult and arduous task.  There is no doubt in my mind that there are problems now in the health services and there are other problems to be solved, but I have every confidence in the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, that if the problems are solved they will be solved by him. One thing is absolutely certain; they will never be solved by the spokesperson on health from the leading Opposition party, who clearly has shown in all his antics over the last few weeks not just a disregard for truthfulness, not just a disregard for facts but a total and an absolute incompetence to deal with health issues.  I now concede my remaining time to Deputy Flood.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>In the short time available <Col N="1154" /> to me I want to stress some of the positive developments that have taken place in the health service over the last number of years.  None of us would deny that when the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, took over in 1987 there was a problem relating essentially to funding. It must be said that he did inherit a very substantial bill of £55 million from the health boards over the previous two years.  Much of the blame for this overrun has been put on the health boards.  I should like to point out that under the 1970 Act the Minister is specifically empowered to deal with such a situation and, quite frankly, any Minister would have to take serious account of the fact that health boards decide on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis to overrun their particular allocations. I do not think that should have been allowed to happen then, and I do not think it should be allowed to happen now.  The Minister for Health has the responsibility for ensuring that it does not happen.</P>
      <P>Over the past two years in particular, once the Minster was able to come to grips with what had been, in certain areas at least, duplication and over-expenditure, he is now entering into a phase, certainly over the past nine months, of developing the health service as he outlined to us in his excellent contribution to the debate last night.  We cannot ignore the fact that the Department of Health is a very substantial spending Department where almost 22 per cent of Government expenditure goes; nor can we ignore the fact that there is an increase of £120 million allowed for in 1990, an increase of almost 10 per cent.  To be fair to contributors from the Opposition many of them have rightly said that the problems in the health service cannot be solved simply by throwing money at the service.  That is a correct approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I respect the right of individual contributors here to put forward their various contributions in a largely constructive way.  I do not think the time of this House should be wasted in entering into argument and detailed differences across the floor of this House in an attempt to score political points.  That is not helpful in the <Col N="1155" /> present situation in the health services. For that reason I welcome wholeheartedly the contribution of the Minister for Health last night.  He indicated that he would have to look at the operation of the acute hospitals, that he would introduce a number of initiatives in the immediate future, thus building on what has happened over the past year.</P>
    <P>I believe this is the correct way forward to deal with the reorganisation and strengthening of the health services.  I should say that any suggestion coming from any quarter that the health service can be improved by simply throwing additional sums of money willy nilly at the service is not helpful to the development and strengthening of our health service.</P>
    <P>Waiting lists, which are a positive example of the Minister's work over the past year particularly in terms of joint replacements, have come in for a considerable amount of criticism.  Many people have forgotten that the Minister, on his own initiative, did take steps to improve facilities at Cappagh Hospital whereby additional theatres were brought into operation in an effort to reduce the waiting lists, so that at the end of 1989 the list stood at 2,316, and 63 per cent of those on the list were waiting for less than one year.  That was a positive development on the part of the Minister. The additional expenditure in the dental services is going in the right direction. His demand that the health services look at their efficiency is correct.  The bringing in of outside expertise, possibly for the first time, since the health boards were set up, is a positive approach.  With all these initiatives being taken over the next three or four years we will see a dramatic improvement in the operation of the health boards.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am anxious to see details of the capital programme for the next five years because even now some of the hospitals are archaic; they are badly designed, lacking facilities for visitors, lacking theatre facilities.  It is time that these were looked at in the context of the <Col N="1156" /> capital programme which the Minister is to announce.</P>
    <P>I believe we are going in the right direction. We need to look at the health service in a calm and rational way.  There is little point in people trotting out individual cases and holding them up as examples of how our health service is run.  Because of the numbers going through the health service there will always be individual complaints, but they are not representative of the operation of the health service as a whole.  This debate has contributed something to calming the situation as far as the health service is concerned.  In the years ahead we will see the trojan efforts of the Minister for Health bear fruit and there will be a service available to all who need it.</P>

      <P>Over the last three years there has been a sinister development under the Minister's unsteady hand of a two-tiered health service for the first time in the history of the State, one for the rich and wealthy where health services are available freely on demand and one for the unfortunate and under-privileged people who, by virtue of their social and economic circumstances, have been relegated to the status of second class citizens. The service, in some instances, is comparable to a Third World health service run by a third rate Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister portrays a simplistic scenario in answer to every conceivable problem. He portrays a frightening lack of comprehension of the gravity of the situation. I have no particular pleasure in, day after day, week after week, month after month highlighting the gross injustices that exist in the Fianna Fáil health service. I take no pleasure in castigating a <Col N="1157" /> fellow general practitioner, in calling into question the veracity of each and every one of his statements.  Both of us were educated in the same medical school; both of us were trained in the same hospital; both of us chose the same speciality, family medicine.  Both of us have chosen a career in politics; thankfully we have different political beliefs.</P>
    <P>I believe that all people in this country should be treated equally and fairly, especially in the area of medicare.  All people should, as a birthright, have access to a caring and considerate health service, regardless of their financial status.  I believe, as do the majority of people that the Fianna Fáil health service under the care of the Minister has deteriorated rapidly.  What the Minister has achieved in his short reign as Minister for Health is morally and socially unjust and against all the principles of a caring, Christian society.</P>
    <P>The Minister's introductory speech last night is a hyped-up PR document, if ever I saw one.  It is easy to discern what was written by the Department of Health.  It is easier again to discern what was written by the Minister's dirty tricks department and still easier to discern what was written by the Bunny Carr organisation.  It is still easier to see what was written by the Minister's advisers.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated what brought him into politics.  He talked about the physical and psychological fears caused by sickness. He talked about his concern for patients' fear over the lack of vital treatment. He says that his patients taught him that fear of sickness makes one less able to cope.  He says that his patients taught him that old people are a valuable and precious resource and that a decent society cares for its old people.  That just does not wear.  The Minister said that he learned to admire the courage of people in the face of pain.  He says, once again, that he learned to admire their courage in the face of death.</P>
    <P>I have some illustrations of what is going on in the real world, the world outside this House, the world outside the Department of Health, what is happening in the acute hospital system, the <Col N="1158" /> paediatric and maternity system, the geriatric, the psychiatric and the dental health systems.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech was a litany of pious hypocrisy and sanctimonious sham, the likes of which I have never heard in my life.  One would think to listen to this hyped-up PR document that there is no two to three years waiting list for ENT operations.  One would think that we have an excellent school health service when the reverse is the truth &mdash; the service is grossly understaffed and underutilised. Surely prevention and early detection of illness, as the Minister knows as a general practitioner, should be the aim of a caring and efficient service.  The Minister and his advisers, however, obviously do not think so.  One would think that routine post-natal services had not been cancelled.  One would think that there is now no two to three year waiting list for cataract and hip operations.  One would think that last December there was not a cancellation of all elective admissions to the Mater Hospital on the north side of this city.  &mdash; and I will now state the obvious because I feel that for Fianna Fáil it has to be stated &mdash; with the exception of those listed for cardiac surgery, cataract surgery and oncology treatment.</P>
    <P>Unfortunate sick people in a poor state of health who for many months have undergone major psychological stress, who are concerned and worried about their health, now find that because of mismanagement by the Government they will not be admitted to hospital, have psyched themselves up to go into hospital in the first place.  One would think we have an excellent physiotherapy service on the north side of Dublin; the reality, as every GP on the north side of the city knows, seemingly with the exception of the Minister and his secret advisers, is that it is not available to GPs.  One would think, to listen to the Minister, that we had an excellent and efficient and caring geriatric service and that there is no shortage of beds.  Daily in my work I see the anguish, the pain, the suffering inflicted not only on the unfortunate patients but also on their immediate families who are ill-equipped and ill-advised <Col N="1159" /> and unable to cope with the situation. One would think that we have an excellent chiropody service.  I have seen, in the last year, the development of a rare disease in medicine.  It evolved under Fianna Fáil and it is called &ldquo;Fianna Fáil toenail&rdquo;.  The Department have reduced the chiropody services available to the elderly to three times a year.  Many of the elderly and partially blind, obese, suffering with arthritis.  They need to have their feet treated at least once a month but because of what the Minister. has done they now have to pay for these treatments at a minimum cost of £10 per treatment.  Surely that is not the hallmark of a caring Government.</P>
    <P>This morning I left this House and went out to visit a patient of mine in a convalescent hospital not three miles from here, quite near my home.  There were 12 beds in that ward where normally there would be five.  I had to pull beds out of my way to examine patients.  I had an elderly patient last week whose sister was taken to hospital.  He has severe Parkinson's disease and severe arthritis and is very unsteady on his feet.  Could the geriatric services take him?  No.  He had to stay at home for seven days.  Baggot Street said they had no beds; Linden said they had no beds and St. Mary's said they had no beds.  Fortunately, I got that patient into hospital yesterday.  That is the kind of service we have.  Fianna Fáil said before the last election that health cuts hurt the old, the sick and the handicapped.</P>
    <P>Finally, four close friends of my family were very seriously injured in a car accident. One ambulance was despatched from the regional hospital in Galway, eight miles away.  The ambulancemen who came to the scene of the accident were excellent but one of the victims was left bleeding in the back of a car for two hours because an ambulance could not be provided.  The patient was taken into the Regional Hospital in Galway&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of this opportunity to express my opinion on the current crisis in the health service.  If one was to believe the utterances from the benches across the way, one would believe that there was some political benefit to be gained from whipping up an imaginary crisis in the health service.  The Minister and the Government would do well to consider where the criticisms of their policies are coming from.  These criticisms are not emanating from the benches of the Opposition only; they are also emanating from people working in the front line services of the health service, hospital staff, patients and members of the public.</P>
      <P>It appears the arithmetic will ensure that the Minister for Health will survive this no confidence motion tonight. However, I believe the public have lost confidence in the Minister for Health, which is far more serious.  I believe also that Members on the Government benches, who are not allowed to give full vent to their frustration at the level of service being provided by the Minister, have also lost confidence in him.  I appeal to the Minister to listen to what is being said by Fianna Fáil representatives on county councils and health boards.  As late as last Monday at a meeting of the Southern Health Board, the views of the Fianna Fáil members were quite apparent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister would like us to believe that the current difficulties in the health service are due solely to the flu epidemic but the reality is that this crisis has bean building up under his stewardship for the past three years.  Since the Minister will survive this vote of no confidence, one can only hope that something positive will emerge from this debate and that <Col N="1161" /> the genuine concerns being expressed by Members on all sides will be taken on board by the Minister in an attempt to resolve these problems.</P>
    <P>I want to deal specifically with the problems of the health service as they manifest themselves in the Southern Health Board area with which I am most familiar.  There are now 1,000 fewer staff and 500 fewer beds in the Southern Health Board area than there were in 1987.  Anybody who argues that the quality or quantity of the service being provided in these circumstances can remain as it was in 1987 is not in touch with reality.</P>
    <P>As my colleague, Deputy Lee, said the slogans used by Fianna Fáil in the 1987 general election stated that &ldquo;Health cuts hurt the old, the sick and the handicapped vote Fianna Fáil; there is a better way&rdquo;. We are still looking for this better way but there are no signs that the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, has got an iota of how to provide a better way for the health services.  As they say, as you sow, so shall you reap.  During the 1987 election campaign the public were led to expect a better service, but the reality fell far short of that, and the Minister reaped his reward in the 1989 general election.  During that election campaign the Taoiseach said he was not aware of the extent of the problems in the health service, and it appears that to date he is still not aware of the extent of those problems.</P>
    <P>I want to briefly outline the difficulties in the health service in the Southern Health Board area.  I have a document in front of me which was submitted by the Southern Health Board to the Department of Health outlining their requirements for 1990 in order to maintain their level of service at 1989 levels.  The shortfall in the allocation <i>vis-à-vis</i> the requirement is £3.35 million.  I believe this highlights the extent to which the Minister is not aware or in charge of what is happening in his Department.  The Southern Health Board have an obligation to pay the 26th pay round but there is a shortfall of £200,000 in their allocation. <Col N="1162" /> The Southern Health Board are in possession of all the facts on the numbers employed in their organisation, yet the Minister has refused to accept that reality.  This is indicative of the Minister's lack of knowledge of the requirements and problems facing not alone the Southern Health Board but every health board.</P>
    <P>Despite the Minister's contentions, the Southern Health Board are facing their third year of cutbacks under his stewardship. The ironic thing about this is that in the letter outlining the health board's allocation the Minister asked them to build up the services as they affect the elderly and the handicapped and to improve the AIDS programme.  If adequate funds were forthcoming the Southern Health Board would not be found wanting in that regard.</P>
    <P>The problems of the Southern Health Board are also being faced by the nation as a whole.  The problem with our health service is that it is hospital orientated. There is little reward for good health and little hope for the sick.  When the cutbacks in nursing staff and beds are coupled with the reductions in community care we get a very dangerous combination. This Government have got the cart before the horse.  If they want to cut hospital services they have to put the resources into the community.  That is where they have failed.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that the embargo on recruitment has been lifted, but there is only one district health nurse for 7,000 members of the population in the Southern Health Board area whereas the recommended average is one district health nurse per 2,500 people.  The embargo may have been lifted but the resources being made available to the Southern Health Board are not adequate to even consider recruiting other staff. Numerous other key personnel posts need to be filled to remedy some of the worst cutbacks in the Southern Health Board area over the past number of years, but little hope has been emanating from the Minister or the Department in this respect.</P>

      <P>I appreciate your efforts, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to facilitate us particularly since the Labour Party played such a major role in having this debate structured properly.  Our spokesman on health, Deputy Howlin, tried to depersonalise the debate away from the Minister because we all respect the Minister as a person.  However, we cannot ignore the fact that the Government have collective responsibility for the administration of all Departments, including the Department of Health.  Irrespective of the constraints which may be placed on the Department of Health by Government borrowing, budgeting or whatever, no priority is being given to the health services.  In fact, there has been a continuing drop in health funding in real terms as a percentage of GNP every year since the Government took office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When most of the members of the Government were in Opposition, they were involved in a nationwide campaign of vilification of the then Labour Party Minister for Health, Mr. Barry Desmond. Fianna Fáil Members led campaigns of assault, both physical and verbal, on Mr. Barry Desmond, when he visited my constituency of south Tipperary to open a new psychiatric unit in St. Luke's Hospital.  There are television reports on this incident.  At that time, he referred, in principle, to the report on the psychiatric services, <i>Planning for the Future,</i> which had as its aim the closure of outdated psychiatric beds and advocated care and treatment for patients in the community.  On the day he visited my constituency, Mr. Barry Desmond publicly stated that neither he nor the then Government had any plans for the closure of acute or sub-acute hospitals in that region, or in any part of the country.  He was striving, at that time when there were Fialla Fáil dominated health boards, to bring some order into spending.  In spite of that campaign of vilification, he never lost a hospital bed, a nurse's post or a patient.  Immediately on assuming office <Col N="1164" /> Fianna Fáil, who still had a majority on the health boards, set about their dirty tricks campaign with the closure of hospitals in their book-keeping exercise. They closed five hospitals in the south east region; they closed acute beds in St. Joseph's and Our Lady's in Cashel and a sub-acute hospital in Tipperary town. When he was later blamed for allowing health boards dominated by Fianna Fáil to overspend one CO publicly stated on RTE &mdash; and I have a transcript of his statement &mdash; that they expected the economy to improve.  Under the Fianna Fáil Government all the health boards were whipped into voting to close these hospitals and to cut back on dental care, ophthalmic care, transport for medical card holders and other services.</P>
    <P>When the sub-acute hospital in Tippeary town was closed, the community, led by the then co-adjutor Bishop of Cashel and Emily, Dr. Clifford, went to the High Court.  Before we arrived at the High Court, the Minister for Health signed an order agreeing to the closure of the hospital but only a few days ago he listed the hospital as still being open. Of course it is still open but only as a day care centre being run by voluntary associations who provide an excellent service.  In the recent past we needed a hospital urgently.  Just for the record, that health centre was going to be provided anyway.  The health board purchased a site from the urban council but it is now a white elephant as they are not going to construct anything on it.  They reopened this hospital as a day care centre to be run by the voluntary associations.</P>
    <P>The closure of hospitals, such as St. Vincent's Hospital, has led to a critical shortage of beds in acute hospitals not only in south Tipperary but throughout the country.  This has resulted in pressure being brought to bear for early discharges which is not without risk.  Elderly patients in particular are being discharged back into the community without any community care.  Geriatric beds are at a premium with the result that these elderly people now have to wait for people to die in geriatric hospitals, assessment units or <Col N="1165" /> in welfare homes before they can have any hope of getting a hospital bed.</P>
    <P>Let me now refer to the ambulance service.  I have in front of me a letter from a person, which I can give to the Minister, who recently broke his leg.  It was considered to be an emergency case and he was admitted to hospital where his leg was put in plaster of Paris.  This person who is a medical card holder and who came to hospital by ambulance was then told to find his own way home.  In another case the relatives of a seriously ill person who looked for an acute hospital bed for him in Clonmel were told he could not have a hospital bed and that an ambulance could not be sent to collect him but that if they were willing to take a taxi they could try to have him admitted to the psychiatric hospital.  Unfortunately, when they arrived there they were told to go to St. Luke's Hospital and from there to St. John's Hospital but again there was no room for the patient.  They then went back to the acute hospital where they were reminded that they had been told there was no bed for him but that hospital kindly rang the psychiatric hospital where he was later admitted and put to bed. The doctor at the hospital wanted a letter from the GP before admitting the patient but the relatives did not have any such letter.  They then went back to the doctor and returned to the hospital with the letter only to find that the patient had been discharged.  He had been taken by ambulance back home.  After much deliberation he was taken back to the acute hospital where he was finally admitted. He died the following morning.  No wonder my colleague, Seán Lyons in Clonmel, is looking for an investigation into the circumstances surrounding that tragedy where a man was in and out of five hospitals, four of which were psychiatric even though he was not a psychiatric patient.</P>
    <P>Similar examples can be given by other Members of this House.  Deputy Taylor has statistics on the dental service which show that there is a waiting list of 11,000 adolescents in the Eastern Health Board region.  There is a crisis, yet the Minister <Col N="1166" /> tries to tell us otherwise.  I have before me a number of newspaper headlines.  For example, the headline in a recent edition of <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> reads &ldquo;Operations hit by Anaesthetists Crisis&rdquo; and the headline in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 1 February &ldquo;Bed Shortage Forces 50 Per Cent Cut in Heart Operations&rdquo;.  Neither of those headlines were drawn up by the Labour Party.  Then there was the headline in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> of 4 February to a report on a Southern Health Board meeting which read &ldquo;Dying Patients Sent Home&rdquo;.  The report stated that Councillor Jackie Healy Rae of Kerry said, in claiming that some patients were being hunted out of hospitals before they were fit to be discharged, that people were scared.  Jackie Healy Rae is a Fianna Fáil councillor, a former chairman of the health board and an advocate of the Minister.</P>

      <P>Last night I listened to a litany of promises.  The Minister promised that there will be a further investigation, that a further review committee will be set up.  This will have serious consequences for every CEO and every programme manager as they will find they have another review group looking over their shoulder to see whether they are overspending, even if they do occasionally make excuses for the Government.  I am saying there is a crisis and that the sooner the Minister puts into effect some of the recommendations in the reports which have been published, the sooner we can stop calling on him to resign and start telling the old, the sick and the handicapped not to worry about Fiann Fáil posters.  We may then believe <Col N="1167" /> that something will be done to resolve this crisis.  We are not the ones who started the scare.  We have tried to act responsibly.  For the past three years we have been consistent and are now calling for action.  Regardless of the way the vote goes the Minister will still have to address the problem.</P>

      <P>I rise to support the motion before the House because in my long years in public life, almost 30 years, I have never before experienced the volume of complaints I have received in recent months about the inadequacy of the health service.  It is a sad experience to have to take up the telephone to listen to the pleas of family members concerning some member of their family who is in urgent need of hospitalisation.  It is even sadder to have to listen to the person concerned, the victim, who in many instances is in severe pain, appealing to their public representative to try to have them admitted to hospital to obtain whatever medical attention they require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have received many complaints from people who are waiting for overdue hip operations.  Often these people are in indescribable pain and agony and unable to move.  The same is true in respect of other categories of illness.  Where the service has fallen down badly is in the provision of a hospital service for the elderly who need hospital treatment. Those who do gain admission invariably find they are being treated in a corridor. They might as well be out on a public street.  When I recently visited our own county hospital in Kilkenny, St. Luke's Hospital, I found that the corridors, particularly in the female wing, were packed tight with beds.  Many of the patients found themselves in hospital for the first time in their 60, 70 or 80 years of life.  The first time anyone goes to hospital is a traumatic experience but to find oneself out in a corridor receiving medical attention with a steady stream of visitors to other patients passing nearby is anything but dignified.  This problem has got much worse in recent times.  As my colleague, Deputy Ferris, has said, it <Col N="1168" /> has become a major issue.  It became a major issue during the 1987 general election campaign and it is an issue on which one could safely say Fianna Fáil got into Government.  During the last general election campaign the Taoiseach admitted that he was not aware of the problems in the health service.  We want to make quite sure now that he is fully aware of the present problems.  I make a special appeal for the additional hospital beds for the elderly who need them.</P>
    <P>This Government's policy, and that of the previous Fianna Fáil Government, directly caused the closure of seven district hospitals in the south-east region, and they made absolutely no provision for care in the community.  It is no wonder that now there is this tremendous problem which is causing so much hardship.  I appeal to the Minister, if he survives this vote this evening, to arrange, as quickly as possible for at least some of those hospitals to be reopened.  Above all, he should be sure that no further such hospitals, be they in the south-east or anywhere else, close.  I understand St. Mary's Geriatric Hospital in Drogheda is under threat.  The Minister should intervene personally there to see that it does not close.  This is the least that could be done for people who have given their whole lives to the service of this country in one way or another.  At the end of the day, they should not be told there is no place for them and, in other words, the quicker they get out of the way the better.</P>
    <P>I want to place a few comments on record.  Government speakers here tonight have tried to say the cause of this problem was overspending by the previous Minister.</P>

      <P>I refer the House to the Minister's own motion which he moved in this House on 27 May 1986, as reported in the Official Report column 189, volume 367.  Deputy O'Hanlon's motion stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1169" /> That Dáil Éireann warns the Government that the lives and the health of members of the public are now at risk in many areas because of the dismantling of the health services and calls for the immediate restoration of adequate funding to health boards and hospitals as a matter of extreme urgency.</P>
    <P>The Minister, a few short years ago, was alarming the people, warning that their lives were in danger.  If they were in danger four years ago, they are in very grave danger now.  Similarly, another Government supporter, Deputy O'Connell, stated, as reported at column 215 of the same volume, and in the same debate, and I quote:</P>
    <P>I never cease to smile when I hear Ministers get up to speak.  This Minister is perpetually in cloud cuckooland. He has the audacity to come in here tonight and tell us that the health services are normal and that he has provided adequate finance for them.</P>
    <P>If that was a reference to the previous Minister &mdash; which it was &mdash; it can be multiplied many times over with the present Minister.  These are just a few collective quotes.  The present Minister when he was spokesman in Opposition never ceased at Question Time to ask the then Minister, Deputy Desmond, to provide extra funding for this, extra funding for that, you name it.  He had a parliamentary question down on any matter he could think of.</P>
    <P>On 28 May 1986 the present Minister said, and I quote from column 500 of the same volume: &ldquo;I cannot understand how any Minister can come in and tell us we have a good service when the most vulnerable in the State are suffering.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He said that four years ago.  Matters have become infinitely worse since then. The same man, now Minister, said on 11 February 1986, and I quote from column 363, in reference to the then proposed closure of the district hospital in Roscrea:</P>
    <P>How much thought went into the needs and care of patients when the decision was made to axe the district <Col N="1170" /> hospital in Roscrea?  If we are committed to the transfer of resources from hospital care to community care, as all parties say they are, surely it is an integral part of community care to keep a small district hospital in a town like Roscrea ...</P>
    <P>Of course, the Minister, barely two years after that, proceeded to close district hospitals all over the place.</P>
    <P>I have not attacked the present Minister personally but a feature of those debates, as my colleague, Deputy Ferris, said, was personal abuse.  Deputy Nolan said and I quite from the Official Report of 12 February 1986, column 2522, volume 363:</P>
    <P>I am glad to have this opportunity of registering my protest at the action of the Minister for Health ... I do not think I would be out of order in accusing the Minister of being mad but I shall not do so because that would result in your not allowing me to be here at 8.30 to register my protest by way of my vote.  However, I must question the sanity of some of the Deputies on the other side.</P>

      <P>It is clear to me that Labour and Fine Gael policy is still as barren as it was when they were last in Government.  They let the services drift into financial chaos then and they have no constructive policies to follow now beyond throwing out a few well-worn cliches, a point that has not been lost on the journalists reporting their contributions. The contribution from the Opposition benches has been a contribution of the shroud waving which my much maligned ministerial colleague, Deputy O'Hanlon, refered to in his speech.  He has set out clearly, in a strategic plan, the direction in which he sees the health services going in 1990 and beyond.  I challenge the Opposition to do the same and stop making outlandish generalisations about the services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The allegation was made here last night that beds in Cavan hospital were &ldquo;chained up&rdquo;.  A quick telephone call to the North-Eastern Health Board would have put Deputy Boylan right.  The board opened 48 medical and 48 surgical beds when they transferred services to the new hospital at Lisdarn in Cavan.  Twelve beds were left unopened at the time because they were not required.  Those additional beds were then available to meet the increased demand which resulted from the 'flu epidemic, even though listening <Col N="1172" /> to Deputy Boylan last night you would think the people of Cavan and Monaghan were spared the 'flu epidemic.  I know Deputy O'Hanlon is an excellent Minister for Health but it would be far too much to expect him to quarantine the people of Cavan and Monaghan from the 'flu epidemic.  The North-Eastern Health Board have refuted any suggestion that people were forced to lock wards or chain beds.  This sort of unfounded allegations cause nothing but harm and distress to the staff and patients in these excellent hospitals and I think Deputy Boylan should withdraw them forthwith.</P>
    <P>The same Deputy raised the position of a 91-year old woman in Cavan General Hospital who was admitted on 19 January with a suspected peptic ulcer.  She had a third check-up and was given medication and has now recovered.  She suggested to the management of Cavan hospital that they contact her nephew who should be asked to take her home.  An arrangement was made with the nephew, a time was agreed, the nephew failed to turn up and, lo and behold, an hour later who should be on the telephone suggesting that she should be left in the general hospital but the bold Deputy Boylan?  It is time he got his facts right and that he came into this House, told the facts and withdrew any allegations about the outstanding staff in that hospital.</P>
    <P>Health expenditure has grown consistently over the past three decades. Expenditure has grown to over 65 times its 1960 level over a period of 30 years. When we deflate these figures to allow for inflation we can see that spending on our health services has increased in real terms by a factor of over five-and-a-half times during this period.</P>
    <P>Health care accounts for about one-fifth of Exchequer spending and it was, therefore, inevitable that the health sector had to carry its share of the burden. In particular, I would like to pay tribute to the staff in the various hospitals and to take this opportunity to thank all the staff in the health services who coped so admirably with the recent 'flu epidemic, <Col N="1173" /> thanks to their dedication and commitment. An eminent consultant physician has felt it necessary to write to the Minister for Health because, to qoute him: &ldquo;of the superabundance of hysteria being generated&rdquo; about hospital beds at the moment.  He acknowledged that a viral epidemic, as confirmed to the Minister by Professor Irene Hillary of the Virus Reference Laboratory, was the cause of the unusual demands on hospital beds in December and that this demand was not the result of a breakdown of the health services.  The Minister has been saying this time and again but the Opposition prefer to ignore medical facts, as we have seen so often in the past, and particularly in this debate.  The emphasis for the past three years has been on streamlining services, seeking out inefficiencies, increasing productivity and protecting key services.</P>
    <P>With the success of the Government's overall economic strategy, resources are now becoming available to address priority needs and the last six months have seen significant moves in that direction. There have been three significant boosts to health funding since last summer.  Firstly, the 1989 Supplementary Estimate allocated an additional £15 million to deal with specific priority areas in the acute hospital services.  The Minister for Health himself gave a prior commitment on this on 24 June, and this was subsequently sanctioned by the present Government on 18 July 1989.  Second, the health provision in the 1990 Estimates showed an increase of £120 million, or almost 10 per cent in non-capital expenditure on the health services for 1990 as compared to the original 1989 provision. Finally, last week's budget allocated a further £13 million, including £5 million for services for the elderly, £3 million for the dental services, £2 million for the mental handicap services and over £3 million for substantial increases in the various health allowances from next July.</P>
    <P>The measures which have been announced show clearly the Government's determination that whatever additional resources can be made available must go to the priority areas of greatest <Col N="1174" /> need &mdash; in particular to the strengthening of community-based support services.</P>
    <P>The Opposition parties have used figures which attempt to prove that there has been a real reduction in the funding available to the health services since the present Minister took office in 1987. However, the reality is that since 1986, and including the recent budget measures, there has been an increase of around £200 million in gross non-capital expenditure on the health services.</P>

      <P>To listen to Deputy De Rossa's claim that all OECD countries are spending an average of 8 per cent of their GNP on health, one would imagine that Ireland is way out of line.

      <P>The consumer price index is often used as a proxy in determining the real level of health expenditure. While this index can be used as a guideline it is of limited value in making year-on-year comparisons.</P>
      <P>The index does not reflect the true growth in health service costs as, for example, it is significantly affected by movements in interest rates.  These movements have a lesser effect on the health services as interest payments represent a relatively small proportion of total expenditure.  Similarly the movement in energy costs have a much greater impact on the consumer price index than on total health expenditure.</P>
      <P>There has also been much ill-informed comment on the percentages of gross national product and gross domestic product devoted to the health services. At a time when there is vigorous growth in GNP as a result of favourable economic trends, it does not follow that maintaining percentages of GNP expenditure, on health services is necessary to preserve services at existing levels.  This is borne out by the fact that although it is generally accepted that significant additional resources have been made available to the health services in 1990 as compared to 1989, health expenditure is still likely to show a slight decline when expresed as a percentage of GNP.</P>

Using this criterion it could be inferred that health services in the United States are therefore more comprehensive than our own.  We know, however, that this is not all the case in reality.  Indeed, the Commission on Health Funding considered these points in their deliberations over a two-year period and concluded that the level of expenditure which this country devotes on health care cannot <Col N="1177" /> be determined by reference to a fixed proportion of gross domestic product or by reference to international comparison. It is not true, as is so often claimed, that during the period of the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition health expenditure was maintained as a percentage of GNP.

      <P>I would like to acknowledge the role played by the nursing profession as a core component of the Irish health services at all times.  The professionalism and selfless dedication of nurses in the provision of care, sometimes, under trying conditions, is deeply <Col N="1179" /> appreciated and the capacity of the profession to influence the general thrust of health service delivery has been recognised.</P>
      <P>The high regard in which Irish nurses are held world-wide bears testimony to the quality both of Irish nursing and nurse training in Ireland.  The fact that the skills of Irish nurses have become extremely marketable abroad provides us with continuing evidence of this fact.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another aspect, however, to this high profile.  In the course of 1989, much media attention was focussed on the supposed outflow of specialist nursing skills from this country and the impact which this outflow would have on the domestic health service.</P>

      <P>Upon investigation it was found that hard information which would substantiate or disprove these claims was simply not available.  In the absence of such information, much of the comment must be treated as highly speculative and unhelpful, both in terms of the image of the public health system and in terms of the morale of the many highly trained and dedicated nurses, who continue to work in Ireland.</P>
      <P>This lack of information has prompted a decision to create an accurate database of available nursing skills.  An Bord Altranais are therefore to undertake a national skills audit and census of practising nurses.</P>
      <P>This audit, when completed, will, for the first time, provide an accurate picture of the extent and variety of skills and qualifications which are currently available amongst practising health services personnel and identify these skills which are in short supply.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Health service management will then be in a position to take appropriate steps to remedy the situation. Health service management at both local and national level will be afforded an invaluable aid in the organising of staff in a manner which will give the best value from available resources.</P>
      <P>Although the audit and census will be of tremendous assistance in the effective utilisation of existing resources, the questions of providing for future needs has wider implications for training and education for the nursing profession.  This question is now being addressed by An Bord Altranais who undertook, towards the end of 1989, to carry out a review of all aspects of nursing education and training with a view to putting in place a structure which will equip nurses with the appropriate skills to address the needs of a modern demanding health service.</P>
      <P>The impact of both of these initiatives of future planning of nursing services and needs cannot be under-estimated.  The availability of a comprehensive, accurate, database in tandem with a modern education system for the nursing profession will certainly facilitate the rational future development of this core component of our health service.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the Department of Health are constantly monitoring, in a structured way, the personnel needs of the services, both as regards numbers of staff and skills required.  This is evidenced by the fact that some 50 per cent of the over 1,000 additional permanent appointments approved in 1984 were in the nursing area.  This approval is also reflected in the similar representation of nursing posts among the almost 4,000 replacement posts approved in 1989.  The selection of the replacement posts from competing boards was specifically designed to target front-line needs and specialist nursing skills.  We are further confident that, with the Minister's action plan in position, a further re-allocation of priority nursing resources should be possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like also to make reference to <Col N="1181" /> many uninformed and, often mischievous, views which have been expressed regarding administration of the health services.  Some simple points warrant attention&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should tell Jackie Healy Rae.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ferris should tell the Deputies on either side of him. The administrative staff figures include some 400 community welfare officers and other specialist personnel, as well as medical records staff and many others providing direct services to patients; administration accounts for less than 3 per cent of total non-capital expenditure; central administration in the eight health boards accounts for less than 3 per cent of all personnel; the service management tier within health boards accounts for no more than 40 posts, or less than 0.2 per cent of local health staff.</P>
      <P>Various commentators have chosen to characterise this reasonable level of administration as being almost exclusively composed of unnecessary and inefficient office staff.  In point of fact this represents a gross distortion of the actual position and an unwarranted attack on many dedicated staff.  It surprises me that many Deputies who are closely associated with the trade union movement should, even by their silence, give tacit support to this view.</P>
      <P>The reality is that these staff are engaged in tasks which directly relate to patient care in its most basic sense.  They are the people responsible for the organisation and management of medical, surgical and diagnostic appointments; the maintenance of medical records; the provision of secretarial services to consultants and senior management; the payment of staff and suppliers; the issuing of medical and hospital services cards and the general management of an enterprise costing nearly £1.5 billion and employing <i>circa</i> 60,000 people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is ironic that some colleagues of these workers should be among those who criticise their number and commitment. It is unpardonable that many <Col N="1182" /> of these same people place the greatest demands on health services administration.</P>
    <P>However, my colleagues and I will not be deflected from our course of strengthening the management ethos in the health services as was clearly indicated in the contribution of the Minister for Health last evening.</P>

      <P>This is utter nonsense. In my area on 1 January 1990 there were 3,522 children on the waiting list for orthodontic treatment in the Western Health Board.  The board are currently organising treatment for children to reduce these waiting times.  All children are assessed in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Department. Priority in the provision of treatment is given to children with the most serious conditions.  I am happy to say that all children with the most severe conditions are under treatment at present and do not, in general, have to wait for treatment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It will receive a further special allocation from the funds recently provided in the budget.  The mid-west has an outstanding consultant orthodontist. These moneys supplement those already provided by the health board.</P>
      <P>The Western Health Board will be advertising the post of consultant orthodontist in the near future following the review of the conditions attached to the post.  The direct employment of a consultant is considered to be the most cost-effective way of providing this expensive treatment.</P>
      <P>The Minister and I are confident that the additional resources provided last year and in the recent budget will help all the health boards to relieve the situation. We are also hopeful that the posts of consultant orthodontists, which are outstanding, when filled, will offer a long-term solution to the problem of providing this expensive treatment for children with severe orthodontic problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Figures on hospital activity over the last 30 years show a striking increase in the annual number of in-patient admissions.  Between 1960 and 1988 the numbers almost doubled from 250,000 in-patient admissions to over 490,000.  Even when the parallel increase in population is taken into account the admission rates per 1,000 head of population have witnessed steep increases during the past three decades.  A measure of the efficiency of the health services in coping with such unprecedented activity levels can be gleaned from the great strides made in reducing lengths of stay in hospital.  These have been more than halved in the past 25 years, from a figure of over 16 days in 1965 to eight days in 1988.  In 1988 approximately 1.2 million <Col N="1184" /> out-patients and approximately 500,000 in-patients were seen in our hospitals.</P>
      <P>Deputy Howlin misrepresents the real situation.  In early January he stated: &ldquo;At least 20 hospitals have closed since March 1987&rdquo;.  The reality is both less sensational and more complicated.</P>

      <P>The Deputy says that Jervis Street and St. Laurence's hospitals in Dublin have closed.  This can only be called deliberate misrepresentation.  In fact, the services of both hospitals have been transferred to a fully modern hospital at Beaumont which provides hospital care to equal any in Europe.  Is the Deputy arguing that we should close Beaumont and that all the patients there be transferred back to old and now totally unsuitable accommodation on the old sites, if that were possible?  I hope the Deputy is not seriously suggesting this.</P>

      <P>Some of the hospitals to which Deputy Howlin refers as having been closed in Dublin and Cork were small hospitals which contributed to the fragmentation of the hospital services in those areas.  Care of the highest standard cannot be provided in small hospitals.  So, the service in Dr. Steeven's Hospital was transferred to St. James's and the Adelaide Hospitals.

      <P>I would remind the House that a total of £250,000 in national lottery funding was provided to help many of the former hospitals change their role.  Lismore, New Ross, Bagenalstown and Tipperary all received £40,000 each while Kilrush received £90,000.  The provision of these funds shows the commitment of this Government to respond flexibly and appropriately to the demands on the health services.  Some of the hospitals to which Deputy Howlin referred had so few beds open that the need to provide a service of the highest standard and at the best value for money demanded that their services be transferred to regional hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Building on what has been achieved in the health services to date, we can go forward and deal with the real issues and the real problems.  Of course, there are many aspects of the health services which need development but no country in the world is in a position to meet them all. What is important, however, is that we have laid the foundation on which steady progress can be built.  This will be done <Col N="1190" /> not by spending money we do not have but by carefully and efficiently using our resources and reorganising our activities to tackle problems carefully and rationally.</P>
    <P>The Minister last night announced details of what I consider to be an exciting and thoughtful action programme for the health services in 1990 and beyond.  The first tangible evidence of the impact that this action programme will have was contained in last weeks Budget Statement with a very considerable additional resource for the elderly, for the mentally handicapped services and for the dental services.  I have a particular responsibility for dental care and I am very much aware of the problems which exist in that area.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, these budget announcements were merely the first instalment of the Minister's action programme. The other elements include: A detailed evaluation of the scope for greater efficiency in the health services, beginning with the major acute hospitals headed up by Mr. Noel Fox who has played such a major role in the recovery of the VHI's financial position; Mr. David Kennedy, whose reputation and track record speak for themselves, will head up a new initiative to streamline the hospital services in Dublin which, because of their unique role, need special organisational arrangements for maximum effectiveness.</P>
    <P>The content of the action programme, no less than the calm and measured way in which he has dealt with the problems arising over the past three years, mark the knowledge, insight and compassion of Dr. Rory O'Hanlon, our Minister for Health.  In my appointment as Minister of State at the Department of Health, I have had the opportunity to gain a deeper appreciation of his approach to health services, his passionate concern for the quality of care for the patient and his real anger at the denigration of our health services and their dedicated professionals by the thoughtless and malicious scare mongering of Opposition spokesmen. Unfortunately such scare tactics find an uncritical reflection in media comment which not only does a disservice to the <Col N="1191" /> quality and commitment of our health service professionals, but does real harm to patients, striking fear and alarm into the elderly in particular.  Worse still, these alarmists succeed in portraying the problems of meeting rising expectations for health care which exist right around the western world as if they were something unique to Ireland.</P>

      <P>Shortly.  The Minister would have grounds for even deeper anger at the cynical exploitation of the sick and the disabled by the Opposition who, on the one hand, call for more services and more expenditure and on the other say that by waving a magic wand we could do all that needs to be done without spending an extra penny.  The public have seen through this double-think and double-talk.  They recognise that the Minister is in command of the situation, that he is not going to be bullied by vested interest groups or taken in by political con merchants.  With his long political experience and his intimate knowledge of the health service and the needs of patients, he is in an ideal position to chart our course for the development of health care in the future.  His record of achievement in facing up to the unpleasant but inevitable task of bringing services into line with the resources available and the major initiatives which he has announced in the action programme can only serve to inspire confidence in his continued stewardship of the health services.</P>

      <P>The real blight in my constituency has been the total undermining of the county hospital in Ennis since this Minister came to office.  I thought he was a progressive man but last night in his speech he indulged in snide remarks and talked, about scaremongering.  The hospital in Ennis was brought into disrepute both last year and this year, not by the Fine Gael Deputies or the Labour spokesperson, but by the Fianna Fáil councillors who were ably led by Deputy de Valera.  For as long as the Minister remains in office the people of County Clare do not know whether Ennis General Hospital will remain open.  Since he came to power the number of beds in that hospital will remain open.  Since he came to power the number of beds in that hospital has been reduced from 127 to 70.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>After a lot of toing and froing, by agreement with the health board, the number was increased to 78, including six surgical beds.  In August 1988, at the highest of summer, the number of beds occupied was 85.  The statistics on the records of the administration of that hospital show clearly that a wrong decision has been made in the allocation of beds to Ennis General Hospital.</P>
      <P>There is no way I can accept the Minister shaking his head.  In 1989 the overspend in Ennis General Hospital was of the order of £250,000.  In future the health board will have to operate with a cutback of £800,000 and the prospect is that there will be further closures.  The Minister should tell the truth.  He is backing a Government who decided to make major cuts in the hospital area.  They saw a soft political target and they realised that most of the people who got sick were those who would not vote.  They thought that by the time the election was called the people would have forgotten about it.  The real cynicism is over there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance came in here the other day and said that the Government have rectified the economy and that every financial problem has been solved. The Minister for Health and his Minister <Col N="1194" /> of State must give a guarantee to the 90,000 people living in Clare that there will be continuity of service at the county hospital.  Deputy Foxe complained about there being only 60 beds in Roscommon Hospital to cater for 70,000 people in County Roscommon.</P>
    <P>There is competition for skilled staff, particularly general surgeons.  The <i>Irish Medical News</i> the other day contained an advertisement for a general hospital in Newfoundland, hardly the most progressive part of the world.  The hospital concerned had 100 beds, the number the Government promised us in the last general election, when, ironically, Fianna Fáil put forward a hospital candidate. People should note the cynicism and hypocrisy of Fianna Fáil in County Clare where they once had 66 per cent of the vote.  Do they not realise what they are doing to their own party down there?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the time constraint I will confine my remarks to the hospital care situation in Roscommon.  It is not necessarily parochial to speak <Col N="1195" /> about Roscommon Hospital as that hospital reflects the chaos, mayhem and sheer disorder in the health services.</P>
      <P>In political terms Roscommon spoke loudest on the health issue in the last general election.  Notwithstanding that, the Minister has failed to respond to the situation in Roscommon in the same way as he has not responded anywhere else. Worse still, the Minister in response to questions in this House and from the media made misleading and inaccurate statements about this hospital, its over-crowding, its bed complement and its dangerously inadequate staff levels.  I will give the Minister the facts and when he again wishes to comment publicly about the situation in this hospital we hope that accuracy will be the hallmark of what he says even if afterwards he intends to do nothing to improve the situation.</P>
      <P>There are 60 beds in Roscommon Hospital, not 70 as the Minister has repeatedly said.  The Minister promised ten single day beds when the number of beds in this hospital was decimated from 137 to 60 in 1987, but they were never provided because of the savagery of the cuts.  The medical wing in this hospital has 27 beds with an additional eight coronary care beds.  On any average day in recent months on the medical side, excluding coronary care, there have been 40 and sometimes more beds crammed into the space allocated for medical care.  During the day three nurses try to cope with the huge work overload.  By all accepted standards, three nurses are inadequate to look after 27 patients let alone 40 or 44 patients.  Between 6 p.m. and 8 a.m. there are no orderlies or domestic help to assist on the wards, so that the already overworked nurses have to do domestic and non-nursing duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The acute surgical side has 25 acute surgical beds and this complement caters for paediatric surgery, intensive care and the ordinary waiting and recovering patients including men, women and children. On Monday last, a typical day, the surgical wing had 32 patients.  There are only two nurses to look after the intensive care unit which could be catering for up <Col N="1196" /> to ten patients.  At night the intensive care is staffed by one nurse more or less on loan from general surgery.</P>
    <P>In the paediatric surgery unit there is only one nurse to look after up to six small children, some of them infants.  The Minister knows, or ought to know, that paediatric care needs greater nursing attention than other areas of acute care, yet that has not been recognised in the staffing allocations.  Last Sunday night four people were admitted to surgery after a serious car accident so that the operating theatre was busy all night with these patients who were then moved to an overcrowded and understaffed ward.</P>
    <P>The Minister may, without batting an eyelid, say in this House and on television that there is no problem in Roscommon, just as he says there is no problem in Galway, Ennis or anywhere else, but this is a very dangerous problem in which the system is being pushed to the limit so that patients who would in normal circumstances be admitted to hospital are turned away because of a lack of beds. Patients are being sent home from hospital, often to live alone, far sooner than they should be and the doctors, consultants and nurses are caught up in a nightmare trying to cope, always haunted by the fear that patients will die because they cannot stretch their mental and physical properties to meet the awful situation they are placed in.</P>
    <P>In 1989 the budget for acute hospital services in Roscommon Hospital was £4.3 million.  In 1990 this budget is down to £4.1 million.  This £4.3 million gave us the hospital care services which I have described, but only God knows what description I will have to give one year on with the budget reduced by £200,000.</P>
    <P>All this is a far cry from the situation described by Deputy Foxe in revelations he made to local newspapers in Roscommon and Galway last week.  Deputy Foxe recounts that he was taken to the Taoiseach's house at Kinsealy by Deputy Leyden one Sunday last June where he found Mr. Haughey, pacing the floor in desperation trying to devise some ways <Col N="1197" /> and means to secure enough support to be re-elected as Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>I stand corrected.  The Taoiseach asked Deputy Foxe what he needed to secure his support and Deputy Foxe very modestly requested the very minimum to pull the health services back from the brink.  Deputy Foxe revealed that he requested 20 additional beds in the hospital, with the necessary back up staff, the appointment of an anaesthetist when the present one retires, that psycho-geriatric accommodation would be maintained at Castlerea&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The promises to Roscommon Hospital were cynically and dismissively welshed upon.  One could only have felt revulsion listening to the Minister last night talking about his heavy burden, his concerns for a better health service for all and his profound and unique understanding of sickness, patients' fear of sickness and the need for support for them.  He said that this concern was born out of his years in general and hospital practice.  What does one say when one compares his bleeding heart declarations with the situation in one hospital, which I described tonight, a typical case?</P>
      <P>There has been a lot of weeping for the welfare of patients by the Minister and his leader who, since their political survival became imperative, are willing to promise, to scheme and to use understaffed hospitals and well meaning and inexperienced people as pawns in their cynical little game to survive.  The motion asks the Minister to go, he has been found guilty by what has transpired in this House last night and tonight.  He has lost his battle in Cabinet and the confidence of the public.  He has also lost the confidence of the health service as not one doctor or nurse believes in him any more. As Cromwell said to parliament, we ask the Minister, in God's name, to go.</P>

      <P>In the short time available to me I should like to refer specifically to the present level of the public health service in County Kerry.  Since 1987 we have lost 60 acute beds and as a result Tralee General Hospital cannot adequately cope with the demands of the public, despite the Trojan efforts of the staff.  Last night a sick man was put into the geriatric unit because there was not an acute bed available.  As a result he left <Col N="1199" /> during the night and went home.  This is no way to treat a sick man.</P>
      <P>There are no five day beds in Tralee General Hospital although the Minister promised 15 five day beds when he visited the hospital last November.  The promise has not been acted on and I appeal to the Minister to ensure that these beds will be made available as soon as possible.  At the moment, although hips are available for elective patients in the hospital, there are no beds available.  This is a scandal.</P>
      <P>Because of the pressure on beds sick people are forced to leave the hospital prematurely.  I met an individual last Friday night who was forced to leave the hospital, still bleeding, following an operation. The token ENT service to which Deputy O'Donoghue referred, is totally inadequate and will not make the slightest impression on the waiting list.  The present financial allocation will run out in six months and more people are being added to the waiting list for treatment.</P>
      <P>Young people are no longer accepted in Cork for an ENT operation.  There is no adult ENT service in County Kerry and I am personally aware of several adults who have been on the waiting list for years and who have no prospects of having this operation.</P>
      <P>There is also a major orthopaedic problem in County Kerry.  I do not have to remind the Minister that the problem will not be solved with the present facilities. The Minister of State referred to orthodontic services but there are over 1,300 young people in Kerry waiting for orthodontic treatment, and over 400 of them have been classified as severe.  Even though an orthodontist was appointed last November he can only treat &mdash; at most &mdash; 28 people each month, which is not sufficient.</P>
      <P>The waiting period for surgical out-patients in Tralee Hospital is one year, the longest in the Southern Health Board area although more patients are being seen in the surgical out-patients unit than in any other hospital in Munster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Services for the mentally handicapped and community care for them are not up to standard in County Kerry.  I appeal to <Col N="1200" /> the Minister, on behalf of the people of Kerry and the Minister region, to do something about that problem.  He cannot hide behind a wealth of statistics and continue to ignore the plight of the suffering.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil said that we manufactured this debate on the health services.  Have they been living in Disneyland for the past few months or have they deserted their clinics?  They must have heard the views of their constituents in relation to problems in health care.</P>
      <P>I want to talk about a sector of the population who do not have people rushing to their defence or organisations to represent them, the elderly.  I want to refer to my own town of Newcastle West because the geriatric unit there is symptomatic of other areas around the country.  Over the last few years the number of beds has been reduced from over 220 beds to 160 beds.  That is a shortfall of 60 beds; it is officially recognised that people are living longer but that the number of dependants upon whom they can rely is diminishing.</P>
      <P>There are queues of people trying to get into geriatric units.  Their families are suffering a severe financial burden trying to cater for them in private nursing homes where the differential between their old age pension and the cost of the home is often £70 to £80 per week.  People are telling us they cannot afford this and asking us to try to get patients into a geriatric unit.  How can we get them in when all the beds are filled and there are waiting lists?</P>
      <P>I could say a lot more but other colleagues want to get in.  Newcastle West epitomises what is happening in other geriatric units around the country.</P>

      <P>I wish to pay tribute to the North-Western Health Board, the best in the country.  Without them, there would have been an unmitigated disaster in the area &mdash; with them it is a disaster.  There is a two and a half years' wait to have one's eyes examined and to get a pair of glasses.  People have been confined to their homes for that length of time &mdash; it <Col N="1201" /> would not have been tolerated in Ceausescu's Romania.</P>
      <P>The orthopaedic situation is worse as there is a waiting list of four years for treatment.  People are being told not to worry, to try to get around and that they will be in great shape for their funeral. The Government are trying to give the impression that the health cuts are over but in the north-west we have been asked to cut £766,000 in real terms after cuts of £9.3 million in the previous year.  We received £3 million for the dental service and there are 70,000 eligible people in the area.  We are now asking for action, not an action committee, so that we have sufficient funds to take our health service out of crisis and to bring it up to a level suitable for the last decade of the century.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a full file of cases which have been referred to me but I will not dwell on them tonight.  I know that there is overcrowding as I have spoken to nurses and doctors in University Hospital, Galway.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, blamed the overcrowding at Christmas on the `flu epidemic.  Having spoken to many people in the hospital I can assure him that very few patients had the `flu coming in to hospital but many had it going home because they were left in corridors.  I witnessed relatives of a patient putting their coats around the end of of a bed to keep the draught off him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, knows the solution.  Merlin Park is a first class hospital in a wonderful setting.  However, its 230 beds are closed. Unit 9 is closed with 20 beds, Unit 8 is closed with 40 beds, Unit 1 is closed with 50 beds and Unit 10 is closed with 122 beds.  This all happened under the present Administration.  The Minister should order the opening of Unit 1 immediately and the rest later.  This would alleviate the pressure on space in University Hospital. If Merlin Park was opened the patients could be discharged from hospital to convalesce for a week or two in Merlin Park.  They would then be fit to go home and it would stop the vicious circle where people are being rushed out <Col N="1202" /> of University Hospital because somebody else wants the bed.  They are not fit to go home and have to be readmitted in a few days.  I will produce evidence to the Minister, and his Minister of State, of such cases.  I entered this debate for a specific reason and I do not apologise to any Member for doing so.  I represent Galway city on the borough council and I am aware that the Minister has denied us any representation on the Western Health Board.</P>

If he does so, he will put the minds of many people at ease.  When we return to normal the Minister will find that there will be less tension in the community and fewer patients in need of hospitalisation.  The Minister should act now and open the closed wards.  There are many nurses willing to work on those wards.</P>

      <P>Listening to the debate I frequently asked myself what the debate was about.  Was it about a public health service that was in crisis, something that was denied, or was it about the structure of the sickness industry?  A great deal of importance attaches to the Minister's speech last night.  In the course of it he made a number of serious points in reply to comments by Deputies.  There is no need for me to go through all the points, to refer to the different hospitals, or list the hospitals where acute beds have been lost.  The fact is that they were lost but the Minister's speech was redolent with images.  He attacked public representatives, the media, the people who gave <Col N="1203" /> interviews and suggested that there had been exploitation of the old.</P>

      <P>It is interesting that the Minister is so sensitive about his speech.  He referred to people who exploit any old person, any sick person, any handicapped person whose story can be peddled.  He referred to throwing borrowed money at problems.  He spoke about fear being generated and attacked the radio media.  He said those involved in the radio media would put the emotion on the air before facts were checked out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have very little time in this debate but I should like to dispose of one fundamental straight away.  There was a real crisis in the health services before Christmas.  It was brought to acute proportions due to the 'flu epidemic but it cannot be explained in terms of the 'flu. Let us move on to a second basic fact.  The Minister made considerable reference to the report of the Commission on Health Funding under the chairmanship of Dr. Miriam Hederman-O'Brien.  He told the House that that report vindicated his thinking.  What it vindicated was his confusion and theirs.  That report stated that many of the decisions which face policy makers contain a very substantial ethical element.  We got a lot of ethics, of course, last night.  The report went on to state that health care in modern societies was <Col N="1204" /> now seen as a right.  The commission did not believe that there was any fundamental disagreement in Irish society on this issue.  It is there that the difficulty arises because neither that report, nor the Minister's speech, answered the question, &ldquo;Does he accept that health is a basic human right?&rdquo;  Is it, as the report suggests, a perceived right that can change tomorrow, the day after, next year or in the next decade?  That question was answered by the public who said that it was a basic right.  They even converted the Taoiseach to that view in the last election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>They thought they had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is a qualified right on what basis is it to be qualified?  The Minister's speech was very interesting in regard to that.  He told us that the report vindicates his life and his philosophy in regard to health.  A piece of irredentist Fianna Fáilism was thrown in in the following statement:</P>
      <P>What I wanted was a health service which was built on the great caring traditions of Ireland &mdash; the family traditions, the religious order traditions &mdash; and added in the realities of business efficiency and value for taxpayers' money.</P>
      <P>There is the nub of the problem.  The public want to know whether Oireachtas Éireann reflects their view that health care is a basic unqualified right, that it is not a right that is qualified by the economic theories of the present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have some sympathy for the criticism that is piling on an individual Minister because it is little less than hypocritical of those who say that in running our economy we can curtail expenditure and do it in an unplanned way.  We heard a lot about planning last night, but when we run the economy as we do now, nothing can be exempted.  For example, it is important and instructive to be aware of a number of facts.  The public support a general public health service.  They have never said that they will not pay tax to <Col N="1205" /> support such a service.  What they have said again and again is that they object to their taxes being abused.  For example, the average person who knows that his or her child can never become a doctor, but has an 87 per cent chance of paying for the education of a doctor, objects when he or she knows that when they are acutely ill they may not necessarily get that service as a right.  That enrages them.</P>
    <P>I should like to point to an interesting difference, for the information of the Minister and his advisers, between him, the Report of the Commission on Health Funding and the Department's view.  The World Health Organisation do not involve themselves in this confusion. They accept health as a basic right.  In this Republic, however, that now holds the Presidency of all Europe, it is a qualified right with acute bed disappearing. I am sure that when the Taoiseach, the President of all Europeans, is asked what he achieved in his little country in which there is world interest he will tell them that between 1926 and 1990 we sent 2,226,330 people out of the country; that ours is a country of poverty and that was why the Eastern European countries were revolting, to be just like us.  He will tell them that he presided over the end of public health care.  I am sure he will refer to the folksy piece that when Fianna Fáil were in office people went to England for their glasses and false teeth.  That was the high point of republicanism.</P>
    <P>This debate is about a few fundamental issues that flow from the report of the Commission on Health Funding, that flow from the Department of Health and that flow from the conservative parties that have said that in running the economy they will not attack the banks' scandalous fraud and abuse of section 84 to rip £90 million or more per year out of the system and that they will not attack the situation in which we have no wealth tax, a tax that this year would be yielding £20 million.  They are wrong and fraudulent when they say that the problems in relation to the funding of the health services can be sorted out by better administration or better management.  If <Col N="1206" /> they were so concerned about health &mdash; all their hearts are bleeding this week &mdash; why did they not say above all else there will be basic rights in this country, there will be aspects of education that will not be touched, there will be aspects of health that will not be touched?  Instead of that, creeping back into the Minister's speech, again and again, is this question of running the sickness industry.  In that speech one can find a number of very interesting phrases.</P>
    <P>I was reminded by Professor Titmus, the great theorist of the British health service who died in a public ward just a few years ago, who spoke about the three models of health care, one of which said, let the family and the market place take care of it and when the blood is flowing out under the doors and the patients are stuck in the corridors, we will get concerned. There was another view which said we will have an insurance model of provision related to merit.  Then there was the egalitarian view that built the British health service and which served Ireland as well as England.  There was a feeling in Ireland for a while that there might be a time when all children, no matter whose children they were, could go to a hospital and expect equal treatment or that all old people could die with dignity.  Now here is the new model, derived from the model of American medical ethics, built on the libertarian tradition.  That was about freedom of choice.  It was never about having the right to have a basic service provided.  It is that ethic we find interestingly forming in the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>A phrase is used which is marvellous in its own way.  In his speech the Minister criticised Deputy Yates saying that he was technicist and that one did not run a health service like the ESB.  The Minister went on to refer to the kind of health service he would like.  He said there would be £5 million for the elderly, £2 million for the handicapped, £3 million for the dental services &mdash; which will be welcomed &mdash; but where are the acute beds?  The Minister threw in a derisory remark which is a scandal whether it was penned for him or he wrote it himself. <Col N="1207" /> Do you want the beds in the hospital in case people get ill?  The fact is that no Minister for Health has a mandate to say to the people your health needs will be treated in terms of the market economy. The Minister went on to say that health must be run as a business.  This is the man on whose desk the buck stops.  Is it not a good analogy &mdash; the fine American imported word.  It is similar to Chicago when the ambulance services were privatised and where people would be asked for their health insurance number before they would be scraped off the streets.</P>
    <P>As we head for 1992 it is very clear&mdash; and the Minister has no protection from that &mdash; there will be further competition in private care.  What we are deciding tonight is whether there will be a public health service with acute beds restored. I will be asked, and the Labour Party will be asked, how one would pay for this service.  We have said that taxpayers never objected paying for it.  We have also said other things that it is a scandal to be abolishing wealth taxes, containing corporate taxes, handing fortunes in bank scams out to the banks and so forth.</P>
    <P>There is something else I would do; I would borrow if necessary to provide a basic assurance that health was a right in this country.  We are now at a veritable crossroads.  It is a situation in which, in relation to any of the principles of equality, there is nothing we can show.  We can say we did nothing to protect any basic decency.  We can say that next we will see privatised education and it will roll on, and when all these Ministers travel abroad and are inundated with meetings, they will be asked sometimes about their Irishness and about their Republic and all they will be able to describe is a betrayed republic.</P>
    <P>There were decent people who founded this State and who made it possible for people to sit on these benches. Many of them were egalitarians and the least they hoped, even if they never got a seat on a plane to a ministerial meeting or ever held power, was that the children of this country &mdash; when we look at them they are the same &mdash; would be treated <Col N="1208" /> equally and that all old people would be treated equally.  Instead of that the Minister has said we have been whipping up emotion.  He said that about the nurses' representative on the Western Health Board in December.  When he said it everyone agreed with him but at last Monday's health board meeting, when she again repeated that statement, nobody contradicted her, and even members of the Minister's party decided to visit the hospital yesterday to see the beds in the corridors.  There they found people who are suffering from cardiac conditions at a distance from cardiac equipment.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach has put a great deal of effort into trying to avoid this debate.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will go even further and <Col N="1209" /> say that that attempt to get out of this debate showed a most appalling and telling lack of political courage on the part of the Taoiseach, his Minister for Health and, indeed, of the whole Government.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of record that the Taoiseach himself said, in the course of the general election campaign last June, that he was unaware of the crisis in the health service.  He was unaware of the depth of feeling among the Irish people.  I wonder if his attempt to wriggle out of this debate shows that he is still unaware of that, or does it show, perhaps, that he is now beginning to understand the problem is but is afraid to be faced with the truth in this House.  One or other of those things is true and neither reflects any credit on the Taoiseach and his Government.</P>
      <P>On 9 January last, my party proposed that the Dáil be recalled early to discuss the crisis in the health service.  There was no response from the Government; I suppose it is not all that surprising.  As it happened the Dáil resumed this January, a week later than last year.  At the Christmas Adjournment the Taoiseach seemed to have his facts wrong as he thought we were resuming on the same date as we usually do but he dismissed my proposal that we should resume on 23 January.  That would have given us ample time to have this debate before the budget and it would have given the Government ample time to do better than the feeble attempt which the Minister made last night to respond.  That refusal to give parliamentary time for this debate left me with no option but to use the parliamentary levers that are open to the Opposition in this House to achieve our objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plain fact is that if the Government had had the will to debate the issue rather than try to escape it, there need have been no disruption of Government business here, in Brussels or anywhere else. Any difficulties that the Government have had in that regard have been purely and simply of the Government's own making, due only to the Taoiseach's obduracy.  He can spend as much time as he wishes walking around the antechamber to this House with a piece of <Col N="1210" /> paper in his hand reorganising the business of the Dáil.  The fact of the matter is that if the Taoiseach had had the gumption on the first day this House sat to agree to have this debate none of that need have happened.</P>
    <P>In June of 1988 my party proposed fundamental reforms in the way that we run our health services, in the way that we deliver health services to people who need them.  Those reforms covered the whole range &mdash; the structure of management in our health service, the pattern of hospital services that we need, the back-up that is needed for hospital services, proper hospital management, medical teaching and research, the organisation of community care, health education and funding.  The Minister ignored all of those proposals.</P>
    <P>In October 1988 we put forward concrete proposals for the better management of the health services.  Those proposals and the fundamental reforms that we put forward were designed to make sure that more people could get better health care.  The Minister and the Government voted against those perfectly sensible short-term proposals.</P>
    <P>In September of last year, the commission on health funding produced its report.  That report very largely endorsed the Fine Gael proposals on the structure of the health service, on the reforms that are needed, on the simple, straightforward management techniques that need to be brought in so that we can deliver better health services to more of the people that need them who are now being excluded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not going to make any more bones here tonight.  He has got his chance.  The Minister's response to that health funding commission's report was that he was going to ask everybody for their views on the <Col N="1211" /> report.  What he has not said is that he will be getting views from the very same people who have had a very large input into the work that was done by that commission so that those same people, having been asked to discuss all these issues with the health funding commission are now being asked to discuss the same issues all over again with this Minister.  It is simply a way for the Minister and the Government to avoid making up their minds about the kind of reforms we need in our health service.</P>
      <P>This debate has achieved a result.  The Minister has been forced to make some response.  That response, from what we have seen last night, is nothing like enough.  Up to last night, there were 21 committees in the Department of Health reporting on various topics to the Minister. There are now 23.  I am saying nothing at all against Mr. Fox or Mr. Kennedy.  Both are able and dedicated people; but we should not be wasting their time asking them to redo a job that has already been well done by the health funding commission and by all the agencies that that commission talked of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to see real action.  The Minister has now begun to admit that there is a crisis; otherwise he would not have laid before this House what he mistakenly calls a wide-ranging strategy.  What does that wide-ranging strategy consist of?  It is here in the Minister's text.  It consists of: a commitment to maintain overall hospital activity; an outline of how to spend £10 million; a major initiative on efficiency in the health service; an initiative &mdash; not a major initiative but an initiative &mdash; on the Dublin hospital services; a radical new approach to patient care; patient consumer care plans for all agencies; an appeals system; a clear commitment to a five-year capital programme; information systems; two further major announcements to be made shortly; and those two further major announcements will be followed by further announcements.  This is the strategy that the Minister is putting before us, a series of outlines, initiatives and announcements, and all the time we still <Col N="1212" /> have the same problem to deal with. People are not getting the kind of health service they need and deserve.</P>
    <P>There is a commitment to maintain overall hospital activity.  What does that mean?  Can the Minister still not see that maintaining the current level of activity is not enough?  He promises a major initiative on efficiency in the health service. That, if ever there was one, is an admission that the present situation is unacceptable.  It is an indictment from the Minister's own mouth of his performance up to now.  We are promised an initiative on Dublin hospital services.  Why, with all the reports we have had, has it taken this debate to wring that out of the Minister? The Minister promises that information systems will be greatly improved and management development stepped up.</P>
    <P>He is surely not trying to say that that kind of thing would need to be done if there were no crisis in the health sector which has been the tune in the last two and a half years.  We must have a quality of access to health services.  If people wish to pay for private medicine they have every right to do so; but our society can have no self-respect if those on low incomes or dependent on social welfare are denied access to an adequate public health service.  It is clearly a big part of our problem that this Government simply do not understand what it is to be a medical card holder with sickness in the family and to have to depend on publicly provided health services.</P>
    <P>There has been no proper planning for situations which can be foreseen.  We must make sure now, for example, that adequate resources are provided to meet the needs that we know will arise next winter.  Next winter, as every winter, there will be an increase in the number of people needing treatment for respiratory ailments.  It is a fair bet that there will be a flu epidemic next year.  We are not asking the Minister, as he tried to suggest to keep empty wards open and to keep staff idle waiting for an emergency, far from it.  What we demand and must have is flexibility at local level, at hospital level to meet these foreseeable <Col N="1213" /> needs.  Neither these needs nor the other ones that we know about have been adequately addressed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The national cardiac centre has a waiting list of 600 patients.  The level of activity there has had to be cut from four operations a week to two.  It would take six years at that rate just to get through the patients who are now on the waiting lists there.  The 25 beds provided are simply not enough to carry out a higher level of activity than that.  There is a clear difference there between public and private medicine even though it is the same surgeons who are carrying out the operations in both cases.  There is no equality of access.</P>
    <P>The problems of the elderly have been clearly identified in the report for the years ahead, as the Minister quotes so often.  We need geriatric assessment units and geriatric departments in acute hospitals.  We need to develop community care to a degree that the Minister has not even begun to imagine.  For mentally handicapped people we will need, over the next three years, 800 extra residential places and 1,000 extra day care places for needs that we know already exist.  We know all the rest of it.  Old age pensioners cannot get dentures.  Medical card holders cannot get any kind of dental treatment, and orthodontic services are almost non-existent for those who have to rely on public medicine.  Those are the needs that we can see; those are the needs that have to be planned for.</P>
    <P>In the light of all these needs it is no wonder that the Minister now stands condemned as being a major part of the problem.  He is condemned by his own Cabinet colleagues.  In May of last year, for example, the present Minister for Industry and Commerce said that Deputy O'Hanlon would go down as the worst Minister for Health in the history of the State.  The Minister is condemned by his own backbenchers, by his own party councillors and by his own party activists.  I will give one example.  Councillor Jackie Healy-Rae has been very loquacious on the subject of late.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>This sad story begins, I think, in 1971 when a dead badger was found in the south-west of England and was discovered to have bovine TB.  This began a long, sorry saga in which the badger, once regarded as a friend of the farmer, was accused, exonerated and accused again of spreading TB among cattle.  In 1975 badger setts in England were systematically gassed in order to destroy the badgers living inside them. Responding to public concern over this method of killing badgers, the Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Peter Walker, asked the Minister of Defence to test the efficiency of this method.  Their results were disturbing.  Many badgers took 25 to 30 minutes to die from the effects of the cyanide gas.  They were shown to wander disoriented from their setts, a fact that had been noticed during the seven year gassing programme.  In addition, it was discovered that setts would frequently have to be gassed three or four times before the badger finally succumbed.  In 1982 Peter Walker announced that the gassing of badgers would be banned and cage trapping would be the method to be used in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here in Ireland we have all heard recent statements from the IFA president, Alan Gillis, and more recently from the director of ERAD, Liam <Col N="1219" /> Downey, proposing that the gassing of badgers in bovine TB hotspots around the country should be introduced by the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy.  This is a preposterous notion and one which the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, are opposed to totally.  Despite 19 years of research in Britain into the possibilities of badgers spreading TB to cattle, no scientific evidence has been produced to support this view.</P>
    <P>In Northern Ireland, the Ministry of Agriculture have announced details of a ten year research study into badgers and their relationship with TB.  The report has come out clearly in defence of the badger.  They do not believe the badger plays a role in spreading TB.</P>
    <P>It would indeed be foolish to suggest there is absolutely no possibility of badgers ever spreading TB to cattle. However, many senior researchers in England do not believe the badger can play more than a minute role in the spreading of TB and even this minute role is still only a possibility.</P>
    <P>The badger is a protected species under the Wildlife Act, 1976 and under the Berne Convention, to which Ireland is a signatory.  Are we going to allow wholesale eradication of the badger when there is no scientific basis to suggest it plays a role in the spread of TB?  I hope not.</P>
    <P>In Offaly an eradication programme is under way under which all badgers, affected or otherwise, are being systematically killed, principally by snaring and shooting.  This research &mdash; for want of a better term &mdash; has no scientific basis, as it is well known that all other strict measures to control TB are being enforced.  ERAD have already announced, since the badger eradication scheme, that the incidence of bovine TB has gone down by 13 per cent.  Thus ERAD are deliberately filtering out information to the country's farmers that the badger is responsible for TB in their herds.  We can only say this is disgraceful. Without comparative tests having taken place in another area of similar type with a similar incidence of TB infected cattle and with a relatively similar number of <Col N="1220" /> badgers, this Offaly survey is useless.  Of course, TB has been reduced in Offaly but not, we believe, because of the eradication of the badger but because farmers are not moving their cattle from field to field as they do all over the country and are not swapping slurry machines.  In short, they are controlling the disease through their good management.</P>
    <P>The badger is a protected species which is under threat because of the scandalous mismanagement of a TB eradication scheme which has cost the country's taxpayers £1 billion in the past 30 years. Other countries have controlled TB by effective testing and improved animal husbandry.  They have not had to resort to scapegoating any unfortunate wild animals.  I call on the Minister to refrain from bowing to the appalling pressure he has been subjected to by the IFA and ERAD.  If the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966, is invoked and the badger is gassed we will strongly consider taking the matter up in the European courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Garland for allowing me a small portion of his time.  I wish to express support for the views he expressed.  The badger is a protected species in this country.  In recent months, as we entered the so-called green Presidency, we have witnessed this Government licensing the shooting of white fronted geese, the scandal of this Government continuing to issue licences for otter hunting and now we have had, apparently by way of Government policy emanating from the Department of Agriculture and Food, support for the wholesale gassing of badgers throughout the length and breadth of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The badger is being used as a scapegoat for the failure of the TB eradication scheme.  Government support for such a policy which runs directly contrary to the protection afforded to badgers under the Wildlife Act, 1976, makes a mockery of the so-called green Presidency and of our commitment to the wildlife of this country and undermines the credibility of the so-called environmental action plan the Government announced only a week or ten days ago.  The first example of this <Col N="1221" /> environmental action plan is apparently a Government sponsored and supported slaughter of badgers.  For this type of policy to be supported, or for the Government to give it sanction, is something this House is entitled to protest against.  If the Government's intention is to renege on international conventions which seek to provide protection for the badger and to depart from the provisions contained in the Wildlife Act, they need to explain to this House why they intend to deal with matters in this way or allow Government-sponsored agencies to deal with matters in this way, when the suggestion that the badger is the cause of the major problem of bovine TB is so clearly refuted in the report published in Northern Ireland a short time before Christmas.  It seems the research undertaken for that report is being ignored within the Department of Agriculture and Food, whatever about the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>I hope the opportunity to raise this issue this evening on the Adjournment will afford both the Minister in the Department of Agriculture and Food and the Minister for the Environment an opportunity to explain the Government's view to this House and that the spectacle of thousands of badgers being slaughtered will not be one we will have to witness.  I believe the general public would not support this and the majority of farmers would not support it.  Good farming practices are going to contribute to a far greater extent to tackling the TB problem than the so-called slaughter of badgers throughout Ireland.  As Deputy Garland has said, one of the first instances of a badger being proved scientifically to have TB derived from the badger having contact with cattle.  Indeed there is a considerable dispute as to whether the cattle infect the badgers or the badgers infect the cattle.</P>
    <P>I hope that the brief time we have had to raise this issue this evening will result in a different approach from that which it is feared will be taken by the Government, ERAD, the Department of Agriculture and Food and the Department of the Environment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The bovine TB eradication scheme has been in operation in Ireland since 1954, but, regrettably, very little progress has been made in eradicating this disease since that time although there has been a considerable cost to the taxpayer.  A number of reasons have been put forward and one focused on the badger as a possible source of infection.  The farm organisations, in particular, have been pointing to the badger for some time but it is in the UK that the role of the badger has been most extensively researched.  As far back as 1973 the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food considered that the badger was a reservoir of infection and that action was needed to gas badgers in areas where they were considered to be a source of infection.  Lord Zucherman was commissioned in 1979 to review the problem and he concluded that badgers constituted a significant reservoir of TB and also that the high densities of both badgers and cattle in south-west England favoured the transmission of the disease within the badger population and also from badgers to cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the Dunnet review which was commissioned by the British Government in 1984 again concluded that badgers can be infected by TB, that they are potential sources of infection in cattle and had to be taken into account when considering bovine TB.  Dunnet questioned the cost-effectiveness of delineating badger social groups and the concept of establishing a &ldquo;clean ring&rdquo; around a farm.  He concluded that the complete and permanent eradication of the disease in badgers and hence in cattle was not attainable by available methods, that is trapping.  He recommended a more limited and confined strategy, that is, that badgers on the breakdown farm where the disease was being transmitted should be killed humanely but that the operation should not be extended beyond the breakdown farm.  Last year the ESRI published a review entitled <i>Badger and Bovine T.B.</i> which states that in many parts of the country it may not be possible <Col N="1223" /> to control bovine TB without controlling the badger population.</P>
    <P>The presence of tuberculosis in a badger in Ireland was first reported from Cork in 1975.  Since then a large number of badgers killed in road accidents have been examined for TB and it has been found that over 10 per cent had lesions of the disease.  In the light of this evidence the Wildlife Service agreed to allow the snaring of badgers in specific areas under licence &ldquo;where all other potential causes have been eliminated&rdquo;.  At present the Minister for Agriculture and Food is considering recommendations from ERAD regarding a policy to deal with badgers in the context of the bovine TB eradication programme.  In making any decision he will be fully conscious of our obligations under the Council of Europe Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and National habitats and to the spirit of the Wildlife Act, 1976.  He will also take into consideration the significant cost of the eradication programme to the taxpayer, which is in the order of £1 billion, the enormous importance of the cattle herd to the economy as well as to our beef and dairying industries and the need for ERAD to be in a position to deal with all factors relevant to the eradication of bovine TB.</P>
    <P>In considering the relevance of the UK strategy in Ireland it should be noted that cost effectiveness was a prime issue in the Dunnet review.  The maximum potential benefits from further reduction of the already relatively low incidence of bovine TB prevailing in Britain by badger removal could not be high.  Furthermore, TB levels in badgers examined in Ireland seem to be appreciably higher than the county levels in the UK where the overall average is 3.9 per cent.  The cost benefit of an effective method of removing infective badgers would be much greater in Ireland than has been reported from Britain.</P>
    <P>At present the Minister is looking at ways in which the eradication policy can be made more effective.  No decision has been taken to allow the gassing of badgers. No Government order has been made under the Disease of Animals Act, <Col N="1224" /> 1966, to gas badgers and the Wildlife Service have not issued licences for the gassing of badgers and do not intend to.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving us the opportunity to present our case.  It is agreed that my party will take four minutes, which I will share with Deputy Ahearn.  The Labour Party will take four minutes and Deputy Power has indicated that he will take two minutes.</P>
      <P>The people in the southern parts of the country have suffered much in recent days from the wind, the rain and the flash floods which have hit most of the country. My constituency has suffered grievously. Much of the Lee Valley has been flooded and areas that had never been flooded in living memory were affected this time. The people of Inniscarra, Blarney and Tower have suffered substantial personal damages.  I ask the Minister to make every attempt to allocate funds to remedy the damage already done and, equally important, finance must be made available to prevent further disasters in the future.</P>
      <P>We had a similar problem in Cork last year and if the Minister remembers, he flew into Cork and met with me, the Lord Mayor at the time, and other representatives in County Hall, Cork but we have not heard any more about the problem since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am prepared to accept acts of God, but damages brought about as a result of negligence and inefficiency must be questioned.  I will be very specific.  One of the areas most seriously affected yesterday was the Riverview Estate in Tower, a local authority estate which was very badly affected by the overflowing of the Shournagh river.  Last night on radio we were promised by the Minister who is a local resident that technical studies would be carried out to alleviate the problem which was partly brought about by problems on the river.  This river overflowed two years ago and at that time we were promised that technical studies <Col N="1225" /> would be carried out.  What we need at this stage is action.  In the short time I have available I will try to elaborate on the role of the ESB on the River Lee.  The role of the ESB in the flooding disaster in the Cork area must be seriously examined. I question the flood management arrangements at the dam.  I know that the high pressures on the River Lee were increased by the outfall from the dam. In effect the problems at the Shournagh river were exacerbated by its inability to discharge into the River Lee.  I am calling for the following three points: first, compensation for the people affected; second, finance for future works to be carried out to prevent further disasters &mdash; a flood prevention programme involving the ESB and the two local authorities, Cork Corporation and Cork County Council; and, third, a full departmental investigation into the workings of the ESB at the Inniscarra dam.</P>
    <P>I believe that the ESB have once again been negligent on this occasion.  As was the case after flooding two years ago, the ESB disclaimed all responsibility at the outset but had to pay out massive amounts of compensation in the end.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to express my deep concern and anxiety at the extraordinary flooding that has occurred in my constituency of south Tipperary, most importantly in my home village of Ardfinnan, in Clonmel and in Kilmoyler.  In fact, the village of Ardfinnan is in a state of emergency this evening because the flooding there has been compounded by the fact that a manhole cover was lifted by the force of the water, resulting in sewage flowing into the shops and houses on the street. Despite enormous efforts on the part of the local authority overseer and engineer their efforts were defeated by the enormity of the downpour.  This evening the people of Ardfinnan, Clonmel and Kilmoyler are devastated, their homes have been ruined and, worse still, their fears are mounting because of a potentially greater disaster occurring this evening <Col N="1226" /> with winds and tides rising and a very bad weather forecast.</P>
    <P>Clonmel is experiencing its worst flood disaster since 1968.  This morning 14 cars had to be rescued by the Clonmel fire brigade.  All schools in the town are closed, houses are flooded and much of the town is impassable.</P>
    <P>Our top priority must be to make some effort to ensure that any future flooding will not cause such destruction and havoc. It is all too easy to refer to such disasters as an act of God but man-made solutions must help us cope with God-sent misfortunes.</P>
    <P>I believe that finance must be made available to south Tipperary county council to ascertain whether some improvements can be effected to alleviate any recurrence of such flooding.  Furthermore, the people whose homes have been destroyed must be given help to repair the damage caused, restoring furniture and any soiled household goods. People cannot be allowed to live in fear of such a disaster recurring.  Unfortunately, there will be a recurrence unless emergency action is taken immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing this matter to be raised this evening and for the arrangement for the sharing of time.</P>
      <P>The flooding of the River Suir is a matter of record and happens on and off each year.  The river originates in north Tipperary, flows through south Tipperary, Cashel, Golden, Tankardstown, Cahir, Ardfinnan, Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir and when in flood causes widespread damage to private and public property, havoc to agricultural lands and particularly to national primary and county roads.  There are two national primary routes in south Tipperary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On my way here on Tuesday I ran into flooding, which was why I endeavoured to raise this matter earlier.  Clonmel Corporation are maintaining today that this is the worst flooding that has taken place in 20 years.  I spoke to their engineers and to the town clerk.  I have also heard, at first hand, stories of houses which had been repaired by health boards, and <Col N="1227" /> occupied by old people, being flooded and damaged irreparably, with no assistance forthcoming.  Some type of emergency supplementary social welfare scheme will have to be devised to help such people.  Business premises in Golden, Tankardstown, Ardfinnan, Clonmel and Carrickon-Suir have been flooded and cars submerged.  There is widespread chaos and this all requires money in order to be put right.  Because of the damage done to business premises, hotels and public offices, the Minister will have to address this as a real crisis.</P>
    <P>This raises for all of us, representatives of south Tipperary in particular, the question of the drainage of the River Suir which was promised by successive Governments over the years.  I understand that its drainage is now a priority on the Government's arterial drainage list.  Indeed, the late John Boyle from Ardfinnan led a deputation to the Government some 15 years ago when they were promised something would be done about the drainage of that river.</P>
    <P>I am calling on the Minister and his Cabinet colleagues to ensure that the River Suir drainage receives priority for structural and-or national funds.  I want his assurance that south Tipperary will be considered a disaster area following this latest flooding.  We call on the Minister to deal with the matter, in any way possible, as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank other Deputies for allowing me participate in this debate.  I want to refer to the flooding in the Lee Valley in particular. This latest occurrence is a repetition of that in 1988 and warrants urgent attention on the part of the Department of the Environment particularly to ascertain the root cause of this flooding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to concentrate my remarks on the 76-house estate, the Riverview Estate, on the Blarney Road, between Blarney and Tower.  It is not good enough for a local authority official, reportedly, to allege that, because such is an act of God, no compensation can be <Col N="1228" /> paid.  Indeed, it was no act of God that these houses were built in this low-lying area, close to the River Shournagh, and liable to be flooded on a fairly wide scale. The fact that the local authority, a week prior to this most recent flooding, delivered sand bags to the residents is an indication that they anticipated such flooding.</P>
    <P>The Minister ultimately is responsible because his Department would have approved local authority plans for the building of that estate in that area.  He should now examine this matter urgently and compensate the residents of this estate who have suffered severe damage. I would appeal to the Minister to take this problem on board immediately in the same way as the people of Ballsbridge were treated when the River Dodder overflowed some years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for having given me an opportunity to raise on the Adjournment the matter of the serious flooding which has taken place in Athy.  I thank Deputy Allen and others for sharing their time with me.</P>
      <P>The position obtaining in Athy at present is indeed a sad one.  Locals say they have not seen such bad flooding since 1955.  The River Barrow, one of the slowest flowing rivers in the country, has overflowed, causing chaos in surrounding areas.  The town's water supply has been affected to the extent that locals cannot drink the water from their taps.  Sewerage has also been affected, with White Castle Lawns being the worst hit.  The greatest damage has been caused on the Monasterevan-Athy road, which is under two feet of water.  Residents of St. Joseph's Terrace have been threatened with evacuation, with sandbags having been placed at hall doors to prevent flooding of homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must pay a special tribute to the relevant local authorities, to the Army, Civil Defence, the Eastern Health Board, the fire brigade and ambulance services for their quick action in dealing with this potential disaster.  A contingency plan was devised and all forces were put on <Col N="1229" /> alert, ready and willing to play their part. The next 24 hours will prove crucial because, if the rains continue, they will have a disastrous effect on the town overall.</P>
    <P>This present storm has continued for a number of days now, wreaking an enormous amount of damage across the country.  I call on the Minister to provide assistance, particularly to those in areas which have incurred the most storm damage.  It is indeed an ill wind that blows nobody any good.  In saying that, I hope some lessons can be learned from our experience of this most recent storm.  In all future planning, whether for housing or schools, but particularly in regard to houses for the elderly, special consideration must be given to siting.  In the past it has been popular to site such buildings close to rivers for scenic and other reasons.  But the past few days have clearly demonstrated that people living in these areas are very vulnerable when flooding takes place.  I would ask that immediate assistance be given them and that action be taken to prevent a recurrence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concern expressed by all Deputies who raised these matters on the Adjournment this evening for the people who have been and continue to be affected by the severe weather prevailing in various parts of the country.  I am anxious to help in so far as I can in areas which fall within the responsibility of my Department.  There are of course, as the Deputies fully appreciate, limits to the area of my responsibility and to the funds at my disposal to give assistance. For example, there are no funds available to me to compensate for any damage caused by the storms to private properties. Householders would normally be expected to have their property and the contents insured against losses from flooding and indeed adverse weather conditions but in necessitous cases it is open to health boards to provide assistance to elderly householders, under the task force on special housing aid for the elderly, to remedy damage to their houses. <Col N="1230" /> Money has been paid through that avenue on a previous occasion.  In so far as business premises are concerned, it has been a very long established practice that the Exchequer cannot meet losses incurred by businesses as a result of their being uninsured.</P>
      <P>In recent months there have been a number of instances of very severe weather.  The first was over the October bank holiday weekend when areas in the west and north-west experienced extremely heavy rainfalls which caused a good deal of damage to public roads and bridges.  Deputies will remember that that was the subject of an Adjournment debate here on 5 December last when I said that I would consider if special funds for remedial works on roads and bridges were warranted.  The next spate of bad weather was on 16-17 December when storms hit the east and south coasts.  The damage to public property during these storms appears to have related mainly to coastal defences including piers, slipways and so on.  There was however significant consequential damage to public roads at that time in the immediate vicinity of the coast.  I understand that local authorities have raised the matter with the Department of the Marine to see if something can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I indicated in reply to a recent parliamentary question that I would give consideration to providing assistance in relation to damage to public roads in the context of the allocation of the balance of the road grants for 1990.  I am glad to be able to say to Deputies this evening that these grants are on their way to the local authorities; they will certainly have received them before the Deputies go home this weekend.  Included in these grants is £1 million by way of assistance towards the cost of remedial works to roads and bridges affected by the severe weather in both October and December last.  Deputy Allen will remember that I visited the area at that time and I said that I would actively consider doing something about the matter.  The 1989 grants which I allocated included £740,000 for Cork County Council to remedy road damage that was caused in <Col N="1231" /> October 1988.  I am also allocating money in regard to the damage caused in October and December last.  I stress that my decision to provide assistance to the relevant local authorities in those cases followed quite a detailed assessment of the damage undertaken by the Department when conditions had returned to something approaching normal.  The assessment could not be made until that happened and that is why I have made the allocation today in that regard.</P>
    <P>Turning to the present spell of bad weather, what is now required is to let local authorities get on with the job of dealing with the immediate difficulties.  I would join with Deputy Power in complimenting the emergency services for the job they are doing in very difficult circumstances.  They certainly have been acquitting themselves admirably. I am satisfied that these people are well organised, have the capacity to do the job and are responding well to the very difficult situation which exists at present and obviously will continue to exist for the next few days.  In time there will be an assessment of the damage caused to public property.  In so far as it relates to public roads, which come under my responsibility, I will consider the extent of the damage and whether special funding is called for.  I have done so for the past two years and I will have to do so again at this stage.  Unfortunately, it seems to be a continuing difficulty for me.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that the significantly increased discretionary grants for regional and county roads, which have been notified to local authorities for 1990, may be used in appropriate cases to undertake the remedial works arising from the present bad weather.  The grants to county councils under that heading amount to over £63 million in 1990 as compared to £47.4 million under the <Col N="1232" /> equivalent grants in 1989 and £33.4 million in 1987.  There has been a very big increase in the amount of money that I have been allocating by way of discretionary grant and I am advising the local authorities accordingly that they can utilise some element of that money if they find it appropriate to deal with the present difficulties.</P>
    <P>To Deputy Ferris I have to say that the problem in Ardfinnan is certainly related to the River Suir &mdash; the Deputy is quite right about that.  I think he recognises that I have no function in that area.  It is a question for the Office of Public Works in so far as arterial drainage is concerned but I take note of what he has said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>In the EC there is such a thing as disaster funding but it was never intended to be used for localised disruption of this kind.  It is for disasters such as earthquakes and avalanches or disasters of that dimension.  The amount of the fund is very small but if I thought there was a bob to be got for this kind of damage I would look for it.  The money was not intended to be used to deal with localised disruption and works of a remedial nature to roads and bridges.</P>
      <P>We have committed some funds for damage caused by storms in the past and I will make an assessment on the matter on this occasion when the weather returns to normal and when I get reports on it.  I cannot add anything further except to say that we all sympathise with those who are discommoded in any way and I will look on the matter as favourably as I can in due course.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 8 February 1990.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 89 together.</P>
      <P>The Government have been following with deep concern the development of the famine situation in Ethiopia following the failure of the crops last year, in particular in Northern Ethiopia.  They made allocations totallying £300,000 (three hundred thousand pounds) in November 1989 and in January 1990 a further £50,000 (fifty thousand pounds) was provided towards famine relief.  The Government have also contributed to relieving famine through our participation in EC emergency aid schemes.</P>
      <P>In addition to the need for food supplies, there is also a problem of access as the worst affected areas of Eritrea and Tigre are in rebel hands.  Every opportunity has been used to bring pressure on the Ethiopian Government through contacts with the USSR and through the European Community to allow food access corridors.  The Community, under Ireland's Presidency, issued a statement on 23 January deploring attacks on merchant ships in the region due to the risk that such attacks might undermine the international effort to relieve the threat of famine, and reaffirming the Community's determination to assist in relieving suffering and calling on all concerned to facilitate delivery of supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An agreement has very recently been reached between the relief agency of the Ethiopian Government, the Relief and Rehabilitation Commission (RRC) and one of the major non-governmental organisations operating in Ethiopia, the Joint Relief Programme (JRP) on a food access corridor, to run from the port of Massawa down the main highway into <Col N="1003" /> Tigre to Adigrat and possibly further south.  The JRP would operate the supply of food aid along this route.  However, in order to operate on this route the JRP needs to be assured of the co-operation of the rebel organisations who control parts of areas involved.  The JRP is currently seeking this co-operation.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 16 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>I advised the House on 23 November last of the developing EC initiative to assist and encourage the reform process in Eastern Europe.  The EC measures are being co-ordinated with the group of 24 industrialised countries which is under the chairmanship of the European Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since last November there has been a further and still-continuing series of dramatic and welcome events in Central and Eastern Europe.  The Community response, and that of the group of 24, has been keeping pace with events and has been developing to take account of changes in the situation.  The actions under way include short term, emergency medical and food aid for Poland and Romania, trade concessions and EIB loans for suitable projects in Poland and Hungary.  Further measures are under consideration.  The most prominent of these is the proposal for a European Bank <Col N="1004" /> for Reconstruction and Development endorsed by the Strasbourg European Council.  The Community and the other participants are now working intensively to reach agreement on the bank's statute. Proposals for a European training foundation and for a system of university level exchanges with Eastern Europe were presented to the Foreign Affairs Council on 5 February and the intention is to advance them as soon as possible.  Consideration is also being given within the EC to the broader framework of the Community's relations with the States of Central and Eastern Europe.  Work is proceeding on the completion of a network of trade and co-operation agreements between the EC and these countries.</P>
    <P>While the original aid programme was directed at Poland and Hungary, which were in the vanguard of the reform process, extension of the assistance to other states of the region is now likely.  Foreign Ministers of the Twelve at their meeting in Dublin Castle on 20 January signalled their agreement that a positive response should be given to requests from other Central and Eastern European countries which have embarked on political and economic reforms.  Ministers also agreed on the need to respond in a way that was in accordance with the circumstances of each country.</P>
    <P>Emergency aid such as food and medical supplies has been sent on humanitarian grounds.  The purpose of the wider aid effort is to support the inter-linked processes of economic and political reform.  It should assist the countries of Central and Eastern Europe to progress towards the goal they have set themselves of more market-oriented economies.  It is for them to work out what courses they now seek to follow.  The Community, itself made up of states following a range of economic policies, has no one blueprint it seeks to impose on others.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that formulating and delivering a coherent and comprehensive Community response to developments in Central and Eastern Europe is a matter to which as Presidency Ireland will afford priority.</P>

      <P>I avail of every suitable opportunity to raise with the representatives of countries in arrears in respect of UN peacekeeping the desirability of paying these arrears at an early date.  This point has been made to the representatives of the USA and the USSR many times.  I have also discussed the matter with the UN Secretary General, who is deeply concerned about the financial situation of the peacekeeping forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total amount received by Ireland from the United Nations in respect of UNIFIL to date is £59.5 million.  We have also received payments in respect of our <Col N="1007" /> involvement, on a smaller scale, with UNFICYP, UNIIMOG, and UNTAG. The amount still due is £17.7 million of which £17 million relates to UNIFIL and £0.7 million to UNFICYP.</P>
    <P>This deficit arose largely as a result of the failure of Eastern European countries to pay their contributions to UNIFIL.  It grew considerably after 1986, when the USA stopped paying its full assessed contribution to UNIFIL.  The USA and the USSR have the largest arrears in respect of UN peacekeeping.  Both have, however, stated their intention to pay their assessed contributions to UNIFIL in full in the future and to repay the amounts they owe over a number of years.  The Soviet Union have already begun to do this and recently paid a further sum of $40 million towards its UN peacekeeping arrears, half of which is earmarked for UNIFIL.  We expect that our share of this payment will be passed on to us very shortly.  Interest is not payable on the amount outstanding.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that payments in respect of the other peacekeeping operations in which Ireland is involved are not in arrears.</P>

      <P>The Government are closely following and warmly welcome developments in Central and Eastern European states which are leading them towards becoming fully pluralist and democratic societies. We fully support moves under way in the European Community and in the western world to underpin these developments.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>The Irish ambassador in Beijing has not been in a position to visit Tibet during the past year due to the refusal of the Chinese authorities to allow him to do so.  Martial law was declared in Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, on 8 March 1989 and foreigners &mdash; including ambassadors &mdash; were prohibited from visiting the region at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our ambassador has continued to monitor closely the situation in Tibet, especially in relation to human rights. Together with his colleagues from the Twelve, the ambassador has ensured that the Chinese authorities were made fully aware of our concerns in this area.  Speaking on behalf of the Twelve before the <Col N="1011" /> UN Commission on Human rights last week, I called on the Chinese authorities to guarantee full respect for the human rights of their citizens throughout China, including Tibet.</P>
    <P>Ireland recognises the government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal government of China, including Tibet.  I have therefore had no reason to raise the question of independence for Tibet with the Chinese authorities.</P>

      <P>As far as migrants from within the Community are concerned, the treaties and implementing legislation have established a system of protection of their rights, including rights to work and to qualify for social security benefits.  Furthermore, their position is recognised in the social charter adopted at the Strasbourg European Council which sets out principles of equal treatment as regards access to employment, working conditions and social protection in the host country.</P>
      <P>As far as migrants from outside the Community are concerned, I am not aware of any proposals from the Commission on which Council consideration of a charter on the rights of migrants within the European Communities could be based.  Furthermore, there is no reference to such a proposal in the programme of the Commission for 1990 which was delivered to the European Parliament last month.  Therefore, it is unlikely that the possibility of such a charter of rights will come up for discussion during the period of the Irish Presidency of the Council of Ministers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>The treaties establishing the European Communities set out the procedures for dealing with membership applications. These provide that the Council shall act unanimously on an application after consulting the Commission and after receiving the assent of the European Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1015" /> The Austrian application for membership was lodged on 17 July 1989 and the relevant procedures have been invoked.  Pending the outcome of these procedures it would not be appropriate for the Government to express a view on possible future membership of the Community by Austria.</P>
    <P>The Turkish Government formally applied for membership of the European Community on 14 April 1987.  The application was referred to the Commission in accordance with the terms of Article 237 of the EC Treaty.  The Commission has now delivered an opinion on the application to the Council to the effect that it would be inappropriate for the Community to become involved in new accession negotiations at this stage and that the political and economic situation in Turkey is such that it would not be useful at present to open accession negotiations with Turkey.</P>
    <P>However, the Commission opinion emphasises the need to intensify the relationship between the EC and Turkey and suggests the areas in which co-operation could be deepened.  The Foreign Affairs Council of 5 February examined the Commission opinion and noted the intention of the Commission to make concrete proposals regarding enhanced co-operation.  The Council's discussion showed that there was a broad measure of support amongst member states for the approach adopted by the Commission.</P>
    <P>I have been in close contact with representatives of the Government of Turkey in the matter of the Turkish application.  In particular I was happy to welcome to Dublin on 19 January the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for European Affairs, Professor Ali Bozer, who explained the Turkish Government position to me in detail.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42, 49, 59, 85, 86, 87, 88, 96, 97 and 98 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputies to my statement to Dáil Éireann on 14 November 1989 in which I set out clearly the Government's policy in relation to the Cambodian question as it arose last year at the United Nations.  The Government are greatly concerned at reports of Khmer Rouge successes after the Vietnamese withdrawal from Cambodia.  An essential part of Ireland's approach to the question of Cambodia is that everything must be done to prevent the return to power of the Pol Pot Khmer Rouge regime which has been guilty of outrageous crimes against the people of Cambodia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Government policy calls for a just, lasting and comprehensive settlement based on the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cambodia.  This settlement must be based on a process of self-determination by the people of Cambodia in internationally-supervised, free and fair elections.  Neither the Hun Sen administration in Cambodia, which was installed by the Vietnamese invaders, nor the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea, which includes the Khmer Rouge, has received any form of endorsement from the people of Cambodia.  In the absence of such endorsement, the Government of this country have not given their support to either of the two contenders for government power.  Neither have the Government given recognition to any of the <Col N="1019" /> contenders for the government of Cambodia, indeed, it is Ireland's general policy that we recognise states, not governments.</P>
    <P>The withdrawal of Vietnamese invading forces from Cambodia offers an important opportunity for the international community to embark on a sustained effort to achieve a just and lasting settlement.  I believe that the recent Australian initiative, calling for a central role for the United Nations in the administration of Cambodia in the lead-up to free elections, offers a promising way forward towards the goal of restoring peace in Cambodia.  This enhanced UN role would be part of an overall international settlement which would exclude any possibility of a return to power by the genocidal Pol Pot Khmer Rouge.  The Australian proposal also calls for a change in the current unsatisfactory situation regarding the Cambodian seat at the United Nations.  I arranged to meet my Australian counterpart, Senator Gareth Evans, in December last and conveyed to him my support for his initiative. I subsequently wrote to him confirming this support.</P>
    <P>I am happy to note that the Australian initiative is gaining increasing international support.  The Australian proposals were central to the discussions which the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council held in Paris on 15-16 January.  They have also been commented on favourably by a number of the Cambodian parties as well as by a number of countries in the region. The United Nations General Assembly has not yet had an opportunity to consider the Australian proposals.</P>
    <P>The Twelve member states of the European Community, under Ireland's Presidency, have called on all concerned parties to examine in a positive spirit proposals, such as those put forward by Australia, which would involve the strengthening of the role envisaged for the UN in a comprehensive political settlement of the Cambodian conflict.  In a public statement issued on 18 January, <Col N="1020" /> the Twelve also expressed their deep concern at the ongoing conflict in Cambodia and called for an immediate cessation of hostilities and the ending of all forms of external military assistance.  The Twelve called on all concerned parties to turn to dialogue and negotiation as the means to find a comprehensive, just and lasting political solution to the Cambodian problem. They made clear their total rejection of the genocidal policies of the Pol Pot Khmer Rouge and stated explicitly that their non-return to power remains a central element of Twelve policy on Cambodia. I was happy to note that the Twelve's statement addressed most of the issues raised in the Resolution on Cambodia adopted by the European Parliament on 19 January.</P>
    <P>I intend, during the Irish Presidency, to avail of every opportunity open to me to increase the prospects for a just settlement in Cambodia which would finally bring to an end the suffering of the Cambodian people.  Cambodia will be discussed at the ministerial-level meeting between the European Community and the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) later this month.  I intend to avail of the occasion to convey to the Foreign Ministers of the ASEAN countries the urgent need to find a peaceful resolution in Cambodia and I am hopeful that our discussions there can advance the cause of peace in Cambodia.</P>
    <P>I am very conscious of the depth of public feeling on Cambodia in this country and indeed in many other countries.  Since the beginning of November last, my personal office and my Department together have received over 600 communications, by letter or phone, expressing concern at the conflict in Cambodia. Ireland's policy on Cambodia, including our strong conviction that everything must be done to prevent the return to power of the Pol Pot Khmer Rouge, was explained to all inquirers.</P>
    <P>The welfare of the Cambodian people is central to the Government's concerns. The achievement of peace and of a lasting political settlement is, I believe, the key issue for the people of Cambodia, especially for the many Cambodians who are <Col N="1021" /> living in squalor in camps on the border between Thailand and Cambodia.  Without peace, Cambodia will not be enabled to set about the task of economic and social development which is so badly needed to ensure the future welfare of all its people.  When the peace settlement we so earnestly desire has been achieved, I have no doubt that the international community, through the United Nations, and the European Community will be anxious to assist the Cambodian people, through their duly-elected government, in the reconstruction and development of their country.  I can assure Deputies that I will fully support the provision of such aid.</P>
    <P>Pending the achievement of a peace settlement, I believe that it is important that aid of a humanitarian nature be provided to the people of Cambodia, both to those inside the country and to those living in camps in Thailand.  Such aid is already being provided to people in both categories by the EC and the United Nations.  The Government last November provided a sum of £50,000 for humanitarian assistance for people inside Cambodia.  This aid was channelled to the Irish voluntary agency, Concern, which had made an application for humanitarian relief for Cambodia.  The funds were provided for water supplies, child nutrition and logistics.  The implementation of this programme is currently being organised by Concern.</P>
    <P>Applications for co-financing by Irish non-governmental organisations will be considered on their merits and in the light of the availability of resources.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45, 70 and 79 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have stated on a number of occasions to this House, the Government attach the greatest importance to the question of emigration to the United States.  In addition to our successful <Col N="1023" /> efforts to improve the welfare and advice services available to Irish emigrants already in the United States, we have sought to encourage our friends in Congress to promote measures to reform current US immigration legislation which places intending immigrants from this country at a considerable disadvantage. The Donnelly visa programme which was designed specifically to address this disadvantage has, I am pleased to report, resulted in Ireland receiving over 14,000 immigrant visas in the period 1987-89. While figures are not yet available for this US fiscal year, there are some indications that Ireland might hope to receive approximately 7,000 visas before the programme ends on 30 September 1990.  This would mean that we would have received over 50 per cent of the visas available under the Donnelly programme.</P>
    <P>The Donnelly visa programme does not operate a waiting list.  Anybody who is on the list of applicants registered in 1987 could conceivably be selected for a visa between now and the end of the programme in September 1990.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that the Ken-nedy-Simpson Bill was passed by the United States Senate in July of last year. This measure if it became law would provide for the creation of a new immigrant category of 54,000 visas per annum &mdash; 10,000 of which would be set aside for citizens of countries like Ireland &mdash; based on a points system.  The next step in the legislative process is the passing of a similar Bill in the House of Representatives. This process has already started and a number of Bills have been tabled, including one from Congressman Donnelly which would provide for the extension of the Donnelly visa programme.</P>
    <P>I understand that the House of Representatives immigration sub-committee has scheduled hearings for 21 February and 1 March and that the House will then begin discussing their own Bill. I had the opportunity to have discussions with Congressman Donnelly during his recent visit and I am hopeful that real progress on legislative reform may be made this year.  I can assure this House <Col N="1024" /> that the Government will continue to press its friends in Congress on the matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with this ongoing process, I <Col N="1025" /> have recently approved the following improvements: the appointment of additional permanent staff, with the agreement of the Minister for Finance; the renting of further accommodation which has enabled a major internal reorganisation of the office to take place.  This will facilitate the more rapid processing of applications; the further updating of the office's computer system involving the purchase of additional VDUs; the installation of additional telephones and the redecoration of the public waiting area.</P>
    <P>The Department is also planning a publicity campaign in the press and television with the aim of encouraging intending applicants to apply for passports in good time.  This year the campaign will include a particular focus on those intending to travel to Italy for the World Cup finals. As part of the campaign the passport office was represented at the recent Leisure Fair held at the Point Depot at the end of January and dealt with over 8,000 inquirers.  As in previous years I will monitor closely the level of applications and should the need arise I will arrange for extra temporary staff to be employed.</P>
    <P>I would point out that passports are not available on demand, except in cases of genuine emergency.  I would appeal to those intending to holiday abroad this year to check that they have an up-to-date passport and, if not, to apply, by post, in good time.</P>

The Twelve have welcomed the mediation efforts initiated in 1988 by the churches in Mozambique and which are continuing under the auspices of Kenya and Zimbabwe. It is our fervent wish that these may soon bear fruit, so that Mozambique can be free to devote its resources to the development of the country, in keeping with the wishes of the people, who have faced much suffering at the hands of the MNR.  On a practical level, the Community has stated on a number of occasions that it is ready to help Mozambique in its reconstruction and economic development.</P>

However, the Council also pointed out that the measures taken so far have been insufficient when measured <Col N="1029" /> against the Twelve's objective of the total abolition of apartheid.  The Twelve Heads of State and Government reaffirmed the intention of the Twelve to maintain their pressure on the South African authorities to bring about fundamental change in South Africa.  Should the expectations raised by recent developments not be fulfilled, I believe that the Twelve will have to consider increasing the pressure they already exert on South Africa, including the imposition of additional sanctions.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the European Commission has been redirecting moneys which were originally intended for the Third World in order to provide assistance to Eastern European countries; if he supports this practice; if, as President of the Council of Ministers, he will ensure that the provision of aid for Eastern Europe will not result in a reduction in Third World aid; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the European Commission has not redirected any money originally intended for the Third World in order to provide assistance to Eastern European countries.  The funding for the programme of assistance to Eastern Europe comes largely from a separate line in the Community's budget. Three hundred million ECU have been provided for this budget line from unallocated Community funds.  In addition, food aid is being provided to Eastern Europe from savings in the FEOGA system.</P>
      <P>I know that there is concern that our co-operation with developing countries may suffer as a result of our response to the momentous changes in Eastern Europe.  The idea that financial assistance will be diverted is particularly current.  I would like to take this opportunity to allay these concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Community and its <Col N="1030" /> member states together constitute the most important source of assistance to developing countries.  The continuing strength of this relationship was demonstrated vividly by the recent signing of the new Lome Convention.  This Convention provides the framework for the Community's relationship with the ACP group of developing countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific.  Under the Convention, the Community is committed to providing over 12 billion ECU, almost IR£9.5 billion over the next five years.  This represents an increase of almost 40 per cent over the previous Convention. There is no question of these funds being diverted or affected in any other way by events in Eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>With regard to aid to the developing countries in Asia and Latin America, the Commission will shortly present to the Council its reflections on the orientation of this aid in the nineties.  I would not wish at this stage to pre-empt that discussion but I can assure the House that developments in Eastern Europe will not have any detrimental effects on this assistance.</P>

      <P>I have not raised the issue of the forced repatriation of Vietnamese boat people from Hong Kong with the British authorities.  However, the British authorities have kept me, and other Ministers of the Twelve, informed of developments in relation to the boat people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland supports an internationally negotiated and agreed approach to the problem of the Vietnamese boat people. We have therefore endorsed the declaration and comprehensive plan of <Col N="1031" /> action agreed at the International Conference on Indo-Chinese Refugees which took place in Geneva in June 1989.</P>
    <P>This plan represents a step forward by the international community in attempting to solve what is a very difficult and tragic problem.  Under the terms of the plan, Vietnamese who qualify as refugees under the internationally accepted definition of this term will be eligible for resettlement in third countries.  The plan provides that those who are not refugees should return to their country of origin in accordance with international practices reflecting the responsibilities of states towards their own citizens.  At a meeting of the Steering Committee of the Conference in January, agreement was reached that every effort is to be made to encourage those Vietnamese who do not qualify as refugees to return voluntarily to Vietnam.  It was also agreed that such return must be orderly and safely carried out within the multilateral framework of the comprehensive plan of action.</P>
    <P>Ireland has played its part in addressing this tragic problem by accepting since 1979 over 400 Vietnamese for resettlement.</P>

      <P>Our concerns in this regard are fully known and understood by the Israeli authorities.  Directly I became aware of the statement attributed to the Israeli Ambassador, I made clear, in my address <Col N="1032" /> to the Euro-Arab Parliamentary Dialogue on 11 September last, the Government's position that we hold Israel responsible for the actions of the so-called &ldquo;South Lebanon Army&rdquo; (SLA) which Israel arms, trains and finances. Subsequently, at a meeting at the United Nations, I repeated our concerns to the Israeli Foreign Minister in the clearest possible terms.</P>
      <P>More recently, on 21 December last, I had to instruct that the Israeli Embassy in London be advised of our serious concern at the shelling of an Irish UNIFIL post by the &ldquo;South Lebanon Army&rdquo; and at the persistence of firings close to UNIFIL positions.  The Government have since raised the matter directly through our Ambassador to Israel with the Israeli Minister for Defence, to underline that such incidents are unacceptable.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It has not been the practice of the Government to send observers to observe elections in other countries and there is <Col N="1036" /> no budgetary provision to fund such travel.  The Twelve have regularly made their position clear in relation to the five Central American countries and expressed their readiness to support any action which would aim at restoring peace in the area.  They have also asserted their firm belief that it is essential for any country which is either linked to, or has interests in, the region to aid the establishment of peace and democracy in Central America and contribute towards its social and economic development.  The Twelve have welcomed the establishment of the UN observer group on Central America, which by working to ensure the impartial verification of commitments entered into by the Central American Presidents, should renew confidence in the peace process.</P>
    <P>The Twelve welcomed the agreement reached at San-Isidro-de-Coronado in December 1989 which aimed to resolve several serious problems of the region, notably, the demobilisation of the Contras. The Twelve support the process within the region itself aimed at finding a settlement which will include demobilisation of the Contras.</P>
    <P>On 30 June 1986 the European Community signed a co-operation agreement with the countries of Central America which has resulted in the allocation of considerable amounts of aid and assistance to the region.  Ireland as Presidency looks forward to the further development of economic and technical co-operation between the Community and the countries of Central America.</P>

      <P>Under the Army Pensions Act, 1971, the <Col N="1037" /> widow of a military service pensioner qualifies for an allowance of half her deceased husband's pension, subject to a prescribed minimum allowance (currently £547 a year).  Under the Army Pensions Act, 1980, a common flat rate allowance (currently £493 a year) is payable to the widow of a special allowance holder.  This allowance was extended to the widows of other veterans of the War of Independence in 1982, but subject to their satisfying a means test.  The number of recipients of these allowances is currently 5,885.</P>
      <P>Whilst their levels may appear low, I should explain that these allowances are additional to normal social welfare entitlements and are fully exempt from income tax.

      <P>The Government are deeply concerned at reports of violations of human rights in Colombia.  Civil unrest in that country and violations of human rights are largely associated with drug trafficking.  The Twelve have condemned the assassinations in Colombia and have expressed their support for the determination of the Colombian authorities to intensify the struggle against the traffic. The Twelve are convinced that the strengthening of its democratic institutions will enable Colombia to overcome the present difficulties and have signalled their willingness to support Colombia in this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the Taoiseach's meeting with President Gorbachev and the <Col N="1040" /> follow-up meetings in Moscow later in April of last year, considerable activity has been under way to increase economic co-operation with the Soviet Union. Interdepartmental committees have been set up to co-ordinate our approach in this area, and there have been visits to Moscow at official and technical level, as well as follow-up visits by Soviet delegations to Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Government have now identified those areas where co-operation can most usefully be developed and are currently working to conclude a package of measures which will put Irish-Soviet economic relations on a new footing.  We have already reached agreement on a declaration on principles of economic co-operation, and we hope to reach agreement as soon as possible on:</P>
      <P>&mdash;a science and technology agreement</P>
      <P>&mdash;an investment protection agreement</P>
      <P>&mdash;a road transport agreement</P>
      <P>&mdash;a marine research agreement</P>
      <P>Total trade between the two countries has grown by 72 per cent from IR£46.8 million to IR£80.6 million since the Shannon meeting, resulting in the opening of new opportunities for Irish exports, particularly in the dairy and beef sectors, while at the same time we have substantially increased our imports from the USSR, including purchases of an amount of Soviet crude oil by the Irish National Petroleum Corporation (INPC).  There has been considerable activity in the semi-State and private sector in seeking out areas where joint ventures and other new forms of economic co-operation with the Soviet Union might be undertaken.</P>
      <P>With regard to Japan, considerable progress was made in the area of bilateral economic relations during the Taoiseach's visit there in April of last year.  In addition to meetings with the Japanese Government, the Taoiseach had meetings with the Keidanren, the leading business and industrial organisation of Japan, and selected industrialists.</P>
      <P>In the official talks, agreement was reached on the following matters of economic significance:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1041" />&mdash;the holding of economic consultations on a regular basis between Ireland and Japan,</P>
    <P>&mdash;the need for ongoing contact between the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Japanese Ministry for International Trade and Industry (MITI),</P>
    <P>&mdash;the desirability of an investment mission to Ireland sponsored by the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry.</P>
    <P>The first session of the economic consultations took place in Tokyo on 10 October 1989.  Issues discussed included those related to tourism, the FÁS programme for training Irish graduates in Japan, and science and technology matters. The next session is provisionally scheduled to take place in Dublin in July 1990.</P>
    <P>With regard to consultations between the Department of Industry and Commerce and Japanese Ministry for Trade and Industry, the main subject under discussion is the question of Japanese investment in Ireland, including the participation of Japanese companies in the Financial Services Centre.  Within the framework of these consultations, it has been confirmed that the investment mission led by MITI, to which I referred earlier, will visit Ireland from 31 March to 4 April 1990.  While the final list of participants in this mission has yet to be determined, it will include some of the most prestigious names in Japanese business and its composition reflects the Industrial Development Authority's priorities in respect of potential industrial investors from Japan.</P>
    <P>In parallel with these discussions, economic relations with Japan have developed further in 1989, both in terms of trade and industrial development.  In the area of industrial investment, in 1989 six Japanese owned companies announced their intention to locate in Ireland, including enterprises as diverse as Fujitsu Isotec who manufacture printing equipment and Sumitomo Bank who will locate in the International Financial Services Centre.</P>

      <P>Bag limits for shooting by hunters resident in and outside the State are not a requirement under the current open seasons order for shooting wild birds. They are therefore optional on the part of individual shoot operators.</P>

    <P>The impact of all hunting of wild birds is monitored and reviewed on an ongoing basis by the Wildlife Service of the Office of Public Works.  This is to ensure that the exploitation of wild bird species does not adversely affect their conservation status having regard to the requirements of the Wildlife Act, 1976.  If the population of any game species is likely to be adversely affected or threatened by the impact of shooting or other pressures, appropriate measures may be taken <Col N="1045" /> under the Wildlife Act to deal with the matter.</P>

      <P>In order to qualify for the free fuel allowance, a person must satisfy certain conditions, one of which requires that the applicant is unable to provide for his/her own heating needs.

    <P>In relation to the course in the college the position is that a range of full time courses in engineering, science and business studies including languages will be provided for approximately 700 students when the college becomes fully operational. Part-time and vocational apprentice type courses will be provided for approximately a further 500 students. These are tentative estimates only.  The <Col N="1058" /> precise nature and level of individual courses and associated enrolments will be determined following further consultations with interested parties and will as far as possible cater for the needs of the local area taking account of existing training and education resources and the requirements of local industry.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 133 and 134 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Deputy MacGiolla on 1 February on the status of Bord Fáilte's development for growth document and the operational programme for tourism prepared under the National Development Plan 1989-1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Included in the tourism operational programme under a scheme for private sector tourism development is a provision for grant aiding the development of water, field and adventure sports specifically for tourists.  The scheme is administered by Bord Fáilte and SFADCo in the mid-west.  Details of eligibility, <Col N="1059" /> application procedures and moneys available are set out in the programme which has been lodged in the Dáil Library.</P>
    <P>I would draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that one of the specific eligibility criteria for aid under the programme is that promoters must &ldquo;demonstrate that the project is in harmony with the local environment.&rdquo;  The development of water, field and adventure sports under the programme will be entirely consistent with a responsible approach to wildlife conservation.</P>
