    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say at the outset that I am very unhappy with the way in which we are approaching this debate.  We are essentially being asked to debate the future of Bord na Móna completely in a vacuum.  The Minister's predecessor commissioned a consultancy report the findings of which were never made public.  The feeling is that it has been committed to the wastepaper bin. In any case we certainly have not seen the proposals that those consultants were making for the future of Bord na Móna. Yet we are discussing today a major restructuring of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are also in a vacuum in that we do not know whether the Minister proposes that the existing divisions of Bord na Móna should be established as private companies.  We do not know how the <Col N="887" /> Minister will approach the need for capital restructuring within Bord na Móna which is going to become a very pressing problem.  The Minister has not, as yet, sanctioned the publication of the board's annual report but the dogs in the street are reporting that the losses are of the order of £80 million to £90 million and that the board, after those reports are published, will, technically, not be able to meet their liabilities with their assets and will, therefore, face a serious crisis of some sort in which the Government must become involved.  We do not know how the Government intend to deal with the restructuring needed and we do not know how each division of Bord na Móna is fareing.</P>
    <P>We are approaching this Bill in a vacuum.  Indeed, when this Bill was introduced in November, 1988 I made precisely these points, that we were in the dark as to where Bord na Móna were going and that we were being asked to approve a Bill involving the restructuring of the board without knowing what was in the Minister's mind.  We are now in February 1990 and we still do not know what is in the Minister's mind, and that is a very unsatisfactory way to proceed. I am hoping that in the course of this debate we will not just see the Minister respond to the letter of the different amendments but that he give us some impression of the way he sees the board evolving with the help of this new Bill.</P>
    <P>In moving amendment No. 2 to section 2 I am trying to sharpen the nature of the relationship between the proposed subsidiary boards that are to be established and the parent board, and the Minister in his response to this amendment last week suggested that they were introducing too many restrictions.  I beg to differ, in paragraph 6 (a) of my amendment I am requiring that the board would no longer have to have the sanction of the Minister for Finance for investment of a limited extent in new companies and I set the figure at £10 million.</P>
    <P>It is about time that we faced up to the <Col N="888" /> situation that if we are to have commercial State bodies performing commercially they cannot be going back to the Minister for Energy and the Minister for Finance for sanction for every little thing they do.  The Ceann Comhairle has extended the debate to other sections of the Bill on this proposed amendment. Some of the proposals in this Bill are ludicrous.  We have a situation where if the board want to execute building works, if they want to embark on research of any kind whatsoever, they will have to get sanction not just from the Minister, which is ridiculous enough, but from the Minister here and the Minister for Finance.  If one employs a dog, one should not do the barking oneself but under the proposed amendments here the Minister is requiring that both himself and the Minister for Finance would do the barking in respect of Bord na Móna. I cannot see the sense of that and I would like to hear the Minister's response.</P>
    <P>Subsection (6) (b) of my amendment to section 2 suggests that there be fair trading rules.  However, the Minister and Deputy Sherlock suggested this would be overly restrictive on Bord na Móna but the wording is that it only applies &ldquo;if the Minister has reason to believe the proposed company might take a dominant position in the market liable to conspire against the public interest&rdquo;.  This is enabling legislation and we do not know what the board intend to do when they enter new business.  The ESB proposed entering the business of coal trading and have entered into the trade of brown goods.  Both ventures provoked strong reaction and there were accusations that the ESB were adopting a dominant market position by entering these businesses. I am not convinced that the ESB are adopting a dominant position. Regrettably the ESB have not moved on the coal venture but they have been established in the brown goods trade market for some time, and eventually the Minister for Industry and Commerce referred the matter to the Fair Trade Commission for a ruling.</P>
    <P>If we genuinely believe there is a danger of a dominant market position <Col N="889" /> being adopted by a State board entering a new business, we should look at this at the outset and not wait for years &mdash; as has been the case in the ESB &mdash; and perhaps do serious damage to legitimate traders if the accusations hold up, and eventually find the matter referred to the Fair Trade Commission.  All I am suggesting is that where the board are establishing a business and the Minister fears there may be a danger in this regard, it would be much simpler and cleaner at the outset to refer the matter to the Fair Trade Commissioner who would establish rules as to what constitutes fair trade. That would be better than waiting, as in the case of the ESB and then doing the same thing later.</P>
    <P>Responding to subsection (6) (c) in my amendment the Minister said he could instruct such accounts to be published. That is fine, but in this House we will have only one chance to decide how we would like to see things done.  The Minister has not in the past instructed Bord na Móna to publish separate accounts of the different divisions.  We do not know how the milled peat division or the horticultural division are doing financially.  I believe that is relevant information to which any Member of this House should have access.  The Minister has not taken the trouble to instruct them about the manner in which they present their accounts so that we would have that clarity. I am not convinced by the Minister assuring us that he has these powers because he has not bothered to exercise them in a way I think would give us reasonable information.  I still maintain that the board should publish separate accounts in respect of their separate ventures.</P>
    <P>In subsection (6) (d) in the context of presenting accounts and the success of the different ventures, I am requiring that the board should do the same as is done in the planning field.  At present each State board must have a five year plan projecting where they are going in the future.  Equally, after five years trading, Bord na Móna should report to the Dáil on how those ventures are performing and where they see their future.  It would <Col N="890" /> be very useful where the board are entering into new joint ventures for them to provide a report on a regular basis, and this would be a new element of the five year planning cycle that is already there.</P>
    <P>In subsection (5) of my amendment I am requiring that the relationship between the board and any subsidiary or joint venture that they establish, should be on a normal arms length basis, that the company can put equity into a new venture but they would not give preferential loans or continuing subsidies to the new venture.  The Minister suggested that normal commercial companies would be involved in providing subsidies or preferential loans to their subsidiaries. I gravely doubt that, in the case of large companies which establish subsidiaries, it is the practice to give preferential loans to their subsidiary companies.  I think they adopt at arms length attitude to those companies and that they require them to stand alone once the equity investment has been made.</P>
    <P>The logic of what I am suggesting is that the relationship should be of that nature and that there would not be a continuing subsidisation from the parent company, either by way of preferential loans or any other way to a venture that is supposed to be profitable.  In the long-term it would not be satisfactory if we found that the survival of the new ventures which State companies entered into was only guaranteed by preferential treatment from the parent company. That should be put into the Bill.  If the parent company want to help a subsidiary, it should be by way of new equity investment and not by way of continuing subsidy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I replied to some of these points when the Bill was before the Dáil last week.  I should like to remind the Deputy and the House of the purpose of the Bill, which I said on Second Stage, is to promote, form, take part in or acquire companies, delegate some of the functions of the board to sub-boards, and to engage in activities not strictly related to peat.  We are now on Committee Stage and I do <Col N="891" /> not think it is appropriate that the capital structure of the company or the annual accounts for the past year are strictly relevant to the powers we are proposing to give Bord na Móna under this Bill.  I accept that in the context of the overall development of Bord na Móna they are important, but these are matters that have to be dealt with separately, and I have already explained to the House that the annual report referred to was only made available to me in recent times.  It has been carefully examined and appropriate decisions will be made by me following full consideration by my Department on whatever steps are deemed to be necessary.  I do not feel free to go into that matter here and I trust the Deputy opposite will accept that.</P>
      <P>The primary function of the Bill is to give commercial freedom to Bord na Móna.  The main thrust of the Deputy's amendments would leave Bord na Móna in a position where they would not have the same commercial freedom as is available to other companies in the private sector.  One has to accept that there will be, of necessity, restrictions on a State-sponsored commercial company, but outside those which are absolutely essential, it is my intention &mdash; and I hope the intention of the House &mdash; to allow State-sponsored companies, such as Bord na Móna, the maximum possible commercial freedom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said last week, it is my intention and the intention of the board at all times that should business practice would obtain in relation to any subsidiary companies to be established.  However, I do not consider it necessary that this should be provided for by statute as suggested by Deputy Bruton.  If it is considered that the relationship between Bord na Móna, the parent company, and any of their subsidiary companies should be subject to certain controls, there is provision to deal with that on an administrative basis under section 2 (6) of the Bill.  I suggest that is the best way to deal with that particular matter to ensure that we are not placing too many restrictions on the <Col N="892" /> commercial operations of Bord na Móna as suggested in subsection (5) (a), (b) and (c) of the Deputy's amendment.  In subsection (6) (a) the Deputy refers to the limit of £10 million.  Only where that figure is exceeded should the consent of the Minister for Finance be sought.  The Minister for Finance guarantees all Bord na Móna's borrowing and total borrowings at present are approximately £186 million.  It is desirable that the standard practice of seeking the approval of the Minister should be used in all cases before the board make any further commitments. It is standard practice that the relevant Minister &mdash; in this case, the Minister for Energy &mdash; and the Minister for Finance would both have to give approval.</P>
    <P>Extensive powers are being provided for Bord na Móna under section 2 to found new subsidiary companies, to participate or to take a share in others, to take over companies, to lend or to guarantee loans for a company.  It is only right that the consent of the Ministers should be required, as provided for in section 2 (6).  Some of these companies may be in other countries or, if in this country, their purpose may be to engage in developments abroad.  This is a major expansion of the powers of Bord na Móna and an extension of commercial freedom. The House will wish them well in availing of these powers to establish successful enterprises abroad, as they are already doing.</P>
    <P>I see little effectiveness in the ceiling of £10 million proposed by Deputy Bruton. There could be several transactions up to this figure, amounting to vast sums which would pass without the sanction of the Minister for Finance.  I would not be happy to stand over such a provision.  We have a necessary safeguard which has always been operated and it should not lightly be set aside.  I believe the Oireachtas would support my view and I would ask the Deputy to reconsider that suggestion.</P>
    <P>While this section relates to financial limits, it will be noted that apart from marketing at home and abroad, activities being opened up by this Bill in foreign <Col N="893" /> countries are generally subject to the Minister's control.</P>
    <P>In his proposed subsection (6) (b) Deputy Bruton refers to the need to refer any proposed company trading in the home market to the Fair Trading Commission to establish fair trading rules. The Fair Trade Commission have wide ranging powers already under the Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Act, 1987.</P>
    <P>If the Fair Trade Commissioner feels that Bord na Móna are operating in an anti-competitive manner he may initiate an investigation of their practices.  He has the same powers in relation to other companies and it would be discriminatory to single out Bord na Móna in the manner proposed in the amendment.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has power to ask the Fair Trade Commission to carry out an investigation into any company which he suspects is operating in an anti-competitive manner.  I do not have to remind Deputy Bruton that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has exercised these powers in relation to the activities of the Electricity Supply Board. The amendment seems to be completely superfluous since it would impose a restriction on the freedom of Bord na Móna to operate in the commercial world on the same terms as far as possible as other private companies.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposes in subsection (6) (c) that the board should publish each year a full set of accounts in respect of the ventures established under this section.  The statutory framework of section 59 (1) of the 1946 Act is already in place to enable the Minister to direct Bord na Móna as to the form of their accounts.  In addition, under section 2 (6) of this Bill the power of the board to set up subsidiary companies is subject to the approval of the Minister for Energy and the Minister for Finance and suitable conditions concerning the accounts of subsidiary companies may be attached to that approval if deemed necessary.  The accounts of these subsidiary companies must conform as laid down in the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1986.  The subsidiary companies will be operating in <Col N="894" /> a competitive environment and it would be unfair to require them to disclose information which their competitors will not have to disclose.  Bord na Móna may be obliged to furnish detailed accounts to the Minister but they would not be for publication.</P>
    <P>In subsection (6) (d) of the amendment Deputy Bruton suggests that the board should present the Minister every five years with an assessment of each venture established under the section.  As a commercial organisation, Bord na Móna will be expected to assess continually the performance of their subsidiary companies. It is considered that the inclusion of a statutory requirement is not warranted. If deemed necessary, suitable conditions may be attached to the Minister's approval under section 2 (6).  Since the activities or operations will be an integral part of Bord na Móna operations, there is no justification for such an assessment to be furnished to the Minister on an individual basis.  Such an exercise is properly a duty of the management and the board, not only for each venture established but for each and all operations.</P>
    <P>I have not been convinced that the amendments suggested by Deputy Bruton should be accepted.  I recommend that the House should oppose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would return specifically to two points.  The Minister is proposing here that sanction be required from himself as Minister for Energy and from the Minister for Finance to do the following: execute engineering and building works of any kind whatsoever and research of any kind whatsoever which the board in their discretion consider desirable.  If the board decided tomorrow to spend £100 on research or to build a shed beside one of their bogs, not only would they have to go to the Minister for Energy but also to the Minister for Finance to get agreement.  The Minister says I am trying to put into statute things that are the normal managerial function of the board.  The opposite is the case.  The Minister is introducing a requirement on the board that no <Col N="895" /> commercial operation would ever have to envisage.  The same is true of many other functions which will require sanction from both Ministers such as the purchasing of assets, entering into agreements for jointly performing a function, establishing a joint company, the acquisition of bogs or any other lands. All these things will require duplicate sanction regardless of their scale.  If it is only a very small investment the board will still require dual sanction.  That is a charter for bureaucratic involvement in the commercial running of this company that would not be in the public interest.</P>
      <P>Regarding annual reports and accounts, it is very frustrating in trying to assess the operations of Bord na Móna, as it is our duty to do, that we do not know, for example, whether their peat briquette activity is performing commercially, how their supplies to the electricity generating stations are performing commercially or how their horticultural peat operation is performing commercially. We have a legitimate right to that information, provided, as the Minister says, it would not create unfair advantage to some competitor.  In most of those cases there are no competitors and in many of the cases their competitors in the solid fuel market would normally provide information on their accounts under the normal obligations of private companies. Will the Minister say why he has not taken the trouble to exercise his rights, to allow us see how the company are performing so that we can, in the exercise of our duties, be better informed?  Perhaps the Minister would comment on those two points &mdash; the extent to which dual and ministerial sanction will stretch into the activities of the company and the format he will be obliging companies to meet in the future in presenting their accounts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about a commercial enterprise, albeit a State-sponsored one.  My desire is only to apply the absolutely necessary restrictions so as to leave the company as free as possible <Col N="896" /> to operate in the commercial world without unnecessary disadvantage because of being a State body.  There is, as the Deputy knows the temptation on the part of the political head or on the part of Members of this House to seek to dictate, interfere, suggest, recommend, influence or pressurise State companies.  When one looks at the overall situation one cannot but conclude that if these additional pressures were allowed to develop it would seriously impede the State company from operating successfully in the marketplace.</P>
      <P>I remember a time when questions to Ministers with regard to State-sponsored bodies were not allowed.  That has been changed, rightly, but at the same time we have to be very careful not to introduce legislation which would make it practically impossible for the State companies to operate.  The Deputy will have to understand that in regard to the matters he raised, capital expenditure by Bord na Móna is established on an annual basis. That is built into the Estimates presented to the House.  That is the only restriction that applies with regard to the company's expenditure during the year.  It must be clear to the Deputy that individual expenditure on buildings, for instance, would not need separate sanction on each occasion.  A company operating commercially must be left free to make those decisions within the agreed capital programme. The erection of buildings are not subject to ministerial controls within the State although the Bill introduces controls with regard to erecting buildings in another country.  The Deputy can take it that any building to be erected within the State does not require individual ministerial sanction.  The only control relates to the capital programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I am exceptionally dense, but I read section 7 of the Bill as saying that</P>
      <P>(1)  in the performance and exercise of its functions in or outside the State, the board may do all or any of the following:&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>among which are included &ldquo;execute <Col N="897" /> engineering and building works of any kind whatsoever and research of any kind whatsoever&rdquo; and then we go on and say that it will require Department of Finance and Department of Energy sanction for all of this.  Perhaps the ministerial practice is that it only requires approval of the capital programme, but if that is the case why does the Minister not write that into the Bill?  The Minister is giving some future Minister an extraordinary power to crawl all over what we hope is a commercial company, in this section. If the Minister is right, maybe a simple change of words would clarify the point.</P>
    <P>The Minister's suggestion that I am in some way encouraging political interference or that this lurks somewhere under the surface of the intention of my amendment is beside the point.  I am saying that each company must certainly be responsible for their performance and must have a duty to report their performance fully.  I am looking for a fuller report of their performance, that is all.  I am not looking for a right to interfere in the company's behaviour.  We have a right to know how the company are doing.  The Minister's suggestion that the Dáil wanting to know how these companies are doing is political interference, is completely beside the point.</P>
    <P>We do not seem to be getting very far, and I hope I am not holding up other Members who would like to comment, but it is a fundamental principle of our attitude to State companies that they should not be required to be answerable to civil servants for the tiniest of their actions and that they give a full account to the taxpayer as to how they are performing at the end of the day.  We need a commercial sector that knows it will be judged on its performance, free of excessive bureaucratic interference.  The purpose of the two amendments on which I am concentrating, regarding the sanction of the Department of Finance and the publication of accounts, is to sharpen up that focus.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In this section Bord na Móna are empowered to establish sub-boards which we are led to believe &mdash; although the Minister has not confirmed it &mdash; would be involved in running the divisions of their business. Their primary function would be as sub-boards for the horticultural peat division, the solid fuel division and so on.  As the Bill is now drafted the only people who can sit on those sub-boards are members of the parent board.  The purpose of having a subsidiary board is to bring new blood to a particular section of a company's business.  That new blood would be partly from outside the company but also from within it.  It could be workers, an executive within the company running the division or it could be new people <Col N="900" /> from outside the company who might have a particular skill, for example, in marketing on the Continent which might be very appropriate to the horticultural peat sub-board if they are established.</P>
    <P>I cannot see that there is any sense in the Minister restricting the members of sub-boards to the existing members of the parent board because it would mean that members of the parent board would be overstretched by having to attend maybe several different sub-board meetings. They could not give each meeting the attention it deserves and yet the Minister's provision will be keeping out new ideas from outside the board.  In this amendment I propose that we allow the board more discretion so that they are establishing sub-boards they can consider anyone inside or outside the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3 of the Bill provides for the establishment of sub-board structures, a development which we welcome.  Subsection (2) says that a sub-board shall consist of the managing director and such number, not being less than three or more than six, of other members of the board as the board shall, subject to subsection (3), from time to time determine.  We are anxious that an element of democratic representation should be ensured on these sub-boards and our amendment simply requires that at least one of the workers should be among the directors appointed.  There are 12 directors on the main board of which four are worker-directors.  It seems reasonable that any sub-board structure, which would include between three and six directors, should include at least one worker-director.  It would be a negation of democracy if this did not happen.  I ask the Minister to accept this amendment in <Col N="901" /> the spirit of protecting the limited element of industrial democracy which workers have won over the years.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton pointed out that appointing people within the board may have the effect of putting responsibility on those who are already overburdened. There is no doubt that people have been appointed to boards who have no interest in them apart from attending meetings. That does not apply to everybody but people within the present board structure, particularly worker-directors, would have a greater interest than people from outside.  I am aware of the number of people sitting on boards of different companies who take very little interest in them.  I have experience of the factory floor and the interest of workers and worker-directors in that structure.  Nobody is better equipped to serve on a board or sub-board of a company than the people who are directly representing workers because they are involved in the day-to-day working of the company and can bring their expertise to the board.  Such people may also have great business acumen and far more interest than some of those appointed to boards.  I have some reservations about people from outside the company being appointed.</P>

      <P>There is validity in Deputy Sherlock's amendment having regard to the existing structure of legislation for the composition of the parent board involving a minimum of four worker directors.  It would be very undesirable to have a sub-board elected without a continuation of that representation, right down to the bottom line of management. I strongly urge the Minister to accede to that request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to draw the attention of the Members of the House to the fact that section 2 gives power to Bord <Col N="902" /> na Móna to establish or acquire companies. Under section 3 &mdash; which we are now discussing &mdash; the Bill will give power to the boards to establish sub-boards. The primary purpose of sub-boards is to allow any matter to be considered in depth by part of the board rather than the entire board as at present.  In accordance with the Turf Development Act, 1946, it is the Government who appoint the members of the board of Bord na Móna. The Minister is agreeable to the board appointing sub-boards but I am confining membership of the sub-boards to members of the main board because it is the Government who appoint the members of the main board.  If they are to delegate part of their function to a sub-board, then it would not be appropriate for them to delegate it to a sub-board which had on it persons who were not members of the main board.</P>
      <P>The appointment of sub-boards is to allow the board to carry out their functions more efficiently but it would be a serious dilution of their authority if persons on the main board, such as management, staff or persons from outside the company, were allowed to serve on those sub-boards.  Those sub-boards will act under and within delegated authority and when they so act they bind the board. If other expertise is required from time to time there are recognised ways of availing of it.  The primary justification for the new sub-boards is maximum effectiveness and no other.  There may be a misunderstanding about this, that the section under which sub-boards will be established is the section under which separate companies, the different divisions, might be established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The &ldquo;divisionalisation&rdquo; of Bord na Móna will facilitate the establishment of three separate companies eventually if it is deemed necessary by the board to do so.  At present we have one company with three divisions and the sub-board idea could be used to oversee the actions of those divisions, but there is a distinction between sub-boards and companies.  I should like to tell Deputy Sherlock that it is the board's intention to appoint at least one of the worker directors to each <Col N="903" /> of the sub-boards.  It would also be open to the Minister to attach such a condition when giving his consent to the appointment of the sub-boards.  It would not be appropriate to single out worker directors in legislation in the manner proposed. Obviously, the board would wish that a board range of skills and background would be represented on each of the sub-boards, but it is not necessary to specify that in legislation.  The Deputy can be assured that it is the intention that the worker directors would be represented on any sub-boards established.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not happy with the Minister's response.  As I understand it it is the intention that sub-boards will be overseeing divisions and not simply sub-committees considering a problem as the Minister seemed to suggest.  There was confusion in what the Minister said. If it is simply a question of establishing a sub-committee to consider some knotty problem I do not believe legislative sanction is needed.  The board could decide that three of their members should study that knotty problem and report back to the board in a week's time.  That is not what is intended.  We would not need any legislative authority for such a move.  We are talking about a sub-board that will oversee on an ongoing basis the commercial operations of divisions of the company. As I understand it, that is what is meant by the delegation of functions to a sub-board.  If that is the case the running of a particular commercial division of Bord na Móna should not be confined solely to members of the parent board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will almost certainly be a chief executive of those divisions and he or she should not be excluded from the sub-board. That person will be dealing on a day-to-day basis with the commercial operations of the company and should be on the sub-board just as the managing director of the overall company is on the parent board.  The Minister has suggested that the reason he did not want to relax this change was because the decisions made by the sub-board would bind the parent board.  He could certainly cover <Col N="904" /> himself in that regard.  Once the parent board is represented on the sub-board, and the managing director of the overall company is represented on the sub-board, he can have absolute confidence that any decision made by that sub-board binding the parent company will not be one that will be unknown to the parent board.  I cannot see how the Minister's argument holds up.</P>
    <P>The Minister offered as a second reason for rejecting the amendment the fact that the members of the board are appointed by the Government.  The Minister said he does not want to see new appointments being made by Bord na Móna to their sub-board activities; that would not be subject to Government sanction.  I am not convinced that Government sanction is necessary for a decision like this but if the Minister feels that Government approval of the appointment of outsiders or insiders is necessary, then I am willing to accept an addition to my amendment to the effect that the Minister should be consulted on the appointment of those people.  In principle, there is no point in establishing divisions and giving them an overseeing sub-board if at the end of the day the same people will be appointed.  The Minister should bring in new blood, he should bring in the chief executive of the division and any person who can make the venture a greater success.  I do not see any point in binding the hands of Bord na Móna to appoint existing board members.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to change my view on this matter.  The sub-boards will act in matters which will be delegated to them by the main board and it would be highly inappropriate to include other persons outside those already appointed to the main board on any such sub-board.  That would be so because the decisions of the sub-board will be binding on the main board.  The delegated authority will be binding and it would be highly inappropriate to have any other person acting on the sub-board who did not have authority to act on the main board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="905" /> I can see merit in the Deputy's suggestion that there should be fresh ideas brought in and it may be that he is suggesting that we should expand the main board but I cannot concede the principle that people should be allowed to operate on a sub-board which has the level of authority provided in the Bill while not holding membership of the main board following appointment by the Government. That would be a serious erosion of the whole principle involved and I cannot see my way to accepting that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The main point I was making was that any board which would include between three and six directors should have at least one worker director. I must point out that worker directors are elected to the main board and others are appointed by the Government.  It would be a negation of democracy if the majority appointed to the sub-boards were those who were elected.  I will leave this to the Minister to consider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am gravely disappointed with the Minister's response. He is referring to two red herrings.  He is saying that the sub-board would bind the parent board and that the Government have to appoint everyone and that their authority would be diluted.  I have already acknowledged that I would be happy to allow the Minister alter my amendment so that the Government would have the chance to approve these people.  I would stick to my guns also and say that if we want a sub-board who can successfully penetrate the Dublin solid fuel market with peat briquettes or who can successfully penetrate the continental market for horticultural peat, we need people who have particular skills in marketing geared to those markets.  There are other persons outside of the existing board who would be well tuned to those particular problems of that commercial division but who would not necessarily need to be involved in all the other activities of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The financial soundness of the relationship between sub-boards and the parent <Col N="906" /> will be guaranteed by having the managing director of the company and many other members of the parent board.  The Minister conceded the principle that there are others outside who might bring new ideas to these operations.  Having conceded the principle he goes back to his brief and says: &ldquo;No, it would dilute my authority, it would dilute the authority of the board and I will not have it.&rdquo;  I cannot see the reasoning behind the Minister's view.  I think that what I am proposing is a very reasonable amendment that would improve the operation of this section.  I would ask the Minister to seriously reconsider what he is suggesting because I cannot see that his arguments will hold water, I cannot see any danger to either Government or board authority in what I am suggesting.  The Minister should debate this on the merits of whether there are new skills that could be brought into the horticultural peat area or the Dublin markets which Bord na Móna are trying to penetrate.  If he considers it on that commercial basis he will come up with the answer: &ldquo;yes, it would be useful to have new people on to these activities.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot concede the principle that persons on a sub-board who are exercising delegated authority from a main board, which has the power of binding the main board, should include on it persons who are not appointed to the main board.  I did not concede any other principle either in my earlier reply other than to state that in the appointment of the members of the main board it is up to the Government to seek to have represented there the various skills which they feel would be beneficial to a board of this nature.  One does not see members of the board going out and knocking on doors selling briquettes in Dublin or in France.  It is a matter for the board to lay down the broad policy and the strategy for the company and to determine investment policy in regard to the company.</P>

We would be mixing up two areas of responsibility here.  The board lay down policy which oversees the operation of the company on behalf of the Oireachtas.  I am sorry I cannot accede the principle enunciated in the Deputy's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Again the Minister is not facing up to the issue I am trying to put.  No one is suggesting that members of the board should go around knocking on doors selling horticultural peat.  The point is, as the Minister recognises, that it is vital that there be a good marketing strategy if they are to successfully penetrate the horticultural peat market on the Continent.  The skills needed to frame such a strategy by a sub-board are very different from the skills needed to frame a strategy to sell milled peat to the ESB &mdash; a sole contractor with no real marketing element in it.  There it is a question of efficient production and managing a business that is well known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The business of penetrating the continental market is new territory for the board.  It is something for which you need not only new executives who know what they are doing in the field but also new members of the board who appreciate the importance of a marketing strategy that will succeed in penetrating the continental European market.  The same can be said of the Dublin solid fuel market. Bord na Móna have made commendable progress in penetrating the Dublin market in the last year or so but they are still a very minor player in that market. An enormous opportunity is opening up for them this coming October when bituminous coal will be banned and peat briquettes will be a smokeless fuel available on the Dublin market.  Again, that needs a good marketing strategy and people on a sub-board who are skilled in that area and who would be well positioned to advise the sub-board on how to approach that problem.  The different <Col N="908" /> divisions of Bord na Móna are different in their requirements from board members. New people who can advise on the particular new problems that the sub-boards will encounter are needed.  It would be different if these were long-term established operations in the marketplace but both the penetration of the Dublin market and the penetration of the continental European horticultural peat market are entirely virgin fields in many ways.  The company have been only scratching at the surface of the opportunities there.  The Minister should look again at this section.  If he would like time to consider it I would be happy to withdraw the amendment at this stage and reintroduce it on Report Stage when he has had a chance to consult more widely on it.  This is a fundamental error in the approach the Government are taking to what would otherwise be a very valuable initiative for the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not disposed towards changing my mind on this amendment.  I am adhering strictly to the principle I have already enunciated.  I am glad the Deputy has referred to the sale of briquettes and the success which Bord na Móna have achieved over the past year, in particular in the Dublin market.  It had been a matter of great concern to me that Bord na Móna had not succeeded in establishing greater levels of sales throughout the country but particularly in the Dublin market.  I am glad that over the past 12 months they have made a major improvement.</P>

      <P>The point I want to make is that the situation that existed and which continues to exist for this season in the Dublin market in relation to the distribution system was one which did not operate to the benefit of Bord na Móna, <Col N="909" /> which is a State commercial company, which produces an indigenous solid fuel material of low smoke value and which provides employment for substantial numbers of people in Ireland.  It was a matter of great regret that the board had to report to me last year that they had to close down temporarily two of their briquette manufacturing plants because the sales were not matching production. I found that very disturbing in a country where we are importing such vast quantities of a fuel which was deemed to be unhealthy and unfriendly to the environment here.  The Deputy might care to acknowledge that it was this Government who took a step in relation to that matter, a step which I hope will open up new opportunities for expanded sales of Irish briquettes on the home market which will substantially improve the environment in relation to smoke levels, provide much needed employment and give an assurance to those at present employed in this industry of a continuation of that employment at reasonable levels.  The matter should have been looked at and tackled long before now.  However, it is only in recent times that that issue has been faced up to.</P>

The present position is very unsatisfactory and this will continue to be the case during this season.  However, as and from 1 October next year, a rew régime will be in place.  I hope that Bord na Móna will not have to face the difficulties they had to contend with in the Dublin market from that time on.  I expect to see a substantial increase in briquette sales.  Bord na Móna share of the solid fuel market is 14 per cent but this is increasing.  For example during the past year there has been a 60 per cent rise in sales in the Dublin area.  This may seem an enormous increase but it is from a much too small base.  I hope to see a substantial increase in the volume of briquettes sold in the Dublin area next year.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(6)  The Board shall publish a report annually on the accounts and performance of each sub-board as a separate arms length activity.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is simply that the House would be informed of the financial performance of the sub-boards. I understand that Bord na Móna will be running their horticultural peat division, solid fuel division and the briquette division separately and I suggest that the board should present separate accounts for each of the divisions so that we know how each enterprise is performing.  To judge from the Minister's earlier comments he is not happy to enshrine in legislation the requirement to provide detailed annual reporting and he instead referred to his own powers.  However, as I mentioned earlier, the Minister has not chosen to exercise his powers and perhaps he would consider instructing the board when the sub-boards are established to run the divisions, to furnish accounts for those divisions as separate activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear <Col N="916" /> that with the appointment of the sub-boards it is not intended to break up Bord na Móna which seems to be implied in the Deputy's amendment that we would have separate accounts for separate divisions. It is intended to facilitate the speeding up of the decision making process at board level.  That is the purpose of the sub-boards as proposed and it will also give the members of the board an opportunity of considering matters in greater detail.  A sub-board could give special attention to particular operations or divisions and the question of separate accounts would not arise therefore. Where Bord na Móna carry on an activity under company form, accounts of course will be available.  The Minister already has the necessary legislative power under the 1946 Act to direct the board as to the form of their annual report and accounts. The amendments Deputy Bruton has tabled give the impression that the sub-boards would act as separate companies. If the main board decide to establish separate companies for each of these divisions they may do so and a separate board of directors could be appointed through the usual procedures as laid down in the various Acts.  That has not been proposed.  All that has happened is the divisionalisation of the existing operation of Bord na Móna and the facilitating of the creation of sub-boards under this Bill who would oversee the operation of those various divisions.  The Deputy's amendment seems to indicate that the separate divisions would operate in the same way as separate companies would and thus would require the publishing of separate annual reports for each of the sub-boards.  That is not the intention at all.  The main board continue to have overall responsibility and in the accounts of the main board a report will appear on the operation of each of the various divisions within the company.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Minister to what he said in the House only a few moments ago, that the logic behind the establishment of divisions was ultimately to establish separate companies.

      <P>In the ESB accounts one finds separate presentations of their appliance trading division, fisheries division and so on and one can see how the different divisions are performing. However, if you open the accounts of Bord na Móna you will not be able to see how the different divisions are performing. I am requesting that the Minister by way of accepting legislative amendments or by an administrative order, if he choses to do so, allow us have information about the separate divisions and how they are performing financially.</P>

Obviously future accounts would make reference to the operations under the various divisions, in the same way as the ESB accounts are presented.  It is within the umbrella of the Bord na Móna company that these accounts would be presented, not in a separate form as if they were three separate companies.  They are only divisions and sub-boards of the main company. Reference to their performance will appear in the accounts of Bord na Móna.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 4, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4. &mdash;(1) The Board shall transfer to such sub-boards the assets, valued according to their audited worth to the Board, necessary to execute the delegated function, along with such liabilities determined by its auditors to be supportable by that sub-board operating at optimum efficiency.</P>
      <P>(2)  Any surplus of borrowings after the auditors have settled the levels supportable by sub-boards, shall be carried by the Board.</P>
      <P>(3)  The Board shall apply to the service of these borrowings&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  dividends remitted by the sub-boards,</P>
      <P>(b)  the product of a levy as shall be set from time to time by the Board on peat extracted by the sub-boards from the bogs, and</P>
      <P>(c)  an appropriation as shall be set from time to time by the Minister, after consultation with the Minister for Finance.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment goes to the heart of the <Col N="919" /> problem of Bord na Móna.  It is disappointing that the Bill does not endeavour to look at the financial and capital structure of the company.  Every solid fuel manufacturer or extraction industry in Europe in the past four or five years has had to adjust to much lower energy prices and this has caused huge restructuring problems.  In all these cases the Government have been involved in a restructuring package of some sort.  In many cases this has been phased in over a number of years so that the companies involved could adjust to the new circumstances.</P>
    <P>In the seventies Ireland and other European countries cranked up solid fuel production activities in order to meet the crisis created by the oil shortage.  Bord na Móna introduced a very expensive new programme of expansion of their peat operations.  When it finally came onstream it met with much lower energy prices than could realistically have been expected at the time the Government urged them to embark on that programme. As a result we are informed by rumours in the newspapers that the company this year have had to write off the value of many of their investments and that their accounts when published will show very substantial losses for the year ended March 1989.  They will also show that the capital structure of the company is such that their assets do not cover their liabilities.  In a technical sense they are insolvent.  When the accounts are available there will inevitably be some question of Government involvement as regards the unsecured portions of the loans raised by the board.</P>
    <P>We need to look at Bord na Móna's operations in a structured way and to put together a package which would allow their commercial divisions, to thrive.  We have seen in the past two or three years an enormous about-turn in the way Bord na Móna have done business.  They have pulled around their commercial activities so that in the year ending March 1990 they will show commercial profits, even meeting the interest on enormous loans of £180 million or £190 million.  However, <Col N="920" /> they will be technically insolvent and they will not be in a position to undertake the planned launch into the European market or the launch into the Dublin fuels market, on the basis of those heavy borrowings.</P>
    <P>We are at a crisis.  The Minister's predecessors commissioned consultants to examine the problems of Bord na Móna. Those consultants, to my knowledge, did not come up with any proposals that met with the approval of the Minister and we have heard no more of them.  The board have been stalled while this has gone on and the Minister has not come forward with alternative restructuring proposals. The Minister argued in the House that he formally received the accounts of Bord na Móna only on 5 February, but newspaper reports indicated the financial problems of Bord na Móna long before that date.  The Minister is playing with semantics when he says that only on 5 February did he becomes aware of their financial difficulties.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to look in a rational way at how we can deal with the crisis which will otherwise break upon Bord na Móna.  I have put forward a solution along the lines of that provided for NET where a holding company was established which was separate from the operations division.  Debt which was excessive to what the operating company could bear was transferred to the holding company and serviced separately from the commercial activities of the operating company.  I have a similar proposal here, namely, that we should look at the different operating divisions of Bord na Móna and establish the level of liabilities which those divisions could support when operating at optimum efficiency.</P>
    <P>This approach is not original since it was advocated in 1984 by the National Planning Board in their report which dealt with our State companies and recognised that some of them would not be able to recover or grow of their own accord because of the high level of borrowings they carried.  A restructuring was proposed, from which point they could grow and evolve commercially and successfully. The holding company, which <Col N="921" /> would hold the surplus of borrowings which were not supportable by the sub-boards, would be serviced in a number of ways: first, by dividends from the sub-boards which would compete successfully, grow and produce profits; second, another possibility would be a levy on the peat extracted by the different sub-divisions; and third, the Minister, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, would pick up the costs which were not sustainable.  This is an alternative to a straight injection of equity.</P>
    <P>The Government are not well disposed to an injection of equity because they have argued that they would have to borrow it themselves.  They do not see that as a viable proposition at present. One or other approach will have to be adopted by the Government.  The alternative I have set out would give Bord na Móna the financial environment in which to develop their business with an orderly support from Government.  We are not asking the Government to support a nonviable, lame duck enterprise.  Bord na Móna are in profit as of 1990 but their overhang of debt accumulated in the past is of such proportions that it will blight every commercial enterprise from here on and will leave the company technically insolvent.  Something has to be done and if the Minister does not see the merit in this suggestion, I would like to hear what he would envisage as being the solution to this problem which is of serious proportions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the structuring of the company and the whole question of the way the accounts are structured, examined and reported on, the Committee of Public Accounts set up what was called the advisory group on public financial accountability, consisting of some of the most eminent people in the private and public sector and they reported to the committee who endorsed their report and reported to this House. I understand a change is taking place or has taken place in the auditing requirements of Bord na Móna in that the control of the Comptroller and Auditor General as auditor is being replaced by a private <Col N="922" /> firm.  I have no difficulty with that.  The Committee of Public Accounts special report which was debated by this House included provision to enable the Comptroller and Auditor General to surrender the audit of commercial State-sponsored bodies which could be taken over by private firms, there by relieving him of a lot of pressure.</P>
      <P>The report also recommended that the Comptroller and Auditor General should have inspection and reporting rights to the Committee of Public Accounts.  This is distinct from the performance review which is carried out by the Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies.  The question is one of propriety, audit and regulation. For instance, in the UK when the De Lorean Company were accused of fraudulent behaviour with taxpayers' money, it was the public accounts committee which pursued that matter.  Where there is fraudulent or inefficient use of resources, the Comptroller and Auditor General should be able to report the matter to Parliament.  That should be separate to the normal audit provisions.  The recommendations of the committee with regard to inspection and reporting rights by the Comptroller and Auditor General should be implemented in the case of State bodies particularly where the Comptroller is surrendering the audit to a private company.</P>
      <P>The Minister should bear those points in mind.  It may be a matter which will be addressed in legislation concerning the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General but we should not be upset if Parliament were to have a role in ensuring that State-sponsored bodies, especially commercial bodies, have accounting requirements which ensure that their accounting practices and procedures are examined by the Comptroller and Auditor General and that he has an opportunity to report these matters to Parliament.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>This section relating to powers of the board outside the State is very important and acceptable.  Perhaps there is an ideological difference between Deputy Bruton and me but I am surprised <Col N="923" /> that in amendment No. 2 Deputy Bruton says that:</P>
      <P>the Board may</P>
      <P>(a)  not offer preferential loans to its wholly or partially owned subsidiary companies;</P>
      <P>(b)  not provide any subsidies, nor provide goods and services on preferential terms to its wholly or partially owned subsidiary companies.</P>
      <P>Is there not a total conflict in what is proposed in this and what the Deputy is now seeking?  The main problem with what is being proposed is that it says in the amendment:</P>
      <P>&mdash;(1)  The Board shall transfer to such sub-boards the assets, valued according to their audited worth to the Board,...</P>
      <P>That is a very narrow perspective in creating financing for sub-boards.  The other point about which I have difficulty is where it says:</P>
      <P>along with such liabilities determined by its auditors to be supportable by that sub-board operating at optimum efficiency.</P>
      <P>That kind of terminology means that we are saying to the board we are now allowing the board under section 4 to trade outside the State but to restrict financing to that effect is something I would find very difficult.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but when the Deputy puts in such terminology as &ldquo;supportable by that sub-board operating at optimum efficiency&rdquo; that is restricting the activity of the board too much and I have great difficulty with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell raised interesting points which might be the subject of consideration on another occasion <Col N="924" /> but they are not strictly relevant to the amendment before us.</P>
      <P>I would suggest to Deputy Bruton that it might be a bit reckless to refer to Bord na Móna as being an insolvent company. I reaffirm that their borrowings are guaranteed by the Minister for Finance, and that they are trading successfully. They have financial problems arising from losses incurred as a result of decisions made in the past, principally with regard to capital expenditure.  The consultant's report which has been made available to me is being carefully examined in the Department and it is still under consideration.  The question of how the board deal with the financial difficulties is being examined.  The board had submitted proposals at the request of my Department and these matters are being jointly considered.  Appropriate decisions will be made in time.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton emphasised that the accounts were leaked some time ago, and said that because they were leaked I should have been making decisions about these matters long before now.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that due and careful consideration is necessary before any decisions are made and that the company have made a major contribution since their accounts were finalised in regard to how they propose to deal with their financial difficulties.  This is a matter which is under careful examination in the Department at present.  I want to assure the Deputy that appropriate decisions will be made in regard to these serious matters as soon as possible.  There is no intention on my part to delay the matter. We should be careful talking about insolvency, particularly when we have a successful company trading in the market-place with a huge number of people employed who depend on the company to trade successfully in the future.  They also depend on full support from the Minister and the Government in regard to the company's activities and I assure the House that they certainly have that support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision for setting up sub-boards within Bord na Móna is designed to give the board maximum flexibility in carrying <Col N="925" /> out their functions.  I have emphasised that point on a number of occasions.  It is considered that the embodiment of the kind of rigid structures for such sub-boards into legislation as suggested by Deputy Bruton would unduly limit this flexibility.  The amendment would interfere with the intention of the Bill which is to open up commercial opportunities for Bord na Móna rather than imposing many statutory restrictions on them and interfering with their free operation in the market-place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister explain that?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (2) of the amendment would, in practice, delegate to the auditors of Bord na Móna capital decisions in relation to the apportionment of the board's financial resources. This again would unduly constrain the board in their role of policy formation for the organisation as a whole.</P>
      <P>As I explained to the Deputy, the sub-boards are delegated authority by the main board to &mdash; in this instance &mdash; operate separate divisions or to undertake to examine any particular proposal on behalf of the main board.  If, in time, the main board decide that it would be more appropriate to establish separate subsidiary companies to operate these divisions, they have the power to do so under this Bill.  In the event of them exercising those powers under section 2 it would be appropriate &mdash; indeed they would be obliged under the Companies Act &mdash; to present separate accounts.  The amendment would introduce restrictions on the company, limit their flexibility and would not be acceptable to me regarding the main thrust of the Bill as it would substantially interfere with it.  Therefore, I oppose the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcomed this legislation when it was introduced but it will be very weak if we do not discuss proper financing and putting the board on a <Col N="926" /> proper footing as far as finance is concerned. The Minister has denied the fact that Bord na Móna are insolvent, nevertheless he cannot escape the reality that the board at present have assets of £100 million and liabilities of £165 million.  It would be a profitable organisation making something in the region of £18 million or £20 million per year if it were not for the burden of their enormous debt.  There is no better place to address the future financing of Bord na Móna or the circumstances under which they will survive than in the course of this Bill.  I ask the Minister, while dealing with this amendment, to address himself to the future financing of the board.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Bruton moved the amendment he referred to the recommendations of the National Planning Board in their report of 1984.  I refer the Minister to paragraphs 8 (1), (2) and particularly (3) on page 122 of the report. Unless the Government are prepared to give hope to Bord na Móna in this legislation the changes envisaged by the Bill will be far weaker than the Government might anticipate.  Bord na Móna have borrowed to the tune of £80 million at extraordinarily high interest rates of 17 per cent, 18 per cent and 19 per cent. This is a burden which they will not be in a position to overcome without a substantial change on the part of the Government. I hope that, before we pass this legislation, the Minister will give serious consideration to how he proposes to place the financial structure of Bord na Móna on a firmer footing than at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister talked about allocating the assets and liabilities to the various sub-boards which will be set up.  Will the Minister be specific and inform the House how this will operate in practice?  Which sub-boards will get the assets and which boards will get the liabilities?  How, in effect, will that be addressed?  Without dealing with specifics in this regard, we are doing something of a disservice to Bord na Móna because, without proper planning, this legislation will not prove as successful as we had all hoped.  There are umpteen precedents available to the Government where boards, similar to <Col N="927" /> Bord na Móna, were under severe financial constraint and where Government packages were put in place.  I am not asking that a similar line be taken in regard to Bord na Móna but the serious difficulty should be addressed in some form or other.  The Minister tends to place significant store on this consultant's report which he has had for some time and which his departmental officials are considering.  When will the consultant's report become public?  Is it the Minister's intention to lay it before this House so that Members will have an opportunity of contributing to the future development of Bord na Móna?  The most important aspect of this legislation, to promote the board in their activities abroad and to allow them to delegate the functions of the board to sub-boards, will be a husk until we address the very severe financial constraints under which the board operate at present.</P>
    <P>Before we leave this amendment the Minister should give us specific information as to how the various actuarial reports will distribute the assets and liabilities of the board &mdash; particularly the liabilities &mdash; to the various subheads.  Will the Minister take my initial point on board?  He said that while the board are not insolvent because various loans are guaranteed, nevertheless the reality is that Bord na Móna, irrespective of the sub-boards or how they are dressed up in this legislation, will be severely constrained and burdened because of the massive amounts in terms of interest repayable on an annual basis.  A sum of £18 million is repayable each year by Bord na Móna in interest alone.  Does the Minister believe that that is a healthy way for the board to operate?  Does he see that there is tremendous scope in this legislation to allow Bord na Móna, under the sub-boards, to be masters of their own destiny?  How can they do that with this massive debt burden?  I ask the Minister to address this matter at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>

      <P>The Minister made a bit of a meal out of the fact that there <Col N="928" /> had been unauthorised leaks.  However, it is up to the Minister to direct the board as to when they will make their accounts available to him.  On the Minister's admission the board did not make their accounts for March 1989 available to him until February 1990, 11 months after the date when they were completed.  We have not seen them before the Oireachtas.  It is the Minister who is neglecting his duties to the House by allowing that to evolve. I do not accept that it is only recently the Minister's attention was drawn to the serious financial difficulties in Bord na Móna.  We have all known for a long time of their problems.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that the proposal I have made as to the legislative vehicle by which we could restructure the company would involve too much inflexibility. The Minister has not substantiated that argument.  What is being proposed is that the excessive debt should be hived off to a holding company, as was done in the case of NET.  That is not something the Government do not know anything about and it has not been argued that it created enormous structural difficulties or constrained the commercial operations of NET as they evolved into a joint venture.  The Minister's argument does not stand up.</P>
      <P>If the Minister does not go along with the vehicle I have suggested as a way of restructuring the company, and giving their commercial divisions the opportunity to grow, perhaps he will indicate the line of his thinking.  What alternative options does he envisage?  Does the Minister envisage a simple equity injection into the company?  Would he not consider it better to take the opportunity in the Bill before us to put in place a structure which will in the long term give the Government a satisfactory way to allow those commercial operations to grow and flourish?  I can see the day dawning, when the Minister has concluded his deliberations and decided on a new approach, when we will have to find time in the House to debate a turf Bill, issue No. 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When debating the future of Bord na Móna it would be a shame if the Minister <Col N="929" /> did not tell us the shape he envisages for the future of the board.  It is not satisfactory that we should spend one day in the House debating the future and structure of Bord na Móna, the way ahead for the company, in the dark as to how the Minister will get over the number one problem facing the board, their huge debt.  No company can grow and develop out of a debt like that which is confronting Bord na Móna.  There is no way they will successfully penetrate new markets or develop new products on the basis of debt finance.  Unless the Minister faces up to that problem urgently and brings forward new structures along the lines I have suggested Bord na Móna's future will be seriously damaged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed at the Minister's response to the amendment. He did not address the difficulties faced by the board or avail of the opportunity to elaborate on his proposals.  When the Bill was introduced by the former Minister he made great play of the fact that a committee had been established to look into the financial position of Bord na Móna.  The Minister, the Government, and Members of the House, are aware that the State is littered with companies who tried to trade out of difficulties similar to those faced by Bord na Móna. Those concerns have gone to the wall. Employees of the company are operating under great stress because, as Deputy Flanagan said, they must cope with the horrific interest repayments the company are expected to meet.  The straight and vertical line approach adopted by the Minister gives the impression that the Department of Finance do not want to let go of Bord na Móna.  Their intransigence will, eventually, lead to the downfall of many companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is wrong that the Minister should give an absolute guarantee for loans advanced to Bord na Móna.  Why should Ireland Incorporated, the taxpayer, be asked to guarantee such loans?  Bad decisions were made.  My colleagues on my right, who proclaim a different ideology to me, have told the House that Bord na Móna are a profitable company.  Bord <Col N="930" /> na Móna are not a profitable company. The fact is that they cannot trade out of the difficulties they are in.  I will be surprised if the Minister in the course of his reply will tell us that he expects the company to trade out of the difficulties they are in without him having to do something to help them.  I do not know how the Minister can blandly suggest that Deputy Bruton's amendment seeks to put restrictions on him.  The Deputy has asked the Minister to introduce certain standards in Bord na Móna.  He wants the Departments of Finance and Energy to look at reality.</P>
    <P>If the company were dealing with bank managers in the commercial world and did not have the letters of comfort, the guarantees from the Minister, there would be a run on their assets.  I appeal to the Minister to be more specific about the problems of Bord na Móna.  He should tell us what he considers to be the alternative to Deputy Bruton's amendment. What does he propose doing about Bord na Móna?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The House is discussing a Bill which, in effect, is an enabling Bill. It proposes to give increased powers to Bord na Móna which will enable them to expand their activities in the market place without the restrictions that exist.  It seeks to give Bord na Móna new powers.  The Bill is not proposing to deal with the current financial difficulties confronting the board.  There is adequate provision under existing legislation, and under the authority of the Minister and the Government, to deal with the problem that has arisen because of bad investment decisions made many years ago and which are coming home to roost on the incumbent in the Office and on the Government. I have given an assurance on a number of occasions that the financial difficulties, which I recognise and which will have an effect on the operations of Bord na Móna in the future, are under careful examination.  They will be dealt with in an appropriate way.  I see that as a completely separate matter to introducing a Bill which proposes to expand the remit of Bord na Móna, to increase <Col N="931" /> their powers to operate in the commercial sphere at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>The House is trying to put structures into place which will enable a more successful, more dynamic and enlarged company to operate in the future.  It would not be appropriate for the House to discuss the financial problems that exist. They follow on from decisions made some years ago and they affect the current financial standing of the company.  That matter has been reported in the annual accounts and it will be carefully examined. Decisions will be made in regard to that matter and it would be improper of me to go into any detail as to how I propose to deal with it at this stage.  It is in order for the Deputies to raise the issue but it would be impossible for me to do so because the matter is being considered and decisions have not been made in relation to it.  I can understand why the Deputies opposite are genuinely concerned about the matter and how it might affect the future operation of Bord na Móna.  All I can say is that when corporate decisions are made by me and the Government, I will seek to make known those decisions.  I am sure Deputies will find other ways in which to comment on whatever decision is made in the Estimates debates or by way of Dáil questions, or, alternatively, if they want to discuss the matter with me, I would be happy to communicate to them any information I can.  One must bear in mind that we are talking about a commercial company which is expected to compete with all the other companies that operate in the private sector.  Because it is a State company it has its own built in restrictions and certain safeguards.  As I have said here on a number of occasions, I am trying to ensure that those restrictions are as limited as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedure laid down in this amendment provides for more restrictions which would limit the flexibility of the company.  I do not see that this is the appropriate way forward.  If Deputy Bruton thinks this is the right way to deal with it and that this is the only way it should be dealt with, and if he wants to <Col N="932" /> press the amendment then we will have a vote on it.</P>
    <P>I ask him to accept my good intentions in regard to this matter.  I recognise there is a problem in regard to the current accounts and the current financial difficulties, but they will be dealt with in an appropriate manner.  We are not yet in a position to state what exactly will be done.</P>
    <P>I was asked if the consultant's report would be published.  I should like to inform the House that it is not my intention to publish that report because, as has been said before, it contains a great deal of confidential and commercial information. Arrangements are in place to discuss the differences between the consultant's view and those of Bord na Móna arising out of what is contained in the report.  The House is aware that many of the consultant's recommendations, including &ldquo;divisionalisation&rdquo;, are already being implemented by the board.  If Deputies require any information in that regard I would be happy to supply it direct.  The usefulness of the report would be seriously inhibited if it were to be published.  That is a valued judgement I had to make as Minister.  I have made that decision and it is not proposed to publish the report.</P>

      <P>The Minister asked whether I feel this is the only answer to the board's problems.  I do not see it as being the only answer but it is an answer which unfortunately we do not have from the Minister.  I can appreciate that he is relatively new to the job and has not had the chance to get his thoughts together on this, but this is February 1990 and the accounts that underline the recent problems are a year old.  How long does <Col N="933" /> the Minister need to come to a conclusion about the future of Bord na Móna?</P>
      <P>When this Bill was introduced in the Dáil in November 1988 we went over the ground thoroughly as to the problems of the board and the unsatisfactory nature of the Government's response.  The Minister's party colleague said that what was needed was a fundamental recasting of the legal and capital base of the company. He also said that the Bill represented a no change situation for Bord na Móna. He went on to say that they must be given the right framework within which to operate on a truly competitive basis.  That was put forward by Deputy O'Malley in November 1988 on behalf of the Minister's own party.</P>
      <P>Now he comes back to the House producing the same style of approach and while I accept that he might have better ideas than my set of proposals as to how this new framework can be given to Bord na Móna, I do not see what he is coming up with.  His own party indicated that there was a need for a new legal framework, in other words, it had to be enshrined in this Bill or else we would be coming back with another Bill in a short time.  That is the reason I feel we are engaging in something of a sham here today.</P>
      <P>The Minister is talking about new rights for the board and new sub-boards. This will be only so many committees in Bord na Móna pushing around paper if the central problem they face, namely, their debt problem, which prevents them from trading commercially and successfully is not addressed.  That aspect is very frustrating.  I understand that the Minister may not have all the answers yet, but it is frustrating for us to try to look at structures and committees that the Minister feels are appropriate.  We do not know what he will do about the central problem which is worrying everybody in Bord na Móna and everyone interested in the development of the energy sector in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will withdraw this amendment and reintroduce it on Report Stage when the Minister will have had an opportunity to consider further the position of Bord na <Col N="934" /> Móna.  Like the Minister's former colleague, I feel that what we have here is not enough to deal fundamentally with the problems of Bord na Móna.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the Bill is being discussed now is coincidental with the fact that the question of dealing with the financial difficulties of Bord na Móna are being considered at present.  I can see why Deputies try to marry one with the other and expect to get a solution while this debate is taking place.  I should like to inform them that I do not intend to deal with it in that way because it would not be appropriate to deal with it in that manner, in fact, it would be highly improper.  The question of the financial difficulties will be dealt with separately.</P>
      <P>There is sufficient legislation to enable the Minister and the Government to deal with the difficulties that have arisen and it is not necessary that they would be solved by way of legislation.  The reason for the delay in bringing forward last year's accounts has to do with this particular situation and the question of dealing with the financial problems.  I would like to assure the House, as far as I can, that in future years the statutory requirement will be complied with in regard to the period within which the accounts should be published.  I hope that what has happened in relation to last year's accounts is exceptional.  Certainly, the problems thrown up are exceptional but there is adequate provision to deal with them and I hope they will be satisfactorily dealt with soon.  Deputy Sherlock raised a point regarding the relevance of sections 6 and 8 which deal with the revenue capital accounts.  It merely relates to the presentation of the accounts, but it will come up again later.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14.</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 5, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>5. &mdash;The Board may, inside or ourside the State, engage in all such commercial activities, whether in <Col N="936" /> relation to the production or marketing of turf or otherwise, as in the opinion of the Board arise out of and can advantageously be conducted in conjunction with any function of the Board.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment extends the board's remit and allows it to engage in various commercial activities not confined to peat or peat products.  The amendment is loosely connected with section 7.  Section 17 of the 1946 Act specifies the duties of Bord na Móna, which refer to turf and turf products.  The board have contended that to enable them to exercise those non-peat related powers outlined in section 7 of the Bill their duties also need to be broadened.  It would not be appropriate to make it a duty of Bord na Móna to engage in non-peat activities, rather this function should be given to the board without there being a specific obligation to exercise it.  The amendment is more of a discretionary function but at the same time it satisfies the board's concerns in relation to the extension of their remit. The purpose is to leave it beyond doubt that the board have the authority to exercise those new non-peat related powers specified in section 7.  However, the board will be limited in the activities that they may wish to engage in.  Such activities are set out in section 7.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Minister in this instance.  The purpose of my amendment No. 17, is exactly the same as that of the Minister's amendment.  The Bill as originally framed would have restricted the board too much in the activities they may engage in.  The reality is that Bord na Móna have to consider all sorts of new commercial activities, some of which will be only tangently related to their core peat business.  It is only right that we should allow them to expand their commercial activities in the way the Minister has proposed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14a:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 11 and 12 to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Section 18 of the Principal Act is hereby further amended by the insertion of the following subsection after subsection (3):</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(4) In any event, when the Minister lays a report of the Board before each House of the Oireachtas in accordance with subsection (3), he shall do so not later than six months after the end of the financial year of the Board to which the report relates.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to deal with the present unsatisfactory position. Almost a year after the end of the financial year we have not yet seen the accounts of Bord na Móna.  The 1946 Act places an obligation on the Minister to set the date and the form in which the board will have to present their accounts. It is quite clear that the Minister's predecessors did not bother to set a date by which the board would have to present their accounts.  In order to get over this problem and the possible reluctance of some future Minister to have the board <Col N="938" /> present the accounts on time, I suggest that a new subsection (4) be inserted in section 18 of the principal Act which relates to the reporting of information by the board.  This would require the Minister and the board to organise their affairs in such a way that the report and financial accounts of the board would be laid before each House of the Oireachtas not later than six months after the end of the financial year to which the report relates.  This would be a sensible move on the part of the House.  It is a pity that the 1946 Act does not contain such a provision because if it did, things would be a little easier for us now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is already a requirement that the reports and accounts of semi-State bodies should be laid before the Houses within six months of the end of the accounting year.  The reason for the delay in the presentation of the Bord na Móna accounts arises, as I have explained already, from the present financial position of the company.  I understand that no similar provision is in place in relation to other semi-State bodies and, therefore, I would be very reluctant to place a statutory requirement on Bord na Móna.  The Deputy's concern about unnecessary delays in the publication of accounts is shared by the Government. There is a requirement on all semi-State bodies to have their accounts completed and available within six months of the end of the accounting year.  I can assure the Deputy of the Government's goodwill with regard to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a time when semi-State bodies were not complying with this requirement and it proved necessary for the Government to oblige them to do so. However, it would not be appropriate to make it a statutory requirement at this time.  If a similar provision was in place in relation to other companies there would be no reason it should not be applied to Bord na Móna.  However, I would rather leave the position as it is as unusual and exceptional circumstances can arise, which proved to be the case this year as the Deputies realise, which may result in the publication of the <Col N="939" /> accounts being delayed for very good reasons.</P>
    <P>It would have been inappropriate for the board to rush the accounts while these other matters had to be carefully considered. The fact that there have been leaks about the accounts is an indication in itself that there is a need to carefully consider matters of this kind.  I urge the House not to press for a statutory requirement on Bord na Móna only because of the difficulties which can arise from time to time when there is a need for flexibility.</P>
    <P>I share the concern that in all cases we should insist that the accounts are made available to the House within a reasonable period, which has been determined by the Government as being six months. I will seek to ensure that Bord na Móna comply with this requirement in the future.  They have been unable to do so this year because of the exceptional circumstances.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the publication which is basically a collection of papers given at a conference in December, 1988, not all of which are directly related to housing.  The material in the papers predates the Government decision to substantially increase the allocation for the provision of local authority housing in 1990 and increased allocations for voluntary housing accommodation and the recoupment of local authority expenditure in connection with accommodation for homeless persons.  These increased resources show the Government's concern to tackle social housing needs on a broad front.  In addition, as I have previously indicated in the House, I also propose to review the operation of the provisions of the Housing Act, 1988 dealing with homeless persons during 1990 and I will have regard to the views of housing authorities and relevant organisations including those responsible for the publication.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 52 together.  I have seen press reports to the effect indicated in both questions.</P>
      <P>With regard to the references to certain of the recommendations of the report of the Stardust Tribunal, I would refer the Deputies to my reply to Question No. 24 of 25 November, 1987, and the reply to Question No. 8 of 25 June, 1985.  Apart from the few specific recommendations referred to in the latter reply which it was decided not to implement, the tribunal's recommendations have either been implemented or are being taken into account in the continuing development of Government policy in relation to fire safety and the improvement of the fire service.</P>
      <P>I am glad to say that very worthwhile progress has been, and continues to be, made in the improvement of fire safety generally with the objective of reducing and, if possible, eliminating deaths, injuries and losses caused by fire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Action taken since 1981 has included allocating some £55 million, including the <Col N="944" /> 1990 allocation, from State funds to finance work on 68 new or reconstructed fire stations, the purchase of 200 new fire appliances and major improvements in telecommunications, emergency equipment, etc.  Fire service staffing at senior levels has been increased from 30 to 133 posts, of which 69 are for fire prevention work.  The Fire Services Act, 1981, strengthened the powers of fire authorities to enforce fire safety.  The Fire Safety in Places of Assembly (Ease of Escape) Regulations, 1985, made the locking of exists and blocking of escape routes from places of assembly such as discos, cinemas, etc. an offence.  Codes of Practice and other advice have recently been issued giving advice on fire safety in places of assembly, hotels and guest houses and community-based residences for mentally-handicapped or mentally-ill people.  Further fire safety advice will be produced as soon as possible.  The Fire Services Council have run 90 training courses for fire service personnel since they were established in 1983 and they have a full training programme in hands for this year which is, of course, additional to the training being provided at local level.  The National Safety Council are fostering fire safety through publicity campaigns while local authorities now have well-developed plans for dealing with major emergencies.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of fire safety standards in new buildings, the proposed building regulations which relate to new buildings have been revised to take account of the tribunal's technical recommendations.  Pending enactment of the Building Control Bill, my Department have asked local authorities and all others concerned to regard the proposed regulations as if they had statutory backing and to apply the standards set out in the draft regulations when designing and constructing buildings.</P>
    <P>The Building Control Bill was passed by Dáil Éireann in December 1989 and is currently before Seanad Eireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that not only SIPTU but also the Chief Fire Officers' Association have said progress <Col N="945" /> in implementing the Stardust Tribunal recommendations is too slow?  Will he accept that the training and equipment are currently inadequate and that in the area of equipment the inadequacies relate particularly to breathing apparatus and protective clothing?  What assurances can the Minister give to the House that these matters will be addressed swiftly?</P>

      <P>We would all be concerned to have as prudent and efficient a fire service as possible.  The very distinguished former Chief Fire Officer of Dublin, now retired, acknowledged publicly the worthwhile progress that had been made on these matters in recent years.  I can quite understand that we would seek to apply as much resource as possible to improving the service, but very considerable worthwhile developments have taken place as I indicated in the answer.  I think Deputy Shatter recognised that on a previous occasion. My intention is to improve on the situation in every way.</P>

Has he considered a regionalisation of these authorities and the application of uniform standards and guidelines to all of them? Will he agree there is a need for an inspectorate of fire services such as exists in other EC countries to ensure uniformity is being applied and that the recommendations of the report published today by the Fire Service Council with regard to training apply uniformly throughout the country to those recruited to the fire service?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to have as good training as is possible.  The question about the establishment of an inspectorate of fire services has not been agreed.  That is the recommendation that was not agreed to.  The situation was referred to by a predecessor of mine by way of public announcement in June <Col N="946" /> 1985.  Deputy Kavanagh was Minister for the Environment at that time and he outlined the reasons it was not being proceeded with.  There has been nothing to alter the position since.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not necessarily agree with Deputy Kavanagh's approach and I ask the Minister to have another look at the need for a fire inspectorate.  In the context of Dublin, the position in the central control building in Tara Street has reportedly been described as chaotic, and it has been stated that none or few of the problems that arose in the Stardust Tribunal regarding the central control building have yet been resolved.  Can the Minister make a statement on this aspect of the matter and give the House an assurance that in the event of a similar disaster in Dublin the fire services will be able to cope promptly and efficiently with any such outbreak?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that the principle be continually established in that the question of the relationship between central Government and the local authorities is fundamental.  I think local authorities are best able to control their own fire service.  It would diminish the effectiveness if it were all transferred centrally.

      <askee>Minister for the Environment</askee>
      <Quest>if he will make a statement on a survey (details supplied) which shows contamination of water supplies which is exceeding EC standards and which found that 25 per cent of treated Dublin water samples in 1988 contained more aluminium than the maximum levels allowed under EC and national regulations and whether he is satisfied that drinking water supplies do not pose any danger to health.</Quest>

      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have noted the concerns expressed in the survey referred to and wish to assure the Deputy that I attach the highest priority to the achievement of the statutory drinking water quality standards.  Under the ongoing sanitary services programme there is a strong emphasis on water quality, and where problems have been identified, investment is under way or planned to develop new sources, provide necessary treatment works and upgrade distribution systems. The survey acknowledged the improvement which has taken place as a result of increased expenditure and improved operation of treatment plants. I recognise that the statutory quality standards have not been achieved yet in all drinking water supplies.  However, in order to ensure that they are fully and consistently met in all areas, the Government have decided, under the environment action programme, to spend up to £300 million between now and the year 2000 on new and improved public water supply schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The quality of drinking water in Dublin is generally very good and Dublin Corporation monitor levels of residual aluminium on a daily basis.  These are well within the statutory limit in water produced at Leixlip and Ballyboden following improvement works at these plants over recent years.  Aluminium sulphate is not used in the treatment of the Roundwood water supply.  In the case of the Ballymore Eustace water supply, the statutory limit has proved difficult to maintain because the treatment works <Col N="951" /> are overloaded and water filters are in poor condition.  Major improvement works, which I approved in January 1989, are now under way at Ballymore Eustace, at a cost of £14 million.  In addition to providing an extra 40 million gallons of water a day to the Dublin area, these works will ensure that the quality standards of the drinking water regulations are consistently met.  In the meantime, everything possible is being done to keep aluminium exceedances to the minimum level.</P>
    <P>Overall, the quality of drinking water in Ireland is very good.  However, water supply sources are vulnerable to pollution from activities in their catchment areas. In addition, old and corroded distribution systems may affect the quality of water which reaches consumers.  Private wells may be susceptible to contamination if poorly located in relation to septic tanks or, for example, waste storage areas on farms.  If monitoring shows that quality standards are not being met, sanitary authorities are required to warn users of the water supply where there is an unacceptable risk to public health, and to prepare action programmes for the improvement of public water supplies as soon as practicable.  I am satisfied that drinking water supplies do not generally pose a danger to health and that the Government are taking an effective and realistic approach in committing very substantial public funds to the continued improvement of water quality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree with the <i>Consumer Choice</i> magazine which states that in 1988 25 per cent of Dublin water samples contained more aluminium than the maximum levels allowed either under EC or national regulations? Would the Minister accept that that is still the position?  Does he also agree that the results of sampling in Counties Laois, Louth, Monaghan, Cavan and in Athlone town suggest aluminium levels up to three times the maximum permitted on average?  Would the Minister agree that this is a major cause of public concern in the light of <Col N="952" /> the link between Alzheimers disease and aluminium in water supplies?  Would he indicate whether consideration has been given by his Department to indicating to local authorities that any other treatment agent should be used on water supplies other than aluminium nitrates for the purpose of providing clear water?</P>

      <P>Several things arise a Cheann Comhairle.  It is the Government's policy that the quality standards required by regulations are met in full. Some problems have been identified, and the Deputy is right in drawing our attention to them.  Members will be aware of the improvement works at Ballymore Eustace and there are also some very considerable improvements taking place at other locations &mdash; Belturbet, Castleconnell, County Limerick and Ballymahon, County Longford.  It is important to say that as far as Alzheimers disease and its relationship to aluminium in water is concerned recent studies have not established a casual relationship between the two.  There is no evidence that the use of aluminium as a treatment method should be discontinued.  However, there is a great deal of research ongoing at present which has to be kept closely in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aluminium is one of the commonest metals in the earth's surface.  Drinking <Col N="953" /> water provides the source of less than 10 per cent of the normal daily intake; so a lot of other foods and substances contain aluminium as well.  Drinking water is only one of them and a very small contributory factor to aluminium intake every day.</P>
    <P>We have good quality drinking water and it is our intention to make it the best in Europe.  That is the reason there is such a large commitment in the action programme to deal with the drinking water quality standards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister indicate to the House by what date can he guarantee the drinking water supply in Dublin city and county will meet EC standards? Second, will he acknowledge that rather than providing major additional finance to tackle the quality of water, during the ten year period 1990-2000, the Government have substantially reduced the financial allocation, while £700 million was made available in the period 1980-89 by Governments of different political persuasions?  It appears that this Government's total commitment is less than half that in the course of this new decade.</P>

Any EC country will be hard pushed to match that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the £14 million plant at Ballymore Eustace, I do not have the <Col N="954" /> exact date on which that will be finalised, but I think it should be completed within 18 months to two years and that will make a significant improvement in the standard of water.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 9 together.  I have no immediate proposals for change in the representation in the Seanad of third level educational institutions.  The question of any change in this regard would be a matter for consideration in the context of a general review of the structures of third level education.  There is no constitutional or statutory requirement that a candidate for a Seanad university constituency must be a graduate of the relevant university.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Does the Minister consider it extremely unfair to graduates of Limerick University and Dublin City University, and indeed graduates of the National Council for Education Awards, that they cannot vote as other graduates do in Seanad elections?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an interesting point but I noticed the NIHE authorities made it clear at the time they were getting university status that they were not seeking representation in the Seanad.  Apart from that, there is as the Deputy knows an interdepartmental committee sitting on third level education and it might be appropriate for them to deal with the question the Deputy raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are more fundamental anomalies in relation to Seanad representation. I referred to these in a debate in the Seanad some time ago but they were not taken up.  For example, what is the democratic justification for awarding a second parliamentary vote to a citizen who had the good fortune as well as the intellectual capacity to achieve a university degree?  Is it appropriate to have a university electorate of 17,000 with three seats and another university with an <Col N="956" /> electorate of 71,000 with the same number of seats?  There are anomalies running right through the system.  I mentioned this in the debate in the Seanad but it did not seem to run.  However, after the interdepartmental committee report the matter should be taken up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Minister is probably unaware that inadvertently he has misrepresented the position of the authorities in Limerick University.  The reason they did not request Seanad enfranchisement at the time was that they felt that the issue of university status should proceed through the Houses of the Oireachtas in an uncomplicated fashion.  That was the only reason, but they want Seanad representation if it is maintained with the other universities.  Does the Minister not think it extraordinarily inappropriate in the light of his most recent reply to me that the matter should be referred to a committee on higher education when the appropriate forum should be the Government who are considering the reform of the Houses of the Oireachtas?</P>

      <P>Under existing law the following facilities are provided for voting by physically disabled electors: a disabled person who is unable to go in person to vote at his polling station may apply for registration as a special voter and vote at <Col N="958" /> home; a disabled person who has difficulty in gaining access to his own polling station may apply to have his vote transferred to another polling station in the same constituency; and a disabled person who requires assistance in marking his ballot paper may be assisted by a companion or by the presiding officer.  It is considered that these arrangements provide a reasonable opportunity for voting by the different categories of physically disabled and an extension of postal voting is not proposed at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that he has received representations from the Disabled Drivers' Association in which they have put the case to him that physically disabled persons should be entitled to the same postal voting system as university graduates and certain categories of public servants and that there is really no justification for the kind of supervised voting system which applies in their case but does not apply in the case of university graduates?  Would he not agree that the postal vote would be a simpler and perhaps less expensive way of allowing physically disabled persons to vote?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very expensive arrangement.  I will not go into detail about its operation and the cost involved. Representations have been made particularly on the requirement that applicants must be certified as being of sound mind and capable of comprehending the act of voting and also in regard to the requirement that a medical certificate must be furnished every year.  An electoral Bill is being framed and that matter will be attended to.  I have also had representations on the question of singling out disabled electors to the effect that it is invidious to do so and to provide a unique voting arrangement for them, that voting arrangements for disabled people should be the same as those provided for other categories.  There are about 3,000 registered as special voters. The experience with postal votes in the 1974 and 1985 local elections left a lot <Col N="959" /> to be desired.  It was the general understanding of all Deputies that we should not pursue the matter again in that way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I said that in the Bill I will be dealing with the matter of annual medical certification, which I do not think is necessary.  Postal voting generally has not worked out abroad, particularly in Belgium and France where they have had considerable difficulty with it.</P>

      <P>I fully support the provision of alarm systems in new local authority housing schemes for the elderly where they are judged to contribute to the security and welfare of the residents.  It is now generally the standard practice of housing authorities to provide alarm systems suitable to the scheme in question. The question of security is essentially a matter for the authorities.  I have already drawn their attention to the benefits of a smoke detector/fire alarm as an early warning system in the event of fire occurring and have recommended that all their tenants should be encouraged to install these inexpensive and potentially life saving devices.</P>

      <P>Elderly people are not living in fear at all times and the Deputy should not say so.  The practice of local authorities is to provide these facilities for the elderly in new housing schemes. My colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Rory O'Hanlon, stated in reply to a question on 21 February 1990 that the provision of home alarms is an option open to health boards to maintain an <Col N="961" /> elderly person at home if such a person would otherwise require institutional care.

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the considerable concern that has been expressed by professional and representative organisations in the construction industry over the shortfall in the capital provision for the national route road construction programme and the failure to meet existing targets in relation to the construction of sections of the national primary route system; if he will publish a revised national roads programme outlining the exact routes which will be constructed in the next three years with Irish and European capital financial assistance; the extent of those routes; their location; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government plan to spend £662.7 million (1989 prices) on the improvement of the network of national roads over the period 1989 to 1993.  This is 25 per cent greater in real terms than the amount provided in the previous five years 1984 to 1988.  The Government have also succeeded in negotiating 75 per cent EC grants for national primary roads and hope to obtain up to £50 million by 1993 in toll-based private investment to accelerate the development programme.</P>
      <P>A draft operational programme for roads and other transport infrastructure was submitted to the EC Commission in December last.  This contains a detailed strategy for the development of national roads and a programme of major projects on the national primary routes.  The programme is currently under discussion with the Commission.  It is planned to publish it when it has been formally approved by the Commission.  Pending approval of the programme, I do not propose to indicate what major projects it is planned to undertake in the period up to the end of 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 8 February last I issued a press statement on the 1990 road programme. This year I am allocating State grants totalling £215.7 million &mdash; the highest level ever provided.  Of this, £116.5 million will be spent on the national road improvement programme.  Five major schemes with an estimated total value of £98 million will start this year, eight will <Col N="968" /> be completed and construction on a further 13 will continue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased the Deputy recognised that there is a developmental road programme in progress.  I cannot comment on individual locations but I recognise that there are bottlenecks.  The purpose of the programme is to ease those bottlenecks and to create a better national roads network.  It is important that rural Deputies should understand that we are also committing a very sizeable figure to county non-national roads, which must be appreciated, because quite a large proportion of our population live in rural provincial areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate when he expects to receive formal approval from the Commission for the roads plan?  Will he indicate how rapidly after formal approval is received it will be published?  Will the Minister also comment on reports that the Government are experiencing considerable difficulties in getting private sector involvement &mdash; as they originally suggested they would be able to obtain &mdash; in matching funds for the road programme and that this is placing in jeopardy many millions of pounds that we could otherwise get from the EC?  Will the Minister indicate how many roads he intends to make toll roads?  Finally, is he aware of the considerable concern expressed about the likelihood of a large number of additional toll roads which will add substantial expense to the motorist?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The lack of private investment available for national roads will not result in us losing any money in so far as EC Structural Funds are concerned, as we will get our maximum amount there <Col N="969" /> anyway.  I was hoping &mdash; and I still hope &mdash; that it might be possible to attract private investment in major road developments.  The Deputy will remember that on a number of occasions I placed a limit on the amount, I did not think it would ever exceed £100 million.  I still think I am pretty near the mark there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I am talking about a period of three or four years.  I am still reasonably happy that we might very well attract a reasonably substantial sum of money but, as I said on a programme yesterday, one would not be inclined to have toll roads unless a major proportion of the money was forthcoming from the private sector because a small amount of money with a big diversion rate from the road would not serve the best interests of anybody.  We got a very good deal in relation to the Dublin ring road and it might be possible to get some private funding for the Lucan-Kilcock ring road. There are one or two other locations but, beyond that, it does not seem possible to attract major investment and I am not in favour of putting toll bridges on roads which have a big diversion rate for a small sum of private money as it would not be in our best interests.</P>

I have indicated that it will be published because Deputies, the general public and indeed investors should be aware of what the programme entails, the policies underlining it and the progress we hope to attain over the next five, ten or 15 years.

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cotter should be the last to complain, because I increased dramatically the amount given to his local authority to deal with rural roads.  The Deputy should be fair and acknowledge that.  The kind of money provided by this Government went from £15 million to £20 million, with £150 million guaranteed over three years with a further £15 million added in the last budget.  That kind of investment was not even contemplated &mdash; never mind thought possible &mdash; a few short years ago.  I recognise that we must look after our county roads and that the inclement weather over the last couple of months has not helped.  New methods of road surfacing and doing business must be put in place and we are doing something in that regard.  I cannot allow people to say that there has not been a major commitment, as far as money is concerned, to county roads and non-national roads over the past few years.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree there is a danger that in our switch from leaded to unleaded petrol which all Members welcome, we may be creating new hazards for the general public?  Will the Minister indicate what research, if any, is taking place here to indicate whether there are different hazards resulting from emissions arising from the use of unleaded petrol?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that bringing in new measures can often result in new hazards but we have to continue to be as modern as possible and experiment as often as possible.  If hazards come this way we will have to deal with them as they arise.  The Departments of the Environment and Energy are participating in a number of studies being conducted at European level in relation to health aspects of benzene in petrol.  It is appropriate that we should participate in such studies in a European context.  I might add that when catalytic convertors are mandatory, as they will be on all new cars below 1400 cc. and, perhaps, on medium and large cars, as the result of the Irish Presidency, they will reduce the benzene content by 75 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that there is a necessity for the Government to take an initiative to encourage existing car owners to have their cars changed to take catalytic convertors? Will the Minister acknowledge that such measures have been taken in other member states?  Will he indicate whether there will be an initiative such as a break from road tax for a year or two years to act as an incentive to the owners of existing cars taking the necessary measures to instal catalytic convertors which can be an expensive exercise?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, as the Deputy has stated, it is an expensive exercise and it is only two years before it will be mandatory on new car models.  That will take place by the middle of 1992 and the convertors must be on all new cars below 1400 cc by the end of 1992.  This country, during the Irish Presidency, will be pushing to have that requirement extended to medium and large cars.  The Government are concentrating their efforts on trying to encourage people to use unleaded petrol and, as the Deputy will be aware, that is providing difficult even with the huge financial incentive.  Unleaded petrol sales stand at about 13 or 14 per cent.  Given that the country is not a manufacturer of cars, and given the costs involved, I do not think it would be practical for us to introduce any initiatives of our town in advance of 1992.  However, we will review this and examine all possibilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister take on board the approach adopted by West Germany where owners of existing cars were provided with an incentive by way of a reduction in car tax?  Will the Minister acknowledge that the measures the EC will bring into force in 1992 may impact on new cars but will not do anything for existing cars?  Will the Minister accept that as a result for a number of years after 1992 we will have continued problems of pollution caused by car emissions? Will the Minister, and the Government, consider taking an immediate initiative with regard to existing cars so that what will take place in 1992 will in a real way contribute to an improvement in the environment rather than our having to wait for existing cars to run out their life span?</P>

In the context of the EC consideration of the use of benzene as an additive to petrol, will the Minister consider it an ideal issue for the Green Presidency to take an initiative on to ensure that a directive or regulation is introduced to encourage the use of that non-toxic substitute as an additive rather than benzene which studies have shown has caused cancers?</P>

    <P>Under Article 12.3.3º of the Constitution an election for the office of President must take place within the period of 60 days before the expiration of the <Col N="975" /> term of office of the President.  This term expires on 2 December 1990.  The election must, therefore, be held between 3 October and 2 December next.  In the event of the election being contested, the poll will be taken on a day to be appointed by order of the Minister for the Environment. In accordance with section 6 of the Presidential Elections Act, 1937, such an order must be made on or as soon as conveniently may be after 3 October next.  No consideration has been given to a possible polling day.</P>

If elections are contested then the polling day would be around mid-November to allow the appropriate time for nominations on the one hand and the arrangements for the new President on the other.  Let us not forget that the last contested presidential election was in 1973 so people have forgotten the arrangements.

      <Quest>the criteria set down for the reclassification of roads to national secondary status; and the way in which the Killarney to Killorglin Road R562 fails to meet the guidelines, having regard to the fact that the Killarney-Fossa portion of this road is now the most heavily trafficked road in Kerry.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The criteria set down for the reclassification of roads to national secondary status are as follows.  The roads must be medium length through or semi-through routes; carry medium to heavy volumes of traffic; serve as connecting roads between principal towns; serve medium to large geographical regions; form extensions to the national primary routes; and link national primary routes together to form a homogeneous network.</P>
      <P>When the national network was originally designated in 1977, it was decided that the Kerry coastal route N70 via Killorglin, Caherciveen and Kenmare should commence at the county town of Tralee.  If as the Deputy suggested the Killarney to Killorglin route were upgraded to national road status, it would not be appropriate to retain the Tralee to Killorglin link as a national road.</P>

Detailed information on such variations or on amounts of rates <Col N="979" /> attributable to particular variations are not available in my Department.  Information on the total amount of rates leviable in respect of each year by each local authority is published annually by my Department; that information in respect of 1989 is included in the publication <i>Local Authority Estimates 1989,</i> a copy of which is available in the Dáil Library.</P>

      <P>Whatever applies to Tipperary town applies to every other town in the country.  I take it that the Deputy's problem was that most of the commercial valuations were listed for revision by the urban district council.  If there is dissatisfaction with the revision of the rateable valuations that have taken place there or anywhere else, the owner or the occupier of the property can appeal to the Commissioner of Valuations and if he is still dissatisfied, the matter can be appealed to the Valuation Tribunal but, of course, there are time limits on those appeals.</P>

The Deputy is the very one who would wish it that way and we do not wish to interfere in the matter.  The Commissioner of Valuation, as the Deputy is aware, is responsible for valuing properties. As a member of a local authority the Deputy determines at estimates time the rates to be levied on commercial properties.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have explained already to the Deputy this has to do with the presentation of accounts.  Sections 18 and 59 of the 1946 Act deal with the accounts and audits of the board.  They provide that the board should keep, <i>inter alia</i>, a capital account and a revenue account but such accounts are no longer common in conventional accounting practices.  This section amends section 18 of the 1946 Act deleting the references to the above accounts thus facilitating a change in the board's accounts in line with more modern conventional practice. Section 8 which more or less refers to the same thing, makes the necessary amendment to section 59 of the 1946 Act.  The accounting practices which prevailed in 1946 are no longer operable and this section merely tidies up the matter and will prevent unnecessary duplication.  Requiring the board to have a capital account and a revenue account means that the company will have to show these figures twice under different headings, which is unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the break the Minister suggested that my amendment was redundant as the Government had made an order which requires State companies to lay their accounts before the House within six months of the end of the accounting year.  If there is such a requirement the question must be asked <Col N="1067" /> why it was not adhered to in this case. The Minister must have been alerted to the difficulties when he did not see the accounts coming in.  To some extent this undermines the earlier argument that the Government only received the accounts on 5 February.  They should have long been alerted to the emerging problems.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that it would have been inappropriate for the board to adhere to the six months deadline in this instance.  I find it hard to imagine that it would be accepted in the commercial world that a commercial company who had gone through a bad year when they faced real difficulties and, looking at a revaluation of their balance sheet, should not have to publish their accounts on the due date and could delay the publication of those accounts for many months.  That does not ring very true with me.  I acknowledge their difficulties and that what they have done is in accord with standard accounting practices.  However, I cannot quite understand why the six months deadline, which one would expect the board to adhere to, was not adhered to in this instance.  There is no doubt about the financial problems but why is there a problem in presenting them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already explained this matter to the House and do not have much more to add to what I have already said.  There was a delay in presenting last year's accounts because of the exceptional circumstances.  I ask the Deputy to accept this and can assure him that the board will seek to comply with this requirement as far as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister states that it would be inappropriate to make it a statutory requirement as circumstances may arise &mdash; this is one &mdash; in which the failure to observe the six months' rule which is that a board must present the accounts within six months of the end of the financial year, can be justified.  I find it difficult to understand the arguments being put forward to justify a delay.  A bad year or a revision of the value of <Col N="1068" /> assets in accordance with standard accounting procedures would not justify a delay.  Therefore what argument is the Minister presenting the House to justify not making it a statutory requirement and for leaving room for discretion as to when the board should present their accounts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I cannot accept the amendment is that if we were to accept it the only company on which there would be such a requirement would be Bord na Móna.  I do not want to place such a statutory imposition on them and place them in a position where they would be the only semi-State company under such an obligation.  I am not as concerned about this matter as Deputy Bruton is. He may have to press the matter to a vote as that is the only way he can resolve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are entitled to an explanation why the Minister is standing his ground.  Unlike the Minister, the House has to depend on published information. It seems that we have a right to demand the publication of that information as early as possible.  According to the Minister, the Government agree with this principle.  However, he is now saying that it should not be a statutory requirement as in certain cases it may be inappropriate to rush the presentation of the accounts.  I would like the Minister to elaborate and explain what these certain circumstances are.  The Minister's argument is that we should not impose a statutory requirement on Bord na Móna as there is no similar provision in place in relation to any other semi-State board. That is a very threadbare argument.  The Minister now has the opportunity to create a precedent and say there is a better way, but if he genuinely believes a strong argument can be made for giving a board an escape hatch when they would be allowed to delay the presentation of accounts, perhaps he could explain it to the House.  I am not anxious to push things to a vote if there is sound reasoning behind the Minister's argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision in regard to the presentation of the accounts to the <Col N="1069" /> Minister rests with the board.  The House is aware that the board have delayed presention of the accounts this year and that had to do with their attempts to deal with the exceptional financial situation the company are confronted with and the present board's attempts to deal with that.  I accept that their efforts to deal with this exceptional situation have resulted in some slight delay in their presenting the accounts to me.  I am not unduly worried about it.  I accept it.  I cannot give the House details of the matters which were under consideration at the board which resulted in their delaying making their formal presentation to me. I am not in a position to do that.</P>

I cannot understand why the Minister will not explain to the House why he feels, in some circumstances, it is justifiable not to meet a deadline on the presentation of accounts; let us forget about Bord na Móna or any other company.  As I understand it, normal commercial practice is that there is a date set for the presentation of interim and final accounts of all companies.</P>

      <P>The matters which the Deputy is pressing me on are the subject of confidential discussions within my Department with the management and <Col N="1070" /> the board of Bord na Móna, and I am not free at this point to discuss these matters with Members of the House in any detail.  I have already indicated to the House that when these matters are resolved I will be quite free to explain the decisions that are being made and the reasons for them.  I am not in a position to do so at present and I think that the situation that obtains whereby the Government have laid down their requirements that all semi-State companies present their accounts for publication before the House within a period of six months from the end of the accounting year is a requirement which the Government have been actively seeking to implement in all cases.  In this case they have not complied with that requirement. I am aware of the reasons.  I am not alarmed by the reasons; I fully understand them.  I cannot explain in great detail what the reasons are.  A point will come when I may be in a position to give fuller information.  I accept that it may be unsatisfactory from the Deputy's point of view but I cannot give all that information now.  We are dealing with a commercial company; we are dealing with commercial matters and I certainly am not free to discuss them in great detail at this point.  I would ask the Deputy to accept that in good faith.</P>

Subsection (a) (1) (k) of <Col N="1071" /> the Bill extends this power to cover all types of research.  It is appropriate that the new additional power should be subject to the approval of the Minister but in order to clarify that the peat related research is not ministerially controlled, the above amendment has been proposed.

      <P>I am happy with this improvement on what is already there but, as we discussed earlier when my amendment to this was taken, I still feel it is too restrictive.  It is a point that we need to come back to.  The Minister, to some extent, is beginning to concede the principle that one cannot have every little item of expenditure vetted by two Ministers and he has agreed to allow peat related research out from under this very bureaucratic system of sanction.  The principle applies with equal validity to many of the other things which have been included and remain under the net of dual sanction.

      <P>The Minister is amending section 7 which suggests that any power conferred on the board in relation to cutaway bogs should be exercised only in accordance with such general directives as may be laid down from time to time by the Minister.  That introduces a rather strange sort of animal into the commercial decision-making of Bord na Móna.  The Minister has lectured us in the House that we should not introduce restrictions on the operations of Bord na Móna and he is at pains to lift the yoke from Bord na Móna in making their commercial decisions.  This proposal, by which he has modified the requirement in the original Bill that Coillte Teoranta would call the shots on the use of cut-away, is very unsatisfactory.  The Minister is being left with the ability to lay down directives in some unspecified way. I would like to hear what the Minister hopes to achieve with this compared to a simple situation where the board were under no particular obligation as regards the use of their cutaway and they would make a decision on a commercial basis. They could if they chose set it in grass or put it out for tender for forestry use, either public or private.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1075" /> In page 5, paragraph (b), to delete lines 14 to 30, and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;(3)  The exercise by the Board outside the State of any of the powers confined by paragraphs (a), (b), (g), (h), (i), (j), (k) or (1) of subsection (1) of this section and the exercise by the Board in the State of any of the powers conferred by the said paragraphs (h), (i), (j) or (k) shall be subject to the prior consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>(4)  Any power conferred on the Board by subsection (1) (j) of this section in relation to cut-away bog shall only be exercised in accordance with such general directives as may be laid down, from time to time, by the Minister.</P>
    <P>(5)  In this section &ldquo;cut-away bog&rdquo; means a bog substantially cleared of turf&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment, since being listed on an Order Paper of the previous Dáil has been further amended on the advice of the parliamentary draftsman, and that accounts for some of the changes to the previous amendment.  It amends section 7 in three important respects.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna have asked that the level of ministerial control of their powers outside the State should be relaxed.  They have claimed that section 7 (b) (3) of the Bill is too restrictive.  They accept that it is appropriate to provide for ministerial control in respect of the non-peat related powers but most of the other powers are routine, day-to-day matters.  This point was also raised by many speakers during Second Stage and the amendment to subsection (3) now removes ministerial control on the powers outside the State at paragraphs (c), (d), (e) and (f) of section 7 (a) (1) of the Bill.  These powers relate to such routine and day-to-day activities as entering into contracts, undertaking hire purchase schemes, operating shops and showrooms, and mounting exhibitions. Most of these powers are exercised abroad in the context of the board's <Col N="1076" /> marketing activity and are not ones that require approval by the Minister.</P>
    <P>In relation to ministerial control, the thrust of the Bill is that the non-peat related powers should be subject to the approval of the Minister whereas the board will be free of such control so far as their peat-related powers are concerned. At paragraph (j) of section 7 (a) (1) the board are being given the power to develop commercially certain cutaway and other bogs incapable of commercial exploitation for turf production. However, this non-peat related power is not subject to the approval of the Minister. In keeping with the general thrust of the Bill it is considered appropriate that the Minister should have to give his approval to any developments in this area.  Subsection (3) of this amendment now provides the necessary control.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) of this amendment provides that the use or disposal by the board of cut-away bog shall be subject to ministerial directives.  This is to remove from the original Bill the unqualified right to all cut-away of Coilltes which they consider suitable for afforestation purpose and enables the Minister to implement the recommendations of the independent Committee of experts to consider the use of cut-away when these are received.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) of the amendment includes a definition of cut-away bog in the section.  This necessitates a consequential deletion of the definition in section 1.</P>
    <P>The point that Deputy Bruton raised relates principally to subsection (4).  The position I inherited was that Coillte would have first call on any cut-away bog required for afforestation purposes, Coillte and Bord na Móna would between them examine the various cut-away bogs that were available and Coillte could decide which ones they required for forestry purposes.  The Government decided to make a change in that arrangement and provided for the change in this Bill. The change involved the establishment of a committee of experts to look at the disposal of cut-away bog which is going to <Col N="1077" /> become available in very large quantities over the next 30 to 40 years.  Happily, Bord na Móna through their own research and development have succeeded in transforming cut-away bog, which I suppose heretofore could have been deemed practically derelict land, into excellent grazing land.  Very substantial quantities of cut-away bog will become available over the next 40 years so it is important that the State lay down a comprehensive policy for the use of these lands.  Arguments have been made for use other than afforestation by farmers in the midland area who are adjacent to the cut-away bogs, that these good farmlands might revert to farming purposes to increase the number of smallholders farming in the midlands or other areas where the land is available.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the final outcome of the investigations undertaken by the committee I have set up will be but they are in a position to invite submissions from all interested parties.  The IFA and the ICSMA and other rural organisations have made submissions to the Department in regard to the future policy on the disposal of cut-away bogs.  I felt, and indeed the Government felt, it was necessary to have a comprehensive look at the question and we have appointed a committee under the chairmanship of Mr. Donal Creed, the former Secretary of the Department of Agriculture and Food to receive and consider submissions and make recommendations to the Minister. If the Government support the recommendations of the committee the Minister would want to be in a position to implement those recommendations. The section is amended in order to ensure that the Minister has the power to issue general directives in regard to the future use of cut-away bogs.  I think it is a much more satisfactory arrangement than what has been made heretofore.  I know it has been widely welcomed by the farming organisations and I expect that a very substantial number will avail of the opportunity to present their viewpoint to this group of experts.  I await with great interest the outcome of their work and I <Col N="1078" /> look forward to seeing their recommendations. I expect they will make recommendations to me well before the end of this year.  I am reluctant to delay the disposal of cut-away bogs but I think a couple of months is a small period to wait when one is laying down a policy which may be in operation for many decades.  If the policy is a good one, it could operate over that period and play a very major part in rural life in the areas where this land becomes available in such huge quantities.  The position that obtained was that Bord na Móna after developing the lands put them up for auction and sold them off in very large lots.  I did not consider that very satisfactory from a socio-economic point of view but it would have been satisfactory purely and simply from Bord na Móna's point of view.  I felt it was a wider issue than the Bord na Móna requirement and I am anxious to see the national socio-economic issue addressed in the disposal of these lands.  The quantities that will become available for disposal are very extensive and in the region of 200,000 acres is expected to become available over the next 30 to 40 years.  We are talking about an amount of land equivalent to the size of an Irish county.  It is quite substantial.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The key issue affecting the future of Bord na Móna which needs to be addressed, and I am glad to hear the Minister say that it is being addressed and will be sorted out without delay, is the future use and control of cut-away bog.  It is estimated that between now and the end of the century an area larger than County Louth will become available for alternative uses as Bord na Móna complete their turf cutting operations in areas of the midlands.  Such a large acreage of land becoming available offers tremendous opportunities for major developments for agriculture and related areas.  Considerable research has already been done by Bord na Móna and An Foras Talúntais into the potential alternative uses of the land and there is a number of possibilities including horticulture, biomass, conventional forestry, <Col N="1079" /> grassland and amenity use.  All of these offer both advantages and disadvantages and the best use of cut-away bog may lie in a mix of options to allow for a degree of flexibility which would take account of the local circumstances and changing conditions.  However, it is vital that an early decision be taken as to who is to have responsibility for the development of the cut-away bog in order to allow the necessary planning to begin.  There had been the predictable calls from the farming organisations that the cut-away bogs be divided into small units and handed over to existing or aspiring farmers.  Such a move would be a retrograde step as it is clear that the cut-away bogs will need a centralised drainage system which individual farmers are unlikely to be able to provide.  It is also clear that to get the best return from cut-away bog will require substantial investment and a high level of technical expertise. It also has to be said that the vast majority of farmers showed no inclination to develop bogland, so to let individuals reap the benefits of work done by Bord na Móna would be unfair and economically senseless.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposed by the Minister is unacceptable in that he seems to be reserving exclusively to himself the right to decide the future of cut-away bogs.  The ministerial amendment states: &ldquo;any power conferred on the Board... in relation to cut-away bog shall only be exercised in accordance with such general directives as may be laid down, from time to time, by the Minister&rdquo;.  Another factor to be considered is the position of a very large number of very highly skilled Bord na Móna workers and ESB employees in the turf burning power stations who depend on peat for their livelihood.  Steps must be taken to ensure that the cut-away bogs are developed in such a way as to provide the maximum possible employment opportunity for those who might stand to lose their jobs when the present phase of bog development is completed. The most sensible step would be to give Bord na Móna overall responsibility for the development of cut-away bogs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1080" /> At a time when State companies in general seem to be fair game for every right wing politician and pundit, it is worth reminding the House that the record of Bord na Móna, despite the Irish weather, has been good and that private enterprise has shown little or no interest in bog development.  Section 7 of the Bill as originally drafted seems to place an obligation on Bord na Móna to hand over the cut-away bogs to the new forestry company.  We supported the Forestry Act, 1988 and we welcome the establishment of a commercial State forestry company which the Bill provided for.  We acknowledged totally the need to expand the area under afforestation as the area of Irish land under forestry is only 5 per cent, the smallest in the EC.  It needs to be rapidly expanded.  There is no shortage of land, privately-owned bogland and marginal land which is under-used or not used at all which could and should be acquired by the forestry company without having to take the cut-away bogs from Bord na Móna.  If the jobs of Bord na Móna workers are to be protected as the current phase of bog development is completed the board will need to consider all possible options for the use of cut-away bogs.</P>
    <P>The new forestry company will be involved in all phases of forestry and wood processing.  It will grow its own timber and will also purchase timber from privately-owned forests.  As I said on Second Stage, why not allow Bord na Móna to get into the forestry area if they decide that this is the best option for cut-away bogs and allow them to sell the timber they would produce to the State forestry company in the same way as the private forestry companies?</P>
    <P>The future of the cut-away bogs is too important a matter to leave to the decision of the Minister alone.  I am talking about an area of land equivalent in size to County Louth.  While we accept that the Minister must have a major say in the future of cut-away bogs, the matter is so important that any directive he proposes to make should have the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Col N="1081" />
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of this review group which the Minister has set up, how will the commercial interests of Bord na Móna in this land, which is a valuable asset to them, be balanced with the wider socio-economic concerns to which the Minister refers?  It has long been recommended by numerous people who have looked at the affairs of State companies that where a Minister imposes an obligation upon them to do something which would be non-commercial he should pay for that out of Exchequer funds.  In other words, any burdens they would have to carry for social reasons should be paid for by the Exchequer. The Minister's colleague enshrined that principle in some legislation which has gone through this House in the past.</P>
      <P>What is the Minister's view as to the best commercial use from Bord na Móna's standpoint and the alternatives? If the committee come up with a list of alternatives which include amenity use which would provide no great commercial return to the board, will the Minister envisage some compensation to the board for that loss or will the board have to shoulder the cost?</P>
      <P>The manner in which the bog is exploited by the board would have a bearing on the possibilities of other uses.  Not all uses are compatible with the board's taking every last piece of turf they can recover from the cut-away bog.  Wider uses could be pre-empted by the manner in which turf is extracted from a bog. Does the Minister envisage that the committee might recommend not only upon the use of cut-away bog but also that the board would be under an obligation not to &ldquo;mine out&rdquo; a bog where some purpose was envisaged which required some extra cover on the cut-away?  I am not certain of the technology but I understand this can be a problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the amendment proposed by Deputy Sherlock that the House should have a right to see the type of general directives, I presume the Minster would envisage laying such orders before the House as a matter of course. It is reasonable in that they will affect policy in this area for a long time.  It <Col N="1082" /> concerns 200,000 acres of land and there should be an opportunity for the House to examine these directives.  The amendment as tabled requires that the House should pass a resolution agreeing to the directive.  In my experience, limited though it be in Government, it is very hard to get time positively to approve orders of this nature.  A more reasonable approach would be a system where directives would come into effect unless a motion to rescind them had been tabled within 21 days.  That is much less onerous for a Minister.  It puts Deputies on notice that if they want to see changes they must do something about it.  The Minister does not have to await the order of business. Many would regard these as minor orders which would be put at the bottom of the queue and it could be months before a positive resolution could be made. Deputy Sherlock might consider an alternative framing of this amendment which would allow a directive to come into effect unless a motion seeking its overturn had been tabled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am seeking that the Dáil should delegate to the Minister for Energy of the day the necessary powers to make decisions on policy in relation to the usage of cut-away bog arising from the report of the committee to which I have referred.  It is a question of the exercise of executive power.  I am asking the Dáil today to extend this power to the Minister for Energy of the day.  This is a very important matter because of the amount of land that will become available. If the Dáil gives me the power today, I do not think it would be appropriate to specify in the legislation that the directives I might issue under this Bill should themselves require a further resolution of the House before coming into effect.  It is for the Government to decide what policy they wish to follow in this area.  They are setting about this task by establishing a group of people with special expertise to listen to all the arguments. Some of the arguments made by Deputy Sherlock will no doubt be made to this committee.  I am asking them to consider all these matters and to make <Col N="1083" /> recommendations to me.  I will then consider them and put certain proposals before the Government for implementation. It is the Government who will decide.</P>
      <P>I accept that there could be financial implications for Bord na Móna arising out of certain recommendations that might be made.  If the committee are to make recommendations which would involve a loss or cost of any kind to Bord na Móna, they have been asked to quantify that cost.  That will be taken into consideration by the Minister and the Government when making a decision.  It is very important that the management of the bogs should ensure that the cut-away bog remains suitable for conversion to farmland.  That is also a matter the committee are considering and they will be making recommendations in that regard.</P>
      <P>It is essential in order to turn these boglands into arable land and good grazing land to leave a certain thickness of bog.  There is a mixing of the shale underneath with the bog and that, when properly treated and fertilised, results in the growth of the grasslands.  It is really just a question of proper management and it would be highly inappropriate if Bord na Móna were to be allowed to continue to operate in a vacuum and cut the bog down to the shale and not leave sufficient thickness to facilitate the transformation and conversion back into farmland.  That is a technical point and it will be taken care of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sherlock suggested that this matter was too important to leave it to the Minister and he wanted Bord na Móna to decide on the future of this matter.  We are moving away from the situation where Bord na Móna had full authority in relation to the disposal of cut-away bog.  The earlier Bill brought in by my predecessor proposed a system whereby Coillte would, in consultation with Bord na Móna, have first option on the cut-away bog.  That is the decision which I am changing.  I am also changing the original position which was that Bord na <Col N="1084" /> Móna would dispose of cut-away bog in whatever way they desired.</P>
    <P>I am seeking to establish clearly what is in the national interest in relation to the disposal of these lands.  That is a matter that will be decided when we get the report some time this year.  I invite Deputy Sherlock or any group who wish to make submissions to this committee to do so.  I hope a large number of bodies will be moved to do so, particularly the group of workers to whom we are referring who have a vested interest in this area.  I would like to see their point of view taken into consideration.  The opportunity is there.  It is not for me to say today what my preference is.  Rather than take that course I am taking the longer more difficult course of seeking a comprehensive review of the situation which would facilitate all the different groups who have proposals and ideas on how this land should be disposed of.  I hope the House will welcome the move which is very worthwhile.  I will certainly not delay in coming forward with firm proposals to Government when I receive the report of this committee.</P>

      <P>I have tabled this amendment to sound out the Minister's intention in relation to the remuneration of officers and servants of the board.  The Bill says that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1085" /> ...the Board shall comply with any directives with regard to such remuneration, allowances, terms or conditions which the Minister may give from time to time to the Board with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I want to find out the Minister's philosophy in this area.  If one decides that it is up to the board to run their affairs, a decision about specific remuneration attached to specific positions in the board should be a matter for the board.  I accept that the board would be bound by national agreements and so on, but what has the Minister in mind when he says that he might issue directives on remuneration and allowances to the board?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been the practice in legislation that provision is made to ensure that Government pay policy would be adhered to by the semi-State sector.  This policy has been followed since the enactment of the Gas Act, 1976, which established An Bord Gáis.  Successive Governments since then required that the boards of State-sponsored bodies have regard to Government policy when determining the pay and conditions of their staff.  I am sure the House will agree that it is incumbent on the Government to ensure that this well established policy is continued.  I am merely making provision for it in the first Turf Development Bill which has come before the Dáil for a long time.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge the need for the Government to ensure that the board have regard to Government or national guidelines and to Government policy concerning remuneration and conditions of employment, but I am asking about the intention of this additional thing that the Minister is bringing in, that the Minister may from time to time give directives with regard to remuneration and allowances, terms and conditions of the board.  These I understand are directives outside the national norm and outside Government general policy.  Why <Col N="1086" /> does the Minister see it as being necessary for him to have powers to issue directives in relation to Bord na Móna which might not be issued in relation to other State boards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

      <P>This is the statutory power that the Minister would have to intervene when normal consultation procedures have failed to ensure compliance by management of State bodies with Government policy on pay and terms and conditions of employment.  Without this, the section would be toothless.  Exhorting State bodies to adhere to national pay norms is one thing, but not having the power to implement it is another.</P>

Even without the last four lines the law of the land would be that the board must have regard to these and once the Government had enunciated their policy concerning remuneration and conditions the board would be under an obligation to meet it.  It seems to me that this is bringing in something new apart from the Government's general conditions.  It is giving the Minister a specific function in relation to the pay and conditions of a particular board.  Maybe I am misreading it.</P>

      <P>By virtue of the provisions of the Turf Development Act, 1953, and in particular section 6 thereof, various schemes have been implemented by Bord na Móna which, <i>inter alia</i>, set out the level of superannuation benefits on retirement payable to members of such schemes. Section 6 (2) (b) of the 1953 Act specifies that the contributions to be made by the board to the superannuation fund must be equal to the aggregate of contributions from members in the scheme.  The effect of this was to decrease their contributions to the scheme, notwithstanding actuarial advice to the contrary and in particular notwithstanding the realities that such limitation on the levels of contribution by the board have, according to actuarial reports commissioned by them, resulted in serious under-funding of the schemes. The amendment is intended to enable the board to increase their contribution to more than 50 per cent of the total.</P>

      <P>I should like to get clarification.  As I understand it, there has been a problem with the pension fund in Bord na Móna and the board have been setting aside money to top up the pension funds to ensure their continued ability to meet the draws upon them.  I should like the Minister to tell us the state of the pension funds in relation to the prospective draws upon them on an actuarial <Col N="1088" /> basis, and whether this enabling legislation will allow the board to commit the money they have already been setting aside.  Are these funds additional to what we understand has already been set aside, as I heard a figure of £12 million mentioned which the board are putting into their fund over a number of years so that it will be adequate to meet requirements?</P>
      <P>I should also like clarification as to the effect of the accelerated redundancy programme of the board on the pension fund.  Is there a problem with the redundancy package in relation to the pension fund in that it creates a drain on the fund which runs ahead of normal actuarial setasides by the board?  Does the Minister feel that there might be problems for the pension fund as a result of high levels of redundancy in the board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The payments arising from the redundancy scheme were not the cause of the problems in the pension scheme.  The problems in the pension scheme arose through an underfunding because the provisions in the legislation which did not enable the board to increase their contributions above 50 per cent mean that the shortfall would be in the region of £12 million.  The board have made a decision to meet these following the enactment of this legislation.  The scheme will be amended and the increases which they were unable to meet will be paid from 1 July 1989: the figure will be up to 10 per cent on existing pensions to all pensioners.  There had not been an increase over the previous four years.  The board have made arrangements for the funding of the additional moneys and can proceed to make the necessary arrangements when the Bill is enacted.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1090" /> In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>2.  &mdash;Section 1 (1) of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the deletion of the definitions of &lsquo;aquifer&rsquo; and &lsquo;sewer&rsquo; and the insertion of the following definitions before the definition of &lsquo;board of conservators&rsquo;;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;aquifer&rdquo; means any stratum or combination of strata that stores or transmits groundwater;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;combined drain&rdquo; means a drainage pipe, or a system of such pipes, that is not vested in or controlled by a sanitary authority and is used to convey trade effluent or other matter (other than storm water) from two or more premises to any waters or to a sewer;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;fisheries region&rdquo; has the meaning assigned to it by the Fisheries Act, 1980, and includes the Foyle Area, within the meaning of the Foyle Fisheries Act, 1952;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;regional board&rdquo; has the meaning assigned to it by the Fisheries Act, 1980, and includes the Foyle Fisheries Commission;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;sewer&rdquo; means a sewer within the meaning of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Acts, 1878 to 1964, that is vested in or controlled by a sanitary authority and includes a sewage treatment works, and a sewage disposal works, that is vested in or controlled by a sanitary authority;&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is concerned with the definition of various terms and, if adopted, would have the effect of replacing section 2 of the Bill and require a consequential change in section 22.  The present section 2 defines two terms, &ldquo;fisheries region&rdquo; and &ldquo;regional board&rdquo; so as to take account of the transfer of fisheries functions, including those relating to water pollution, from the former <Col N="1091" /> boards of conservators to regional fisheries boards and to make express provision for the inclusion of the Foyle Fisheries Commission.  These definitions are, in essence, being aligned with more recent fisheries legislation which is the responsibility of the Department of the Marine.</P>
    <P>The definitions of &ldquo;fisheries region&rdquo; and &ldquo;regional board&rdquo; are being repeated in this amendment, which now includes the additional terms &ldquo;aquifer&rdquo;, &ldquo;combined drain&rdquo; and &ldquo;sewer&rdquo;.  From a drafting point of view it is preferable to replace the section in full rather than attempt to cater for these terms through a series of piecemeal additions.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Aquifer&rdquo;, which is already in section 1 of the 1977 Water Pollution Act, is being redefined so as to cater more fully for the requirements of an EC Directive on the protection of groundwater against pollution.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Combined drain&rdquo; and &ldquo;sewer&rdquo; are being redefined following a detailed review of the legislation on sewers and drains.  The new definitions are intended to ensure the effective operation of the provisions of section 22 of the Bill.  That section will allow a sanitary authority to declare a combined drain to be a sewer for the purposes of the 1977 Act and the Bill where they consider it desirable for the purposes of improving the level of control on trade effluent discharges.  An order under section 22 would have the effect of requiring individual licences for each trade discharge to the drain, subject to appropriate conditions in each case. The present situation in relation to discharges to drains is, as I am sure Deputies are aware, that the combined effluent from a number of industries may only be licensed in respect of the point at which it discharges to waters or to a sanitary authority's sewer.  In these circumstances it can be extremely difficult to identify the particular industry responsible should pollution occur.  Section 22 and the new definitions of &ldquo;combined drain&rdquo; and &ldquo;sewer&rdquo; are intended to ensure that effluent discharges to drains are amenable to greater control, stricter <Col N="1092" /> monitoring and enforcement, just as would apply were the discharges in question to go to a sewer which is the responsibility of a sanitary authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>After the definition of &ldquo;sewer&rdquo; to insert the following definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;waters&rsquo; includes&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  any (or any part of any) river, stream, lake, canal, reservoir, aquifer, pond, watercourse, or other inland waters, whether natural or artificial,</P>
      <P>(b)  any tidal waters, and</P>
      <P>(c)  where the context permits any beach, riverbank and salt marsh and the channel or bed of anything mentioned in paragraph (a) which is for the time being dry,</P>
      <P>but does not include a sewer.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment does not indicate any disagreement with the amendment the Minister has proposed.  It relates to the definition of &ldquo;waters&rdquo; as contained originally in the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977.  Concern was expressed at the time of the publication of the Bill that there was a possibility that prosecutions could be brought under the Bill against persons who were not responsible for causing pollution but on whose lands waters came and when the source of the pollution originated in lands other than theirs.  It is proposed to amend the definition of &ldquo;waters&rdquo; as contained in section 2 of the 1977 Act and replace it with the definition proposed which is:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;waters&rsquo; includes&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  any (or any part of any) river, stream, lake, canal, reservoir, aquifer, pond, watercourse, or other inland waters, whether natural or artificial,</P>
      <P>(b)  any tidal waters, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  where the context permits any beach, riverbank and salt marsh and <Col N="1093" /> the channel or bed of anything mentioned in paragraph (a) which is for the time being dry,</P>
    <P>but does not include a sewer.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Some of the later amendments to the Bill may resolve the problems I am concerned with.  I am anxious to ensure that under the Bill there will be full powers to properly prosecute any person who is the cause of the pollution.  Every Member wants to ensure that the pollutor is prosecuted but that the person innocent of any wrongdoing does not find himself the subject matter of court proceedings. There is a variety of amendments, including ministerial amendments, tabled to later sections of the Bill.  If ministerial amendments, or those tabled by this side of the House by Fine Gael, are accepted many of the worries we have may be resolved.  Nevertheless, I am anxious to hear the Minister's response to my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept Deputy Shatter's amendment.  If adopted, the amendment would change the definition of &ldquo;waters&rdquo; in the 1977 Water Pollution Act by deleting the reference and, I quote, &ldquo;or other area which is contiguous to anything mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b)&rdquo; from paragraph (c) of his proposed amendment.  In all other respects the definition would remain the same.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there was some controversy about the definition of &ldquo;waters&rdquo; when the Bill was published, and going through the other House, with claims by certain members of the farming community that the changes being made would make it impossible for farmers to carry on their normal practices.  These claims also made an issue over the likelihood of farmers being prosecuted because some slurry entered dry drains during normal land spreading, even though there was no prospect of waters or fish life being adversely affected.  I am aware that the IFA sought changes to this effect in the Bill.  It is clear from what Deputy Shatter has said in relation to his amendment that he has been influenced by such claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1094" /> These claims are all the more difficult to understand when it is realised that the Bill does not contain any provision which seeks to change the definition of &ldquo;waters&rdquo; which has applied since the 1977 Act came into effect.  Agriculture has not been brought to a standstill in the intervening years and I have no reason to believe that this will happen in the future either.</P>
    <P>The reference to &ldquo;contiguous areas&rdquo; is necessary to afford some element of protection to waters.  If polluting matter is placed so close to a river bank that it will inevitably gain entry to the river the practice is clearly unacceptable.  There is no evidence of local authorities availing of the present definition of &ldquo;waters&rdquo; to act in an unreasonable manner.  In the event that they did so act I have no doubt that the courts would ensure the proper application of the law and the non-conviction of the alleged polluter.</P>
    <P>It is worth nothing that the definition of &ldquo;waters&rdquo; does not include any reference to &ldquo;drain&rdquo;.  The offence in the 1977 Water Pollution Act and the definition of what constitutes &ldquo;polluting matter&rdquo; clearly imply that fish or spawning grounds must in fact be placed at risk or that other legitimate uses of waters for domestic, industrial, commercial, agricultural or recreational purposes are jeopardised as a result of the entry of polluting matter to waters.</P>
    <P>It is extremely difficult to envisage any court convicting a farmer of a water pollution offence where slurry entered a field drain in a situation in which no risk was involved to fish life or where disruption of other uses did not arise.  I believe that the proposed amendment would represent a weakening of the legislation to protect waters and accordingly I am not prepared to accept it.</P>
    <P>The other point raised by Deputy Shatter is covered in amendment No. 28 which will be moved later and which talks about only being able to prosecute where the pollution offence originated in a particular farm rather than elsewhere.  That covers one of the points made by Deputy Shatter.  In these circumstances I cannot <Col N="1095" /> accept the amendment which would substantially weaken the Bill and the 1977 Act.  The purpose of this legislation is to strengthen the law in relation to water pollution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>On this issue I support what the Minister said.  The purpose of the Bill is to strengthen the 1977 Act which, I think it is fair to say, was found to be less than adequate to deal with the problems of water pollution.  It would be going in the opposite direction if we were to agree to Deputy Shatter's amendment which seeks to restrict the definition of waters.  Even since the enactment of the 1977 Act there has been a greater awareness of what constitutes water, a greater awareness of the many ways in which waters can become polluted not just through surface water but through ground water.  Deputy Shatter's amendment seeks to restrict the definition of waters.</P>
      <P>The exclusion of other areas which is contiguous to anything mentioned in paragraphs (a) or (b) would, as I understand it, remove areas which are in the vicinity of a river.  Suppose a river burst its banks and there was the kind of flooding that is now so prevalent as a result of storms, etc., the potential for polluting matter being brought into waterways would be considerable.  Deputy Shatter's amendment would have the effect of restricting that.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said what is behind Deputy Shatter's amendment is the representations made by the IFA following the publication of this Bill and what, in turn, is behind that is an attempt to avoid a situation where the Bill could be used to control either agricultural activity or other forms of activity in areas contiguous to waters.  It would be a retrograde step if Deputy Shatter's amendment was accepted.  I am somewhat surprised that he is proposing it and certainly I am opposed to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat amazed at the Minister's sanctimonious response about my being influenced by the IFA <Col N="1096" /> and by Deputy Gilmore's response.  From this side of the House we have made it clear for some considerable time that we want updated and more effective water pollution legislation on the Statute Book. This particular Bill was published in January 1989 and we are only now taking Committee Stage because there were serious defects in it.  I presume the Minister will acknowledge, as we go through the Bill, that a substantial number of amendments the Minister is tabling, which will improve the Bill and make it workable, derive from amendments published by the Fine Gael Party last spring and also derived from detailed discussions which the Minister for the Environment had with the IFA and the ICMSA.</P>
      <P>So far as the Fine Gael Party are concerned, we must have proper legislation on the Statute Book to tackle water pollution. We are not interested in prosecutions being brought against innocent people.  The people we must get at are the polluters, the people who behave irresponsibly. A very real concern was expressed that ordinary farming practices which did not give rise to any real risks of pollution could result in wrongful prosecutions being brought.  In acknowledgement of that there are a number of amendments tabled by the Minister which presumably will be taken on board as we go through Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I particularly made the point that in the light of the amendments now being tabled I felt my amendment to this section was not necessarily relevant at this stage, but I was anxious to get the Minister's response to it to ensure that the problem that existed when the Bill was originally published was being resolved. The Minister gave her answer and referred to a later amendment which she has tabled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister might be a little more respectful of the representations received from a variety of groups who, as I understand it, are as committed to ending problems of water pollution as we are in this House.  They are also anxious to ensure that we have proper legislation on the Statute Book.  The Minister might be <Col N="1097" /> more circumspect in her less than complimentary inclinations towards the IFA and the ICMSA who went to a lot of trouble to highlight problems with the legislation in various areas and without whose work the Minister would not be putting forward a number of her amendments.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore need not express any worries about the commitment of the Fine Gael Party to dealing with this particular problem.  It was because of our concern about this area and the failure not just of agriculture or industry but of local authorities to tackle the problems of water pollution that we brought before this House the Environment Protection Agency Bill which the Minister opposite opposed.</P>
    <P>I would be a little circumspect in expressing any criticism of the proposal; It is not a proposal I am pushing.  I wanted the Minister's response to it.  She confirmed that the concerns we have about this definition as it would interact with later sections will be resolved as we go through the Bill.  I am happy to accept the various amendments the Minister is making to the definitions section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear that we are not seeking in any way to weaken the legislation in terms of the definition of &ldquo;waters&rdquo;.  That is the reason we are opposed to this amendment.  It is not the intention of this legislation, nor I am sure would it be the intention of any Deputy, to seek to prosecute anybody innocent or to seek to bring proceedings against anybody who is not responsible for a pollution offence.  That is why in a later section I will be proposing an amendment to ensure that it is only where the pollution originates in a particular area that proceedings can be taken.  That is different to seeking to limit the definition of &ldquo;waters&rdquo; to such an extent that if polluting matter is placed on the brink of waters or, as Deputy Gilmore rightly said, in circumstances where a river can overflow and the matter can be taken into the waters very easily, it can cause an incident of pollution.  Besides the river overflowing, through seepage, and so on, <Col N="1098" /> polluting matter can very easily get into water courses.  For that reason areas that are contiguous to waterways have to be included in the definition.  I am opposing this amendment but if the Deputy is not pressing it we should leave it at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one brief matter I would like the Minister to clarify.  In the definition of &ldquo;combined drain&rdquo; there is a reference to drainage pipes which are not vested in or controlled by a sanitary authority.  I would like the Minister to clarify if in the 1977 Act or some other Act or in the Bill before us the drains which are controlled by sanitary authorities are included or excluded?  I do not understand the reason the definition of &ldquo;combined drain&rdquo; excludes those which are controlled by a sanitary authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a difficult area. The position is that if it is controlled by a local sanitary authority it is actually called a &ldquo;sewer&rdquo; but if not, it is called a &ldquo;combined drain&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>We now come to amendment No. 3 in the name of the Minister.  Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 are alternatives and amendment No. 51 is consequential.  I am suggesting therefore&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek clarification from you, a Cheann Comhairle, on one matter.  I am not sure whether it has arisen out of a misunderstanding but section 2 of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, provides for the establishment of a Water Pollution Advisory Council.  That Act is still in <Col N="1099" /> force as we are only debating this matter today.  Such a council did exist up until the end of December 1986.  No new appointees were appointed to that council following the 1987 general election.  In amendment No. 2 I sought to slightly amend the manner in which the Water Pollution Advisory Council would work and proposed a less lengthy name for it, the Water Pollution Council.  However, a Cheann Comhairle, you ruled that amendment out of order.  As the Water Pollution Advisory Council is an existing body under the Act I cannot understand the reason for this.  I was not trying to create a new body but simply to give the existing council a more modern name and to slightly change the method of appointment. In the circumstances I cannot understand why amendment No. 2 has been ruled out of order.  I ask for an explanation.  I could understand it if no such body was in existence as I know I could not provide for one.  I fully appreciate that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have conveyed my decision to the Deputy.  His amendment, amendment No. 2, clearly involves a potential charge on the Revenue.  Section 30 of the Bill proposes to abolish the advisory council, to which he referred, provided for in section 2 of the Principal Act. Amendment No. 2 seeks to establish a somewhat similar body, the expenses of which must be paid for from the Exchequer.  It therefore imposes a potential charge on the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 52 appears to be consequential on amendment No. 2 but even if it is intended as an alternative it has the effect of continuing in operation a body where the term of office of its members expired in 1986 and whose expenses were met from the Exchequer. Consequently, it is out of order as amendments must be considered in the manner they affect the Bill before us and not in the manner they affect existing law.  This is a slight elaboration.  My ruling has been carefully considered and is not open to discussion or challenge now, as the Deputy appreciates.  I elaborate so that <Col N="1100" /> it will be clear to the Deputy and the House that it involves a potential charge on the Revenue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, are you saying, Sir, leaving aside amendment No. 2, that it is not open to an Opposition party in the context of amendment No. 52 to formally propose the deletion of a provision from a section of the Bill currently before the House which proposes to abolish a body provided for by statute?  The Government have failed to comply with the statute and appoint members to the council.  Surely this cannot inhibit the correctness of amendment No. 52 in trying to oppose the Government who intend abolishing an independent body established to deal with the problems associated with water pollution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore and Deputy Shatter's amendments relate to a prosecution of a water pollution offence under section 3 of the 1977 Act, while my related amendment, amendment No. 51, deals with the same issue in relation to offences under section 171 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959.  The approaches adopted by Deputy Gilmore and Deputy Shatter have certain merits which we will probably discuss later and represent an improvement on the good defence contained in the 1977 Act.  I believe however that the Bill can be improved further in this regard.  I am, accordingly, proposing amendment No. 3 which will provide for a good defence in line with similar provisions contained in the more modern Air Pollution Act.  This will entail the application of the best practicable means concept so as to prevent water pollution.  There is a clear responsibility on everyone to take steps to prevent water pollution from their activities.  I believe that not only is it necessary to require the installation of appropriate facilities to do this but also to impose an obligation to use and maintain these facilities so that pollution does not occur.  In some situations taking appropriate measures may entail providing and using facilities, such as sufficiently large and well constructed effluent or slurry storage tanks.  In others it may involve <Col N="1102" /> complying with the norms of good agricultural practice in relation to quantities and timing of slurry spreading on land.</P>
      <P>My proposed good defence requires the defendant to prove to the court that the defence provision is applicable in the particular circumstances pertaining to his case.  The amendment strikes the right balance and I am confident that the courts will apply this provision in a manner that only the most genuine cases will avoid conviction.  In the circumstances I cannot accept the amendments proposed by either Deputy Shatter or Deputy Gilmore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>When this legislation was published considerable concern was expressed about the original provision contained in it which sought to displace a provision in section 3 of the Principal Act which states:</P>
      <P>It shall be a good defence to a prosecution under this section to prove to the satisfaction of the court that the person charged took all reasonable care to prevent the entry prohibited under subsection (1).</P>
      <P>It is proposed to replace this with the following:</P>
      <P>It shall be a defence to a charge of committing an offence under this section for the accused to prove to the satisfaction of the court that either&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  he could not have reasonably foreseen that the act or alleged omission concerned might cause or permit polluting matter to enter waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concern was expressed that the proposed amendment to the 1977 Act would remove what has become known as the good defence provision which the Minister has referred to, with the result that persons could be wrongly convicted of causing water pollution in circumstances in which they foresaw the possibility of pollution occurring and took all reasonable care to prevent such pollution.  My amendment would ensure that where a person has acted responsibly and taken <Col N="1103" /> reasonable care to prevent pollution and pollution occurs without their being at fault they would have a good defence. My amendment reads:</P>
    <P>It shall be a defence to a charge of committing an offence under this section of the accused to prove to the satisfaction of the court that either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  he could not have reasonably foreseen that the act or alleged omission concerned might cause or permit polluting matter to enter waters, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  he did foresee the possibility of polluting matter entering waters and that he took all reasonable precautions to prevent such entry.</P>
    <P>Last spring Fine Gael published the amendment I am now referring to to try to ensure that we would properly tackle the problem.  The Minister's amendment is a very substantial change from that contained in the original Bill.  It is worth making the point that the original concerns were expressed specifically by the IFA and the ICMSA who at all times told me they were anxious to ensure that those who were polluting were properly brought before the courts, but where an incident occurred that could not possibly be foreseen in circumstances where a person had taken all reasonable precautions, it simply was not correct that he should be open to prosecution.</P>
    <P>Although the semantics are different, it seems that there is no substantial difference between what the Minister is proposing and what we are proposing.  It seems to come back to one thing &mdash; the Minister could have been gracious enough to acknowledge that the amendment we published last spring might be of assistance to the Department in looking at the position in this area.  I want to emphasise that what this party want to ensure is that people responsible for pollution are prosecuted and that those prosecutions are successful.  What we want to ensure, in industry or agriculture, is that where there is a risk of pollution the industry, the agricultural concern or the <Col N="1104" /> individual farmer involved takes all reasonable precautions to prevent pollution. That involves looking at the type of business, what risks it creates for the environment and ensuring that necessary action is taken in the context of the type of facilities provided and the type of practices applied to ensure that what one is doing does not create pollution.</P>
    <P>What we do not want to happen is that the person who takes all reasonable precautions but is, for example, suddenly confronted with the extraordinary weather conditions we have had in recent months, and finds that a river two miles away overflows and creates massive flooding which results in pollution occurring in circumstances which nobody could either have envisaged or protected against, would find himself prosecuted.</P>
    <P>I do not see a very substantial difference in practical terms between what the Minister is now proposing and what we are proposing but I want on the record of this House confirmation from the Minister that a person who did foresee the possibility of polluting matters entering waters and who took all reasonable and proper precautions against such a happening but who finds, due to extraordinary circumstances that pollution takes place, will not find himself at risk of prosecution under the Minister's amendment. I think I am right in saying that.</P>
    <P>Lest Deputy Gilmore or anyone else suggest it, it is not a question of watering down the Water Pollution Act but of ensuring that people who have taken all proper precautions, who want to ensure pollution does not take place, do not find themselves wrongly before the courts.  In the context of tackling pollution, we are not legislating to get a variety of convictions against innocent people.  We want to get the people who are guilty of bad practices, the people who have not taken reasonable care, the people who have not spent moneys to prevent polluting matter entering water courses, the pharmaceutical, chemcial or industrial plant that is being careless in its operations, and ensure that they are properly prosecuted.  We do not want to see people <Col N="1105" /> who have done everything possible to anticipate a pollution incident, the subject of prosecution.</P>
    <P>Subject to what the Minister has to say, we will not be pressing our amendment because I think it is fair to say that the Government have responded to the concerns we expressed nine months ago about this provision.  I do not mind a different form of wording so long as our concerns are dealt with.  I am anxious to ensure &mdash; and I want reassurance from the Minister on this &mdash; that her particular wording will not water down the Bill either.  I want to make sure that her wording will ensure that the polluter can still be properly prosecuted and that the technicality of the wording used will not result in people who are guilty getting off.</P>

      <P>I can certainly give that assurance to Deputy Shatter.  At the end of the day it comes down to the court's interpreting this legislation and the amendment we are suggesting would put an onus on the courts to ensure when considering prosecution proceedings, that the person against whom the offence is alleged has provided, maintained, used, operated and supervised appropriate facilities.  I do not think there is much between the original amending Bill as passed by the Seanad and which has been reiterated by Deputy Shatter, the position of Deputy Gilmore and my own position.  Our amendment, however, puts an onus on persons to provide facilities, to maintain them, to use them, to supervise them and to operate them, and if somebody does that I do not believe it would be reasonable to prosecute or have them convicted of a pollution offence.</P>
      <P>Since it is generally the view that local authorities do not prosecute enough rather than that they prosecute too much, I do not think we need worry that there will be any blatant misuse of the legislation. At the end of the day, it will be for the courts to decide and this amendment will give guidance to the courts as to what they are to look for in trying to decide if somebody made a reasonable effort.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that both the Minister and Deputy Shatter concluded that there was not a lot between the three of us on this issue.  There certainly is a very great deal between us.  I would agree that we all want to stop water pollution and that we all want to see water polluters prosecuted but the only way we will stop water pollution and ensure that water polluters are prosecuted and that those prosecutions are effective, is not by speeches in the House but by what is actually in the legislation.</P>
      <P>Why are we here at all?  We are here because it has been found that the 1977 Act was not adequate to deal with the problem of water pollution.  The present Bill was born out of the number of fish kills which occurred, particularly in 1987 when it became apparent that there was a necessity to improve the legislation which was weak.  The area where the legislation was particularly weak was this section we are now addressing.  Why was section 3 of the 1977 Act weak?  It was weak because subsection (1), a superb subsection, says that a person shall not cause or permit any polluting matters to enter waters but subsection (3) states that it shall be a good defence to a prosecution under this section to prove to the satisfaction of the court that the person charged took all reasonable care to prevent the entry prohibited under subsection (1).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was generally accepted that that subsection in the 1977 Act was one of the principal weaknesses in that Act and was the escape hatch through which polluters could avoid prosecution.  That conclusion is not an invention of mine.  That is quite clear in the explanatory memorandum which was circulated with the Bill when it was first published and which stated that the very first provision of the new Bill was an amendment of the good defence provision in section 3 (3) of the 1977 Act, to put a greater onus on the person charged to prove he could not reasonably have foreseen that his act or omission might cause pollution of the waters.  The Government's position was that subsection 3 (3) of the 1977 Act was inadequate and the formula they put forward <Col N="1107" /> in the Bill as originally published was an effort to tighten that up.</P>
    <P>The local authorities, who have had the responsibility of implementing the 1977 Act, have told the Department &mdash; the Minister will be aware of this &mdash; that they found that section 3 (3) of the 1977 Act was unworkable and was primarily responsible for their failure to effect prosecutions. The regional fishery boards would not use that subsection.  That was one reason that they, when effecting a prosecution, relied on the 1959 Fisheries Act rather than the 1977 Water Pollution Act.  They found this subsection was the hatch through which polluters could escape.</P>
    <P>Before we get into the semantics of the various amendments it is worth reflecting on why we have a good defence provision at all in this legislation.  It seems to be a somewhat unusual provision in legislation. For example, the Road Traffic Acts have nothing like this.  If you are caught speeding you make your case to the judge and the judge will decide whether your defence is a good one, but nothing in the Road Traffic Acts provides that it shall be a good defence, for example, if you tell the judge you were in a hurry on your way to the maternity hospital.  Ambulances and fire engines all have to comply with the provisions of the Road Traffic Acts, and the reason we do not get a glut of what Deputy Shatter describes as unreasonable prosecutions under the Road Traffic Acts is that the prosecuting authorities use a certain amount of common sense when applying them, as by and large do the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>Why then is it necessary to have a good defence provision at all in the Water Pollution Bill?  We are, after all, dealing with something that is quite serious.  Section 3 (1) of the 1977 Act, which is what all this relates to, provides that a person shall not cause or permit any polluting matter to enter waters, and polluting matter is defined in quite a serious way. It &ldquo;includes any poisonous or noxious matter, and any substance (including explosive, liquid or gas) the entry or discharge of which into any waters is liable <Col N="1108" /> to render those or any other waters poisonous or injurious to fish, spawning grounds or the food of any fish, or to injure fish in their value as human food, or to impair the usefulness of the bed and soil of any waters as spawning grounds or their capacity to produce the food of fish or to render such waters harmful or detrimental to public health or to domestic, commercial, industrial, agricultural or recreational uses&rdquo;.  Therefore, polluting matter as defined in the 1977 Act is quite serious.  We are not talking about any old thing that goes into water; we are talking about matter that is poisonous, noxious, damaging to public health, damaging to food &mdash; quite serious matter getting into water.  Therefore, why should there be a provision in the Water Pollution Bill at all which provides that it is a good defence if somebody took all reasonable care to prevent it occurring?</P>
    <P>The reason is very simple.  It is one of those classic double standards one gets in legislation.  On the one hand you are saying that here we have fine legislation, no water pollution, but here is the way out of it.  I suppose it is a very Irish form of legislating.  The phrase &ldquo;took all reasonable care&rdquo; was wide open, as it was proved, and could not be operated by the local authorities and by the fishery boards.  There is a very strong argument for the deletion altogether of that subsection of the 1977 Act, and I gave serious consideration to tabling an amendment to its total deletion.  However, having regard to the debate on Second Stage and to the sensitivities my comments on that Stage provoked, I felt that perhaps it was more prudent and there was a better possibility of getting a more moderated amendment through the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister when initially tabling the Bill agreed that the provision in the 1977 Act should be tightened, that the phraseology &ldquo;took all reasonable care&rdquo; was wide open and something was needed to replace it.  This was one of the areas seized on by the IFA in particular in their criticism of the Bill when it was published, presumably because they felt &mdash; in my opinion rightly &mdash; that the new <Col N="1109" /> Bill would increase the possibility of prosecutions and would increase the success rate of those prosecutions.</P>
    <P>After the Bill had gone through the Seanad and the Minister had successfully fended off the criticisms of the original replacement of the subsection in the 1977 Act, the new &ldquo;good defence&rdquo;, clause, we then had a general election.  As very often happens in general elections, commitments were made.  I would like to put on record a document which was circulated by the Minister before the general election mainly to farmers: <i>General Information on Provision of the Local Government (Water Pollution) (Amendment) Bill, 1989</i>, which says that the new good defence provision in the Bill is intended to put a greater onus on a defendant than the existing provision in the 1977 Act, to prove that he could not have reasonably foreseen that his act or omission might cause water pollution.  It states that the Bill also provides that the good defence will be available in cases of prosecution under the Fisheries Acts.  No such defence is available under the legislation at present.  Some local authorities and other interests had sought the removal of the good defence provision based on the experience of attempting to enforce the Water Pollution Act.  The fisheries boards also regard the present defence as unsatisfactory and instead have preferred to seek prosecutions under the Fisheries Act, 1959.  The IFA regarded the modified defence provision as going too far and had suggested that the 1977 Act provision should be retained and possibly extended to include a requirement in relation to taking precautionary measures.  It states that the Minister is agreeable to the retention of the 1977 Act provision expanded to include a requirement to provide and maintain reasonable facilities to prevent water pollution, and on Committee Stage an amendment to this effect will be put down for consideration by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>There you have it, a general election, a commitment made after the Bill had gone through the Seanad that the Government would retain the same old good defence clause that in the 1977 Act <Col N="1110" /> was proved unworkable.  Not only that, the Government agree that they will extend it, so that they will make it even more wide open for people to escape prosecution under it.  The Minister has talked about it as being an improvement. In my opinion it worsens the provision in the 1977 Act which was already found to be unworkable.  Not only does it retain precisely the same wording of &ldquo;taking all reasonable care&rdquo; as was the case in the 1977 Act, but it is further qualified by the phrase &ldquo;having regard to all the circumstances, were suitable for the purpose of such prevention.&rdquo;  As I am sure Deputy Shatter as a lawyer would be aware, as such clauses &ldquo;having regard to all the circumstances&rdquo; are the kind of clauses which are open to wide interpretation in the courts.  Experience has shown that it is precisely those kinds of clauses which make it impossible for prosecutions to be effective under an Act such as this.  In fact the situation is worsened. The 1959 Fisheries Act did not have this good defence clause and that was one of the reasons the fisheries boards used the 1959 Act but now the 1959 Act will have this good defence clause applied to it by this legislation.</P>
    <P>The wording used in the Minister's amendment is precisely the same wording as was agreed with the IFA.  I have no objection in principle to the IFA or any organisation coming in and making their case of a Minister &mdash; in fact I support it &mdash; and negotiating their position.  That is in the nature of democracy.  However, I do not think that should blind us to the fact that what is actually involved is a watering down of the Bill as presented originally.  That is quite clear from the fact that the IFA in communication with their members represented it as such. They said they were in disagreement with the amendment to this provision &mdash; the good defence provision &mdash; that they had been successful in getting the term &ldquo;could not have reasonably foreseen&rdquo; changed to &ldquo;took all reasonable care by providing, maintaining, and supervising facilities suitable having regard to all the circumstances for preventing pollution,&rdquo; precisely the wording of the amendment <Col N="1111" /> the Minister has presented to us.  In other words, the amendment the Minister puts before us is the amendment which was agreed by the IFA who argued their case that the Bill as presented would tighten up the situation.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, I had considered tabling an amendment for the deletion of section 3 (3) of the 1977 Act, but I felt that an amendment of that kind would not get the support of the House, having regard to the debate which took place on Second Stage.  The case was made that a distinction should be drawn between persons who cause pollution and persons who permit pollution.  The argument was made that if, for example, some polluting matter happened to be passing through a farm on its way to a watercourse, it would be unreasonable not to have some defence provision built into the Bill to protect somebody who might be prosecuted in that situation.  That is a reasonable point and my own amendment would extend the original wording in the Bill as initiated to a situation where it would not apply to people who had caused pollution.</P>
    <P>Finally, it is important to remember that this Bill applies not only to farmers but to all potential polluters of water, whether from agriculture, industry and indeed I hope, if other amendments are accepted, to local authorities as well.  It is important that there is a clear determination by the Legislature to deal with water pollution and to deal effectively with those who transgress in that area.  I think it would be quite wrong to have a provision retained in the Bill and, under the Minister's amendment, extended which would enable polluters to escape prosecution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a number of things I must say in reply to Deputy Gilmore. First, I am not familiar with the letter he quoted on Second Stage.  I have made inquiries from my officials and they are not familiar with this letter, either. In any event if the letter arose either <Col N="1112" /> before or during the last election campaign, it was during the régime of a different Government.</P>
      <P>On the question of this amendment, I believe, and this is my advice, too, that this amendment substantially strengthens the 1977 legislation because it puts an onus on the person against whom a prosecution offence is alleged and on the court to make sure that the person in question had proper facilities in place, used the facilities and maintained, operated and supervised them.  That is an extremely powerful position and much more powerful than the position under the 1977 Act where it could be argued, and was argued successfully in court, that a person took reasonable precautions, but they were never defined.  It was never defined what reasonable precautions were and that they included having to put in facilities, maintain them, use them and so on.  That is why I believe this strengthens the present position.  I can assure Deputy Gilmore that I have spoken to people in the farming community who are not at all happy at the amendment being proposed by the Government and see it as a strengthening of the law and putting an onus on them to instal proper facilities, to maintain them and to use them.  The assertions he makes in regard to the farming community may not be justified and if he makes inquiries he may discover what I have discovered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fair to table this amendment, for this reason.  A pollution incident can occur even though somebody has taken all reasonable care, has installed facilities and used them and so on.  A pollution incident can occur through an act of God, for example, using the example of earthquakes in the Irish context may be unfair but the Deputy referred to flooding and matters of that kind.  It would be unfair in those circumstances for somebody to be convicted.  Where a pollution incident occurs as a result of something outside the control of a farmer or an industrialist or whoever and where they have taken all reasonable care and have installed facilities, used them, supervised them and so on, it would be unreasonable and <Col N="1113" /> wrong to prosecute and that is why the amendment is being moved.</P>
    <P>People inquired as to why we should have to put the onus on people to use the facilities and it was suggested that if somebody puts expensive facilities in place they are obviously going to use them, but I believe that is not the case. Very often expensive slurry tanks and so on can be put in place but can be used for other purposes.  That is why it was felt necessary to put the onus on the person not just to instal the facilities but to make sure that they are in use and so on.  In the circumstances I consider this to be a balanced and reasonable amendment.  I disagree with Deputy Gilmore, I would not be here tonight if I felt it was a sham and that we were not dealing with the main problems of the 1977 Act.  I believe we are and I have been advised both independently and by my officials that that is the case.  It is because that is the case I am quite confident to push this amendment.  If in time it is shown it is not working, I will have no hesitation in tabling another amendment.  Indeed on Report Stage I might have a look again at the wording &ldquo;having regard to all the circumstances&rdquo;.  If that is going to cause problems I am quite open to looking at it.  The intention is to strengthen the law to make sure that those who commit pollution offences are prosecuted but equally to ensure that innocent parties are not so convicted and cannot be so convicted. That is reasonable, it is balanced and it is what we all want to achieve.  To argue about the words here and there would be unfair in the circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am loath to get involved in an argument between Deputy Gilmore and the Minister, Deputy Harney.  I am inclined to leave them at it.  I think I made the point that what Deputy Gilmore wants is what lawyers describe as a strict liability offence, that is an offence created no matter what steps someone has taken to ensure that pollution will not occur.  In the event of an act of God, such as the appalling flooding we have had in the past few days and which the Government do not seem to think is having any <Col N="1114" /> detrimental effect on the country &mdash; if they do not want to visit the constituencies where it is having an impact all the need to do is watch television at night &mdash; you cannot prosecute somebody who has done everything reasonably possible if a pollution incident occurs.</P>
      <P>What Deputy Gilmore is suggesting is that no matter what precautions somebody takes, he should be prosecuted.  I support Deputy Gilmore on the point that local authorities have not been prosecuting when they should have been. That has nothing to do with the defence provision.  Many of the local authorities lack the resources to prosecute and in the past they have not always been encouraged to prosecute.  On occasion there can be a confusion of responsibility between the local authorities and the fisheries boards, each watching the other to see who should bring the prosecution.  One of the reasons we wanted the environment protection agency put in place was to ensure there would be a body to take an overview of what the local authorities were doing and to make sure that prosecutions would take place where justified. The Minister tells us of her commitment to the workability of this legislation.  We are all committed to that, but there is a need for somebody to take an overview.</P>
      <P>The Water Pollution Advisory Council existed until 1987, taking an overview, producing research reports, setting out what needed to be done, setting out where local authorities were not doing it and influencing the course of the development of new legislation.  It is very odd that a Minister who is intent on reforming the law to ensure that the polluter pays and that our water pollution legislation works is abolishing the Water Pollution Advisory Council in the legislation dealing with water pollution.  We are not allowed to debate the point until we reach section 30.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this legislation is enacted and the new defence provision is put in place there is a specific need to ensure that the manner in which the legislation is operating is closely monitored.  The <Col N="1115" /> Water Pollution Advisory Council were a body with unique expertise to carry out that monitoring.  It is regrettable that they are being abolished.  The Minister said to Deputy Gilmore that things happened pre-June in a different Government.  It was a different Government who were abolishing the Water Pollution Advisory Council because Fianna Fáil in Government disliked every independent environmental agency that existed and sought to abolish them.  This new Coalition, this temporary arrangement, are continuing to abolish the Water Pollution Advisory Council.  They voted against the establishment of an environment protection agency which could have provided a monitoring arrangement.  I know the Minister will tell me she intends to set up an environment protection agency but we will not see the Bill this month or next month.</P>

I do not know what powers that agency will have.</P>
      <P>I have reservations about what Deputy Gilmore is saying.  I would hate it to be misinterpreted outside this House, either by the media or by anybody else.  I do not want to see a headline tomorrow which states &ldquo;Workers' Party more concerned about environment&rdquo; or &ldquo;Workers' Party more committed to tackling problems of water pollution than any other party&rdquo;.

      <P>The Water Pollution Advisory Council were abolished by a different Government. That is a fact.  It is the case that if the environmental protection agency were not being established with an advisory council to advise on pollution generally and several other matters, it might be necessary to reconsider.  It is better to streamline our legislation and the number of agencies, bodies and advisory councils. We tend to be very good at setting up bodies and committees but servicing and funding them becomes difficult.  It is more appropriate to have one body attached to the environmental protection agency which will ensure that it is totally independent. I do not believe that was the case with the Water Pollution Advisory Council.  I accept that they had people of the highest competence and expertise but unless they are given freedom to act very often they cannot produce what they might otherwise be able to produce.  It was effectively a toothless body, although it did tremendous work.</P>

      <P>There were too many people on it &mdash; 36.  It was cumbersome and I do not think it functioned effectively. The environmental protection agency will be in place by next summer and will have an environmental advisory council dealing with general environmental matters, including water pollution. That is the appropriate way to have independent advice of that kind made available to the Government and the public at large.  For that reason I am quite happy to go along with this Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter's amendment cannot be moved because it involves expenditure. The Deputy gave no functions to his water pollution advisory council.  If he decides to move this amendment at a later stage he might consider that point. I am not quite clear what exactly they would do that will not be done by the advisory council attached to the environmental protection agency.  It is not correct for Deputy Shatter to say that the functions have changed substantially. That is not the case.</P>
      <P>I have consulted widely with environmental organisations and interested parties around the country.  I have in some cases changed my own view of how the agency should operate as a result of those consultations.  That is a good thing.  If more legislation was drafted on the basis of consultation with those who operate many of our laws in the area of the environment, we could incorporate many practical suggestions to make legislation more powerful and more efficient.  Whatever functions were carried out by the former advisory council and any functions that Deputy Shatter might wish to give the water pollution advisory council can be catered for in the context of the Environmental Protection Agency Bill which will be before the House this session.</P>

      <P>I will not test the generosity of the Chair by saying it now. In relation to the good defence provision, the Minister talked about what happened before the election and disclaimed any responsibility for it.  I cannot blame her for that, although I suspect that were I to ask her opinion on this issue before the election it is probable that she would be more in agreement with the position I am expressing now than she is with the position she has to articulate in the House on this issue.</P>
      <P>The Minister says the amendment strengthens the provisions in the 1977 Act and that she has met some farmers who believe that that is the case.  The IFA say that it does not strengthen the Act, that it improves the Act the way they want it improved.  I have enormous admiration for the way the IFA successfully lobby Governments.  If they did not see that a provision in the Bill as it was originally presented was going to tighten the law, they would not have made such an issue about it.  This was one of the big issues raised by the IFA because they saw the Bill as originally presented as tightening up the defence provision leading to more prosecutions.  They sought this amendment. The amendment the Minister has before us is precisely the amendment they agreed with the Government.  It is stretching credibility to believe that skilled IFA negotiators would have gone to Government seeking a weakening of the Bill as presented and would have come out as the Minister claims with it strengthened in the way she has strengthened it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says the Bill is strengthened. How can it be strengthened if it retains the same concept and phraseology of the 1977 Act which has proved to be unworkable &mdash; the concept of having taken reasonable care?  The Minister may argue that it is strengthened because it <Col N="1119" /> goes on to talk about &ldquo;providing, maintaining, using, operating and supervising facilities&rdquo;, and so on having regard to all the circumstances.  I welcome the fact that on Report Stage the Minister is prepared to consider the term &ldquo;having regard to all the circumstances&rdquo;, but she is greatly exaggerating the effect of the terms in which it is expressed here.</P>
    <P>We must look at this in context.  It is unfortunate that we are, if anything, dwelling overlong on the agricultural area because this Bill applies not only to agriculture but to other forms of economic activity as well.  The public purse, particularly the European purse, is spending large sums of money for pollution control measures on farms.  Are we to have a situation where it may be argued that someone could not have maintained, used, operated and supervised facilities because one had not yet got the grant to introduce the methods which would have controlled pollution?  Will we get arguments that facilities could not be used because a person had run into hard times and could not apply them?</P>
    <P>The problem with this kind of amendment &mdash; and experience is there to prove it &mdash; is that it is wide open to very loose interpretation.  Deputy Shatter says that the reason there have not been prosecutions taken by the local authority is that they do not have the resources to do so.  I would be one of the first to agree that the local authorities should have more resources to deal with this area, but I must confess that it is not the area in which local authorities are most strapped for resources.  The Minister when introducing the Bill told us that local authorities have 62 engineers, 70 technicians and 15 chemists employed primarily on water pollution.  It is not exactly an area devoid of resources in the local authority, although I accept that a lot more could be done in that area.  Those professional staff who have been trying to operate the 1977 Act will agree that it could not be worked, that they could not get prosecutions, that that clause was the principal reason they could not get <Col N="1120" /> prosecutions, and now the same concept has been reintroduced.</P>
    <P>The 1977 Act says that a person shall not cause or permit any polluting matter to enter waters.  If somebody causes polluting matter to enter waters they should not have the protection of a good defence clause in the legislation.  I would like the Minister to justify that.  We are talking now about people who caused the pollution.</P>

      <P>Yes, and my amendment deals with people who cannot prevent the pollution.  I accept that there are some circumstances, for instance an act of God, where circumstances get out of control. In those circumstances it is all right to have a good defence provision built into the legislation to protect people.  My amendment would retain that protection for the people who could not prevent pollution occurring.  My amendment would retain the amendment in the original Bill and passed by the Seanad but it would completely exclude the defence cover for those who had caused the pollution.</P>
      <P>I would like that point to be addressed by the Minister.  Can the Minister justify covering those who would cause water pollution by a good defence clause?  I concede that a person permitting pollution matter to enter the water might in some circumstances need a good defence clause, although my preferred situation would be that that provision would be deleted altogether, but where somebody causes pollution there is no justification for retaining the good defence clause which is now proposed by the Minister's amendment before us.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gilmore is very persuasive and I admire him for that but he should not suggest that this is coming before us because the IFA drafted it.  This is precisely the same terminology which is contained in the Air Pollution Act.  Is he suggesting that they drafted that too? Deputy Gilmore asked if I thought that <Col N="1121" /> somebody who causes pollution should get away with it.  If somebody deliberately causes pollution, of course they should not get away with it.  However, if there is an accident &mdash; let us forget about the farmers for a moment and get away from the paranoia about them &mdash; involving a vandal who breaks into a factory and releases a stopcock which causes a major pollution incident, does that mean that the industry in question, which had taken all the precautions and had appropriate measures in place, should be convicted of a pollution offence?  I do not think anyone could suggest that they should.</P>
      <P>We are seeking to ensure that if somebody has taken all practical steps by putting in place appropriate facilities on a farm, industry or whatever and uses, maintains, supervises and operates them and if a pollution accident or incident occurs because of an act of God or something outside the control of the individual, it would not be right or fair to prosecute that person.  I want to reiterate what I said because Deputy Gilmore misrepresented it.  I have spoken to senior members of the farming organisations and they have told me they are not happy with this amendment because it puts an onus on their members to install expensive facilities and to maintain them.</P>
      <P>I do not consider for one moment that the organisation which think it is a good amendment were fooled or that they were foolish or naive.  I am certainly saying that, as a result of this amendment, an onus will be put on many members of the farming community, whether they know it or not, to put in place proper facilities and to maintain and use them.  If they do not and if they come before the courts charged with pollution, there will be no defence in those circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Gilmore that it is not a strengthening of the 1977 Act; of course it is.  All that the 1977 Act says is &ldquo;it shall be a good defence to a prosecution under this section to prove, to the satisfaction of the court, that the person charged took all reasonable care to prevent the entry prohibited under <Col N="1122" /> subsection (1)&rdquo;.  It is possible at present for a farmer or an industrialist against whom a pollution offence is alleged to go to court and plead that they took all reasonable care.  At the moment it is not open to a court to interpret what &ldquo;reasonable care&rdquo; is.  If this amendment is accepted, the court will have to be sure that the person in question had appropriate facilities, used the facilities, maintained the facilities and operated the facilities and so on, that they did not just put in a slurry tank and store pig feed in it.  They must have used it for the appropriate purpose.  They will have to prove that and if they cannot do so to the satisfaction of the court, they will be prosecuted on a pollution offence.  That is substantially different from the provision in the 1977 Act, I have no doubt about that.</P>
    <P>Many of the people who could not operate the Act because of the restrictions at the moment believe it will substantially improve the situation.  They believe that the general body of farmers, industrialists and others against whom pollution offences could be alleged will now be forced, as a result of this amendment, to put in place appropriate facilities if they are in danger or at risk of causing pollution offences.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment is balanced, fair and reasonable.  It is proposed so that we can get at those who cause pollution but it will not affect those who, through no fault of theirs but as a result of an accident, cause pollution.  That is fair and reasonable in the circumstances and I do not think anybody could argue against it.  It seems extraordinary that Deputy Gilmore would take such a narrow view of what we are proposing.</P>
    <P>With respect, I suggest he is unfair in saying that it is no different from the 1977 Act.  He must know that by putting an onus on persons to put in place facilities and so on and to use them substantially strengthens the legislation.  Without it, the legislation would be ineffective and toothless.  Many of the defects of the 1977 Act, in particular the good defence one, would continue.  For that reason and in those circumstances I ask the House to <Col N="1123" /> accept the proposed amendment subject to the proviso that I will again take advice in relation to the phrase which initially caused Deputy Gilmore concern.</P>
    <P>However, when I showed that I was open to considering it or looking at it to see if it would lead to the difficulties he mentioned, he seemed to say that we should not get it out of proportion because it was not significant.  He cannot have it both ways.  I do not know what the Deputy is trying to do, I suspect he is being a little mischievous and imputing motives which are not there.  I invite him to show me the letter privately to which he referred.  After Second Stage I made inquiries but they were in vain.  Perhaps he will bring whatever correspondence he has to my attention.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Gilmore's amendment which basically brings the Bill back to where it was before the vested interests, the farming lobby and industry, got hold of the Minister.  It is the old story: whoever pays the piper calls the tune.  The Minister said that the wording was the same as that in the Air Pollution Act.

      <P>The Minister said it would be very hard luck on a factory if someone broke in at night and opened a stopcock.  That indicates the Minister's shallow thinking.  If a factory has deleterious and highly dangerous materials <Col N="1124" /> this is the very thing against which they should be on their guard.  They need adequate security to ensure that people do not break into the factory and release stopcocks so that deleterious material is not released into rivers.  The Bill is meant to provide for these very things.  Deputy Gilmore's amendment is an excellent one and I support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>We have almost exhausted everything that can be said about this. I will supply the Minister with a copy of the letter from the IFA to their members. I will also supply the Minister with a copy of the document to which I referred which was circulated by the Minister for the Environment.  The Minister was incorrect when she stated that I laid heavy emphasis on the phrase, &ldquo;having regard to all the circumstances&rdquo; and then did not lay emphasis on it when she showed a willingness to reconsider the phrase.  In fact, I welcomed her willingness to reconsider the phrase but that was not my only comment about the section. My principal comment about the section was that it retained the concept that a person took all reasonable care which is precisely the same concept that is in the 1977 Act and which was found to be unworkable.</P>
      <P>I am proposing that we should retain the same terminology used in the Bill originally circulated by the Government with one exception, that the defence provision would not apply to those who cause pollution.  The position I have adopted on this is very reasonable.  In the course of the debate it has not been shown to me how one can justify covering uniquely in the Bill those who cause pollution.  I have said all I wish to say about the circumstances where things get out of control and a person is prosecuted for an offence not of his or her making.  That point is conceded in my amendment.  I did not invent the fact that the amendment was agreed following negotiations with a strong interest group.  That is a historical fact.  The amendment significantly weakness the Bill and, if anything, will leave it worse than the position in the 1977 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1125" /> When we are talking about the use of facilities and so on one of the problems we must face, to forget about agriculture for the moment, is that very often on the industrial scene the facilities being used by factories and so on are not appropriate. Presumably, factory owners could argue under this provision that even though they were using the facilities available to them they could not prevent the pollution occurring.  It is unfortunate that the Minister raised the case of a factory being vandalised and the intruder releasing a substance which would get into water courses.  I would expect that any industrialist would ensure that if he or she has substances on the premises which are likely to cause pollution the necessary measures to have security on their premises to prevent such pollution would be taken.  After all, we are talking about matter which caused enormous damage to waters, to fish life and so on. There is a fundamental difference between the position adopted by the Minister and my position.  It is my intention to press my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is a fundamental difference between us but Deputy Gilmore wishes to create the impression that such a difference exists. I do not understand the Deputy's logic. He has said that the good defence provision should not apply to a person who causes pollution but should apply to the person who permits pollution to occur.  I am not able to distinguish the difference. The Deputy was unfair when he referred to industry and so on.  He is aware that this does not apply to industry.  They are covered under the licensing provisions. When they are breached they can be convicted of causing pollution.  If they meet the terms of the licence that is a different matter and the good defence provision does not apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not true to say, as Deputy Garland seemed to think, that pollution can only be caused by dangerous, toxic or chemical matter.  Milk, for example, is 400 times more potent a pollutant than the same quantity of raw sewage.  If a housewife pours enough milk down her <Col N="1126" /> sink and it gets into a water course it will cause pollution.  If a person in a farmyard releases enough milk into a river he will pollute that river to such an extent that it will damage fish stock.  I agree that if dangerous substances are in place there should be security involved but it is important to realise that it is not just in relation to them that we have to be concerned.  Some of the products we consider natural and use in our everyday life, if misused or released into water courses, can cause pollution.  It is to deal with those matters that we are amending the Bill.</P>
    <P>It will not be enough for a person to argue that they took reasonable care. They will have to prove that by showing that they installed proper facilities and used them.  This is an extremely powerful weapon in the hands of local authorities, the fisheries boards and the courts.  The provision is not the same as that contained in the 1977 Act and it could not be said to be the same by any stretch of the imagination.  Under that Act a person can argue that he or she took reasonable care although they may not have installed proper facilities.  People have argued that case very successfully.  We want those who cause pollution, who do not take reasonable care, who do not instal proper facilities or use them, to be charged before the courts.  Equally, we want to ensure that if by accident or an Act of God &mdash; that is possible if we are to judge by recent storms and floods &mdash; pollution occurs, the person involved will not be convicted for such an offence.  It is not the intention of the Bill to convict such a person and I do not think it would be Deputy Gilmore's intention either.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said she was prepared to give some consideration to the phrase &ldquo;having regard to all the circumstances&rdquo;.

If the Minister is withdrawing the amendment with a view to re-introducing it on Report Stage we will all agree to leave the issue for debate then.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete lines 37 and 38 and in page 4, lines 1 to 25 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) the deletion of subsections (5) and (6), and the substitution of the following:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(5)  The Minister may, after consultation with any other Minister who, having regard to his functions, he considers ought to be consulted, by regulations make exemptions from subsection (1), and attach conditions to and restrict such exemptions.</P>
      <P>(6)  Where it is proposed to make regulations under subsection (5), a draft of each such regulation shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, and the regulations shall not be made until a motion approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an amendment to the end of page 3 and the first half of page 4 of the Bill which amends the 1977 Act. One of the subsections being amended is the one which deals with exclusions concerning those who may not cause or permit any polluting matter to enter waters.  As mentioned earlier, subsection (1) makes provision for the general prohibition on the entry of polluting matter into waters. Subsection (5) lists the exemptions and includes a table listing the sections of legislation under which apparently someone would be allowed to permit polluting matter to enter waters.  First, there is a general principle involved here.  We are either going to prevent polluting matter entering into waters under this legislation or we are not.  It would be bad if we were to allow the making of a series of exemptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to look at the legislation <Col N="1130" /> which makes provision for exemptions. For example, any deposit authorised under section 3 or section 13 of the Foreshore Act, 1933 is exempt.  We are talking here about the issue of a foreshore licence to enable the infilling of certain areas to take place.  Under that section literally anything can be the subject of an exemption. There is nothing in the Foreshore Act, 1933 which prohibits a licensee from using polluting matter as infill material on foot of a foreshore licence.  It is open to him to do so under that legislation.  As I understand it, a foreshore licence has a life of 99 years.</P>
    <P>Section 48 of the Harbours Act, 1936 makes provision for the depositing of dredged material from the sea.  However, this is exempt under the 1977 Local Government (Water Pollution) Act.  In other words it is permissible to allow material of that kind to enter waters and it is not covered by the Water Pollution Act.</P>
    <P>Section 88 of the Harbours Act of 1946 which is exempted would allow for ashes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I managed to get one sentence in last night before the adjournment of this debate and that was to comment on the vulnerability of my own county in relation to storm damage.  I propose, in the ten minutes I have tonight, to try to put in clear and graphic form, for the information of the House and more particularly for the information of the Minister, the dreadful plight of County Wexford and the horrific damage done to that county since the December storm began and which continue right up to today.</P>
      <P>County Wexford has approximately 120 kilometres of sandy beach and coastal dune system.  That system forms a vital part of the county's tourism amenity and economy.  The dune system also provides protection against incursion by the sea to a vast area of agricultural land, bird sanctuaries and habitats for rare fauna. Wexford county is not like other counties. It is not protected by sheer rock or cliffs.  It is vulnerable sandy beaches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 16 December last Wexford county was battered by a horrendous storm and since that storm the coastline has been continuosly affected by high seas and additional storms coming day after day. The result has been massive with extensive damage to the coastal systems.  The <Col N="1132" /> following areas have been severely attacked and are currently extremely vulnerable: Courtown, Ardamine, Cahore, Ballycorrigar, Ballinesker, Curracloe, Rosslare, Carne, Ballyhealy, Ballyteigue, Cullenstown, Duncormick and Fethard.  All these areas are severely threatened and I want to put the scale of that damage in clear perspective now for the Minister.</P>
    <P>I will do that by taking but three or four examples.  The north beach at Courtown in north County Wexford is badly damaged.  Severe erosion has taken place on the dunes along the north Wexford coast, particularly the north beach at Courtown.  The rock armouring which the county council placed on the beach has been overtopped by the sea and five metres of width has been eroded.  The county council roadway to the car park at Courtown is now in imminent danger of being eroded and requires immediate attention.  The county engineer in Wexford has done a memo for the county council indicating that a programme of dune stabilisation involving fencing, planting and the prohibition of pedestrian traffic is required.  A major coastal protection scheme is now required in Courtown if it is not to be washed away and the initial requirement for this programme as estimated by the County Engineer, is £100,000 to stop further devastation on this one beach.  Courtown is one of the primary tourist attractions of north County Wexford and an integral and vital part of the Wexford economy.</P>
    <P>At the south of the country is Cullenstown Strand.  The mouth of the river at Cullenstown has been changed by the storm.  The beach itself is now under attack and the whole tourist infrastructure of the area which is dependent on the beach facilities there are threatened. Again the county engineer, in a memo to the county council, has indicated that a major civil engineering job is required to re-establish the river course there.  He says that it would be beyond the capacity of Wexford County Council to finance this major plan to divert the river mouth to its original location and to <Col N="1133" /> construct retaining walls and embankments. It is a huge undertaking well beyond the capacity of Wexford County Council.</P>
    <P>Massive erosion has taken place on Rosslare Strand since the major storm of 16 December.  The stretch from Kelly's Hotel northwards to Rosslare point has suffered severely.  On the 16 December half of the golf course in Rosslare was under water and waves were breaking over Kelly's Hotel, breaking over the playground which is well in from the sea. The narrow strip of sand which is Rosslare is a hugely important tourist anchor for the south County Wexford area.  It obviously is of huge economic interest to the county of Wexford and is one of the premier tourist resorts of the county.  More than that, it is a protection for Wexford town itself.  At a meeting of Wexford Corporation no later than this week the engineers were very concerned that Wexford town itself will be vulnerable to severe flooding if there is further erosion at Rosslare Strand.  In the last number of years there has been massive erosion there and what is required to deal with the problem is the implementation of the major capital plan which has been in the Department for many years. That will be a hugely expensive operation but it is needed now.</P>
    <P>I want to talk about Kilmore Quay.  It, too, was battered.  We saw the television pictures of the damage on 16 December. The sea wall and pier is being repaired now by Wexford County Council.  The patching job which is as much as Wexford County Council can do will cost £90,000 but again a major capitol scheme is with the Department and the cost of that is £2 million.  Vessels were wrecked.  Many were completely destroyed, others rendered useless for fishing and in need of urgent repair.  Dozens of fishermen are without a livelihood and those Kilmore Quay families are left with no income, for over two months in many cases, and no help or assistance from the Government. The miserable amount of money, £50,000 of grants and £50,000 in loans, given through BIM for boat replacement was a token response to the tragedy faced <Col N="1134" /> by these families in Kilmore Quay who literally now have no money are exhausting their savings to try to survive.  The scale of the disaster for the community in Kilmore Quay, a community based on fishing cannot be overstated by me here. The general cost of the damage in Wexford in terms of only beginnings to patch up the damage was originally estimated at £229,000.  That figure has been updated to over £0.5 million, and that does not take account of the capital schemes required for Rosslare, for Kilmore Quay and for Ballyteigue which will cost many millions more.</P>
    <P>Ballyteigue is a very vulnerable area at the south of the county.  The sand dunes have been breached in several places and several thousand acres of low lying farm land, including farm houses, are in imminent danger of flooding unless a capital scheme is put in to protect them.</P>
    <P>I have not mentioned Ardamine and Cahore, all severely damaged and in need of work amounting to tens of thousands of pounds.  The Government have responded in a token way for boats for Kilmore Quay but nothing else.  Wexford County Council have to date expended £60,000 of money we do not have; we have grabbed from every budget to keep things together but we are totally overcome now with the scale of the disaster facing us.  The Government must recognise the damage that has been done and provide adequate coastal protection for this most vulnerable county in terms of infrastructure.  We need that help immediately.</P>
    <P>The extent of the damage that has been caused cannot be overstated.  It is increasing daily and we have yet to experience the spring tides which are due next month.  The defences of Wexford are down and if we have storms coinciding with the spring tides next month, God help us, because the damage will be well beyond even the scope of us as a country to deal with so that we will be going begging our European partners for assistance. I urge the Minister to look at the disastrous situation that faces the people of County Wexford.</P>

      <P>We recognise that there has been widespread flooding and considerable disruption of agriculture, fishing, transport, schooling and tourism related activities and considerable damage has resulted from the floods and storms.  The Government are aware of the difficulty and are informing themselves fully of the impact and the extent of the recent storms and flooding.  The utterances from Members of the Opposition would lead one to believe the Government had been in some way negligent in their response to weather induced difficulties.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  To illustrate this let me take you back to the severe weather of August 1986.  It is well to get these things in perspective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>In August 1986 following severe flooding in southern and eastern areas of the country in the wake of Hurricane Charlie, the Government, following receipt of the reports and estimates of damage to public roads and bridges, provided road grants totalling £6.449 million which were notified in October 1986.  In making these allocations account was taken of flood damage which had occurred earlier in 1986 and in other areas of the country, and the road funding involved had to be met within the provisions already available to the Department and no special additional Exchequer funds were provided in 1986. In October 1987 Donegal County Council were given some leeway in the use of county road strengthening grants to help them finance remedial works arising from floods during the month.  The next bad bout of weather occurred during the <Col N="1136" /> latter part of 1988.  Again the Government reacted positively to the urgency of the situation and £1.5 million was allocated in 1989 for remedial works to public roads and bridges in the counties affected.</P>
      <P>Let me remind the House &mdash; because it appears from remarks made last evening that reminding is necessary &mdash; that, following damage caused by the storms over the October bank holiday weekend when areas of the north-west experienced extremely heavy rainfall and by the storms which hit the east and south coasts on 16 and 17 December, I notified local authorities throughout the country of road grants totalling £1 million by way of assistance towards the cost of remedial works to public roads and bridges.  This record since 1987, I submit, is the record of a Government who are aware of the problems and are prepared to respond positively and with a sense of urgency to crises.</P>
      <P>I will not belabour the fact of the establishment of the special Cabinet sub-committee except to say that, in so far as my area of responsibility is concerned, I requested all authorities on 12 February this year to submit detailed reports of the damage to roads and bridges and estimates of costs of remedial works to same.  All the reports have been received since last Friday, and, concluding only this week, officials from the Department conducted preliminary on-site assessments of the reported damage.  At the same time my colleagues, the Minister for the Marine and the Minister for Agriculture and Food, were having similar assessments carried out.  The net effect of all this activity was that last Friday the Cabinet sub-committee, within days of being established met to consider the preliminary assessment reports of the overall damage.  These reports are now being finalised and I anticipate the final report will be ready for submission to the Government within the next week or so. This level of activity in so short a time hardly reflects an uncaring attitude as was suggested here last evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ferris quoted me correctly last night, and for the record I repeat there <Col N="1137" /> are limits to the area of my responsibility and to the funds at my disposal to give assistance.  For example, there are no funds available to me to compensate for any damage to private properties caused by the adverse weather.  Householders would normally be expected to have their property and the contents insured against losses by flooding.  In necessitous cases it is open to the health boards to provide assistance to elderly householders under the task force on special housing aid for the elderly, and money has been paid through that agency on previous occasions.  It is a long established practice that the Exchequer cannot meet the losses incurred by businesses as a result of their being uninsured.  That, let me add, is not a personal view, or, indeed, the view of the Government.  It is the policy which has existed throughout the history of the State and it has never been broken.  Indeed, in August 1986, as I have said, in their response to Hurricane Charlie the then Fine Gael-Labour Coalition endorsed that policy.</P>
    <P>Turning again to public roads and bridges, it is important to note that the significantly increased discretionary grants for regional and county roads which have been notified to local authorities in 1990 may be used in appropriate cases to undertake remedial works arising from the bad weather.  The grants to county councils under this heading amount to over £63 million in 1990 as compared to £47.4 million under the equivalent heading in 1989 and £33.4 million in 1987.  There has been a big increase in the amount of money I have been allocating by way of discretionary grants and again I am advising the local authorities that they can use that money to deal with the roads problem.  Some Members may say that local authorities have already agreed their road programmes for 1990 but, as the title implies, discretionary grants are precisely that and may be used at the discretion of the local authority, and that means at the request of the members of the local authority.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the EC disaster fund and I would like to take the <Col N="1138" /> opportunity once and for all to nail this hardy annual to the mast.  Let me tell what the fund does not do.  The fund does not cover damage to public structures; it does not compensate for agricultural damage and it is not for infrastructural projects or remedial schemes.  The principal objective of the fund is to provide urgent aid to Community residents who are the victims of natural catastrophes that are recognised as being of exceptional scale and gravity.  The fund is largely symbolic in that it represents a testimony to the solidarity of the other peoples of the Community to those members who find themselves in profound material and moral distress.  The budgetary resources of the fund are tiny, amounting to 1990 to some 4 million ECUs, approximately IR£3.1 million. People should recognise that and know that that is the situation of the EC disaster fund.</P>
    <P>In deciding to intervene in any case the factors that are taken into account by the EC Commission are the extent of loss of life, the numbers made homeless and the degree of hardship suffered by those affected.  The fund does not purport to offer strict compensation for the damage suffered by the victims.  We may not like that, but the situation is as I have outlined. That is what is available and that is the understanding of the Commission so far as the EC disaster fund is concerned.</P>
    <P>I understand it is proposed to allocate the following amounts from this year's EC budget for damage sustained up to mid-February.  Take a look at the kind of money we are talking about.  The UK is to get 900,000 ECUs, the Netherlands 500,000 ECUs, France 400,000 ECUs, Belgium 300,000 ECUs, Germany 300,000 ECUs and Denmark 200,000 ECUs.  I understand further that the EC has already notified the Irish Red Cross Society of the Irish allocation and the society will be in contact with the local authorities and health boards regarding disbursement of the money, and these moneys are disbursed through the Red Cross.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that the local authorities were somewhat remiss in their response to the recent bout of storms, and certainly whoever framed the terms of the Opposition motion and amendment gave that clear impression, I wish on behalf of the Government to record my deep appreciation of the local authorities and the emergency services for their marvellous response to the problems which the bad weather presented. Throughout the past few months they have been doing an admirable job.  The Garda, the Defence Forces, the Fire Brigade, the Civil Defence and all local authority employees and those involved in the emergency services deserve our thanks.  It was ungracious of certain individuals last evening not to record that.  I record our appreciation on behalf of everybody in the House this evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking in this debate.  The comments by the weather men on RTE television and radio that the weather was in a state of chaos sums up the situation for us and the difficulties for this Government. I know that in the west and midlands where we have had very heavy rainfall and storm damage over the past couple of months the people are disheartened by the weather forecasts and the nationwide alert that was issued for today.  We had snow in the west today and we expect to have gale-force winds. It is a very serious situation, one that is facing many of us, and there is on-going speculation as to the extent of the losses. I am very glad to hear the Minister say that reports are being put together on the actual losses by Teagasc and the farm development services.  I hope that when these surveys are being considered by the Government and particularly by the Cabinet sub-committee we will have action shortly.  The IFA today spoke about losses of £10 million.  The insurance industry do not know the extent of claims to date but up to December 1989 they <Col N="1141" /> paid out claims in the order of £2.5 million.</P>
      <P>I know from the many smallholders who came to me that they were not able to get insurance for farm buildings, haysheds and out-offices whereas they could get comprehensive insurance for their house and garage.  It was very difficult for them to get insurance cover, other than insurance against fire and lightning, on farm buildings and this is one of the areas I would like to see the Government investigate. I believe a small number of people had buildings damaged which were not insured because they could not get insurance cover for storm damage from 11 of the major companies in this country.  Much of the damage and a great deal of the losses in the west and midlands has been along the river basins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was present at a meeting of the River Shannon forum on 16 February with a number of my colleagues from the west and midland constituencies.  I was very impressed by the recommendations made to us on that date.  In fact, my colleague and friend, the Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, who represents that area gave me a great deal of detailed information about the acute flooding in Athlone, which has always been one of the flash points when there is flooding of the River Shannon.  In particular, she was concerned about areas such as Clonbunny, Carrick O'Brien and Golden Island and I understand that a deputation of Westmeath county councillors recently met with the Minister for the Environment which had been arranged by the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke.  They pointed out the needs of their area which, I understand, in the short-term would mean that work would be carried out on the access roads and that flooring for farmsheds would be provided.  In the medium to long term, they would like to see the recommendations of the Shannon forum urgently considered by the Government.  I know the Minister for Education is very concerned about the matter and has reported these details to the Cabinet sub-committee.  The Shannon forum has been one of the great successes in bringing together all people <Col N="1142" /> in the region who have an interest in the River Shannon and discussing what they can do to help the whole development of the River Shannon.</P>
    <P>I know that Delap Waller presented a report and that a survey was carried out by IFA.  It is quite clear that to deepen, widen and build up the banks of the River Shannon, especially in the area I know, between Meelick and Athlone, would be very expensive and of doubtful benefit to people in the area, but in the short-term I think the River Shannon channel should be cleaned and the silt removed.  I hope the Minister will be in a position to provide extra funding to local authorities to raise the road levels in the areas affected by the flooding.  This year the Minister made money available under the local improvements scheme &mdash; I thank him for that &mdash; which allowed the local authorities, more flexibility.  Thanks to the Minister, we can spend this money on roads that were previously repaired under the local improvements scheme which is most important in the Shannon area where the river has risen over the roads.  I hope this policy will be continued.</P>
    <P>I also believe that the areas should be designated as environmentally sensitive and that the landowners should be compensated with annual payments per hectare. Now that the Shannon forum have been established, I hope we can move on to setting up a River Shannon Authority. I can tell the House &mdash; if Deputy Connaughton, my constituency colleague, was here he would also be able to tell the House &mdash; that there are very serious incidents of flooding in north Galway.  I visited Gardenfield near Tuam, Deputy Connaughton was also there, and we saw the results when water could not get into the River Clare near Tuam.  In fact, 22 families were affected by very serious flooding.  The water that should have been flowing into the River Clare was going into one farmer's yard.  He had actually to feed the cattle from the back of a tractor and trailer because of the serious flooding.  I believe the Office of Public Works can do a great deal of work <Col N="1143" /> in that area.  I understand that the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, has already sent his officials down to Gardenfield and I hope they will be able to divert the serious flooding from Gardenfield across the Curraghan road into the River Clare where the water should be going in the first place.  Now that Deputy Connaughton has arrived he will be able to verify the very serious situation in the Gardenfield area.</P>

The catchment areas of all the rivers, I have already mentioned the Shannon, the Dunkellin river, the Suck, the Shiveen and the Nanny, have been affected and obviously the livelihood of farmers have also been affected.  On tonight's news I saw that an area in south Galway, known particularly as very good sheep country, suffered very serious flooding.  I hope the Government will look at all the river catchment areas because the livelihoods of farmers have been affected.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I believe that every EC mechanism should be used to get whatever aid we can get, particularly for the flood damage.  I believe there should be a directive on the question of assistance where these disasters occur, as they have in a number of areas throughout the country.</P>

      <P>Everybody is agreed that the past ten to 12 weeks have been some of the roughest this country has <Col N="1144" /> experienced in living memory.  It is vitally important that the Government approach the problem in a sensitive and sensible way.  The setting up of a working committee of Government Departments with responsibility in areas which are primarily affected is a sensible move.  It is necessary to gather and collate information so that we can proceed in a coordinated manner.  We must not have one Department fighting against another Department in defence of their own partticular interests.  A joint effort is necessary to get the solution to the many problems.</P>
      <P>It is important to remember that there is no point in expecting an instant, long term solution while we are in the middle of a crisis.  The Meteorological Office announced today that rainfall in the month of February was the highest on record and February is also recorded as the wildest month on record.  These factors have to be kept in mind when considering the problems facing the Government.</P>
      <P>The problem of coast erosion did not arrive overnight; it has been with us for many years.  I remember people in east Cork speaking about having the areas of Garryvore, Ballycotton and Ballycrennan protected from coastal erosion. A debt of £12 billion was run up between 1982 and 1987.  If the money had been used for productive purposes we would not now be facing some of these problems.</P>

      <P>In east Cork there has been great damage caused since 16-17 December.  It has hit areas such as Youghal, Claycastle, Ballycrennan, Garryvore and Ballycotton.  Ballycotton is vitally important for fishing and it is also the base of the lifeboat for that part of the country.  The pier and breakwater in the harbour are in quite a dangerous condition and the county council have underlined this by putting Ballycotton on the priority list for repairs.  I am sure that when the conclusions of the ministerial <Col N="1145" /> report have been reached, the finance necessary to repair the harbour and pier in Ballycotton will be forthcoming.</P>
      <P>Other areas, such as Mallow and the Blackwater Valley, have been subject to flooding over the years and this area must be considered in any long-term plan for the prevention of flooding.  Mallow and Fermoy are subject to unnecessary flooding year after year.</P>
      <P>We are all aware of the shortage of funds within the country and also from the Community.  I congratulate Mr. Gene Fitzgerald, MEP, who on the 22 February had an amendment added to the Commission initiative to provide funds for the clean up of beaches in Objective I countries, which would include Ireland. At the meeting of the Regional Affairs Committee he had an amendment added to include coastal erosion.  This will have to go before the European Parliament but if passed it will be helpful in regard to the funding of coastal erosion protection projects.</P>
      <P>I congratulate and thank the workers in the ESB, firemen and other who have done such tremendous work during this horrific weather.  If everybody will pull together rather than being negative, I am sure we will find a solution to the problems facing us.</P>

      <P>A Government fund is also to be set up.  I have heard much about coastal damage and coastal erosion.  I wish the Minister would come inland, to counties like Cavan and Monaghan, which have suffered drastically but are not even mentioned.  Farm buildings have been ripped asunder, fodder has been lost, the River Erne has broken its banks and thousands of acres are flooded.  There have been severe sheep losses.  The Minister might convey that information to the Minister of State, Deputy Kirk, in the absence of the Minister for Agriculture. Lambs are dying on a large scale.  I wonder if the Government are aware of this and of the serious havoc that is being caused.  Many cattle and sheep are still wintering outdoors.  Immediate aid is necessary to bring people through this crisis.  We faced the problem in 1986-87 when we made immediate funds available through the doubling of headage payments. It is quite a simple exercise which is acceptable in Brussels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1147" /> The extension of the severely handicapped areas should also include the whole of counties Cavan and Monaghan. Damage to private houses is causing more hardship than the loss of livestock. Households have been devastated.  I could give the Minister a list of names and addresses of people, whose roofs and slates have been ripped off, in local authority areas in Cavan town and the local authority do not have the finance to make the necessary repairs to prevent further damage being caused.  Will the Minister give an immediate cash injection to the local authorities to start the repairs and give a further commitment to complete the repairs later?  An immediate cash injection of not less than £5 million is needed for Cavan to get us off our knees.</P>
    <P>Because of the condition of the roads, with foundations being exposed over the years, many roads have been washed away by the floods and some houses are totally isolated.  The roads must be rebuilt at enormous cost so that people can travel to and from those houses.</P>
    <P>An inspector who visited the county three weeks ago said that he had not witnessed conditions like those in Cavan anywhere else in the country.  That report is outdated, although it will give the Minister an idea of the problem.  The damage has been trebled since that report was written.  We must face that problem in Cavan.  Unless we are prepared to make the finance available to remedy the problems things will only get worse.  I want the Minister to take on board the serious problems I have outlined.</P>

The county council are not in a position to address the problem caused by the flooding. Estimates in both local authorities were reluctantly passed during the autumn and it is not possible for either of them to provide a public light or to fill a pothole.  How can the Minister expect the county councils to spend £1.5 million <Col N="1148" /> to address the devastation caused by the flooding?</P>
      <P>In relation to farmers, the record of the House will show the attitude of the Government, as expressed last night by the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, who said that there was not a crisis.  That was a disgrace coming from somebody who is supposed to be an expert in the Government.  Farmers throughout Laois and Offaly have farm buildings down; they have lost winter barley, have had grass under water for weeks and fodder has been destroyed. These farmers are facing a poor and a bleak spring.  These problems are coupled with the tardiness of the Government in the extension and reclassification of disadvantaged areas.  This also has severe consequences for the people I represent. The Minister present tonight should take up with his Cabinet colleagues the disgraceful delays in the payment of grants through the Department of Agriculture. The farmers need this money.</P>

      <P>In relation to urban areas, private housing and local authority housing estates in Portlaoise and Tullamore, and in other parts of my constituency, were severely affected by flooding on the morning of 7 February. The Minister is right when he says there is no responsibility to cover the private belongings of people but I would ask the Minister to consider that if he can give £1 million towards a swimming pool in Sligo surely he can give a small sum to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to help families who are badly stuck because of flood damage.  The Minister for Social Welfare gave a Christmas present to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and there is no reason why, in the teeth of an emergency, a similar sum cannot be made available to them to help flood victims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1149" /> In relation to drainage, it is embarrassing for any politician to speak in this House about the draining of the Shannon, having regard to the notorious promises made in regard to this problem. There is no more notorious promise made at every election since the foundation of the State.  Reference was made by a previous speaker to the Shannon forum. The submissions of the Shannon forum were ignored by this Government and their predecessors.  Maybe now, because we have an unprecedented crisis in the Shannon Valley, the proposals of the Shannon forum will be taken into consideration. I call on the Government to make representations to the European Commission to have the entire Shannon basin area declared a super-severely handicapped area in order to address the problem of the small holders in west County Offaly particularly.</P>
    <P>Laois County Council have submitted a claim to the Department of the Environment to the tune of £1.8 million.  If the Minister cannot provide this money the council will not be able to repair the roads and bridges, put in the enlarged pipes necessary, open the culverts and generally do the necessary remedial work to prevent the recurrence of such a catastrophe. EC aid has been bungled.  This was admitted by representatives of the Minister's party when they acknowledged that the party sum available to use is not sufficient when one looks at the storm fund available to other countries in the Community, as mentioned by the Minister here this evening.</P>

      <P>I do not need to give details of the flooding in Carlow town, as it was well publicised.  People saw boats going up and down the streets.  While we might like to be described as one of the very important European cities, we do not want to be the Venice of Ireland with boats going up and down because of flooding.  I would ask the Minister to listen to the claim being made by the engineering staff in relation to drainage of the Barrow and the prevention of flooding there by the building up of walls and so on.  A submission to prevent flooding will be sent to the Minister and to the Board of Works.  We can forget the past if we are able, but we must do something about the future.  I appeal to the Minister, to listen to the submissions made by the county engineer in relation to what must be done in the future.</P>
      <P>In relation to the ESB, having found £18 million to remedy the VAT that nobody is going to pay, they should rise to the occasion and make allowances to people who want to dry out their houses and business premises.  Electricity is being over-produced at night time and it would not be very costly for the ESB to provide that electricty free for these people.  It would be a very generous thing for them to do.  Carlow County Council have already spent £55,000 dealing with the emergency.  As the Minister knows, they have not that kind of money.  I sincerely hope the Minister will listen to what I have said.  As so many people want to contribute, that is all I am asking at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to delay the House either.  I just want to add my voice in protest at the lip service and prevarication on the Government side in relation to this problem.  This is the third occasion, since Fianna Fáil were returned to power in 1987, that we have been complaining about the problems which resulted from storm damage.  The Minister and his Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, promised us the sun, moon and stars.  They said they would give us money <Col N="1151" /> but they did not.  The Government do not recognise that this is an island state; we had major storms and flooding in 1987, 1988, 1989 and now in 1990 but we still do not have a disaster fund.</P>
      <P>The same applies to the Government's attitude on poverty.  The biggest cut which this all embracing, successful Government made was in overseas development to help the poor hungry people in Africa.  When we see what they did to that small fund I shudder to think what they will do in regard to this problem. What disappoints me most of all is that the Minister for the Environment is from the west and he knows that the Atlantic is beating hard on the shores.</P>

      <P>The Minister knows that precautions must be taken by Mayo County Council but that they do not have the funds to do so.  I do not know if they have more than we have in Clare because we certainly do not have funds available to undertake repairs.</P>
      <P>All one side of Lahinch golf course will be taken away which will affect the tourism promotion which the Minister and his Government have been shouting about.  I ask the Minister to bang the heads of his colleagues together as he used to advise us to do when he was in Opposition.  I am referring to Minister Reynolds, Minister Brennan, Minister of State Kirk and others so that we will get all the funds that are available from the Community to assist us.  The Government could then match these funds.  I admit that the Minister was not overlordly tonight.  He has been humbled a little by this disaster.</P>

      <P>The extent of the flooding in South Tipperary, particularly in Ardfinnan, Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir, have already been outlined by me. Now that the flooding has subsided the destruction and havoc are evident.</P>
      <P>The only solution to the flooding in South Tipperary is the drainage of the River Suir.  While this may be a very expensive project it has been on the political agenda for many years, indeed I suppose since before I was born.  I now plead with the Minister to put it at the top of his agenda and if he cannot proceed with the total project I ask him &mdash; although this is not desirable &mdash; to examine the possibility of having the drainage of the Suir carried out in sections so that areas in my constituency and others would not be flooded because of this enormous problem.</P>
      <P>In South Tipperary we can give no assurance to anyone who has suffered in the past that the flooding will not continue in future.  Such flooding will be unavoidable unless the drainage is carried out.  I ask the Minister to examine the possibility of providing this.</P>

      <P>The coastline of southwest Cork has been severely affected by the recurring storms since mid-December. I want to outline the serious damage that has occurred in the area.  Roads at Tragumna and in the Skibbereen area have been completely swept away.  Piers at Union Hall, Ring, Castlestownsend, Bear Island and Crookhaven have been <Col N="1153" /> seriously undermined by the storms.  Protection walls at Tragumna, Union Hall, Owenahincha, Garrettstown, Crookhaven, Bantry and several other areas along the south-western seaboard have been seriously damaged, indeed in some cases they have been swept away.</P>
      <P>Coastal erosion is a major problem from Kinsale to the Dursey Sound.  The problem is of such magnitude that it deserves a major injection of funds from the EC and our Government, not the miserable allocation of £120,000 to County Cork.  This is the amount the Minister announced the other day, through his Minister for Food, in southwest Cork.</P>

      <P>There is no need to set up a committee at Government level to ascertain and evaluate the damage throughout the country as a report has already been laid on the Minister's desk. I know that the Minister is aware of what damage has been caused.  All county engineers are concerned about the flood and storm damage, they have laid their complaints before the Minister and told him the amount of money they need. Action is what is needed, not a task force and pious platitudes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Cork the storm damage has been estimated to exceed over £5 million.  How can we expect to get this money when the Minister does not have the will to fight for it in Europe?  If the Minister fails to get the funds from Europe he should give <Col N="1154" /> back the £8.25 million which he hijacked from Cork County Council through the Whiddy package over two years ago to pay for the refurbishment and paving of Grafton Street.</P>

For years we have been holding back the storms from the Atlantic Ocean from the rest of the country.

Unless immediate action is undertaken we will have another island off the coast of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sum of £750,000 is needed to protect the Maharees and I appeal to the Minister and the Government to allocate this money immediately. There are also major problems at Waterville and Ballinskelligs and two holes at Ballybunion golf club are under threat.  This is one of the best courses in the country and is recognised as the tenth best in the world.  Many parts of the coastal area of this course are under threat following the recent storms. Many families are threatened at Carrigisland in Ballylongford and a nearby beach is also threatened with being wiped away.  There is a need for action along the Kerry coastline.  We should prepare a national plan to deal with our coastline which is a natural asset and amenity.  It serves all our scenic areas and includes many attractive beaches.  We should <Col N="1155" /> carry out a survey of our coastline, identify the weak areas and earmark them for emergency funding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Chair I propose to share some of my time with Deputy Kemmy.  I should like to thank Deputy Taylor-Quinn for accepting our amendment which calls on the Government to take all necessary steps to ensure that local authorities have the resources available and preparations made to deal effectively with future climatic emergencies.  At a meeting of Cork County Council on Monday it was stated by the county manager that an allocation of £400,000 had been received from the Department up to January 1990. However, he told us that up to one week previously his officials had estimated that it would cost in the region of £4 million to repair the damage caused.  That did not take into account the fishery harbour development programmes for south Cork, west Cork or the small fishery harbours. The Minister should bear in mind that the figure needed for Cork is £4 million.</P>
      <P>It is a pity I did not have an opportunity to tell the Minister before he left the Chamber that the disastrous system he introduced in 1988 of giving what was described as voluntary redundancies, or forcing workers of local authorities to accept redundancy, was the cause of the problems we are facing.  There are no local authority employees to keep the water drains clear and flooding has resulted.  In north Cork two lives were lost by falling trees.  If people were working on the roads they would have been able to identify the dangerous trees and have them removed.  What were described as voluntary redundancies were not voluntary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Redundancy payments were made to officials and the general staff of the council and the Minister introduced an embargo on the recruitment of replacements. The council cannot make redundancy payments and a number of years later seek permission to recruit staff.  The Minister should lift the embargo on <Col N="1156" /> recruitment to Cork County Council.  I am referring to engineering, general and administrative staff.</P>
    <P>In Mallow we experienced severe flooding in the Spa area in December 1988.  To date we have not been made aware of the results of trial borings for the purpose of diverting a small stream in that area.  The houses in the Spa area were flooded in the recent storms.  We have not got very far since 1988 despite the fact that on that occasion the Minister inspected the area from a helicopter.  This is the time for us to make an appraisal of whether the horses and the dogs should be given priority over the condition of peoples' homes.  There is a need to update many of our old Acts.  The Act which refers to the power of local authorities to deal with overhanging and dangerous trees is as old as the hills.  A council should have the power to enter lands if they need to do so.  We must do something about the land that is being drained on to the public road and is causing serious flooding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity that the Chair does not have the power to work a miracle like that of the loaves and fishes in relation to time for the debate.  It would be a help to us and give us more time to debate the subject.  It is a pity that we do not have any person in the country with the ability to change water into wine.  If we had, the country might be on the road to recovery.  The Government must respond to the crisis and to the suffering of our people.  That is what they were elected to do, nothing more and nothing less.  In Limerick city the River Shannon has broken its banks in three places and flooded part of the city and the lands surrounding it.  Houses in the inner city have been flooded.  The river has broken its banks and flooded houses in the area around the Sand Mall, Sir Harry's Mall and Athlunkard Street.  The families who have suffered from the flooding have applied for aid and compensation to Limerick Corporation to help them out of their distress but there is no money available. The Government must come to the aid of those people and compensate them <Col N="1157" /> for the trouble, inconvenience and loss they have suffered.  I do not believe in throwing money away and each application should be judged on its merits. Applications should be referred to a local tribunal with the power to award compensation.</P>
      <P>We are paying out a lot of the lottery money to projects which are not essential. Indeed, some of them are frivolous projects.  There is no reason why those who have suffered from flood and storm damage should not be compensated.  The Minister, instead of sending local representatives and council engineers to conferences that are not esseential, should send them to Holland to learn how they have coped with coastal erosion.  I visited Holland 26 years ago and I saw dykes, boulders and dams being constructed. If the Dutch can contain the sea there is no reason why we cannot contain some of our rivers.  Many parts of Holland are below sea level but are in constant use.  There is no reason why our engineers cannot learn from the experience of the Dutch.  I believe in learning from people who know about these problems.  If we do not do so we will not eliminate our problems.  The Dutch have won back land from the sea.  The Minister should send our engineers to Holland to learn how they can contain our rivers and waterways.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I should like to welcome the fact that the Government have set up a Cabinet group to deal with the problems caused by the recent storms.  I welcome the positive statement by the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Wilson, last night that a full report will be available to the Cabinet next week. That is essential because severe damage has been caused around our coastline. Money from the Government or the EC should be made available as soon as possible to resolve the problems that exist.  I come from a county that has 75 miles of coastline and over the years we have had to cope with major problems from coastal erosion.  There was little response from former Governments.  Deputation after deputation met different Ministers but we did not get much of a hearing.</P>
      <P>Due to the storms since 16 December problems along our coastline have reached crisis point.  The following areas have been severely attacked and are presently extremely vulnerable: Courtown, Ardamine, Cahore, Ballyconnigor, Ballinesker, Curracloe, Cullenstown, Carne, Rosslare, Ballyhealy and Ballyteigue. One could go on listing the areas right around the coast where serious problems exist.  There are problems with farm buildings, glass houses, mushroom tunnels etc.  I would like to deal with a few of the areas where major problems exist at present, particularly in the area of coast erosion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Courtown Harbour which is the hub of the economy of Gorey town and North County Wexford has been devastated by <Col N="1159" /> coast erosion.  Severe erosion has taken place on the dunes along the north beach at Courtown and the rock armoury which the county council have placed on the beach has been overrun by the sea.  The county council roadway to the car park at Courtown Wood is in imminent danger of being eroded and requires immediate attention.  Substantial rock armoury is required along this section of the coastline to protect the area because if Courtown Harbour goes it will have serious consequences for the business people and for the whole of North County Wexford. It is an area that has great tourist potential, it is adjacent to Dublin and to Dublin Airport and it is also very close to Rosslare Harbour.  It is essential that moneys be made available as quickly as possible to protect Courtown.</P>
    <P>Cullenstown Strand is another area which has great tourist potential.  It is a major tourist resort for south Wexford. Storms since the beginning of 1990 have caused extensive erosion at Cullenstown Strand.  The county council are not in a position to do very much about it because of lack of finance.  The extensive remedial work required would be beyond the financial capabilities of the county council at present.  In Ballyteigue, south Wexford, the farmers have major problems. The sand dunes there have been overtopped by the sea and as a result 7,000 acres of low lying agricultural land could be flooded permanently by the sea with major financial losses to the farmers of this area.  There are seven or eight miles of sand dunes in that region that need to be rebuilt and to be provided with rock armoury.  This particular area of coastline is the responsibility of the Office of Public Works.  The Minister should request the Office of Public Works immediately to protect Ballyteigue's valuable assets and particularly to protect substantial numbers of farmers who will be affected.</P>
    <P>Wexford County Council to date have done their best to counteract the problems. They have spent £20,000 in Courtown, £40,000 on Kilmore Quay and they are planning to spent £50,000 on Cahore to protect some of the resorts there.  In <Col N="1160" /> all, that is a total of £110,000 spent by Wexford County Council &mdash; which they can ill afford &mdash; and it will put a severe financial burden on the council over the next few years.  We need £100,000 in Wexford at present to do a mere holding job with rock armoury for Courtown, £30,000 to protect Ardamine where one of the houses was washed into the sea and a number of other houses are close to the cliff edge and ready to disappear. The Government should immediately make emergency allocations to the county council to enable them to protect Courtown and Ardamine, both of which are essential for tourism and for the whole economy of that area.</P>
    <P>Rosslare beach has been the bane of all politicians from Wexford and TDs over the last number of years.  We as an Oireachtas group have approached Deputy J. Mitchell when he was Minister, Deputy Dukes when he was Minister for Finance, Ministers in the last Government and Ministers in this Government seeking the implementation of a major scheme for Rosslare beach which will cost £6 million &mdash; a lot of money one might say but if that £6 million is not soon made available to implement the major scheme I am afraid Rosslare will no longer exist. It is essential that the provisions of the national plan be implemented for coast erosion and that we seek moneys from Europe in conjunction with our own national plan to safeguard the beaches and particularly the beaches of County Wexford, which are a major tourist attraction and very valuable to the whole country.</P>
    <P>The EC disaster fund has been referred to and to me it seems just that.  The amount in the fund is a token gesture. Now that we have the Presidency of the EC we should try to bring that fund into line for the nineties.  We have taken into account the problems which have arisen in Ireland, the UK and other EC countries because of storm damage over the past three years.  The Government should consider setting up a disaster fund where an allocation would be made each year from the budget.  In the good years when the money would not be used it could be <Col N="1161" /> allowed to accumulate and at times of crisis, such as we have at present, that money could be used in conjunction with European moneys to alleviate the problems that exist around the coastline and throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I welcome the interest of Deputy Dukes and Deputy Taylor-Quinn in Courtown Harbour and in the coast erosion problems of County Wexford because for the last number of years from 1982-87 the Government did not show any interest in coast erosion.  I welcome their new found interest and I hope when this debate is over we can see County Wexford getting its fair share of whatever money is on offer following the Cabinet meeting next week&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is my intention to use this five minutes to say as much as I can. It is physically impossible to do justice to a debate such as this in five minutes. However, something very serious has happened over the past few days and that is the statement made by the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Kirk, that he has travelled the length and breadth of the country and he stated that the claims made by the farming organisations are exaggerated.  I have travelled large sections of this country and I think they are not exaggerating.  I wish to contradict his statement and I would like to say further that the Minister seems to be completely out of touch with reality in respect of the damage caused by the floods and storms over the past six or seven weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to agriculture in the Shannon valley and, indeed, in other areas there are approximately 300,000 acres <Col N="1162" /> under water for the past two to three weeks.  The damage caused by this flooding is almost impossible to estimate. However, I think it is only right that we should try to put a figure on it at this stage.  The Minister has stated that the amount of money available to him from the European Fund &mdash; which we have heard a lot about &mdash; is of the order of £120,000.  This was obtained from Mr. Ray MacSharry, the Agriculture Commissioner in the EC.  It is derisory and will go no way towards solving this problem.  I am calling on the Government to take steps immediately to compensate these people because if they are not compensated there will be thousands of farmers throughout the country who will face financial ruin.  The approximate number of farmers affected &mdash; and we can only guess, but I have checked the figures both yesterday and today &mdash; is somewhere between 3,000 and 4,000.  I understand that these figures are being checked by the farming organisations and will be available in the next few days.</P>
    <P>The damage for grassland alone and loss of production as a result of waterlogging over the last two to three weeks could be in the region of £5 million.  One may ask how I calculate that figure.  It is quite simple.  If £20 per acre is allocated for 300,000 acres that gives the figure of £5 million.  No doubt the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Kirk, can understand clearly that any waterlogged grass will be at least five weeks behind for this season.</P>
    <P>I understand that the loss of sheep, cattle and other stocks from flood and related diseases, for example, pneumonia, twin lambing disease and many others, will be of the order of £2.5 million. The most serious aspect of this is the loss of feed, hay and silage in particular. People in a great part of the midlands have winter cattle out and will now have to buy fodder.  The amount of money required to buy fodder following these losses will create huge bills which could be in the region of £3 million.  This gives some indication of the amount of money required to compensate for the damage <Col N="1163" /> caused in this area.  The Minister questioned the figures.  I believe that in the region of £10 million to £12 million is needed.  The Minister of State should make that case to the Ministers who are considering this.  Many farmers are worried at the Minister's attitude both yesterday and today and on the radio in particular.  We are talking about the provision of £120,000 for perhaps 3,000 farmers or £40 each or the price of 20 bales of hay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I never mentioned the figure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister clearly stated that in his opinion this type of loss has not taken place.  The Minister is the one on whom the farmers depend to go to those four Ministers and inform them that this is the position of agriculture.  I would like to give a few examples.  In County Waterford a farmer with 220 acres has 180 acres completely under water; the breach in the sea wall would cost £100,000, not to mention the loss to the farmer.  It is going to cost £100,000 to repair the breach in the sea wall.  Another small farmer with 40 acres lost two sheds which will cost £3,000 to replace and stock worth £500.  In all, about £4,500 worth of damage was done.</P>
      <P>There is a duty on the Minister of State to ensure that the case is properly put to the Ministers concerned and that proper costings are done.  The insurance companies have refused to pay out.  This is a scandal.  The person concerned had obtained cover for damage but the legal boys got around this and said he did not have cover for storm damage and the insurance company refused to pay.  The Minister must face up to this problem. Three thousand farmers live in that area but, unfortunately, I cannot go into the figures in depth as I have only five minutes at my disposal.  The Minister has a serious job to do and I hope he changes his attitude and ensures that a proper case is made on behalf of farmers.</P>

      <P>It falls on me to <Col N="1164" /> wind up the debate.  Everyone inside and outside the House can see that there is great interest in this topic throughout the country.  It is unfortunate in the extreme that the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Kirk, made the remarks he did last night. His view on the extent of the storm damage is beyond belief.  It is as if he has been out of the country for eight weeks with no contact with our people.  I wish to inform the House that there was a remarkable change in policy in the Department of Agriculture and Food this morning.  I understand their telephone lines were jammed with calls from irate callers whose property had been damaged. All of a sudden the message hit home.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, had a different record to play tonight.  One would think that we were talking about two different problems. I do not know from whom the Minister of State received his information &mdash; I presume it was from the agricultural community &mdash; but as Deputy D'Arcy rightly pointed out, it is completely and utterly wrong.  It is a good job people did jam the telephone lines of the Department of Agriculture and Food today and I hope something will now be done.  I understand the Minister of State had a busy day answering telephone calls.</P>

      <P>Many meetings mandated Deputies and Senators of the Government party to bring details of the huge losses of property, stock and winter feed to the Minister of State and the Department of Agriculture and Food. Examples of losses abound.  Farmers in the Shannon valley have had to be evacuated and their livestock penned in spaces not much bigger than a zoo cage.  Most of their winter fodder has been ruined. One small farmer lost 40 ewes in a flash flood in Corofin, County Galway.  During the storm the night before last a wall fell on 14 in-lamb ewes.  One can imagine the strain on that farmer's face when he saw those 14 dead sheep &mdash; and 20 lambs <Col N="1165" /> were killed as a result.  Taken with the replacement cost of the stock, his total financial loss is in the region of £2,500, leaving aside a cost of about £1,500 to repair the building.  Where does one expect a small farmer with 40 acres to find that kind of money?</P>
      <P>Because of the inclement weather a group of farmers in the Tuam area had to rent shed space in another part of the parish to house their cattle while another farmer had to stand in three feet of water inside a slatted house to erect a raised feeding trough to keep silage out of the water.  Roofs of farm buildings are scattered all over the place and vast areas of land which have not been covered by flood waters since 1954 will be almost useless in 1990 as grass growth will be severely retarded.</P>
      <P>So bad was the flooding in the Shannon valley that an emergency meeting of the Shannon forum was called last week, which all public representatives were invited to attend, to bring back the news where it mattered most.  However, it appears that this message was not brought back to the Minister of State. Volumes were spoken in Athlone that day and promises were given to bring the story back and to hammer home to their ministerial colleagues the great damage caused by the storms and flooding.  I have no doubt that they were crocodile tears. We can only assume that the Minister of State told the truth last night and did not get any feed back.  Deputies and Senators of his party were adamant that they were going to change the face of the Shannon valley.  Indeed, the Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce, Deputy Leyden, boldly told the meeting that he was going on a fact finding mission the next day.  I would like to know what he saw and, more important, what he told the Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am convinced that the Government and EC Commissioner, Mr. MacSharry, have conspired to ensure that no worthwhile aid will be made available, despite what the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, said tonight.  The EC Commissioner moved quickly two weeks ago to inform the nation that there was <Col N="1166" /> only petty cash left in the till and a sum of £120,000 would be made available. The Minister for the Environment must be accused of hypocrisy as he named the contributions given to each member state of the Community but was not man enough to quote the figure for Ireland. He knows the figure as well as I do.  It is £120,000 which will be useless as it could be used in any parish in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Government genuinely believed when the EC Commissioner, Mr. MacSharry, pointed out that the till was empty that that would be the end of the matter, that the weather would improve or there may be a miracle.  This did not happen.  A precedent was created in 1985 and 1986 when farmers in difficulty were helped.  I should know as I was near the eye of the storm at the time.  The Coalition Government spent £13 million in 1985 providing feed vouchers.  Regardless of whether this was money well spent, someone came up with £13 million.</P>
    <P>In a brilliant move in 1986 headage payments were doubled.  At the time 50 per cent of the payment could be recouped from the EC.  I want to inform the House tonight, lest anybody in the Department of Agriculture and Food says that this cannot be done or never has been done, that on that occasion the payments were increased on the basis that the national Exchequer would fund only half the amount required.  However, following some brilliant negotiations in Brussels the EC funded the entire bill on that occasion to the tune of £18 million. I defy anyone to contradict me as I received this information from the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, only two months ago.</P>
    <P>There was, and still is, financial aid available if looked for in the proper way. If the remarks which the Minister of State made were transmitted to the EC authorities in Brussels, what would they think?  Obviously they would say things are not so bad in Ireland because one of the Ministers responsible has said so in the national assembly.  It is unfortunate that he made those remarks.</P>
    <P>Because of the personnel we now have <Col N="1167" /> in very important places we have never been in a better position to have our case heard.  First, we hold the Presidency of the EC.  As the Taoiseach is able to get to New York and Camp David, surely he should have no problem getting to Brussels to raise this matter with a man with whom he served in Government, the EC Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr. MacSharry, a former Minister for Agriculture. He could also talk to the Minister for Agriculture and Food, who is also a former EC Commissioner.  If that is not a receipe for getting things done in Brussels I do not know what is.  Agriculture has never been in a worse state and it appears as if the Government have thrown in the towel.  More important than that, it appears that if the Minister continues with the kind of statements he made here last night, we will lose again. I want to say this particular to Minister Flynn: there is a natural disaster fund in the EC.  One cannot plan for a natural disaster, so it is a contingency payment that has to be there.  I know that many <Col N="1168" /> countries creamed off handsome sums of money over the years for their natural disasters in their hour of need.  Now it is our turn, and I am not talking about £2 million or £3 million but about a substantial amount of money that will compensate people for the terrible losses they have incurred and will continue to incur for all in 1990.  It is incumbent on the Minister to ensure that he get together the three wise men as I call them, the Taoiseach, the Commissioner in Brussels and the Minister for Agriculture. They have the power.  I doubt, however, if they have either the initiative or the ambition to do something for Ireland, for whatever reason I will never know.  Let it never be said that there was no precedent for this.  It can be done and I have proved it in the House.  There is at least £20 million that can be got for direct aid to farmers.  I suggest that the Minister get on his bike tomorrow morning and get it done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 6 relates to section 3, which in turn relates to section 3 (5) and (6) of the 1977 Act. Subsections (5) and (6) of the 1977 Act exempt a list of works and a list of public bodies whose works in or near rivers or near waters of one kind or another are exempted from the provision that a person shall not cause or permit any polluting matter to enter waters.  I do not see the necessity for exempting all these different bodies.</P>
      <P>I mentioned earlier the exemption under the Foreshore Act, 1933, and some of the exemptions under the Harbours Act, 1946.  The latter Act exempted the depositing of dredged material from the sea and the depositing of earth, ash or stones.  It also exempted harbour works which would contain provision for the opening of sewers, drains or pipes.  All these activities are exempted under the 1977 Act.  A number of other Acts are relevant, including the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1955, the Liffey Reservoir Act, 1936, the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1945 and the Turf Development Act, 1946. The 1949 Local Authorities (Works) Act would exempt the ESB, Bord na Móna and local authorities in that if they or any of their contractors were carrying out works they would not have to comply with the provisions of the Fisheries Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a general principle we should not have these kinds of exemptions.  We <Col N="1174" /> know that State organisations, local authorities or their contractors are very often offenders in regard to water pollution. There is no good reason they should not come under the general provisions of the water pollution legislation, where they would be prohibited from causing or permitting polluting matter to enter water and presumably they would also be covered by the &ldquo;good defence&rdquo; clause about which we talked earlier.</P>
    <P>The amendment I am proposing would seek to delete from the 1977 Act those exemptions and replace them by a provision where if the Minister felt there was a necessity for an exemption he could bring regulations before the House to provide for that exemption.  The 1949 Local Authorities (Works) Act deals with the kind of public works that would relate to storm damage, flooding or whatever. It was felt that for those reasons it would be necessary to exempt certain types of public works.  It is desirable that this should be provided for by way of regulations which would be brought before the House and would set out the conditions under which such works would be carried out.</P>
    <P>None of the Acts which exempt public bodies from the provisions of the 1977 Water Pollution Act protects against water pollution.  The Acts are expressed in very wide terms.  In the case of the Foreshore Act there is reference to any type of infill.  They are wide open to abuse.  For these reasons we should delete the exemptions and make an alternative provision whereby any type of exempted works or classes of works would be dealt with by way of regulations which would be brought before the House.</P>

First, it would render all licensed trade effluents subject to prosecution under section 3, thus removing any incentive for industry to comply with the licensing provisions of the Act.  Secondly, it would extend the ambit of the Act to waters outside the functional area of local authorities and to discharges which are <Col N="1175" /> already adequately catered for by the various Acts referred to in section 3.  I believe that the approach adopted in the amendment is incorrect in that it would take the axe to exemptions that have not given rise to problems generally and indeed are necessary for the orderly operation of an effective regime of water pollution control.  At the same time it would give the Minister the opportunity to introduce an unlimited number of exemptions without these having to undergo the full legislative process.  In my view there is no scope for providing further exemptions to section 3.  Indeed the present exemptions should be kept under constant review and it is for this reason that the Bill empowers the Minister to remove those exemptions which are abused or found to be unnecessary.  For instance, the Minister will now be able to remove the exemption conferred on Bord an Móna turf developments by section 27 of the Turf Development Act, 1946 should he conclude that such developments are the cause of widespread pollution.</P>
      <P>Some of the exemptions have given cause for concern.  I do not dispute what Deputy Gilmore has said.  It will be necessary to use the provisions of this Bill to limit certain exemptions.  I hope that can be done.  All exemptions should be reviewed in the light of this legislation and unless they are absolutely necessary they should not stay.  That is why the power is being given.  It is not necessary to give the Minister any additional functions in relation to exemptions generally. To give a power of unlimited exemption seems to contradict what Deputy Gilmore set out to do initially.  It would also make it impossible to have certain trade effluents which are subject to very strict licences provided for.  That would have major implications for industry throughout the country.  While I would not disagree totally with many of the points raised by Deputy Gilmore, the most effective way to deal with this is by way of the new provisions in the Bill which will allow the Minister to make regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that &ldquo;debating&rdquo; is the appropriate word.  The Minister sees some merit in what I am attempting to do.  It certainly is not my intention to open up the possibility of even further exemptions than are already included in the 1977 Act.  The purpose of the amendment was to eliminate exemptions or certainly to restrict them.  It is a question of how one looks at it.  The Minister talks about the need to review some of the exemptions in the 1977 Act. If that is the case we should face up to it now.  Leaving it to be done by way of regulations is not necessarily the best way.  If we feel that section 27 of the Turf Development Act should be deleted from the list of exemptions or that the Harbours Act, 1946 in relation to the foreshore should be deleted, that should be done in the context of this Bill.  It is not my intention to press this amendment to a vote.  Instead of leaving it to be done by way of regulations, however, I would ask the Minister to consider having a look at the list of exemption on Report Stage and perhaps deleting those which can now be deleted which would at least reduce the problem to be dealt with by way of regulations.</P>

      <P>I would like to be helpful but I do no know if it would be practical or feasible to review the extent of all these exemptions between now and Report Stage which I hope will be soon. I share many concerns of the Deputy but such a review of all exemptions could not be done in a short time.  I am prepared to look at the Deputy's suggestion.  We can restrict the exemptions but I do not <Col N="1177" /> know if we could totally de-exempt all the bodies we might like to bring under the provisions of this legislation.  Turf development, for example, may be its nature necessitate certain matters getting into water courses and I do not know whether one can have turf development without that.  I do not know enough about it to be able to comment now, but I will undertake to come back on Report Stage with whatever I can or at some further stage.  However, giving the Minister power to make regulations would have given sufficient time after the passing of this Bill to review these exemptions and to have discussions with relevant Departments and Ministers in reviewing operations that have in the past necessitated these exemptions, to see if they are unnecessary or desirable from the environment point of view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7.</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 4, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;4&mdash;Subsection (3) of section 4 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the substitution for paragraph (b) of the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(b) In considering whether or not to grant a licence under this section and in considering the terms of any such licence a local authority shall have regard to the objectives contained in any relevant plan under section 15.  It shall also base its assimilative capacity estimates on a seven day sustained low flow criterion.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a very significant omission in the 1977 Act which is not being addressed in this Bill and that is the question of the criteria used in measuring pollution in rivers.  It is not just a matter of the licence <Col N="1178" /> that should be taken into account.  The terms of such licences are of vital importance. The fact is that the only or certainly the best criteria for establishing water quality is the seven day sustained low flow criteria.  This means one has to take a river at its lowest possible level for seven days and measure it on that basis because, obviously, if one measures the level when it is at medium or high flow the element of dilution will be very substantial.  We all know that frequently rivers are running low, especially in summer as they did last summer.  This is a very significant omission in this Bill.  It is essential that we protect the quality of our water because it is a very precious resource for ourselves and our tourists.  I would be interested to hear what the Minister has to say and whether she can reassure me on this point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment also seeks to impose an absolute obligation on local authorities to set licence conditions based on the receiving water's assimilative capacity as determined on a seven day sustained low flow.</P>
      <P>Such an obligation would interfere with the basic powers extended under the 1977 Act to local authorities to determine the conditions attached to discharge licences. These decisions should be based on all circumstances relevant to the particular licence application and the conditions imposed should seek to safeguard water quality and the legitimate uses of the waters concerned.  Should any party consider that the conditions are inadequate they may appeal them to An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The adoption of the uniform approach put forward in this amendment would be most inappropriate where particularly dangerous substances are contained in an effluent discharge.  Licence conditions in such situations should seek to reduce and, as far as possible, eliminate such substances from the effluent &mdash; the concept of tackling pollution at source &mdash; rather than limit discharges based on the assimilative capacity approach.  The latter would provide a much poorer level of environmental protection.  There would <Col N="1179" /> also be situations in which the seven day low flow criteria would not apply, as where discharges are made to estuaries or to the sea.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the issue which the Deputy seeks to address is amenable to a legislative solution involving a rigid, uniform approach.  Local authorities must continue to be allowed to determine licence conditions taking account of all circumstances relevant to the particular licence application.  I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>The environmental protection agency will be given responsibility for setting standards for the issue of water licences, waste permits and air pollution licences. I share the Deputy's concern &mdash; I know what he is trying to get at &mdash; but this is not the best way to do it as it may best be catered for in the context of those standards set by the proposed agency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I totally agree with the Minister when she said that we should be trying to eliminate the causes of these discharges and perhaps I should have stressed that in my short contribution. Nevertheless, sometimes there are illegal discharges or those which cannot be reduced beyond a certain minimum.  I am disappointed with the Minister's response.  I agree that estuarial waters are a different matter but, in so far as discharges are made into rivers above the waterline, one has to take into consideration the effects at the lowest possible water levels.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this matter on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is already done by local authorities, they are required to take the particular circumstances into account.  However, to make it a rigid requirement for every single licence that you have to take the assimilative water capacity over seven consecutive days would be unnecessary.  It is not required in all circumstances and would not be desirable.  The Deputy is seeking to ensure that particular circumstances are taken on board.  I share his concern in <Col N="1180" /> that regard but it would be more appropriate for the new environmental agency in setting standards to deal with this matter rather than making it a very rigid and inflexible rule if it was written into the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 31, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an amendment to section 6 of the Principal Act which makes regulations for the purposes of section 4 of the Principal Act which deals with licences for the discharge of trade or sewage effluent into water and section 8 which deals with appeals against these licences.</P>
      <P>Section 8 will be amended later on but the reason we feel that the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; should be substituted for &ldquo;may&rdquo; is that if &ldquo;may&rdquo; is left there it is part of the legislation.  Some Ministers may be a lot more concerned about environmental issues than others; our concern is that regulations will be made in terms of licences for discharge of trade and sewage effluent into water and that regulations will be made in terms of the appeals against these licences from people who have been granted them.  I should like to hear the Minister's response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider it more appropriate that section 4 of the Bill should seek to provide general enabling powers in relation to regulations on the payment of fees for licence applications and appeals rather than imposing rigid obligations on the matters to be addressed by such regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The charging of fees for services are now a normal feature of the provision of public services.  The provision in the Bill is intended to allow local authorities to offset some of their costs in processing licence applications by charging fees determined and prescribed by me.  Substantial costs may be incurred by local authorities in processing such applications, depending on the nature of the <Col N="1181" /> effluent discharged and the complexity of the production processes involved.</P>
    <P>The provision regarding payment of fees for appeals to An Bord Pleanála will similarly help to offset substantial costs. A fee of up to £36 is payable for appeals at present under the Local Government (Water Pollution Fees) Regulations, 1985.  I assure Deputies that it is my intention to bring forward regulations at an early date on the payment of fees to local authorities in respect of licence applications made under section 4 of the 1977 Water Pollution Act.</P>
    <P>I remain satisfied that it is better to retain the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; and, in view of what I said, perhaps Deputies will reconsider their position.  There are circumstances where it might not be desirable to charge a fee, for example, if a hospital, medical institute or voluntary body are concerned.  It is undesirable to put the element of compulsion in all cases and perhaps if the Deputy reflects on that he might agree with me.  It certainly is the intention of the Government &mdash; and it has been the situation for quite some time now &mdash; that in the issue of licences fees are payable.  They can be quite substantial and they are also payable in relation to appeals.  Indeed, those fees have been the subject of a lot of controversy and disquiet by Deputies, among others, but, because of the huge cost involved, it is necessary to charge a fee, even for a third party appeal by a member of the public.  I ask Deputies to leave the flexibility in the legislation, to leave the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; which is more flexible than the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; so that we can take account of particular circumstances such as I outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the view that generally, in principle, if somebody applies for a licence under this legislation they should foot the expense incurred by the local authority to process the application as well as the expense incurred by An Bord Pleanála.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's reason for not accepting the amendment does not stand up.  The <Col N="1182" /> particular subsection provides that regulations under this section may make provision for the payment to a local authority of a fee of such amount as may be specified in respect of an application to it.  It says that you can provide for the payment of fees of different amounts in respect of different classes of applications.  I do not imagine that a school would be looking for a licence under the water pollution legislation but it could apply in the case of a medical establishment.  Different fees can apply in different circumstances and that would deal adequately with the Minister's objections.  &ldquo;May&rdquo; is an empowering provision and &ldquo;shall&rdquo; ensures that it would happen.  In this context it would make a lot of sense to ensure that there were different types of licences.  I cannot see why the Minister will not accept the amendment although I do not want to unduly delay the House in relation to it.  Perhaps she will consider looking at this again on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that the Minister has taken a negative position in regard to this amendment.  It seems that the Department of the Environment are considerably behind in making regulations which they are enabled to do under various legislation.  I would be concerned that if under this legislation the Department of the Environment are not required to make the regulations they may well be pushed to the bottom of the pile.  The Minister advanced an argument for not including a provision in the Bill that regulations could be made about hospitals. There is a provision in the Bill for a waiver, a remission or a refund of fees in certain circumstances and that would cover that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not entirely happy about the payment of fees to An Bord Pleanála in respect of appeals.  I agree with the principle that the licence applicant should pay a fee to the local authority and that if he wishes to appeal that licence decision to An Bord Pleanála it is also correct that he should pay a fee.  However, I am concerned about the case of a third party, a member of the public, a residents association or an environmental group who are <Col N="1183" /> anxious about conditions attaching to a licence and are anxious to appeal that to An Bord Pleanála.  I am concerned that they will be hit with a fee.  As the Minister has stated there has been some controversy about the Minister's decision to increase the level of fees which apply in the case of planning applications and appeals to An Bord Pleanála.  I suggest to the Minister that she should have another look at that matter.</P>
    <P>I do not think members of the public should be discouraged from making an appeal to An Bord Pleanála by the size of the fee involved.  In the planning area we are talking about a fee of £56.  If we discourage appeals we are defeating one of the purposes of the legislation which is to give the public greater access to and involvement in protection from pollution. Will the Minister clarify if it is intended that the fees she has referred to will be paid by the public?  If that is the case will the Minister consider having a second thought about it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to tell Deputy Shatter that I will have another look at the provision between now and Report Stage and I may be able to cover the points made with the use of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  On the payment of fees, nobody likes to say that a member of the public with a legitimate appeal or who wants to obain information should have to pay. However, substantial costs are involved in processing applications for licence fees, planning applications and so on. Some element of the cost involved &mdash; it is only a tiny portion &mdash; should be recouped.  The fee has been introduced to recoup some of the cost involved and to try to avoid unnecessary appeals or appeals that are lodged for the sake of making an appeal.  The fee of £36 may be a lot of money for some groups but, generally, it is not.  In my view an organisation or a member of the public would be more serious about an appeal if they had to make a small payment than they would if there was no payment involved. The fee has been introduced to avoid frivolous appeals as much as anything <Col N="1184" /> else.  In the main we want to help to defray some of the cost involved.  In principle I would like to be able to say that legitimate appeals should be free and that in other cases people should have to make a contribution to the costs involved. However, I do not think it would be possible to cater for the two cases.</P>
      <P>The water licence fees have not increased but the planning appeal fees have.  I cannot give an undertaking to Deputy Gilmore on the point he made about fees or the level they will be set at.  They certainly will be retained but I cannot say at what level.  I give an undertaking to consider between now and Report Stage the use of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; as opposed to the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;. However, the use of that word may still allow the exclusions I mentioned and I am concerned about that.  If that is the case I will have no great objection to making the change suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be a way out of this dilemma which the Minister should consider between now and Report Stage. We are dealing with two entirely different matters in this section.  One concerns a licence fee payable by an industry or a person requiring a licence while the other relates to an appeal fee to An Bord Pleanála.  I would be very unhappy to leave the section unamended.  Will the Minister consider using the word &ldquo;will&rdquo; in subsection (a) which deals with a licence and the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in the section dealing with An Bord Pleanála? However, the issue is not as simple as that because there are two types of appeal to An Bord Pleanála, the appeal from the industry or user who, generally, can well afford to pay a fee, and the appeal from members of the general public many of whom cannot afford to pay a fee.  The Minister suggested that a nominal amount should be paid in order to discourage frivolous appeals.  I agree that we should discourage frivolous appeals but a fee of £36 is quite substantial.  A fee of £5 or £10 would be sufficient to discourage totally frivolous appeals. Alternatively, the Minister should consider the concept of refunding fees where <Col N="1185" /> An Bord Pleanála are satisfied that the complaint, even if it is overruled by the board, was a serious one and merited consideration.  In such cases a refund in full should be made.  Will the Minister consider those suggestions between now and Report Stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is desirable that we should get involved in an argument about the level of fees when we are framing legislation because we cannot include monetary sums in the Bill. I do not think Members would consider that desirable.  If the Deputy accepts that we should try to discourage frivolous appeals then there is a need to have a fee.  The correct way to deal with fees is through the regulations.  I am being reasonable in what I am doing about Deputy's amendment which is to consider substituting &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  The wider issue of whether fees should be paid by certain groups and the level of those fees, is not a matter for discussion on the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (1), line 29, after &ldquo;direction.&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;An Bord Pleanála inspectors' reports in water pollution appeals shall be made public, and the reasons for An Bord Pleanála's decisions be publicly stated.  A decision by An Bord Pleanála to deny an oral hearing on a water pollution licence appeal, may be further appealed to the Minister.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a very important principle involved in this, freedom of information. It is essential that An Bord Pleanála inspectors' reports are made public and that the reasons for their decisions are publicly stated.  We have found in the past that An Bord Pleanála commission <Col N="1186" /> an inspector's report on an issue which is the subject of an appeal, whether it is in regard to a water pollution licence or a planning permission.  The inspector's report remains secret and An Bord Pleanála can overturn it, as we found in the Radio Tara mast case, without any reason or even public knowledge.  The position is very unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>An Bord Pleanála send skilled and experienced inspectors to look at an issue and they may sit for many days at an oral hearing before reporting.  In due course An Bord Pleanála publish their report. The gullible, innocent general public read An Bord Pleanála's decision and remark, &ldquo;the inspector spent many days there, listened to a lot of evidence and he has either accepted or rejected the appeal&rdquo;. It does not occur to the normal person that An Bord Pleanála can, and frequently do, overturn their inspector's report and not only that but the public never know about it; furthermore, the public are never given reasons.  These things are most unsatisfactory.  There have been many strange decisions made by An Bord Pleanála, especially since 1987.  I will leave it to your imagination and your memories to see what happened in 1987.  There have been some very unsatisfactory goings on.</P>
    <P>Finally the question of whether an oral hearing takes place is at the discretion of An Bord Pleanála.  Frequently they decide against having an oral hearing. There is no appeal at present against this. I think there must be some appeals procedure, perhaps to the Minister, because in virtually all cases an oral hearing, if only for the sake of showing the public that justice is being done, should be very much the rule rather than the exception.  Denying people their right to an oral hearing is a very serious matter. I would like to hear the Minister's response to that also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 23 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act 1976 provides that where an inspection is carried out or an oral hearing is conducted on behalf of An Bord Pleanála or by a person appointed by the <Col N="1187" /> board, that person must submit a written report on the inspection or hearing to the board.  The board are required to consider the report before determining the matter in question.  This provision equally applies to appeals under both the Water Pollution Act and the planning Acts.  The board are not obliged, however, to accept the recommendations in the inspector's report.  Appeals fall to be determined by the board and the inspector's report may be viewed as an input or one part of the decision making process.  For this reason it has not been the practice to make inspector's reports public either in relation to water pollution licences or in relation to planning applications. I agree totally with the Deputy that there is a need for greater access to information in this area.  Provision in that regard will be made in the proposed Environmental Protection Bill.  There is also a directive, as the Deputy is aware, before the Council of Ministers in relation to access to information.  These matters might be more wisely discussed in that context.</P>
      <P>I cannot agree with the suggestion that there should be an appeal to the Minister against a refusal by the board to hold an oral hearing.  Bord Pleanála are an independent board and should be as independent as possible in the exercise of their duties and in the carrying out of their operations.  Appealing a decision of the board on whether to have an oral hearing would run contrary to the independence of the board and would not be desirable.  For that reason I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment.  I would also add that the Deputy does not seek to make any reports of the local authority available to the public.  In his amendment it appears to be only the activities of An Bord Pleanála with which he is preoccupied. It is inconsistent to make it compulsory for An Bord Pleanála to publish a particular report and not to do so in the case of the local authority concerned. I cannot, therefore, accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree broadly with <Col N="1188" /> Deputy Garland's amendment particularly as it relates to the publication of An Bord Pleanála's inspectors' reports. The Minister is correct in drawing attention to the fact that the amendment does not include local authority reports either. Reports of this kind should be available to the public, at least for inspection.  If they were available, not only in the area of water pollution but in the general area of planning many of the difficulties and much of the controversy about planning decisions which have been the subject of public comment recently might have been obviated.  The public have a right to know what the professional opinion is on matters of this kind.  It may well be that, having regard to all the circumstances, the board have the right not to accept the report they get from the inspector but the principle of the inspector's report being made available should be defended.</P>
      <P>I do not understand the Minister's explanation that this can be dealt with in the context of the environment protection agency.  This is the second time in the course of this debate that the Minister has offered the agency as the panacea. She did so earlier when we were talking about the Water Pollution Advisory Council and their abolition under this Bill.  What exactly will the environment protection agency deal with here; the inspector's reports of An Bord Pleanála will either be available to the public or not so available.  The establishment of an environment protection agency and the freedom of information directive is neither here not there so far as this issue is concerned unless the reports are to be made public.  Surely it is as easy to provide for that in this legislation as it is in the context of the environment protection agency legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am inclined to agree with the Minister in relation to the question of appealing to the Minister in respect of a refusal of an oral hearing.  The experience, particularly in the environment area, where matters are appealed to the Minister, has not been encouraging.  I agree that it would take from the independence of An Bord Pleanála if such appeals were <Col N="1189" /> allowable.  The main thrust of the amendment is about making information available to the public and that should be taken account of.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, take the view that in the general planning area as well as in this area the inspector's report should be public information.  Presumably the planning situation and the inspector's report after an oral hearing, set out the submissions made at the hearing as well as a recommendation to the board.  An Bord Pleanála, where they receive an inspector's report, should normally publish it and not make a decision on foot of that report until at least two weeks after publication so that if there is anything in the report to which people want to make a written response they have the opportunity to do so.  I am not talking of reopening an entire oral hearing but if there is a belief that something has been misunderstood by an inspector or that there is a misconception of a particular planning application, or an application under this Act, that the board will have a response before them in writing before making their final determination.  Like Deputy Gilmore I do not understand why the Minister mentioned the environment protection agency.  It was my understanding from what was said about the Fine Gael Bill that the Government were not enthusiastic about an agency that would have general freedom of access to information held by Government Departments, An Bord Pleanála etc. Even if they do have that access, they may do so in the context of reporting on the performance of the different bodies concerned and would not be involved in determining the individual planning application or the application of the water pollution legislation.</P>

    <P>I hope that in the context of planning legislation we will see the planning Acts being changed and that it will be a matter of practice that these reports are made public information.  I do not see how we can have the Minister for the Environment in his super Green Euro role, apparently trying to sell a directive on freedom of information to the other <Col N="1190" /> member states of the EC while we deny freedom of access to basic information within our own jurisdiction.  I would share the Minister's view and that of Deputy Gilmore about the idea of an appeal from An Bord Pleanála to the Minister where there is a refusal such as that suggested by Deputy Garland.  That could politicise a process which should be kept out of the political arena.  I would have reservations about that.</P>
    <P>There is also need for uniformity.  I am not sure if we can make provision for reports in the context of the water pollution Acts as in other circumstances reports are not made available to the public.  Perhaps this has to be done under the planning Acts but I would like the Minister of State to clarify her approach to this matter.  Is she disposed to the idea that all such reports should be published? Can she tell us if the Government intend bringing forward specific legislation to amend the planning Acts, including the water pollution and air pollution legislation, to ensure that such reports are made public?  When are we likely to see such legislation?  They are the relevant questions on this matter.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputies who argue that planning inspectors' reports in relation to planning applications should be made public.  While I do not have any function in relation to planning matters within the Department of the Environment, I understand the Minister is reviewing the planning Acts.</P>
      <P>In relation to water licences, the Deputies may feel that I am using the Environmental Protection Agency as the panacea for all our toubles, but I do not want to give that impression &mdash; it would not be fair to do so &mdash; as it will not be.  It may be that, following the passage of the legislation, appeals may only be made to this agency so far as water and air licences are concerned.  That is why it may be more appropriate to streamline the requirements in relation to access to information in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I do not claim to be an expert in this area, I understand that it is not common to have an inspector's report <Col N="1191" /> in relation to a water licence.  When an appeal goes before the board it is not always the case that there is an inspector's report.  Maybe what Deputies want is the technical report on which the decision is made.  As I said it is not always the case that an inspection takes place as would happen, for example in a planning application.  However, I do not want to use that as an excuse.  As I said, I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment for a number of reasons.  First, it would place the onus on An Bord Pleanála, second we intend to review this procedure in the context of the Environmental Protection Agency legislation which will have a role to play in relation to water and air pollution licences and waste permits; and, third, I cannot agree that a refusal to grant an appeal by an Bord Pleanála should go to the Minister.  That would lead to an erosion of the independence of the board and would, as Deputy Shatter said, be politicising the process to some extent.  We want to avoid this as it would be undesirable to do so.  The reason we have an independent board is to avoid matters of that kind.</P>

From my reading of the Bill this may not be appropriate in the context of this legislation but I would like to see this covered.  The Minister of State referred to an EC Directive on this matter.  However, we should be able to legislate for matters of this kind in the House without having to await an EC Directive.

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 9, line 8, after &ldquo;fine&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;exceeding £250 but&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason this series of amendments is down is that we believe the environmental officers of local authorities should have the support demonstrably, not alone of both Houses of the Oireachtas, but of the courts as well.  There were a couple <Col N="1193" /> of incidents in my own area that concerned me greatly.  The first was several years ago where several thousand gallons of animal blood were discharged into the east Waterford water scheme.  Due to the vigilance of local authority staff this was discovered before the water had actually gone through the treatment plant.  The type of treatment that is available in a water treatment plant would not have dealt with the viral type of infection that was in the animal blood.</P>
    <P>When this case was brought to court and there was a successful prosecution a fine of £100 was imposed on conviction which, in my view, was derisory and would make people like the environmental officers of the county council, who had gone to great trouble to prepare the case and whose vigilance prevented what could have been a major disaster in terms of the water supply to Waterford City, Tramore and Dunmore East, feel that they had not got the support of the courts. Again in Dungarvan on two separate occasions an industrial concern was prosecuted. Paltry fines of £50 and £10 were imposed after successful conviction.  In one case the parameters were exceeded 1,000 times in terms of the effluent which was being discharged into Dungarvan Bay and, indeed, the South Eastern Health Board advised people not to consume shellfish from that particular harbour.</P>
    <P>The fact that one does not always have consistency between district justices in these matters is the major matter for concern here.  When local authorities bring people to court and successfully prosecute such breaches of the Act as we are discussing here tonight, the type of fine brought in should reflect the seriousness with which the court views the matter.  I would be interested in the Minister's response to this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments provide that a person shall be liable on summary conviction of offences referred to in the section to a fine of not less than £250 and where convicted on indictment to a fine of not less than £2,500.  These <Col N="1194" /> amendments would, in my view, constitute an unwarranted interference with the discretion of the Judiciary to deal with each case on its merits.  I believe the Judiciary will apply a sensible sentencing policy when dealing with water pollution offences and I believe that there is already a trend emerging of the courts taking a more serious view of such offences and imposing higher penalties as a consequence.  A requirement to impose a mandatory minimum fine in the case of such offences would lead to unnecessary rigidity in the law.  There will always be exceptional cases where particular mitigating circumstances exist which would justify the imposition of a small or even a nominal fine.  For instance, if a person is convicted of non-compliance with a notice under section 12 of the Principal Act the fact that the person may be able to provide evidence that he has complied substantially with the terms of the notice and has arrangements in place to ensure early completion of the remaining measures to prevent pollution might be such a mitigating factor.</P>
      <P>Apart from the specific monetary penalties contained in the Bill it should also be remembered that there is a number of other provisions which should result in offenders having to pay out significant amounts.  These include recoupment of local authority or fishery board expenses in taking the prosecution, including the salaries of officials involved, the cost of investigating the accident as provided for under section 28 and possibly costs involved in complying with an order to mitigate or remedy the effects of the pollution. Offenders may, in addition, be held civilly liable under section 20 for damages, losses or injuries sustained on account of the pollution.  These provisions are useful weapons in the fight to make the polluter pay and they should also be effective in providing a real deterrent against polluters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For these reasons I consider it would be wrong to provide for a minimum fine. Judges should continue to be in a position to assess all the relevant facts in each case to determine the appropriate penalty.  I might add in response to the case Deputy <Col N="1195" /> O'Shea mentioned that there was a case recently of a first offence where somebody was given 18 months for dumping blood in water.  On appeal that was changed but the person went to jail and served part of the sentence.  To take one case and use that as a reason to justify a minimum sentence would be wrong.  If there is a minimum fine I believe there is a tendency in the courts to apply the minimum because it will more or less guide the Judiciary in the direction of the minimum.  Leaving it to their discretion to go as high as £1,000 will make it more likely that in many cases they will go way above the £250 threshold.  Simply to require them to do it in all cases might mean we will get the minimum, and maybe no more than the minimum for all first offences.  That would not be desirable or fair.</P>
    <P>The general view is that unless it is absolutely vital in legislation, to interfere with the independence of the Judiciary and compel them to look at each case in the light of the facts and circumstances, is undesirable in law.  I know Deputies will remind us of drunk driving offences and what we have been asking for in relation to rape, but in relation to the imposition of fines in this legislation I do not believe it would be desirable and I am not certain it would have the desired effect.  While we would always have to get the minimum £250 we might never get much more than that even where a fine of £800, £900 or £1,000 would be more relevant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I always have some reluctance to constrain the Judiciary totally for the reasons Minister of State gave, but I am also concerned and anxious to ensure that where prosecutions take place and someone is properly convicted the District Court imposes a proper fine or sentence where appropriate.  It occurs to me that this problem could be approached from a different viewpoint. Deputy Harney is right when she says that where you provide a minimum, there is always a danger that it is that minimum the Judiciary will order, and where a fine <Col N="1196" /> is appropriate it is often gauged not just by whether there is a minimum fine but what the maximum is as well.  The usual reason for providing for a low level of fines in the District Court is that that is a court of limited jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>I want to raise something with the Minister which she may be willing to consider on Report Stage and I want to put it on the record of this House that I have raised it on Committee Stage and am in a position to move it on Report Stage. Having considered Deputy O'Shea's and Deputy Quinn's amendment and had another look at the section, I suggest that the maximum fine of £1,000 which the District Court can impose is insufficient. If you take the comparison of a fine of £1,000 and/or six months' imprisonment &mdash; bearing in mind that we probably will not be dealing with this legislation again for some years &mdash; it would seem that the maximum District Court fine could be constitutionally quite properly increased to £2,500.  In the context of the District Court imposing penalties that would give a wider degree of discretion to a district justice and would render it more likely as you go through the different levels of seriousness of cases that appropriate fines would be imposed.</P>
      <P>In regard to the cost, the District Court is allowed to provide for the meeting the costs of works up to £2,500 but the fine is limited to £1,000.  The Minister can correct me if I am wrong in my reading of the legislation.  It would seem appropriate to amend the District Court minimum fine from £1,000 to £2,500.  That should guarantee that district justices would impose proper fines.  It would give them greater leeway in exercising discretion in the context of different levels of seriousness of offences that might come before them.  I would like the Minister to consider that, and I would like Deputy O'Shea to consider that as an approach that might deal with the type of problem he is concerned about.  I think the £1,000 fine is too low in the context of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem here is that the experience of the 1977 Act was that the Judiciary, with all due respect to <Col N="1197" /> them, did not appear to take the problem of water pollution very seriously when cases were brought before them, and the experience of local authorities and fishery boards has been that judges tend in a first offence to put back the case to allow the offending party an opportunity to put his affairs in order and to get himself back on side.  Even then where a prosecution is proceeded with, the tendency is that the level of fines is very low.  Therefore, it is important that the Legislature send a very clear message to the Judiciary that, while they have discretion to judge each case on its merits, the view from ths House is that the penalties should be considerably increased.</P>
      <P>I am inclined to go along with the view expressed by Deputy Shatter, that the maximum fine should be increased.  I am not entirely convinced by the Minister's argument that if you provide for a minimum the Judiciary will necessarily always go for that.  It may well have the effect of signalling to them that there is a great deal of concern about this and that the Legislature would wish to see the Judiciary taking a much firmer stand with polluters than has been the case up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Shea referred to a serious case where the fine was only £100, and that is one reason we are amending this section.  As I understand it, for a prosecution under section 10 the maximum fine that can currently be imposed is £250.  That is the problem.  I am not familiar with the case in Deputy O'Shea's constituency, but the problem here is that the level of penalty is so low that in the context of a maximum fine of £250 the district justice might have thought £100 was a reasonable fine.  That is why it is important to increase the maximum fine as opposed to providing a minimum fine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the three contributions from the Minister and the spokespersons, I have no hang-up as to how we achieve the desired effect.  It is my concern that local authority environmental control officers can feel <Col N="1198" /> badly let down when certain types of fines are imposed by the court upon conviction. I ask the Minister to respond to Deputy Shatter's suggestion regarding increasing the level of fine.  I have a totally open mind on this, but I am seeking to ensure that the people in the field who are implementing this legislation on behalf of the community should feel they have the backing of the Judiciary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Shatter on the point he made.  On looking at the Bill since I went to the Department I made that point that I thought £1,000 was quite low, but the advice we have from the Attorney General &mdash; the Deputy knows we are obliged to take the Attorney General's advice &mdash; is that we cannot go higher than £1,000 in the District Court.  I know that advice is disputed by people outside the Attorney General's Office but that is the advice we have. I take Deputy Shatter's point that the District Court under section 7 is allowed to make an order on costs up to £2,500. I know it seems inconsistent but very often the law is inconsistent in this respect and the advice offered is too.  I will certainly have a look at this again and seek the advice of the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>However, it is important to remember that the fine is only one small part of the penalty that is going to be imposed.  If somebody is convicted of a pollution offence in addition to being required to make good the damage, he will have to pay the full cost of taking the prosecution, which will be substantial, even at the District Court level.  This will add enormously to the financial penalty that will be imposed on those convicted of pollution offences.  I share the Deputy's concern and I see the reasoning behind putting forward an amendment of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the general awareness of the environment, the Judiciary cannot but be aware of it and I am optimistic that they will impose realistic fines of up to £1,000, which is what will be allowed at District Court level.  I believe they will impose various levels of fines depending on the seriousness of the offence.  It was the case <Col N="1199" /> in the past that pollution and environmental offences generally were not taken seriously in many areas of Irish life, but with this legislation together with the changes in public awareness, I think we will see changes in that direction too.</P>
    <P>In view of the comments made by Deputy Shatter, I will seek the advice of the Attorney General on this point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her constructive response.  I find it very difficult to understand how the Attorney General's Office could reach the conclusion that £1,000 is the constitutional magical sum beyond which the District Court cannot impose a fine.  The only constitutional constraints are that the court is a court of limited and local jurisdiction. The court can order damages up to the tune of £2,500 in this legislation as compensation for carrying out remedial works and can do so in a wide variety of other legislation.  I really do not see any constitutional difficulty in the fine being brought up to £2,500.</P>
      <P>I invite the Minister to look with a certain degree of scepticism at any advice she may get that suggests a fine of £2,500 imposed by the District Court would create any constitutional difficulty.  The Minister might also inquire whether there is any other legislation in existence under which the District Court can impose fines of up to £2,500.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make one brief point.  Where the polluter has to pay the costs awarded by the court, that is compensating the community for the injury done to them, but the penalties fall into a different category.  They are penalties for breaking the law.  I think this distinction is important.  I think the penalty should reflect the injury done to the community.  However, I withdraw my amendment at this stage pending Report Stage when the Minister will come back to it having reviewed the situaton in the light of Deputy Shatter's remarks.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 11, between lines 40 and 41, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  the deletion of `shall' and substitution therefor of `may' in subsection (2).</P>
      <P>(b)  the insertion in subsection (2) of the following paragraph&mdash;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(d)  require the person to or on whom the notice is served to submit in writing to the local authority concerned&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  maps, plans, drawings or photographs showing the location, nature, extent and condition of any facilities for the collection, storage, treatment or disposal of the effluent or other polluting matter and any other premises from which polluting matter may enter water, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  such other particulars as may be specified in the notice of the matters aforesaid, including particulars of the arrangements, systems and methods in use or proposed for the disposal of the effluent or other polluting matter, and of the times and rates at which such disposal is effected.&rsquo;,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The first part of my amendment deals with section 12 of the Principal Act.  Section 12 (2) of the Principal Act, the Local Government (Water Polution) Act, 1977 states:</P>
      <P>A notice under this section shall</P>
      <P>(a)  specify the measures...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1201" /> (b)  direct the person on whom the notice is served to take such measures as are specified in the notice, and,</P>
    <P>(c)  specify a period within which such measures are to be taken.</P>
    <P>I want to address what is essentially a technical problem, which I have heard about from people who deal with the Act in the field and have the problem of serving section 12 notices on polluters. Under section 23 of the Principal Act it is possible to seek information from a polluter but there is no provision in either section 12, or section 23, to obtain information from a potential polluter.  In practice, if a local authority want to serve a section 12 notice and are not in a position to get by way of right information that is required regarding a certain type of operation, for example, the number of animals or the type of effluent disposal facilities that are there already &mdash; it is very difficult to get a section 12 notice right; in other words, that is that the section 12 notice would deal specifically with the problem that is there.  In my county, the experience has been that some farmers would wish to have a section 12 served upon them, and there is a reason for this.  Under Statutory Instrument 348/84 development on foot of a section 12 notice is exempt from planning permission.  I believe that Statutory Instrument was brought in for a very good reason that is, that a problem could be dealt with rapidly and the need to go through the planning process could be set to one side.  However, the problem with a section 12 notice is that it will give a technical direction as to how a particular problem of effluent should be dealt with but it does not have to conform with planning considerations, in other words it could be aesthetically inappropriate in a high amenity area.</P>
    <P>In order that section 12 of the Principal Act can be operated much more effectively by the local authorities, I am seeking in my amendment that the local authorities do not have to serve the notice, in other words, that the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is changed to &ldquo;may&rdquo;and the local authority <Col N="1202" /> can seek information from the polluter or potential polluter.  If the local authority have reason to believe that a particular operation has the potential for major pollution, they should be in a position to obtain full and absolute information regarding the enterprise.  The local authorities for instance can, require information under notice served under section 23 of the Principal Act, but this means that two managers' orders have to be signed, and I believe there are some legal difficulties here.  I am looking for more flexibility in terms of section 12 of the Principal Act so that local authorities can enter into consultations with potential polluters but, more importantly, can obtain all the information which is relevant to the section 12 notice.</P>

      <P>I believe that the case of the Tallaght Two, Meleady and Grogan, constitutes a miscarriage of justice.  I have practised law in this country for upwards of 35 years and in that period I have never said or felt that about any other case.  We have a very fine legal system which in 99.9 per cent of cases works extremely well, but there does happen the very rare case where something goes amiss.  I believe this is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1203" /> This issue has been a source of tremendous tragedy for a number of families, not least that of Mr. Eamon Gavin whose car was stolen on that night in 1984.  Mr. Gavin was brought to Rathfarnham District Court by the gardai to carry out an identification.  He carried out an identification there of two young people, Meleady and Grogan, who were sitting in an anteroom to the court.  I believe Mr. Gavin genuinely believes that he made a correct identification and I do not doubt his bona fides for one minute.  I know that he and his family have suffered grievously as a result of what happened to him that night and since, but it has to be said also that the families of Meleady and Grogan have suffered tragically and grievously as a result of these incidents.</P>
    <P>I always thought it strange and unacceptable that the normal identification procedures were not gone through when these two young men were suspected, as apparently they were, by the Garda.  The normal procedure is to conduct an identification parade in the normal manner but for some reason that was never done in this case.  That is one of the unsatisfactory things about it.</P>
    <P>The other is that three other young men have admitted to being the persons in the car that night.  Normally people do not admit to a serious offence of that nature but three other people have admitted to it.</P>
    <P>The matter was the subject of an exhaustive examination by RTE, who devoted an entire &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme to the subject.  I passed a video tape of that programme to the Minister and I hope he has had or will have an opportunity of looking at it.  I find it strange too that the authorities, when they knew that the programme was about to be put out, went before the President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Hamilton, and sought to obtain an injunction to restrain its being shown.  Mr. Justice Hamilton refused the application and the programme was broadcast.</P>
    <P>After the court hearing new fingerprint evidence came to light which was consistent with the story given by the three <Col N="1204" /> people who admitted to being in the car that night, not Meleady and Grogan.  I believe that a miscarriage of justice has taken place here and that while Mr. Gavin suffered as he did &mdash; his car was stolen and he was attacked while on it and so on &mdash; it was not Meleady and Grogan who perpetrated that act.  The Minister no doubt will tell us that they were found guilty by a court on two occasions.  That is correct.  I would remind the Minister that we have had the example of the Guildford Four recently and that they also were found guilty by a court and courts.  There are many similarities between that situation and this one.  The authorities in the UK, to their credit, took it upon themselves to recognise that something had gone wrong in the administration of justice in that case and they did something about it.  That required a tremendous act of strength on their part and I would beseech the Minister to show the same strength in the case of the Tallaght Two.</P>
    <P>What can be done?  I know that the Minister does not have the power as the law stands to refer the matter back to the courts.  That is a regrettable shortcoming in our legal system.  I accept that the Minister does not have that power, but there are other things he can do.  First of all, he could release Joseph Meleady who is in prison at this time with some fair period still to run on his sentence.  Joseph Meleady has suffered enough, as have his family.  I have not time here to go into the history of what happened.</P>
    <P>The second thing the Minister could do would be to publish the internal Garda report which was commissioned, conducted and prepared by senior Garda officials.  That was completed some two years ago and its findings have never been released or made public.  A copy of the report apparently got into the hands of RTE and details of it were broadcast on a programme.  One of the findings of the report was that there are certain aspects of this case that warrant further investigation. Why has that report never been published?  It should be published now.</P>
    <P>The Minister could move a motion in this House to have a full judicial enquiry <Col N="1205" /> conducted into this entire unfortunate affair.  I call on the Minister to do those three things &mdash; to release Joseph Meleady from custody immediately, by reason of the unusual circumstances of this case, to publish the Garda report and to move a motion in this House, which I am sure would have all-party support, to set up a judicial enquiry.</P>
    <P>It takes great strength of mind to admit that a mistake has been made and that justice has not been done in a particular case.  Many authorities at the highest level would regard that as an issue of weakness but I say the reverse would be true.  The British authorities in the case of the Guildford Four showed tremendous couarge and strength in saying that they have a fine judicial system but occasionally it goes wrong and they recognised that fact.</P>
    <P>I would beseech the Minister to look at the RTE video on this case and to accept that it has been very well known in Tallaght for years that these two young men are innocent of these crimes.  Many people have confirmed this, including student organisations and a number of nuns who have been identified with the case and know the story from children in Tallaght.  They have all given it as their firm opinion, from knowledge of Tallaght on the ground, that these are innocent people.</P>
    <P>An article in <i>Magill</i> summed this up in August 1988 when Mr. Frank Connolly stated that the story of the Tallaght Two is a tragedy, an unhappy cycle of broken families, heartache and imprisonment. That is the sum of it and I would beseech the Minister to show leniency on this occasion, having regard to the overwhelming doubt about their guilt, and to release them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Taylor has put the case very well.  He has been working on it a lot longer than I.  Since I took up the matter I am equally convinced that there has been a grave miscarriage of justice.  It is very easy here for us to talk about the Maguire case, the Guildford Four and the Birmingham Six but when it comes a bit closer to home in this case <Col N="1206" /> and in the Nicky Kelly case it is not so easy.  I would ask the Minister to recognise that sometimes the law can be wrong.  This is clearly a case where this is so and I would ask the Minister to review the case in the most appropriate manner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate the genuineness of the concern which has been expressed about this case, there are some basic points about it to which I, as Minister for Justice, must have particular regard.</P>
      <P>In May 1985 both Joseph Meleady and Joseph Grogan were found guilty by a jury at the Central Criminal Court.  Subsequently a Paul McDonnell gave evidence to the Court of Criminal Appeal to the effect that he had been in the car on the night of the offence and that Meleady and Grogan had not.  On the basis of this evidence a retrial was ordered.  At the retrial in November 1985, Paul McDonnell, for whatever reason, was not called by the defence.  In any event, the second jury found Meleady and Grogan guilty.  McDonnell was tried for perjury.  At the first hearing the jury could not agree but at a second hearing a new jury found McDonnell guilty.</P>
      <P>When imposing sentence on McDonnell the judge referred to the fact that this had been the fourth time that all the evidence in the Meleady and Grogan case had been brought before the courts and that three juries of ordinary men and women had listened to all the facts and arguments in properly conducted courts of law and had decided as to the guilt of Meleady and Grogan and also in McDonnell's case.  He had heard and read many comments in the media regarding this case and asked that it now be put to rest for good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In May 1988 the then Minister for Justice rejected a petition which had been made in the case of Joseph Grogan.  The basis of the petition was to the effect that Grogan had been wrongfully convicted and that the Minister should release him. The Minister declined to deal with an identical petition made in the case of Joseph Meleady as he was unlawfully at <Col N="1207" /> large at the time.  As the House will be aware, Meleady was only recently returned to custody.</P>
    <P>Suggestions that there had been a miscarriage of justice in the case arose at a relatively early stage, received widespread media publicity and were directly in issue in the retrial and the perjury case. As I have already said, two juries have found Meleady and Grogan guilty and the verdict in the perjury case was consistent with that.</P>
    <P>I must refer in passing to the contribution of the two Deputies.  I know that neither would want to suggest that the police had acted improperly in this case, as distinct from the Guildford case where the police in the UK had been found to have fitted up the Guildford Four.  I know that is not suggested by Deputy Taylor; I acknowledge that the Deputy is nodding his agreement with what I am saying.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances I do not consider that a public inquiry into this case could be warranted.  I am not satisfied that any new evidence has been adduced in this case which would provide any grounds for reasonably assuming that the verdicts of the three juries were wrong and, accordingly, I do not propose to authorise a release in this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>To stave off the threatened closure of the zoo we are asking the Minister and indeed, the Taoiseach who has commented, to change their hard faced uncompromising attitude and to <Col N="1208" /> rescue this beloved national institution. Towards the aim of saving the zoo, our party are making a modest proposal to solve the immediate crisis, which would cost very little.  We are proposing that the Government make an interest free loan of £500,000 to the Zoological Society to tide them over this immediate crisis. Unless action is taken now the zoo will close before 1 April, well ahead even of the expected first or interim report in April of the committee of experts set up by the Government to report and make recommendations on the future financing of the zoo.</P>
      <P>The crisis is now so acute that unless the Government do what they are asked and put in train our suggestion no later than tomorrow, the zoo will close because the bank who acts as the society's treasurer will not honour cheques issued by the zoo authorities after 17 March. The appeal for public funds will not yield anything like the desired amount to assure the bank.  The Taoiseach's intemperate dismissive comments on the plight of the zoo in a newspaper last Sunday were most unhelpful to the fund raising drive by public appeal.  Since these events must happen in the inevitable run of things unless the Government act in the meantime, the director of the zoo will not have the money to feed the animals or to pay the wages and salaries of the 50 staff who keep the enclosures and grounds.</P>
      <P>Ahead of this, plans have to be and are being made to effect some kind of orderly closure of the zoo with the dispersal of the 800 species of animals and birds, some to other zoos, and almost unthinkable, half of the animals and other creatures will have to be destroyed.  These are the bald facts.  There is nothing hypothetical, there is no supposition in what I have said.  They are the bare facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have had plenty of time to address the problem before allowing it to come to this sorry pass.  In October 1988 the Zoological Society made a detailed report on the serious financial vulnerability of the zoo.  No action was taken until May 1989 when the committee of experts was set up, but <Col N="1209" /> the committee were given no terms of reference or instruction to commence work until October 1989, and that only after the society had sent another detailed report on the dire situation.  It has been known for years that the zoo was not generating from its own resources enough money to pay staff and to keep the animals fed.  We know that the Government came to the rescue in 1985 with £250,000 and that two lots of lottery funding were given in 1987 and in 1989. These funds went to write off deficits and debts already accumulated.</P>
    <P>We know that every worthwhile national and regional zoo in Europe, America, Australia and everywhere else, receives public funding.  We need look no further than Belfast Zoo for an example. They receive £500,000 annually to fund maintainance costs plus a variable annual grant to cover all their capital costs in any one year.  In the past decade this combination of State support for Belfast Zoo has meant that that zoo has received in excess of £10 million from the British Government or its agencies.  Our proposals go nowhere near being so generous or so open-ended.  We merely propose a fire brigade action to stop closure now. We are fully aware &mdash; as the Minister is &mdash; that the Government's commission of experts, who cannot finalise their work until at least June, have recommended publicly through their chairman that the Government give Dublin Zoo £250,000 immediately to forestall closure even before their first interim report on the crisis.</P>
    <P>Dublin Zoo is the third oldest zoo in the world, only the zoos of Paris and London are older.  They have a highly valued collection of animals, birds and aquatic creatures, many of them rare and endangered species.  It is a truly national institution and loved by Dubliners; 160 years qualifies it to be part of our national heritage.  It would be unthinkable to let it close.  Whether it lives or dies is in the Minister's hands and we ask her to act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Connor, the shadow spokesman for the Office of Public Works who are the <Col N="1210" /> owners of the zoo land.  I also support his urgent plea to highlight the fact that this is not a fake or exaggerated crisis as the Taoiseach seemed to think a few days ago.  This will come to a head unless immediate relief is given to the zoo.</P>
      <P>It is right that a working party should have been set up to look at the future of the zoo and how it might be improved. However, the position is so urgent that it cannot await even the interim report of the working party expected in April. Money is needed now and if the Minister and the Government cannot, in advance of the report of the working party, rise to giving the zoo a grant from the national lottery or some other source, they should advance an interest free loan to tide them over until the report is received.  That is an eminently reasonable proposal and I do not see why the Government could not do so as an interim solution to an urgent problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The zoo happens to be in my constituency but it is a national institution, it is treasured by all people, most of whom have had the pleasure of visiting it over the years.  It has given them great pleasure and continues to give pleasure to tens of thousands of children each year. The zoo should not be closed, it should be extended.  There was an application some years ago for extra land within the Phoenix Park but it was rejected by the Office of Public Works.  That suggestion should now be considered because the 30 acres of the zoo are insufficient to house even their present collection of animals and other creatures.  Many people consider that the animals in the zoo do not have enough space, there is more than enough space available in the open air surroundings of the Phoenix Park.  I do not think that even the most avid conservationist or protectors of the Phoenix Park would object if extra acres, immediately adjacent to the zoo, were incorporated in it to give the animals extra space.  However, that is a secondary issue tonight.  The purpose of this debate and for calling a busy Minister back to the House so late at night is to appeal to her to take action very quickly.  If they cannot <Col N="1211" /> give the zoo a grant they should consider an interest free loan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke) Mary O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I never thought, when I became Minister for Education, that I would be answerable for the zoo.  Of course, primary responsibility for the zoo rests with the Royal Zoological Society of Ireland.  Their objectives are the maintenance, exhibition, study for educational purposes of all species of living animals, the promotion of the study and knowledge of zoology and the cultivation of an interest in the conservation of animals.  The area occupied by the zoo in the Phoenix Park is held by the society under licence from the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>The involvement of my Department is that they are used simply as a channel through which funds are paid to the society.  Prior to 1985 small State grants of between £2,000 and £5,000 per annum were paid through the Department of Education.  In 1985, because of the zoo's serious financial position, a special grant of £250,000 was paid.  The Members opposite will remember that the then Deputy Hussey was Minister for Education and, as far as I remember, there was an arrangement about school trips to the zoo either free or at a reduced rate.  In 1987 I was approached by the president and the director of the zoo, a submission was made to the Government and another £250,000 was paid to them.  On that occasion I met Mr. Wilson and Mr. Cooke of the zoo and they told me categorically that that would be the last State money they would need because they had a dramatic economic plan to put into operation, the details of which they gave me and which I submitted to Government. They were confident that matters would work out satisfactorily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1989 the Government gave another £250,000 to the zoo with the proviso that the Royal Zoological Society allow a committee who were being set up to fully investigate all the activities of what is essentially a private society.  The zoo also had their own method of raising income such as membership subscriptions, gate <Col N="1212" /> admissions, sponsorship and income from their restaurant and shop facilities.</P>
    <P>Arising essentially from the sociey's serious financial position the Government set up a committee.  Their terms of reference are: (a) to recommend on the future operation of Dublin Zoo, the approach to the keeping and caring of animals and related matters, taking account of any proposed EC legislation in the area; (b) to review the financial operation of the zoo with respect to income from all sources, including sponsorship, and expenditure; (c) to assess how the zoo can be made financially viable without public subvention and to recommend on the steps necessary to bring about the maximum possible financial viability; (d) to meet or receive submissions from interested parties and bodies regarding the operation of the zoo and (e) such other issues as may be relevant to the future operation of Dublin Zoo.</P>
    <P>The members of the committee have wide professional expertise.  The chairman, Mr. Michael Doyle, is a veterinary consultant and the other members are Mr. George Eaton, of Eaton Down, chartered accountants, Mr. Nicholas Jackson, chairman of the Conservation and Animal Management Committee of the Welsh Mountain Zoo and Mr. Noel Pearson, chairman of the Abbey Theatre.  Each was chosen for his particular expertise and the committee are working very well.  They meet regularly to pursue their task and are considering the publication of an interim report in April and then a final report later.</P>
    <P>The committee have sought submissions from a wide spectrum of individuals and institutions and they have also appointed a professional market research organisation to establish on a scientific basis what the Irish public want from a zoo.</P>
    <P>The Committee expect to be in a position to furnish a detailed report by 1 May 1990 and the question of further State aid will be considered in the context of their findings.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 1 March 1990.</P>

      <P>The report refers to delays on a number of projects, in EC member states, which are being assisted from EC special transport infrastructure grants including the three by-passes at Wexford, Shankill/Bray and Dunleer.  My Department issued its response to this aspect of the report in December last.</P>
      <P>The estimated total cost of these three schemes is £51.6 million.  The transport infrastructural grants committed for these schemes is £7.1 million, of which £3.5 million has been advanced to date. Total expenditure on these schemes up to the end of 1989 was £14.4 million.</P>
      <P>Wexford by-pass was approved by the EC Commission for EC transport infrastructure grant assistance in 1984.  Most of the work on the by-pass was completed by the end of 1986.  Work on the balance of the project could not commence until 1986 because of protracted land acquisition difficulties.  The full by-pass was opened for traffic in 1988 and all outstanding works were completed in 1989.</P>

    <P>Bray/Shankill and Dunleer by-passes were approved for transport infrastructure grant assistance in 1985 and 1986, respectively.

      <P>In accordance with section 9 of the Housing Act, 1988 each housing authority undertook an assessment of the need for the provision of local authority accommodation within its area on 30 September 1989.  In making such assessments, housing authorities were required, <i>inter alia</i>, to have regard to the need for housing of persons who are living in accommodation that is unfit for human habitation or is materially unsuitable for their adequate accommodation <Col N="987" /> or who are living in overcrowded conditions.</P>
      <P>I have no reason to believe that Dublin Corporation failed to carry out their assessment in a proper manner in accordance with the required procedures.</P>

      <P>In August 1989 the European Commission, acting under Article 169 of the Treaty, requested the Irish authorities to submit observations on matters with respect to compliance with Council Directive 80/779/EEC on air quality limit values and guide values for sulphur dioxide and suspended particulates.  A response was sent to the Commission in October 1989.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 70 and 73 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statement which I am having circulated in the Official Report sets out the details of each housing authority's assessment of housing needs at 30 September, 1989.  In 1990, approximately 1,200 dwellings will be added to the local authority housing stock.  Each authority has been notified of its approved number of new `starts', including purchases of private houses, and it is now a matter for <Col N="990" /> the authorities to decide which schemes/dwellings they wish to commence/purchase during the year.  I expect that the number of houses becoming available during the year.  I expect that the number of houses becoming available during the year for letting by authorities including an estimated 3,800 casual vacancies, will be sufficient to meet acute housing needs in 1990 and accordingly I do not accept that there is a risk of returning to a housing crisis situation.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the report of the National Council for the Aged published in June 1989.  The council are an advisory body to the Minister for Health and consideration of any recommendations in the report would, therefore, be primarily a matter for his Department in the first instance.</P>
      <P>However, in so far as projects being carried out by approved bodies under my Department's voluntary housing scheme are concerned, the cost of the provision of accommodation within such projects for communal use is reckoned as part of the overall cost of the project on the basis of which the grant is determined subject to the maximum of £20,000 for each unit of accommodation provided in the complex. Other assistance for such projects in the form of health and welfare support services is a matter for the Minister for Health.  The cost of the ongoing management of a complex is the responsibility of the approved body concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 49 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Global warming, or the &ldquo;greenhouse effect&rdquo;, is a global problem and requires international action if it is to be solved. The Toronto Declaration referred to in Question No. 49 relates to a conference of non-governmental organisations held in Toronto in 1988, which, <i>inter alia,</i> called for the development of an action plan for the protection of the atmosphere <Col N="1014" /> and made recommendations to Governments for specific action in a number of areas.  In dealing with this global problem, the European Community has a vital role to play and has developed an action plan in a European context for dealing with the issue.  The Commission is currently preparing proposals for action by the Community in relation to climate change, and Ireland will seek to use its Presidency of the Community to ensure that a strong position is adopted on this issue, particularly in the lead up to the Second World Conference on Climate Change, to be held next November and which will consider appropriate global response measures.</P>
    <P>Carbon dioxide emissions account for about 50 per cent of &ldquo;greenhouse gases&rdquo; and energy conservation is considered to be the most effective short-term contribution the developed world can make towards reducing these emissions.  At national level, a number of initiatives are being taken in this regard.  The Government's environment action programme announced that an additional £500,000 will be made available to the Department of Energy this year for a major energy conservation programme, and I understand that that Department is currently considering the format for such a campaign, with a view to its introduction at an early date.</P>
    <P>I understand also that the Department of Energy is currently carrying out energy audits on departmental and Eolas buildings to ensure that these are energy efficient and it is hoped that the benefits demonstrated will encourage other State and semi-State bodies to introduce appropriate energy efficient management. That Department has also targeted for audit the medium-sized industrial sectors which consume over 50 per cent of industrial energy, namely the food, drinks and chemical industries.</P>
    <P>As announced in the environment action programme, thermal insulation standards and the range of buildings to which they apply will be reviewed with a view to further reducing the amount of energy consumed on space heating.</P>
    <P>Apart from these energy conservation <Col N="1015" /> measures, the use of natural gas to meet part of our energy requirements has already meant that CO emissions in this country are not as great as they would otherwise be.</P>
    <P>Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) account for another 20 &mdash; 25 per cent of the greenhouse effect and Ireland is participating in international action to reduce production and consumption of these substances through the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer.  The protocol contains measures to control the production and use of the more destructive CFCs and halons and was concluded in 1987.  Proposals to further strengthen the Montreal Protocol are currently being developed and will be considered when the parties to the protocol meet in London next June.  At that meeting, the Irish Presidency will work towards a strengthening of the protocol, with the aim of achieving the elimination of the production and use of CFCs and halons as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The Government has also, in the environmental action programme, set aside a sum of £200,000 in 1990 for the purpose of commissioning expert studies to establish the specific implications of possible climate change for Ireland.  Proposals in this regard are being developed. The studies will enable the development of further appropriate response measures and strategies.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the funding of <Col N="1016" /> road works at this location rests with Kerry County Council.  The council may, at its own discretion, deploy funding from within the discretionary grants for regional and county roads allocated by my Department to meet the cost of works on the road in question.</P>
      <P>The discretionary grants notified to the local authority for 1990 amount to £3,023,000.  This represents an increase of £600,000, or 25 per cent, compared with the road grant provisions under the equivalent headings in 1989.  I do not propose to make special road grant assistance available to the local authority in this case.</P>

      <Quest>if he proposes to increase on a pro-rata basis the current limit of £20,000 capital assistance per dwelling unit under the 1984 scheme of capital assistance for non-profit and voluntary housing, having regard to the additional costs and changes which have taken place since 1985 when the sum of £20,000 was fixed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The development of the voluntary housing scheme is closely monitored and changes are and will be made as they become necessary.  The increase in the 1990 provision for the scheme to £9.275 million, as compared to £6.6 million last year, reflects the current high level of demand under the scheme and is indicative of the continuing effectiveness and adequacy of the existing grants. While I will keep the matter under review I am satisfied that at present an increase in the grant limits is not a prerequisite to continued growth in the voluntary housing sector.</P>

      <P>Small public service vehicles may be licensed as either public hire or private hire vehicles.</P>
      <P>Public hire operations (by taxis or cabs) are limited to specified areas.  As the operation of such vehicles is based on their availability &ldquo;on street&rdquo;, it is considered that some form of identification of these vehicles is necessary.  In the case of taxis, a standard roof sign must be displayed which comprises the word &ldquo;taxi&rdquo;, licence number and a section which may be used for advertising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Operators of private hire vehicles (i.e. hackneys) are prohibited by public service vehicle regulations from displaying any sign, advertising or telephone number on their vehicle which relates to the service they give.  This service is essentially private in nature and depends on prior agreement between client and <Col N="1028" /> operator.  Unlike public hire operators, private hirings are not subject to geographical restrictions.</P>

      <P>&mdash;the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Licensing) Regulations, 1978; and</P>
      <P>&mdash;the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations, 1989.</P>
      <P>In summary, these regulations require that buses, when used in a public place, be constructed and loaded safely and be roadworthy.  Buses must be road-worthiness tested annually.  In the case of bus drivers, a higher standard of fitness, both mental and physical, is required.</P>

      <P>The rehousing of the tenants is a matter for the local authority.  Funding will be provided, as necessary, by the Government as part of the public capital programme.  Last May, I asked the corporation to prepare an outline plan to provide for the rehousing of the tenants in the locality, and to the greatest extent possible within the parish of St. Laurence O'Toole, with the long term and elderly tenants getting special consideration in this regard.  I also stressed to the housing authority that close contact should be maintained with the local community and I requested the city manager to designate a suitable senior officer who would have the necessary skills to interact successfully with the local community.</P>
      <P>The plan requested is awaited.  Nevertheless, I have set aside in this year's housing capital allocation to the corporation, £1 million to enable them to commence the construction of, and/or purchase, 60 houses in the programme for the housing of the residents.  I am satisfied that the allocation should be sufficient to meet expenditure on the programme this year.  It is a matter for the housing authority to formulate and submit to my Department the plan and the particular proposals in order to get this programme under way.</P>

      <P>The percentage of turnover spent on exporting/transporting products to the home market and to foreign markets can vary greatly depending on the product being transported, e.g. high volume, low value products and low volume, high value products and on the mode of transport i.e. surface or air freight.  Statistical data is not available on the overall percentage of turnover spent by Irish industry and transporting its goods to and from foreign markets or within the domestic market.</P>
      <P>Both public and private sector bodies have, however, on occasion made estimates of the percentage cost of transporting goods to export markets. Government thinking on this issue is contained in the National Development Plan of March 1989 which stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is estimated that transport costs for Irish exporters to Europe account <Col N="1038" /> for between 9% and 10% of export sales values and that these costs are approximately twice that incurred by Community countries trading with one another on the European mainland. This cost penalty applies to the great bulk of Ireland's international trade &mdash; not only export but also imports of materials and capital goods.</P>

      <P>The European Court of Justice has ruled that legislation requiring a declaration of the state of origin of a product on the product or accompanying package, which in this case would be coal sold in either sealed or unsealed bags, would be in breach of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
      <P>There is no legislation which requires that coal be packed in sealed bags or that a statement of the net or gross weight be declared on the bag, whether sealed or unsealed.</P>
      <P>However, where coal is sold by retail the weights and measures legislation requires that a weighting instrument verified and stamped by an inspector of weights and measures be kept at or near the premises and the seller shall weigh any coal on the stamped weighing instrument if so required by the purchaser or an inspector of weights and measures.</P>
      <P>Also it is an offence, under section 39 of the Restrictive Practices Act, 1987, for anyone to sell or offer for sale a quantity less than that which is purported to be sold or offered for sale.</P>

      <P>The basis for the May 1988 Government decision was a report entitled <i>Designation of Areas for Industrial Policy</i> produced by the National Economic and Social Council (NESC) in September 1985 which recommended objective criteria for determining the areas to be designated.  The NESC report, No. 81, September 1985, was published and is available from the Government Publications Sale Office, or directly from the National Economic and Social Council.</P>
      <P>An analysis was commissioned from the ESRI to determine on an independent basis the actual areas which merited designation under the NESC criteria and was for the information of my Department only.  Accordingly, I do not propose to publish it.</P>

      <P>I introduced the social welfare diary for the first time in 1989.  The diary contains useful references on social welfare services as well as the normal diary material in standard format.  It is intended to help in the task of getting information to people on their social welfare entitlements and is made available widely to public representatives, community information centres, social workers and other organisations which provide such information.  The diaries have proved most useful and have been the subject of much favourable comment.</P>
      <P>The diary includes as standard material a considerable amount of general information, including maps of four cities, namely, Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway.  The possibility of including additional material, for example additional maps, in the diary would be limited by space constraints but the Deputy's concern in this regard will be brought to the attention of the supplier.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit on 5 February 1990.

On 26 February 1990, he forwarded a form P.60 certifying that he had paid 52 reckonable contributions for that year. This has now enabled him to be awarded disability benefit at the rate of £95.80 per week, which is the rate appropriate to a person with an adult dependant and two child dependants.</P>

      <P>Payment of benefit to the person concerned was disallowed from 3 November 1989 following an examination by a medical referee who considered the claimant to be capable of work.  The claimant expressed dissatisfaction with this decision and was further examined on 11 January 1990 by a different medical referee, who also considered her to be capable of work.</P>

In general terms, telecommunications charges for business users in Ireland are comparable with the average of corresponding charges in other EC countries.  Irish business users will benefit in particular from price reductions of between 20 per cent and 71 per cent for digital private circuits recently announced by Telecom Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the newspaper article referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I regret that the article gives the erroneous impression that the only kind of ante-natal service available to pregnant women is hospital based.  The primary responsibility for the care of pregnant women rests with the general practitioner service through the operation of the maternity and infant scheme and I must emphasise that there has not been any reduction in the level of this service.  This service is provided for expectant mothers and also for infants up to six weeks of age free of charge to medical card holders and persons in category II eligibility for hospital services which is about 85 per cent of expectant mothers and their infants.  Normally mothers choose their own general practitioner and make at least six visits before confinement and two visits afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to hospital based ante-natal services, I do not accept the statements quoted in the article to which the Deputy refers.  Particular care has been taken to ensure that all maternity units are in a position to provide the highest possible <Col N="1048" /> standard of care for both mothers and babies.  The primary consideration in the location of units is to ensure that each unit has a minimum throughput which will justify the provision of the sophisticated range of staff and facilities required to deal with those at risk and to give reassurance to those who may be experiencing difficulties in their pregnancy or delivery.</P>
    <P>In addition to providing hospital based services, two of the Dublin maternity hospitals provide outpatient clinics in outlying areas.  Health boards also provide similar services for expectant mothers.  I understand there have been no reductions in these clinics.  The Tallaght ante-natal clinics organised by the Coombe Hospital in association with the Eastern Health Board will be re-established very shortly.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment on some other points mentioned in the same article.</P>
    <P>The impression is given that mothers are now being discharged from hospital 48 hours after giving birth.  The position is that some hospitals do discharge mothers after 48 hours but only in cases of a second or subsequent birth or where the mother requests to be discharged.  There is no question of any mother being discharged after 48 hours where complications have occurred or until such time as the consultant involved deems her fit to be discharged.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence available to my Department of any increase in post-natal depression.  There has been no reduction in the number of public health nurses providing post-natal care.</P>
    <P>I am saddened by the apparent readiness of a few members of the nursing profession to provide grounds for a diminution of confidence in a service which consistently produces excellent results and has contributed so much to the health and wellbeing of both mothers and babies.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the interest expressed by a chiropodist (details supplied) from Northern Ireland in assisting, on a voluntary and unpaid basis, in the training of chiropodists from the Republic; if, in view of the fact that the professional body for chiropodists in the UK of which he is a member has determined that it would be a breach of their professional rules for him to offer educational or training services without the sanction of his Department he will consider inviting him to assist in the training and education of chiropodists from the Republic; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I am aware of the interest expressed by the chiropodist concerned in assisting in the training and education of chiropodists here.  At present, a body, the Chiropodists Assessment and Advisory Committee, regulate standards for chiropody pertaining to chiropodists appointments in the public health service. These standards are underpinned by my Department recognising a number of chiropody training colleges all of which are located in Great Britain with one other located in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An appropriate mechanism to assess all interested and practising chiropodists as to their competence to provide services for public patients and the future regulations of chiropodists, including their training, is the subject of a report prepared by a Chiropody Review Group <Col N="1051" /> comprised of nominees of chiropody representative bodies and medical and health administrative personnel.  This report, which I understand will contain recommendations on revising current recognised chiropody training standards, will be presented to me shortly.</P>

      <P>The development of hospital services in County Clare is a matter for the Mid-Western Health Board in the first instance.</P>
      <P>In relation to acute hospital services the health board have decided that these services should continue to be provided at Ennis General Hospital.  This decision was taken following a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors and taking into account the extent to which Limerick Regional Hospital provides services for the Clare area.</P>
      <P>With regard to the psychiatric service the health board are developing these services in County Clare along the lines recommended in the report <i>Planning for the Future.</i> This involves the replacement of the traditional institutional based service at Our Lady's Hospital, Ennis, by a comprehensive community based psychiatric service.  Day hospitals have been established at Kilrush, Ennis and Ennistymon which catered for 208 persons in 1989.  A 30 place day centre is operating at Friary Hall, Ennis, and Dulick Enterprise Centre at Our Lady's Hospital provides workshop facilities for 30 people. In addition the health board have nine hostels with 56 places in various locations in County Clare.</P>

I understand that the board will be submitting their plans to my Department in the near future.</P>
      <P>The Southern Health Board are at present funding 578 extended care beds for the elderly in Cork city.  This figure excludes acute beds for the elderly and private beds in voluntary and private nursing homes.  It also excludes extended care beds in Cork county which are availed of by residents of Cork city.</P>
      <P>The Government are committed to improving services for the elderly.  An additional allocation of £5 million was made available in the budget in addition to the moneys already allocated this year to develop home and community support for the elderly as recommended in <i>The Years Ahead.</i> Health boards will be informed of their share of the additional funds shortly.  As a result of this funding, the Southern Health Board will be able to make considerable progress towards achieving their priorities in services for the elderly this year.</P>

      <P>It is not correct to say that no dental service has been available in recent years in the Southern Health Board.  Dental services on the basis of priority categories have been provided by the board as follows: the relief of pain and sepsis; persons who are handicapped or medically at risk; national school children; adolescent dependants of medical card holders and medical card holders and their adult dependants.</P>
      <P>The board provide dental services for children in Cork city on the basis of the routine screening of children in first, third and sixth classes in the national schools. Where treatment is needed it is carried out in one of the dental clinics.  In 1989, 14 dental surgeons were engaged in the provision of dental treatment in Cork city.</P>
      <P>The community care committee are currently examining a report on the dental services in the Southern Health Board which outlines measures necessary to bring about an improvement to the services throughout the board.</P>
      <P>In addition the Southern Health Board will benefit from the apportionment of the £3 million additional funds provided in the budget to bring about an improvement in adult dental services and in orthodontic services.</P>

    <P>A teacher is eligible for the award of a retirement pension and lump sum provided that he/she:</P>
    <P>(a)  has reached 55 years of age and has at least 35 years of pensionable service, or</P>
    <P>(b)  has reached 60 years of age and has at least five years of pensionable service, or</P>
    <P>(c)  has completed at least five years of pensionable service, and satisfies the Minister and the Minister for Finance that while serving he/she has become incapable from infirmity of mind or body of discharging the duties of a teacher and that such infirmity is likely to be permanent.</P>
    <P>Teachers with at least five years of pensionable service, who retire without immediate eligibility to pension, have the option of preserving their pension rights and becoming eligible for a pension and lump sum on reaching 60 years of age.</P>
    <P>Initial pension awards are based on the teachers retiring pensionable salary and the amount of his/her pensionable service, subject to a maximum of 40 years pensionable service, at date of retirement.  Pension and lump sum may be calculated as follows:</P>
    <P>Annual Pension = 1/80 x Retiring Pensionable Salary x Pensionable Service</P>
    <P>Lump Sum = 3/80 x Retiring Pensionable Salary x Pensionable Service</P>
    <P>Currently, rates of pension are increased in line with increases granted to serving teachers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 129 and 131 together.</P>
      <P>The planning section of my Department recently completed a review of post-primary facilities in Cork city and environs based on the most up to date primary and post-primary enrolments.  In the light of that review it is the view of my Department that the provision of a new post-primary school in Riverstown-Glanmire is not warranted at present.</P>
      <P>The question of ordering a further review of the situation regarding a second level school for the area by the Advisory Council on Post-Primary Education in Cork city area does not, therefore, arise. However, my Department will continue to monitor closely the situation as it develops in Riverstown-Glanmire.</P>

      <P>I have been unable to trace any requests from parents of the Riverstown area of Cork to discuss the school transport system for pupils attending the second level schools outside the Riverstown area.  I am satisfied, however, that adequate provision is being made for these pupils in the matter of school transport. Riverstown is in the Cork city catchment area and pupils in the Riverstown area who live at least three miles from their nearest post-primary centre in Cork city are eligible for transport to that centre.  Such pupils may also be allowed transport to the Carrigtwohill-Midleton post-primary centre but only from the boundary of the catchment area of that centre.</P>
