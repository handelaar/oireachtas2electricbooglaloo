    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1454" /> The Government decided last October that, as part of our preparations for the Presidency, the Minister for Tourism and Transport should arrange for the leasing of an additional jet aircraft for the six months of the Irish Presidency of the European Community, subject to the Minister being satisfied that the aircraft could be properly serviced and maintained. It was subsequently agreed after an assessment of the situation by the Minister for Tourism and Transport that a joint committee, representing the Departments of Tourism and Transport and Defence at senior level, should be formed to progress matters.  That committee drafted the specification for the aircraft and assessed tenders which, in accordance with normal practice in the procurement of aircraft for the Air Corps, were sought by the Department of Defence.  Specific financial provision for the costs was made in the Defence Estimate for 1990.</P>
    <P>The Department of Tourism and Transport played the major role in arranging for the aircraft.  This included obtaining initial quotations on the cost range of aircraft available which would meet the Government's requirements. That Department's advice also covered the technical specification, evaluation and acceptance of the aircraft and the leasing arrangements, as well as consultations with a number of persons and organisations with knowledge of executive travel.</P>
    <P>The role of the Department of Defence in effecting the contractual arrangements was clearly implied in my statement to the Dáil on 30 January that the Air Corps would operate the aircraft, while the Department of Tourism and Transport's involvement arises from their responsibility and expertise in civil aviation matters.</P>
    <P>As I said in the Dáil on 30 January, it would be contrary to the well-established practice and the conventions of commercial confidentiality to give a breakdown of the contract price.  I gave the Dáil then the overall cost of operating the aircraft for the six months of the Presidency.  The Minister for Tourism and Transport has <Col N="1455" /> already indicated publicly that no payments by way of commission or fee or any such charge were made to any person or company from public funds in connection with the aircraft.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask first why the Taoiseach did not give such a comprehensive answer on 30 January. May I ask why the Department of Defence are quoted as saying that tendering competition for the lease of the aircraft was done here.  Why is there this apparent discrepancy of view between what the Department of Defence and the Minister for Tourism and Transport are saying?  Why did the Taoiseach on 30 January refuse to confirm that the aircraft now used is not the one that was first sought out because, I am told, the one first sought out had been damaged in some way by a heavy landing in Senegal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I really do not understand what this is all about.  I have given the full details between my answer of 30 January and that of today as to exactly what happened.  In my view the Government very sensibly asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport &mdash; who has more knowledge of these things departmentally than anybody else &mdash; to look into this whole question for us.  He did that, came up with a recommendation which was then processed by the Department of Defence.  I understand there was some statement by the press relations officer in the Department of Defence which was reported in the newspapers but I do not think that what that officer said is in any way in contradiction with what I am saying here.  I am giving the full detailed facts of exactly what happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach again say why he refused to answer the question as to whether the aircraft now used was the first one that was found?  Is it not the case that the first one found &mdash; which the Government were about to take on lease &mdash; had been damaged?  May I also ask the Taoiseach why the information on the leasing cost of the aircraft is being kept a <Col N="1456" /> secret at this stage?  Is it not perfectly in order for this House to know what is the leasing cost and what are the details I have sought?  Why is there secrecy about these?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing secret about them.  The Deputy should know from his own ministerial experience that it is not the practice to give this sort of confidential commercial information.  All I am holding back at present is the actual breakdown.  I have already given the House the full cost &mdash; £1.3 million.  I wanted to do that because of the controversy the Deputy had raised about this matter; I wanted to give that information to the House but, even giving that information is slightly in breach of normal practice in this House over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us have brevity; I want to deal with other questions also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach explain to me what commercial disadvantage would ensue for the company if it were known how much the Government had paid for the aircraft?  Could the Taoiseach tell me what commercial or political disadvantage would ensue for the Government if the Government were to say how much they had paid the company for the aircraft?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know; all I know is that down the years it has been the traditional practice in this House not to disclose confidential commercial details of this kind in respect of organisations or companies who did business with the Government.  As far as I know, that practice is very much in the interests of the Government and the taxpayer, to make sure that they get the best possible value in transactions of this kind.  As I have said, I have departed somewhat from normal practice by giving the House details of the overall cost.</P>

      <P>A very brief question, Deputy Dukes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has not set any new precedent by disclosing the cost to the House because this expenditure would have to be accounted for in the accounts of the Department of Defence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Taoiseach, even if he is not going to give the break-down of the cost of this deal, if it would include details of a payment made either by the Government or by the lessor company to an agent who would find this aircraft?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not, and I think in all honour the Deputy should withdraw suggestions and allegations he has made in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I withdraw nothing.  If there is nothing to be hidden the Taoiseach would do far better for everybody concerned to reveal the information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I told the Deputy before, and the Minister for Tourism and Transport has indicated that no payments of any such kind were made.  In fact, although it is not my business, the corporation which supplied the aircraft has also made a statement to the effect that they did not pay any such fees.</P>

      <Quest>if, arising from his press conference after his recent meeting with President Mitterrand in Paris, he will outline the basis on which he ruled out the possibility of supporting the idea of a united neutral Germany; if he will clarify his reported comments on neutrality and especially his statement that if a country was neutral, you had to ask who it was neutral against; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The right to self-determination is a principle endorsed by the Charter of the United Nations.  In my reply to a question in the House on 13 December last I indicated that Ireland supports German unification and the right of the peoples of the Federal Republic of Germany and of the German Democratic Republic to determine their own future by a free democratic process. I further indicated that this is also the position of the Twelve as affirmed by the Heads of State and Government in Strasbourg.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reports that I have ruled out the idea of a united neutral Germany or the possibility of East German membership of the Community are totally incorrect.  I said nothing of the kind.  I believe, in fact, that it would be foolhardy for anyone to try to lay down hard and fast conditions or objectives in a situation where events <Col N="1460" /> are moving so rapidly and so momentously. What I did indicate was my view that it was unrealistic to contemplate that such a powerful economic and political entity in the middle of Europe as West and East Germany combined, would not influence or affect the course of European affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach saying that the report, which stated that he indicated that neutrality no longer has a validity in the current situation and that one has to ask, if you are neutral, who you are neutral against, was incorrect?  If so, would he make a statement in this House to that effect, that neutrality still has a validity, perhaps an even greater validity in today's world?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to this matter and the matter which will be raised in Question No. 6, would the Taoiseach consider the idea of producing some kind of a White Paper or discussion document on the question of foreign affairs as they affect Ireland at present, in view of the developments that are taking place in Europe, so that this House can be involved in a discussion on these matters and so that we can have an input into what is being decided by Government in relation to our attitude internationally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, a discussion in the House on events in Europe would be useful but I do not think a White Paper would be necessary or effective because events are moving so quickly.  The scene is changing by the day and by the time one would have produced a White Paper it probably would be out of date.  I certainly think we might discuss some time fairly soon the question of having a debate on the whole subject of developments in Europe.</P>

      <P>I take the point that events are moving so fast that it is <Col N="1461" /> difficult enough to keep tabs on what is happening from day to day.  Nevertheless, it is important that we have a statement from Government on the guiding principles that are forming the attitudes of the State in relation to those events.

The question of economic and monetary union between East and West Germany is a very current issue which is being keenly debated both in East Germany <Col N="1463" /> and West Germany and throughout the Community.  What form that economic and monetary union will eventually take remains to be seen.</P>

      <P>It is not the practice to disclose in detail the matters discussed at an official working meeting of this kind. I can, however, tell the Deputy that it was of particular benefit to me, as President of the European Council, coming into that office immediately after President Mitterrand &mdash; a statesman of world renown &mdash; to have the benefit of his views and experience on European and international affairs.  We covered Community issues, developments in Eastern Europe and other major issues of mutual interest and concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>President Mitterrand's proposal for a European Confederation is, of course, one that he will elaborate on himself in due course.  My understanding is that it would involve all European countries who would wish to join, with particular reference to the need to provide the emerging democracies in Eastern Europe with a structured framework in which they could participate in consultation and decision making, as appropriate, with the other European countries on issues of <Col N="1465" /> common interest.  The concept, with its aims of dialogue and stability, is one related to the holding of a meeting of the Heads of Government of the 35 CSCE participating States in 1990.  In my view it merits full and positive consideration.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his full reply on this issue relating to the idea of a confederation of states.  In outlining his views on the confederation of states, did President Mitterrand intend it as a purely co-ordinating confederation of states dealing with perhaps international political affairs or is it intended to be an economic confederation as well?  Can the Taoiseach give some idea of the general view on the confederation and while the Taoiseach indicates that he is favourable to the idea, can he say if that is the Government view at this time?</P>

      <P>As I said in my reply, it is primarily a matter for President Mitterrand to elaborate on his concept and deal with the various aspects that Deputy De Rossa has raised.  I understand that he intends to do that, but pending that, <Col N="1466" /> my understanding of his concept is that it will be primarily a framework to fill a gap that exists.  The 12 member states of the Community have their own framework, mechanisms and procedures for dealing with their affairs of mutual interest.  There is nothing similar in Eastern Europe not is there anything bridging the gap at present between the Eastern European countries and the Community. What President Mitterrand is primarily concerned with is to provide some sort of a framework which will fill that gap, a framework within which all the countries of Europe could relate to each other. President Mitterrand sees it very much as a framework which would help to contribute to stability in the whole of Europe.  I suggest that the Deputy should await further elaboration of the concept by President Mitterrand himself.</P>

      <P>My question in relation to whether this was Government policy or the Taoiseach's personal view was an attempt to find out what was Government policy in relation to this idea of a confederation and I did not intend to be in any way mischievous.  If it is a Government view, clearly some consultation must have taken place in relation to it.  In that respect, is it also intended that this confederation would be seen as a replacement for the blocs that exist at present, the NATO Alliance and the Warsaw Pact?</P>

      <P>Without breaking any confidences that might exist between himself and President Mitterrand, can the Taoiseach give an indication whether President Mitterrand sees this idea of a <Col N="1467" /> confederation as being something that would replace and indeed transcend the kind of involuntary and forced union imposed upon many countries in Eastern Europe by the kind of &ldquo;democratic centralism&rdquo; to which Deputy De Rossa, up to lately anyway, seemed to adhere?</P>

      <P>It is early yet to take decisions of that kind.  President Mitterrand merely put forward this concept in very broad outline and I understand that he intends to elaborate on it further. It would be advisable to await that further elaboration by President Mitterrand.  I would see it related to the Helsinki concept process, primarily because it involves the same group of nations.  But of course, it would be different to the extent that the Helsinki process involves meetings from time to time whereas this would be an on-going framework which would be kept in place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I will refer to two reports published recently.  The Economic and Social Research Institute in their Quarterly Economic Commentary of December 1989, published two weeks ago, forecast a fall of about 10,000 in <Col N="1469" /> unemployment in 1990 which coupled with a significant reduction in emigration, would mean a fall of about 25,000.  A further progress report by the Central Review Committee under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> shows that over 60,000 gross jobs were created in 1988 and 1989.  Notified redundancies for 1989 total 13,400, their lowest level since 1979 and over 40 per cent lower than in 1988.  Registered unemployment fell by an average of 8,000 over the two years 1988 and 1989.  More definitive information for the period from April 1989 to April 1990 will not be available until mid-August and it would be pointless to give any estimate at present in view of the fact that all the reports are not available.</P>

      <P>I wish to take Questions Nos. 8, 31 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>The role of the Minister for the Marine in relation to fish culture activities by the ESB at Poulaphouca or elsewhere is that of statutory licensing authority.  As such the Minister is bound to consider on their technical merits fish culture operation and applications for licences.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the ESB that they propose to end their fish culture operation at Poulaphouca at the end of the current season and are not proceeding with their licence application.  Questions in relation to the basis for the ESB decision in this regard do not fall within my sphere of responsibility.</P>
      <P>On the general question of fish culture operation in fresh water, a committee with representatives of my own Department, the Departments of the Environment, Health and Energy, together with the ESB and other freshwater salmon producers, will consider the environmental impact of fresh water hatcheries.</P>

Will the Minister tell the House where the smolts will be provided <Col N="1471" /> for restocking now that one third of the smolt population will be depleted when fish farming ceases in Poulaphouca?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in constant touch in relation to this and many other matters with my colleagues in the Departments of Energy and the Environment.  The ESB took a decision not to continue their operation at Poulaphouca.  The system operating there is that the smolts are taken out at the end of a six months period and the ESB decided to discontinue the operation as soon as that period elapses. The provision of smolts for the industry in general is a matter purely for the ESB and managers and operators of the fish farm section in the ESB.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at the Minister's response.  Does he not feel that the Department of the Marine have some responsibility in arranging the provision of smolts for fish farming purposes? Will the Minister advise the House of the amount of malachite green being used by the ESB in Poulaphouca?  Did the Department of the Environment advise him that there was serious pollution of the water coming into Dublin city?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department have not been consulted about the supply of smolts.  As the Deputy knows, the ESB are conducting a very successful and profitable business in that line and I am quite sure that they will be well able to cope with the production of smolts. During 1989 no malachite green was used by the ESB in Poulaphouca.  When malachite green is used, it is used in such infinitesimal proportions that the quality of the water is not affected.</P>

      <P>Search and rescue within the State's area of responsibility involves a number of State and voluntary agencies including the marine rescue co-ordinating centre at Shannon, the Air Corps, the Naval Service, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI), the coast radio stations at Valentia and Malin Head and the coast and cliff rescue service.  The operations of all these agencies, with the exception of the RNLI, are funded directly by the State.  The State does not finance the lifeboat service although my Department make an annual grant of £100,000 to the RNLI.</P>
      <P>In January of this year I launched 11 new fisheries patrol boats at Howth. While the main purpose of these boats is to combat illegal salmon fishing and the protection of salmon stocks, the boats come with the added bonus of being suitable for sea rescue operations.</P>
      <P>A package agreed in November at the Council of Ministers' meeting set aside 110 million ECUs, IR£85 million approximately, for fishery surveillance and Ireland hopes to get a large share of this. I should point out that search and rescue services are specifically excluded from this package.  Fisheries protection vessels and aircraft may, of course, be employed to assist in search and rescue operations.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that concern has been expressed by various organisations along the south and west coasts regarding search and rescue? Will he agree that a higher priority should be given to search and rescue methods? At present a sum of £10 million has been allotted for fishery protection but none of the money has gone towards the replacement of helicopters?</P>

      <P>I agree that this is a matter of great importance which is exercising the minds of many people.  Another question on the Order Paper is germane to this one. However, the money mentioned by the Deputy is to be spent on maritime patrol aircraft, communications facilities for sea fishery officers, inshore protection vessels and transport.  It specifically excludes the search and rescue operations but advantageously they may be used for search and rescue.</P>

      <Quest>if the European Court Order made in November 1989 relating to the British Merchant Shipping Act, 1988, has any effect on Irish shipping legislation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The European Court Order arising from the action instituted by the EC Commission against the United Kingdom has no direct effect on Ireland.  The order granted by the court is, in effect, an injunction against the United Kingdom relating to the application of nationality requirements of certain sections of the British Merchant Shipping Act, 1988.  This order was granted pending the outcome of the case.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the matters at issue relate to the control of &ldquo;flagships&rdquo; or &ldquo;quota-hoppers&rdquo;.  Ireland has to date supported the United Kingdom in its defence and, as the case is still <i>sub judice</i>, I would prefer not to make a substantive statement on the issue at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree more with the Deputy.  This is a serious problem and that is why we are associating ourselves with the UK in what they are doing.  The fact is that we have limited quotas and if flags of convenience are allowed those boats will be picking up our quota of fish.  In so far as it is humanly possible we want to avoid that and block it if it has started.  The Commission have acted under Articles 7.52 and 221 of the Treaty of Rome which concern the right of establishment, discrimination against nationals, movement of capital and so on.  The Commission have attacked the UK Act on that basis.  There is a defence. We have associated ourselves with that defence and we are hopeful that we will win.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Priority Question No. 12 and Question No. 42 together.</P>
      <P>I welcome the publication of this report.  The report contains very valuable research and analysis which will be useful in the on-going implementation and development of fisheries and aquaculture policy.</P>
      <P>I have already had a preliminary examination made of the 14 specific recommendations made in the report.  In this regard I am glad to be able to report that the vast bulk of them are already being pursued either by my Department or An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  As regards the remaining recommendations that are not, I have asked for an urgent appraisal and will implement those that may be considered worthwhile.</P>
      <P>On the particular subject of the share of administrative costs in the total budget, it must be borne in mind that the regulation and management of the fisheries in the interests of conservation and in accordance with our Community responsibilities poses a considerable but unavoidable administrative burden. Indeed, the ESRI report itself points out that even if no development work were done on sea fisheries, the cost of protecting and regulating the existing industry would have to go on so that overall costs would not be reduced greatly.</P>
      <P>In so far as the administration of grants and incentives is concerned, I am satisfied that these are managed on a cost efficient basis.  I will be looking at the issue on an on-going basis in the light of the analysis in the ESRI report to ensure that the best value for money is received.</P>

Will he agree that it is necessary to correct that method of expenditure?  What is the Minister doing to reverse this trend?

      <P>In the body of my reply I indicated my view in answer to the question of high costs.  It is as well for the Deputy and the House to know what is going on by way of implementation of that report.  Exploratory fishing costs money, particularly in the argentine, scad and blue whiting areas.  Coastal surveys to locate sites for shell fish are taking place.  Research work on new species suitable for fish farming is taking place. There has also been development work to determine the economics of farming a species other than those already farmed, for example, brill, plaice, turbot, cod and abalone.  An experiment on eel growing has been carried out as the Deputy is aware, in her own constitutency but not with any great success.  Studies are taking place to determine the effect of escaped farm salmon.  Market research abroad is an administrative cost and BIM have officers in Europe.  Negotiations with joint ventures are also taking place.  One of the great difficulties with regard to the pelagic species is supplies for the processing factories.  The Deputy will realise that there are a whole series of costs which are really administrative costs but are related very much to productivity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 29, 45 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>The latest position in relation to the rod licence dispute is that following detailed discussions, I have developed further the proposals I announced on 10 November last.  These proposals have been communicated to various organisations and I am expecting a response within the next day or so.  Leading spokespersons for the organisations concerned have welcomed these proposals and have indicated that they will strongly recommend them to their organisations.</P>
      <P>If my proposals are generally acceptable I expect that all objection signs will be removed and that angling will recommence without delay in the areas in which is has been disrupted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The central elements of the proposed basis for settlement are my proposals of 10 November 1989, subject to refinement of the fine print in the light of many detailed suggestions made.  Those proposals provided for the exercise of a democratic choice at a local level in the <Col N="1480" /> selection of the management of the co-operatives who were to be allowed operational discretion in day-to-day management. Those proposals also provide for shareholders a right to vote in the election of members for regional fisheries boards.</P>
    <P>On the same principle of local democracy which was the key to the original proposals, a significant majority by way of secret ballot will decide whether non-members of the co-operative should hold a share certificate to fish.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that these proposals offer a fair and democratic procedure for resolving the rod licence dispute.  They involve putting in place a co-operative mechanism tailored to local needs and which should generate significant revenues for local fishery development.  To have a say in the process proposed, anglers who contribute will have the decision-making powers.  Thus, the basic revenue-raising objective, on which there is general agreement, should be fully met.  The position of the co-operatives will complement and enhance the statutory position of the central and regional fisheries boards which will retain their pivotal role in inland fisheries development.</P>
    <P>I have appealed to all groups in the pro and anti-licence camps to respond positively to these proposals and to put behind them the divisions of the past two years.  The new arrangements, properly supported by all anglers, could help to transform the development of this important national resource both as a local amenity and in the interest of the tourist sector.</P>
    <P>Hopefully, we are now at the end of a difficult chapter in the administration of inland fisheries.  I should like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the splendid work of all those involved in the fishery service, both on the central and regional fisheries boards and the managers and staff, throughout this period.</P>
    <P>I should also like to express, through you, a Cheann Comhairle, my appreciation for the helpful and constructive advice which I received from Deputies on all sides of the House in the handling <Col N="1481" /> of this complex issue.  As matters are now at a most delicate stage, I would ask for their continued support in ensuring that our present efforts are brought to a successful conclusion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>May I express the hope that the Minister has arrived at a position where the dispute, which has caused unprecedented social and economic disruption, is finally drawing to a close.  In thanking the Minister for his efforts to date can he acquaint me with the following information?  Assuming the Minister's proposals are acceptable to the relevant groups and I trust they will be &mdash; will it be necessary for him to introduce an amendment to the Fisheries (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1987, in this House abolishing the compulsory aspect of having a licence to fish.  Second, does the formation of co-operatives in any way alter the position of the Government in so far as the extension of fresh water fish farms to all western lakes is concerned? Third, what will the role of the regional fisheries boards be assuming that by democratic choice a co-operative decide that a share certificate is necessary and that there may still be a small minority unwilling to participate in that regard? Finally, will the proposals, if accepted, also extend to the area where salmon licences are required at present and about which there has not been a dispute to date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Deputy has said by way of support.  First, legislation is necessary to amend the Fisheries (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1987, and to interlock it with the new scheme, and that will come before the House.  I do not think the existence of the co-operatives has any bearing whatsoever on the development of fish farms.  My predecessor and myself have indicated that we do not want structures on lakes. That is the general policy.  The regional boards will have the powers and duties that they already have under statute and they will also be available to the co-operatives to effect the decisions of the co-operative with regard to fishing.  Finally, <Col N="1482" /> in regard to salmon licences &mdash; as the Deputy adumbrated in his question &mdash; there has been no problem with that sector and I am making arrangements for their licensing to continue.</P>

Sometimes it was an economic loss which was not for the whole country because people transferred from one part of the country to another to fish, but at least it could be argued that the money was kept in the country.  The fact is that the person who takes out a share certificate will be in a position to impact on the various areas I have referred to already, namely, they will be able to form part of the <Col N="1483" /> governments of the particular co-operative, they will be in a position, by virtue of holding a certificate, to vote for representatives on the regional fisheries board and they will be part of the decision-making process for non-members. That is the significant part.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's statement and I congratulate him because ever since he was given this portfolio many of the angling clubs along the Blackwater Valley &mdash; from where I come &mdash; have had confidence in him.  The issue looks very like being resolved since the spokesman for the anglers, who is a Cork man, spoke this morning and said he would be strongly recommending acceptance, and when a Corkman makes a pronouncement like that one can rest assured he knows what he is talking about.  Will the Minister ensure that no effort will be spared to build up immediately the relationship between all sections of the community as we are now coming into the fishing season?  Will the Minister also say whether he has given any consideration to the all-important issue of the nationalisation of the inland fisheries?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 40 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>The procedures for the regulation of dumping at sea in the North-East Atlantic are governed by the Oslo Convention (its full title is the Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping from Ships and Aircraft) to which Ireland is a contracting party.  Last June the Commission met in Dublin and adopted a decision to cease the dumping of industrial waste in the North Sea by 31 December 1989, and in the rest of the Convention area by 31 December 1995, unless it could be shown that: (i) there were no practical alternatives for disposal on land, and (ii) the waste caused no harm to the marine environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1487" /> The commission's decision incorporated a procedure known as the Prior Justification Procedure (PJP).  This procedure obliges contracting parties which intend to issue a licence for the disposal of industrial waste at sea to circulate details of the waste to other contracting states.  Other contracting states may lodge objections but any objections must be based on scientific evidence.</P>
    <P>Details of the UK licensing proposals were sent to my Department in September and October 1989, and were examined by the Department's scientific adviser in the light of these criteria already mentioned viz. at (i) and (ii).  My Department's scientific evaluation showed that there were no alternatives available at present for disposing of this waste on land, and that there was no harm to the marine environment, given the nature of the waste i.e. effluent from the manufacture of anti-allergy and anti-asthma drugs, paracetamol and an antioxidant for soap and paint manufacture, and the method of disposal.</P>
    <P>The countries objecting to the proposal are all countries bordering the North Sea.</P>
    <P>The question of European support in relation to Sellafield should be addressed to my colleague, the Minister for Energy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  In relation to the Convention which he has mentioned, would he agree that exception is allowed where it can be shown by what is described as a competent international organisation that no harm is caused to the marine environment? Would he, therefore, tell me what competent international organisation was able to satisfy the Irish Government in this respect but was unable to satisfy at least five other European Governments, particularly in circumstances where the Irish Government have a particular responsibility in relation to Sellafield and to the Irish Sea and North Sea?  I further ask the Minister, does this saga not underline the necessity for the establishment of a Europe-wide environmental protection agency which would prevent dumping unilaterally by <Col N="1488" /> one state particularly in the face of reservations by others?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply, two conditions of the procedure known as PJP are that there are no practical alternatives for disposal on land and that the waste causes no harm to the marine environment.  I had this question thoroughly investigated by a scientist in my Department and would not take any action without solid scientific advice.  I am totally <i>en rapport</i> with the five other governments as far as this type of dispossal is concerned.  Only three companies in this country are involved in this type of dumping and one of them will have before the end of this year &mdash; they have until 1995 &mdash; put in place a plant for the disposal of waste on land.  The other two are moving in that direction.  Of course, we are urging the United Kingdom also to see to it that this practice continues. In regard to the fourth point the Deputy made, inevitably a Euro convention will be put in place.  The fact that the Oslo Commission took the steps it did at its meeting in Dublin is an indication that it is a Euro matter in the broadest possible sense, that is to say, incorporating countries other than the Twelve of the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister state if he received any representations from the five states who objected to this dumping and can he see the implications of our refusing to go along with these countries? Furthermore what will happen the next time toxic waste is dumped in the North Atlantic?  We will kick up a big row and will look to West Germany, Denmark and other countries for their support.  I wonder what kind of answer we will get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate Deputy Garland's concern but let me say to the House that the North Sea is a particularly bad place as far as pollution is concerned. The countries around the North Sea have particularly bad consciences about this pollution; it is not necessarily as a result of dumping but pollution caused by dumping will not aid that position.  As <Col N="1489" /> President of the Council of Fisheries Ministers I am aware of the impact this is having on the fisheries.  I am aware, for example, that haddock stocks are practically wiped out as a result of pollution caused by the dumping of industrial effluent and sewage by very strong heavily industrialised countries. However, I want to assure the Deputies who put down the questions and the House that my Department are particularly sensitive and will take action accordingly on these matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I was praising the official. I wish to ask the Minister again what competent international organisation told him that the dumping of 40,000 tonnes of this type of waste in the North Sea was not bad for the marine environment? Furthermore, would he not agree that on the next occasion when complaints are likely to be made, particularly in relation to Sellafield, as a result of this experience the finger is likely to be pointed at us by other European Governments who will say &ldquo;you did not co-operate when we expected your co-operation the last time&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will agree there is a big difference between the refuse of anti-asthma drug-making and what is coming out of Sellafield into the Irish Sea.  I am very confident that the scientist who advised me is a man of international standing.  I am not talking about an international grouping of any kind, but he is a man of international standing.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already welcomed, on behalf of the Government, the release of Nelson Mandela.  As I said at the time, he has demonstrated by his indomitable courage throughout the years that the human spirit can never be vanquished.</P>
      <P>His release was a most positive step by the South African Government, following on from President de Klerk's speech to the South African Parliament on 2 February.</P>
      <P>Today, Ireland has joined with our partners in the Twelve in issuing a statement on Nelson Mandela's release.  This statement reads as follows:</P>
      <P>The Twelve warmly welcome the release of Nelson Mandela, one of South Africa's longest serving political prisoners.  They commend the South African Government on this step.  Mr. Mandela's release has been one of the basic demands of the Twelve over the years.  Taken with the steps announced by President de Klerk on 2 February, this is without doubt a most important contribution to the establishment of that climate which the Twelve consider necessary for the initiation of genuine negotiations with the black community. The Twelve repeat their view that these negotiations must be aimed at the total abolition of apartheid and the establishment of a new, democratic, united and non-racial South Africa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1492" /> Nelson Mandela has remained a potent symbol of freedom for all those struggling for the eradication of apartheid. His release comes at a crucial time in the history of South Africa when expectations are high that the Government has accepted that radical change to the structures of South African society can no longer be delayed.</P>
    <P>The Twelve hope that all parties in South Africa will now seize the opportunity to achieve the end of apartheid by peaceful means through negotiation.</P>
    <P>We have listened with considerable interest to the statements by Mr. Mandela since his release.  In these he has shown himself to be without rancour and to adopt a constructive approach on the future of South Africa.  His views will certainly provide an input into Twelve deliberations on their policy on South Africa.</P>
    <P>In any discussions on Twelve sanctions, Ireland's primary function as Presidency is to take into account the views of partners and to work for consensus.</P>
    <P>Our national position of total abhorrence of apartheid has been expressed on numerous occasions.  We welcome the reforms President de Klerk recently introduced.  They are of considerable significance in building that climate which is necessary before true negotiations with the genuine representatives of the black community can begin.  However, further steps need to be taken.  The state of emergency, for example, has not been lifted.  Moreover, these recent measures do not address the fundamentals of the apartheid system, which must be addressed before the system of apartheid can be said to be in the process of being dismantled and the lifting of sanctions considered.  Our objective remains the total abolition of apartheid and the establishment in South Africa of a new society based on principles of equality and justice for all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his elaborate reply, but I believe certain <Col N="1493" /> elaboration and clarifications are necessary. Will the Taoiseach indicate to the House whether he has received a communication in letter form from the British Prime Minister since the release of Nelson Mandela, whether he has replied to that correspondence and whether that correspondence was the basis of a reply given by the British Prime Minister in the House of Commons this afternoon in which she states that she finds the reply given by Deputy Haughey as President of the EC Council as being amenable on her position in relation to the possibility of sanctions being lifted in relation to South Africa?</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to comment on what the Deputy has just mentioned.  I am not aware of the reply given in the British House of Commons, but I received a communication from the British Prime Minister and I replied to it. My reply was along the lines I have given here in relation to our role in the Presidency.

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I can seek an unequivocal statement from the Taoiseach in his role as Taoiseach of this country and in his role as President of the EC Council, that nothing has happened to date which would encourage us or the EC to seek any relaxation in the sanctions against the South African régime.  It is extremely important for a clear statement to go out from the Taoiseach in both capacities in relation to what has hapened over the weekend, lest, as I believe, he has been quoted in the House of Commons as saying that because of a reply received from him consideration will be given at the next meeting of the Heads of State to the momentous events and to the changes that have taken place in South Africa.  I would hate to think anything written by the Taoiseach of this country at this stage could lead the British Prime Minister or any other Heads of State in Europe to draw the conclusion <Col N="1494" /> that the Taoiseach is amenable to the position stated by the British Prime Minister over the weekend.</P>

      <P>There is nothing of that kind arising.  I would like the Deputy to understand that the latest position of the Twelve is as I have read out.  The matter will be considered further at a meeting of Foreign Ministers on 20 February.  In my capacity as President of the Council I have indicated that it is my duty and function to put all the relevant factors before my colleagues and if possible to achieve consensus and agreement.  I would not at this stage wish to go any further, than that or to be taken, as President, as saying one thing or another or being amenable to this, that or the other. My position &mdash; I have to be scrupulous about this &mdash; is that I must not pre-empt the decision of the Community and anything I say must have the agreement of the Twelve.  The latest agreed position of the Twelve is as I have stated here.</P>
      <P>The Deputy can be quite clear as to Ireland's national position as distinct from the role of Ireland in the Presidency. The Irish national position is as I have read out, that these recent measures do not address the fundamentals of the apartheid system which must be addressed before that system of apartheid can be said to be in the process of being dismantled and the lifting of sanctions considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  Will he not agree that the time has long since gone for statements of our abhorrence at apartheid to be worth anything with regard to its dismantling? For that reason will the Taoiseach give a firm guarantee to this House that he will ensure that no debate takes place about <Col N="1495" /> the lifting of sanctions until the five conditions agreed at the 16th United Nations session just over are fulfilled, namely, the release of all political prisoners and detainees unconditionally, the lifting of all bans on proscribed groups, the removal of all troops from the townlands, the end of the state of emergency and the repeal of all legislation such as the Internal Security Act and the ceasing of all political trials and executions?  These five conditions were laid down by the UNO, of which Ireland is a member before any lifting or discussion about the lifting of sanctions should take place.  I would like the Taoiseach's guarantee that until those five conditions are met he will not allow the EC countries to lift the sanctions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree with the Deputy.  I do not think our abhorrence of apartheid can be stated too often and the constant reiteration of such statements by the international community undoubtedly had an influence on present developments in South Africa.  Secondly, I could not agree to rule out any discusions in any of the Councils of the Community. I suggest to the Deputy that on reflection she might agree that any member state is entitled to put forward any point of view it wishes, but then it is a matter for the Presidency to try to guide, steer or otherwise secure the position where the Council would arrive at an agreed and, it is hoped, the right decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of these five conditions, and is his aim to ensure that they are met before he will let the Council of Ministers change?  I recognise that he is supposed to work for agreement, but all the countries of the EC are members of the UNO and they have endorsed these five conditions. Therefore, I think there is an onus on him to remind them of that and to ensure the sanctions are not lifted.  Could he perhaps make personal contact with the ANC leadership and Nelson Mandela to get their word that they want Europe to continue with sanctions, so that he can <Col N="1496" /> speak with a voice of authority directly from the leadership of the ANC and Nelson Mandela?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I could not do that without the express agreement of the British Prime Minister, but I can reiterate that my reply both to the British Prime Minister and to the Leader of the Opposition in Britain was entirely along the lines I have indicated here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach being perhaps too scrupulous on two points?  First in his reply to Mrs. Thatcher, given the fact that his reply has been quoted in the House of Commons this afternoon would the Taoiseach not agree that that frees him from any restrictions he might otherwise have in relation to correspondence of that kind?  Is the Taoiseach not aware that his reply was quoted by Mrs. Thatcher in the context of her justification for the point of view she has taken over the past weekend that it is now time to relax the sanctions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1497" /> Would the Taoiseach not agree he is being too scrupulous on another point, in saying that he should not pre-empt the position of the Community on this issue? Would he not agree that that is totally at variance with the position he has taken in this House on other issues when he has been promoting his position as President of the European Council in order to get a &ldquo;Green&rdquo; Europe or any other type of Europe the Taoiseach has been talking about?  Would the Taoiseach not agree that it is time the Presidency used the influence it has, which the Taoiseach flaunts, in order to get results we want on this issue?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy knows full well exactly what the role of the Presidency should be in these matters. There is nothing that I have said to anybody at this stage which would justify anybody presuming that, as President, I was taking a position which would make me amenable on the lifting of sanctions. I can say that very categorically to the Deputy.  There is nothing that I have said either in reply to the Leader of the Opposition or to the British Prime Minister, or to anybody else, which would attempt to pre-empt the decision of the Twelve in regard to sanctions, and certainly nothing I have said would entitle anybody to say that I was amenable on the maintenance of sanctions.  As to whether the correspondence can be revealed I will consider that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to repeat, that on a matter as delicate, sensitive and of such fundamental and far-reaching importance I think it is right that I should not attempt to pre-empt the view of the Council.  I think there would be some resentment among my colleagues if I attempted to do that.  We are concentrating in this House on the view of the British Government, but there are other member states who, I am quite certain, will have their own views to put forward.  I think it would be wrong and not helpful for me to attempt to pre-empt the outcome of those discussions, except to give the House my undertaking to endeavour to secure <Col N="1498" /> agreement among the Twelve, because that is very important.  I think it is very important that the Twelve should have an agreed attitude.  I will do everything I can to attempt to secure an agreed position of the Twelve and that that position will be the right one.</P>

I further propose that the House adjourn at 8.30 p.m. to discuss this matter between 8.30 p.m. and 11 p.m. tonight and tomorrow night.  I would further add, since it appears that the Government are beginning to recognise there is a problem, that it would be useful for the Cabinet subcommittee, which was announced today, to have the views of this House and the direct experience of Members of this House to draw on when they are going about this work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> Before I concluded last week I was dealing with the reduction in taxes.  I welcome the Minister's decision to reduce the standard rate of VAT from 25 to 23 per cent.  It is recognised that we have the highest rates of VAT and excise duty in the EC and, therefore, it is essential that a start be made to bring about a reduction.  The reduction of excise duty on soft drinks is also a very welcome decision by the Minister.  It is important that the reductions in VAT and excise duties are now passed on to the consumer and I hope the Ministers for Finance and Industry and Commerce will monitor the situation and ensure this is done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One area about which I am not very happy at present is the drinks industry. There is a general rip-off of the customer in both the alcoholic and soft drinks industries.  The Minister should seek a full-scale investigation into the operations of the breweries, distilleries and publicans.  I have no doubt that a cartel arrangement is in operation right across the board, with agreed price fixing rampant. The decrease that will come about because of the VAT reduction from 25 to 23 per cent will not be passed on to <Col N="1612" /> the consumer in so far as alcoholic drinks are concerned because the distillers and the breweries have decided to increase the price.  It is a shame that the Minister for Finance, in the last three budgets, has not increased the price of drinks right across the board.  Yet, there has been a dramatic increase in price by the breweries and the publicans.  The Minister has a role to play in ensuring that the breweries and distillers do not increase the price of drink at present but that they allow the decrease that will come about as a result of the reduction in VAT from 25 to 23 per cent to be passed on to the consumer.  That is an area that needs to be investigated and I hope the Ministers for Finance and Industry and Commerce will set about that investigation.</P>
    <P>The agricultural sector has seen a significant increase in incomes over the last few years, which is welcome following the disasters which occurred in the early eighties for many different reasons.  I would like the milk quota for the small farmer to be sorted out.  The Minister can allocate 11 million gallons but unfortunately it will not be given out on a creamery basis but on a national basis which means that producers in the south and south-east will not get their fair share.  I hope the 11 million gallon allocation is only a start which will be increased as the years pass to ensure that the small producer can earn a decent standard of living on the family farm.</P>
    <P>We are awaiting a report from the Minister for Agriculture and Food in relation to disadvantaged areas.  We certainly need to extend the disadvantaged areas. There are a number of areas in County Wexford which should be included in the disadvantaged areas.  At present only 3 per cent of Wexford lands are included while Waterford has ten times that amount and Kilkenny has five or six times that concluded.  The farmers in the poor lands in Wexford have not had a fair deal and when the Minister is sending the new scheme for disadvantaged areas to Brussels, I hope he will include many areas in County Wexford where farmers are finding it difficult to earn a decent standard of living.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1613" /> I welcome the introduction of a grant for agricultural students, an issue which has been a bone of contention particularly in Macra na Feirme during the last number of years.  The farming student was not being treated like his counterpart in the regional colleges in relation to grants.  I compliment the Minister and wish him a speedy recovery, and I thank him for introducing this grants scheme valued at about £1.7 million for agricultural students.  I welcome also the index linking of stamp duties, an essential move to facilitate the transfer of farms to sons or daughters so that they can have an opportunity contribute to the economy from the farm.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to investigate the recent report from Bord na gCon that 13 greyhound tracks will be closed.  The greyhound track in Enniscorthy is one of the tracks mentioned and if it closed it would be disastrous for the industry in the south-east.  There is a bright future for the greyhound industry and it would be decimated if this track were closed.  I would remind the Minister and Bord na gCon that the money used to develop the greyhound industry is taxpayers' money. The greyhound industry is as well worth developing with taxpayers' money as any other selected area.  The Enniscorthy track should be upgraded and developed as a major attraction for business people and to help the economy.  We will not accept the closure of the greyhound track in Enniscorthy, which would mean that people who have been involved there all their lives would have to travel to Dublin, Tralee, Thurles or elsewhere to develop their business.  I hope this proposal will not be implemented.  I would ask the Minister to let us have the up-to-date position on this issue and to ensure the continuation of the greyhound track in Enniscorthy, along with the other tracks it is proposed to close.  The Irish greyhound industry is one of the leading greyhound industries in Europe, and I hope it will continue.</P>
    <P>Even on the Order of Business today we referred to coastal erosion.  This has been an on-going problem for many years.  Because of the storms during the <Col N="1614" /> last three months coastal erosion has been highlighted.  I welcome the decision to set up a ministerial group to report on the problems caused by recent storms and flooding.  I am glad there is no dragging of heels or long fingering of these problems, as this committee are to report back within two weeks.  I am glad the Government are prepared to take action.</P>
    <P>The coastline of County Wexford has been devastated over the past few weeks. Courtown Harbour is a tourist attraction and many people, from Dublin for instance, go there for holidays.  It is essential to make money available to protect Courtown Harbour as a tourist amenity. We need about £100,000 to ensure that further damage is not caused.  We had a worthwhile meeting with Minister Wilson last week in Dublin and because of his intervention and because of this new committee, we hope to see action as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I welcome Deputy Dukes' commitment to coastal protection.  It is certainly a change of heart.  I am glad he visited the sunny south-east this morning and viewed Courtown Harbour, but I would remind the House that when Deputy Dukes was Minister for Finance, on at least six different occasions we met the Minister with responsibility for coastal protection, Deputy Jim Mitchell, and we met Deputy Dukes on two occasions, to raise the problem of coastal erosion in County Wexford.  Deputy Dukes when in a position as Minister for Finance to apply to Europe for money, took no interest in the problem.  Had Deputy Dukes applied for money at that time we would not have the major coastal erosion problems in County Wexford today.  I take a cynical view of Deputy Dukes' recent intervention and I hope he is not playing politics with the people of Courtown.</P>
    <P>I was glad of the decision of the Minister for Health, in conjunction with the Minister for Finance, to allocate extra money for the mentally handicapped and for dental services.  A further £3 million is to be made available to health boards to improve dental services for adults and children.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to providing increased money to <Col N="1615" /> cater for elderly people.  The Minister should take a deep interest in nursing homes.  One must question the high fees they are charging elderly people.  The fees range from £120 to £140 a week. People on old age pensions are not able to pay this sort of money.  The Minister must look at the quality and the standards of care in these nursing homes.  He must also examine the nursing standards to see if patients are getting the right kind of care.  I have reservations about the operations of some nursing homes and I do not think that proper nursing procedures are being followed.  I know the Minister will be introducing legislation shortly in respect of this whole area; it is all very well to say that we will provide services for old people but the services which will be provided must be looked at.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for Finance on his budget as it is going in the right direction.  I hope that the different people he set out to look after in the budget will be considered and that the economy will develop as it has over the past three years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget could be best described as a blunderbuss in that it fired bits and pieces everywhere without creating any impact.  It did very little for the poor and underprivileged, the victims of the economic crisis in recent years.  I agree with the people who described the budget as one of lost opportunities.</P>
      <P>The euphoria which greeted the budget from the Government benches and some sections of the media has now evaporated because when people studied its provisions in detail they saw that it contained more shadow than substance.  The budget was an insult to the underprivileged, those on low incomes and the unemployed. As I said, these are the people who suffered during the economic crisis and they can take very little comfort from its provisions.  The damage to large sectors of our community has not been put right and there is growing evidence that the benefits of economic recovery, given to certain sections of the community, are not shared equally throughout the whole community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1616" /> We heard a lot recently about high growth rates, high exports and profits, but these terms are meaningless to the people I represent, those on the dole or receiving disability and unemployment asistance and benefits.  The factors I mentioned are not being translated into sufficient jobs and, taking the current rate of job creation, it means that 250,000 people will be unemployed for the first five years of this decade.  The long-term unemployed have been abandoned and have not benefited from the recently improved economic climate.  Many jobs being created at present are makeshift, low paid and part-time and many unemployed people are exploited by their creation.</P>
    <P>Inflation and interest rates are seriously affecting the living standards of many workers, especially those who, unfortunately, are on social welfare.  The figures quoted in recent times bear no relation to the reality of inflation.  The price of the normal shopping basket for the wife or the urban workers and the total absence of price control mean that many organisations are in a position to exploit the situation at present.  I will return to the question of price controls later.</P>
    <P>I can certainly confirm the statement that we are living in a two-tier society of the haves and have-nots.  It is a society that is experiencing widespread poverty and no real sense of social concern is shown by our political leaders.  The cutbacks in our health and educational services have seriously harmed the least well off in society.  I was not able to take part in the debate on the health service last week but the cutbacks &mdash; to which I will refer later &mdash; mean that many medical card holders and elderly people are being treated inhumanely throughout the health board areas.  The cutbacks in education mean that we also have a two-tier educational system, which has created enormous problems for chldren in disadvantaged areas, despite the lip service in recent statements to the contrary.</P>
    <P>Earlier I described the budget as one of the lost opportunities and I will now elaborate on this.  The creation of jobs <Col N="1617" /> and the reduction in the level of emigration must be our national priority but the budget has done very little &mdash; if anything &mdash; to tackle these problems.  This is a great country for lip service.  We are expert at identifying problems and solutions but we must be condemned for our failure to translate targets into real solutions.  Our society and the industrial scene are dominated and controlled by restrictive practices, demarcations and vested interests.  Until these issues are faced up to squarely by the Government we will continue to have high unemployment and high emigration.  Our bright young people, the products of our top class educational system, will be the victims of these factors and of the unwillingness and moral cowardice of Governments to tackle these important issues.</P>
    <P>Any Government that have the moral courage to take on the powerful groups within our society, the groups who hinder and, indeed, paralyse any attempt to bring about efficiency in our public and private sector, will have the support of the majority of our people.  The people have been demoralised by inadequate leadership and are now looking to a party which will take on the groups and the vested interests who oppose change because they themselves are afraid of change as it would affect their privileged position in society.</P>
    <P>The whole programme of job creation is being badly hindered by restrictive practices and demarcation which lead to high public liability insurance which, in turn, is linked to our inadequate and inefficient legal and courts system.  This is not the occasion to deal with this matter in detail, but I will refer to it at another time.  We have a high level of bureaucracy and a high level of taxation brought about by excesses in public expenditure and inefficiency in the public service.  These and all the other issues I mentioned are interlinked and are hindering job creation.  I would go so far as to say that the Government have no policy in relation to jobs other than measures which flow incidentally from the budget.</P>
    <P>Emigration and unemployment cannot be separated because they are part of <Col N="1618" /> the same problem.  They come from a number of issues to which I already referred, such as high income tax.  Emigration is caused by pessimism about the future of our young people and by the perceived narrow-mindedness and boredom of Irish society.</P>
    <P>There are seven major causes of unemployment: high income tax, PRSI and other overheads &mdash; the overlay of social legislation makes the employment of labour unattractive &mdash; workforce attitudes and habits, the cost and tax structures for certain industries such as the road transport system, a multitude of poverty traps, every one of which arises from official policy and the absence of a coherent or co-ordinated Government structure or policy to tackle unemployment. There is a widespread sense of hopelessness among our young people because of a lack of determination and dedication to treat this problem.</P>
    <P>We can put the scale of the unemployment and emigration problems in context if we look at the figures for recent years.  In August 1984 our register for unemployment was 214,000 and the net emigration for the preceding five years was 30,000 which, effectively, meant that 244,000 people were out of work.  In August 1989 the register of unemployment showed a figure of 232,000 and there was a net emigration in the proceding five years of 156,000, making a total of 388,000 unemployed, an increase of 59 per cent.  That is in stark contrast to the position in the UK where the register of unemployment in August 1984 stood at 3.116 million as against 1.741 million in August 1989, a decrease of 44 per cent.  If the UK trend had occurred here in that period the figure of 388,000 would now be less than 107,000, a lot less than the 1984 figure.  That begs the question, why the dramatic difference in trends between the UK, our nearest neighbour, and this country?</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to some of the issues that should be faced by the Government.  In the UK they have one Department of Employment, fewer poverty traps, lower income tax rates, higher allowances and industrial relations <Col N="1619" /> reform has reduced disincentives to employ.  What should we do about our problems?  I suggest we should create a new Department of Employment by merging the Department of Labour with the industrial development function of the Department of Industry and Commerce and the unemployment payments section of the Department of Social Welfare. It goes without saying that we should have a real reform of our taxation system.  We should have a reform of our means testing procedure and abolish poverty traps.  We should reform social insurance, reform labour relations &mdash; something that has been promised for a long time&mdash;and reform and reorganise the labour market clause.  We must face up to those issues which we have failed to do over the years.  Recent Governments have only been playing around with the job creation programme and the whole problem of unemployment and emigration. There is no real commitment or political courage evident in any of the proposals put forward in recent times.</P>
    <P>What we need is a major review of industrial policy and a radical reorganising and simplification of industrial promotion agencies.  We have the jungle of bureaucracy that hinders and frustrates any young person attempting to set up an industry or business here.  We must look at the allowances and grant schemes which appear to put more emphasis on the provision of plant and machinery than on the creation of jobs.  There must be a major investment in the construction industry which has been given a lot of lip-service in recent times but very little investment has been made in it.  That labour intensive industry could create many thousands of jobs.</P>
    <P>When we refer to job creation we must not forget the victims of the many traditional industries which closed in the early eighties.  Many of those unfortunate people have not succeeded in finding other employment.  Many of them live in my home city, Cork, and they were employed in the traditional labour intensive industries such as Fords, Dunlop and <Col N="1620" /> Verolme.  I would like to see the introduction of new specific employment and training measures for the long-term unemployed.  We should also be mindful of the many young people who leave our second level institutions annually and who do not wish to go on to third level education.  Those young people are anxious to enter the job market at the earliest possible opportunity but their hopes and ambitions are being denied at present.  It is essential that we create thousands of places for apprentices in Irish industries.</P>
    <P>The budget contains a number of good measures such as the reductions of VAT and excise duties.  However, I am worried that those reductions will not be passed on to the consumer.  In that regard I agree with some of the statements made by Deputy Browne.  The assurances given by different Ministers in recent days regarding price control and the intention to have inspectors on our high streets safeguarding the interests of the consumers must be taken as so much lip-service when the real facts are known.  The abolition of price control in recent years has led to widespread abuse and I can supply ample evidence of that abuse.  I deplore the cutbacks that took place last year in the office of the Commission on Fair Trade.  Offices of the commission in Cork and Galway were closed and the service was centralised in Dublin.  People from the provinces who had complaints were told that if travel outside Dublin was required their complaints could not be dealt with.  That was highlighted in the House, the Minister quickly backtracked and complaints from outside Dublin are being dealt with by the office in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Every possible step must be taken by the Government to control price increases and ensure that reductions in costs are passed on to consumers by a reduction in prices.  I can quote examples where I believe consumers are being robbed left, right and centre.  I should like to deal with one example, the sale of Polish coal.  Earlier this year, following a complaint by a constituent, I carried out an investigation into the price of Polish coal.  I contacted the Central Bank and <Col N="1621" /> I was told that the Polish currency in November 1989 had devalued seven-fold against the US dollar.  The zloty, the Polish currency, in November 1988 stood at 496 to the US dollar or 767 zloty to the Irish punt.  In November 1989 it had devalued almost seven times, to 3,450 zloty to the US dollar and 4,991 zloty to the Irish punt.  At the same time the price of a 50 kg. bag of coal went up by 20p. I tabled a question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce about that and he told me that price control generally was abandoned in 1986 and with it the structure for collecting and analysing a wide range of information.  Accordingly, he did not have detailed information in regard to the price structure of Polish coal.  That is a damning indictment of the Minister for Industry and Commerce who, it appears, does not care a whit for Irish consumers.  How are our consumers being protected?  We do not know where the coal is coming from because the country of origin is not stamped on the unsealed bags.  If price control was introduced in regard to that product many families would get great relief but the rip-off continues.</P>
    <P>The explanation I received from CDL was that they paid for their coal in dollars. The Minister should snap out of his inactivity and carry out a full inquiry into the activities of the conglomerates who increase prices without any notification to him.  There should be a full investigation into the importation and pricing of coal. I have no doubt that if that were held we would ascertain the real facts.  I will take one other example.  I put down a question to the Minister for Finance on 12 December 1989, Volume 394, column 932 of the Official Report, in relation to the excise duty on non-alcoholic beers.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy A.  Reynolds responded:</P>
    <P>Non-alcoholic beers bear a specially reduced excise duty charge of 37.2p per gallon or 4.65p per pint.  The excise duty borne by ordinary beer is, on average, approximately 37.6p per pint.</P>
    <P>Try visiting any pub in this or any city and ask for a bottle of non-alcoholic or a <Col N="1622" /> bottle of normal beer and it will be the same price.  Even though there is a 40p, or 33p or 30p, difference in excise duty &mdash; and if you add 20 per cent VAT there will be a difference of 40p &mdash; they are sold at the same price.  Again there is no price control.  Deputy Browne is correct that there needs to be a full investigation into the price of beers, non-alcoholic beers and mineral waters because the consumer is being ripped off.  Quite honestly I do not know who is doing the ripping off because everybody washes their hands of the issue when questions are asked.</P>
    <P>In Britain an order was imposed to reduce the price of coffee but here there was total stagnation &mdash; paralysis from the Minister.  The imposition of price control must be considered again at this stage because the situation is serious. Importers, distributors and shopkeepers are refusing to pass on reductions to consumers, we do not know where the problem is.  There must be a full commitment from the Government on these issues.</P>
    <P>In relation to the taxation provisions in the budget, time prevents me from dwelling on them.  We have read much recently about tax reform but we have seen very little evidence of any such reform in the budget.  In fact, the net result of the budget for PAYE workers is that they will pay £110 million more this year than they paid in 1989.  That is the bottom line when the cosmetics, the camouflage and the juggling of figures, are taken into account.  Tax exemption limits must be increased substantially as well as combining allowances for children if we are to make any progress towards improving the position.  This can be done by a number of measures.  Surely we can widen the tax net to take in the people &mdash; whom I can easily identify &mdash; who are under-paying.</P>
    <P>I said I would deal with the question of public spending and this prompts me to deal briefly with the health services which, in my opinion, are inefficient, disjointed and disorganised.  I want to spend a few moments on that issue because I did not get in on last week's debate on the health services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1623" /> The health services need an overall restructural plan as set out in the Fine Gael policy document &mdash; Towards a Better Health Service.  I am deeply disappointed that the Minister has made no attempt to introduce most of the provisions of the report published by the commission on health funding.  The Minister used the commission's existence to prevent any changes and to reject proposals put forward by the Opposition parties over the two years the commission sat.  Since the commission issued their findings, the Minister has further delayed any changes in the structure of the health services using the story that he is now seeking observations from the many interested groups on the commission's report &mdash; groups that had already made their views known.  As I said, there is an urgent need for an overall restructural plan for the health services, and I would hope this would be done sooner rather than later.  In the meantime additional resources must be made available to certain areas of the health services.</P>
    <P>I am deeply disappointed at the limited resources made available in the recent budget.  There must be investment in the community care service if we are to decrease dependency on the hospital services which have been taking up 50 per cent of our health budget in recent years. Despite all that has been said recently, there has been no real improvement in our health services, in fact, the crisis has deepened.  I will not refer to any specific cases but there are numerous horror stories I could tell this House.  However, that would serve no purpose at this stage. The CEO of the Southern Health Board is on record as saying that despite the increased allocation, effectively the level of service will be the same as last year and last year's service was disastrous. Last year was a year that our so-called civilized country should be ashamed of because that was the year when the size of one's bank account or the size of one's wallet dictated the service one received.</P>
    <P>In my two years as health spokesperson for my party I brought forward a comprehensive health policy document which <Col N="1624" /> has stood the test of close scrutiny.  We set out clearly in that document the fundamental problems besetting the health services and we put forward radical solutions. At long last the Minister, under pressure last week, introduced some small measures which will at least stimulate him into creating some original ideas. Up to now he has cut at random, or got the health boards to carry out the cuts, but they did not always happen in accordance with medical needs but many times on political considerations.</P>
    <P>What we have seen is an exercise of time wasting where people suffered, and are still suffering.  There must be major investment in the community care service if we are to decrease dependency on the hospital services.  In recent years, the Minister has displayed a Jekyll and Hyde character in his approaches to health. When he was on this side of the House he was most vociferous with his cries of wolf on many issues but when he became Minister for Health he acted very sheepishly when the issue of health was raised in this House.</P>
    <P>I am also bitterly disappointed at the lack of investment in our educational services. Having listened to the Minister in the House on Thursday last, she has once again failed to recognise in any real way the deprivation that exists, especially in our urban areas.  She has failed to recognise the dependency of some of our schools on increased resources for remedial and other works in the disadvantaged areas of our cities.  The Minister has totally failed to grasp the nettle in this area and must be condemned.</P>
    <P>I am also disappointed at the allocation for overseas development.  The letter from Bishop Casey to Deputies should be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>It would be neglectful of me to conclude my budget speech without dealing with the budget impact on the economy of my own city.  My city has suffered the trauma of the closure of many traditional industries, but Cork people, being so resilient, have fought back.  Through our agencies in Cork we have put forward the development plan for Cork which became part of the regional plan which, <Col N="1625" /> in turn, should have been included as part of the national plan.  Cork people are waiting with interest to see how the Structural Funds will be allocated.  I am issuing a warning to the Government that we will fight to ensure that Structural Funds are distributed in accordance with regional needs rather than with the Government's political considerations.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Minister for Finance again rejected the concept of a regional development agency.  I would ask him to reconsider his position.  My city has not yet emerged from the on-going trauma of closures and the present threatened closure of Sunbeam Wolsey on the north side of Cork city is a major worry for our people.  Sunbeam Wolsey must not close, that would be the final, fatal blow for the people of the north side of Cork city who have already suffered badly because of Government policies in recent years.  Sometimes unemployment has reached 80 per cent in certain areas. The workforce in Sunbeam Wolsey are mainly female, many of whom are the only breadwinners in families throughout the north side of Cork city.</P>
    <P>I am calling on the Government to support, through their agencies or by direct aid, the measures that are being taken at present to save this industry. While negotiations are still going on I will not make any politically divisive statements. The people on the north side of Cork city, however, are depending on the Government to deliver the necessary provisions to secure the future of the Sunbeam Wolsey plant which has given employment to generations of Cork people.</P>
    <P>Cork people are still concerned about the future of Irish Steel and this concern has increased substantially recently with the present uncertainty in relation to its takeover.  I would ask the Government to clarify the position not only for the sake of families of the workers in Irish Steel but for the sake of confidence in the region generally.  As I said on budget night, VAT on electricity will not help that plant.</P>
    <P>I am also disappointed that there was <Col N="1626" /> no mention of major construction projects in the budget.  I will deal specifically with the tunnel crossing of the River Lee.</P>

Last Wednesday night the Minister for the Environment said that there would not be a bob &mdash; and I am using his words &mdash; available from EC funding for storm damage.  I welcome the change of heart on this and I would ask him to look at the many areas in the Cork region which have suffered storm damage.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil's tradition has always been one of caring, particularly for the old, the sick and the less well off in our society.  The road back from the disaster days of the 1982-87 Coalition has not been easy and the legacy the Coalition left the nation plunged us into the depths of a financial crisis. In four short years they managed to double the National Debt from £12.5 billion to £25 billion.  Foreign debt increased by £4 billion.  Our budget deficit reached a record level of 8.5 per cent of GNP and interest rates were at record levels.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Government have put the country first.  We now control our own destiny.  Foreign debt has fallen.  The budget deficit is less than 1.5 per cent of GNP and interest rates are 5 per cent below the budget rate.</P>
      <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> is an integral part of the way forward.  It has been an outstanding success, in stark contrast to the hastily conceived and subsequently aborted <i>Building on Reality Programme</i> of those unsuitable bedfellows, Fine Gael and Labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am looking at this year's budget not only from an overall point of view but <Col N="1627" /> with particular reference to my own constituency. Dublin Central is an area which it is safe to say has residents in all social economic groupings and it could be assumed that everyone could not be facilitated in any one budget.  Budget 1990, however, has proved all the pundits wrong and, looking across the wide spectrum of its provisions, I can safely say that, in so far as was possible, all of my constituents have benefited to some degree from it.</P>
    <P>We can all agree that the most vital component of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> is job creation. Throughout the eighties we have repeatedly reminded the industrial and business sector that the creation of a healthy economic environment will enable them to provide the many jobs which we so badly require.  This type of environment has been put in place much faster than most people expected and we now have a situation which we would not have dreamed possible only three years ago.  I know there is widespread impatience that there is not always a flood of jobs appearing every week.  It must be remembered, however, that it takes time and careful planning before sustainable jobs can be created.  It is quite evident that over the past two years especially there has been an ever-increasing improvement and all the indicators for the future are good, based on the degree of international stability. We must always be looking for ways and means of speeding up the programme of job creation.  I am aware of the excellent small business programme which the IDA have been operating in recent years. In the last year for which I have figures, 1988, 4,150 jobs were created in small businesses, one third of all the first-time jobs in that year.  I assume that this trend will continue.  The small business programme has brought in direct employment grants together with a range of other helps and incentives.  Half of the grant is paid when the employee starts work and the remainder when the job is retained six months.  We are aware of the IDA's current and recent successes in attracting overseas industries.  I know <Col N="1628" /> that there is a misconception that the entire announced grant in these cases is paid out willingly and without much ado. This is of course not the case.  There is a performance clause built into the agreements and a large proportion of the grant must be repaid if the performance is not up to scratch.  Perhaps the Minister and those others concerned would look into the possibility of reconstructing the grants to new and existing industries so as to encourage them to bring extra jobs on stream at a faster rate.  In addition employers, large and small, would find it much easier to create extra jobs if the Minister's new PRSI employees exemption scheme could be directed at the first £60 per week of earnings at least for those single people earning £8,000 to £9,000 a year, the category which appears to have largely lost out in the income tax exemptions in the budget.  I know this would cost some extra millions to fund but perhaps the Minister, with his magic touch, could re-arrange his figures to make this possible, in other words, to invest in jobs and people rather than in machinery.</P>
    <P>The elderly must always be given special consideration.  In many cases we are talking about the people who in the early days of our State fought and worked for its future.  They deserve to be looked after because they are in no small way responsible for making our country what it is today, a modern society willing and more than able to take its place in a new Europe.  Thus I was glad to see the increases to pensioners which, in all cases, have outstripped the current and projected inflation rates.  The budget provides for a 8 per cent increase for widowers and widows, a 6 per cent increase in the non-contributory old age pension and a 6.7 per cent increase in contributory pensions.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Minister for Finance would like to have gone further but as things improve over the next few years, as they undoubtedly will, I am sure the elderly will be high on the priority list for increased payments.  Before leaving the subject of our senior citizens I must take this opportunity to condemn, in the strongest possible terms, the unfounded <Col N="1629" /> allegations against our health service, which I know are needlessly frightening people, particularly the elderly.  For some reason best known to themselves &mdash; the desire for cheap publicity, I suspect &mdash; several Opposition Deputies have taken it upon themselves to continually adopt scaremongering tactics by circulating stories regarding the health service which are misinformed and exaggerated.  I take this opportunity to accurately describe what they are, pure lies.  In my constituency there was a 40 per cent increase in admissions to hospitals during the period December-January compared with the same period 12 months ago. Additional beds have been made available and there are now more staff working in the health service while productivity in hospitals has increased substantially, due in no small way to the hard work of doctors and nurses.  The Minister for Health has announced in relation to home care services for the elderly that a number of steps will be taken during 1990 in the area of nursing homes, home helps as well as short-term and long-term community day care facilities. I am satisfied the Government are looking after the elderly.  If they were not doing so, neither I nor any member of the Government party could morally or otherwise support the budget in any shape or form.</P>
    <P>No one is naive enough to believe we have not got our problems with unemployment. As I said, it is a major problem and there is a duty on the Government to ensure that the people affected are looked after.  I welcome the announcement in the budget that there will be an 11 per cent increase in the rate of long-term unemployment assistance.  This is the third successive year that such an increase has been given.  Other unemployment assistance recipients will receive increases of at least 5 per cent, which will act as a cushion against the effects of inflation, expected to be in the order of between 3 per cent and 3.5 per cent, helped in no small way by the reduction in the VAT rate from 25 per cent to 23 per cent.  The budget made provision for a 10.2 per cent increase in <Col N="1630" /> the disabled person's maintenance allowance and a 6.7 per cent increase in unemployment benefit and disability benefit.</P>
    <P>When I hear the Opposition speak about poverty, my mind goes back to the time when Fine Gael wanted no social welfare increases in 1987.  The Labour Party proposed that an increase be deferred until November of that year. The poor received no special increases under Fine Gael or the so-called social partners, the Labour Party.  They received only the minimum increases which barely kept pace with inflation. The report of the Commission on Social Welfare was thrown out by the then Minister for Social Welfare, the former Deputy Gemma Hussey.</P>
    <P>Other social measures in this year's budget include the 10 per cent increase in child dependent allowance.  This is to be welcomed and, in relation to children, I particularly welcome the introduction of a clothing allowance from September. Many families experience much difficulty in providing their children's school and winter clothing and this measure will mean a lot to many people, particularly in my own constituency.</P>
    <P>I now wish to refer to those people who have had to give up their jobs to care for and look after elderly relatives at home. For a long time these people have been an added arm of the health service.  We must admit they were not rewarded in an adequate manner for the vital work they carried out, which in most, if not all, cases they do out of love and devotion and which if it were not carried out by them in an unselfish manner would place a further burden on the State services. The payment to these carers has been increased from £28 to £45 per week.  I welcome this increase, I urge the Minister to ensure that this matter is continually reappraised and recognised as vital work.</P>
    <P>In relation to women's affairs, as a former member of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights I am acutely aware of some of the problems facing women. I am also aware from speaking to many of my constituents that although we like to think that women do not find themselves in a disadvantaged position <Col N="1631" /> because of their sex that is not always the case.  I was pleased to see the Minister make provisions for a special allocation of £500,000 to be devoted to programmes for women.  Of this figure, £150,000 will be provided to the Rape Crisis Centre which over the years has meant a lot to rape victims.  I am convinced that in many cases the advice and the support it gave meant literally the difference between life and death to some victims.  In singling out and welcoming this measure, let me say I will be contacting the Minister for Justice to urge him to constantly reappraise sentencing policy; in other words, to regularly look at the law in relation to rape.</P>
    <P>Another problem we would like to think does not exist to the extent it does is child abuse.  Most people shy away from this problem.  A programme for child abuse prevention is being developed on a pilot basis by staff of the Eastern Health Board in a number of primary schools in the Dublin area.  This programme has the support of all the main parties in the primary school sector and the special grant announced by the Minister in the budget is to be welcomed. This programme deserves our full support, both financial and otherwise.</P>
    <P>In my own constituency of Dublin Central there are many old houses.  In recent years I have been concerned about the house improvement grant scheme which is being phased out.  Although the idea behind setting up the scheme was, possibly, a good one, the scheme was poorly managed and under-funded and in many ways did a certain amount of harm.  I appeal to the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Finance to look at the question of refurbishment as it costs a great deal of money to maintain old houses.  It is nice to see row after row of old houses in the centre of the city but they are extremely costly to maintain, in particular roofs and windows.  I ask the Minister to consider funding a new scheme of refurbishment grants.  These would be of vital importance in the older parts of our cities and towns.  I hope he <Col N="1632" /> will give this matter serious consideration during the next few months.</P>
    <P>Taxation has always been a sore point. The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> is committed to a significant reduction in both direct and indirect taxation.  The process has been started.  Both personal taxation and VAT rates were reduced by the Minister in the budget.  The top rate of tax was reduced from 56 per cent to 53 per cent and is now 12 per cent lower than it was under the Coalition Government of Fine Gael and Labour.  The standard rate of 32 per cent is now down to 30 per cent and the 25 per cent rate of tax now looks like being reality in the next three years.  We all look forward to that.  When Fianna Fáil came into power in 1987 a 25 per cent rate of income tax was but a pipe dream, but the enormous improvements in our economy have led to the dream becoming reality.  Furthermore, it is envisaged that almost two-thirds of taxpayers will be at the standard rate of tax by 1993.</P>
    <P>As a further incentive to employment, tax exemption limits for low paid workers have already been increased, with a limit for a married couple now of £6,500, and a family with five children, not uncommon in my constituency, will be exempt from tax at an income of up to £8,000 a year.</P>
    <P>A tradition of part-time work is also a feature of Dublin Central and a big bonus to many people is the new exemption from PRSI for workers currently paying full rates whose gross earnings are £60 or less per week.  In effect this means these workers will be exempt from their share of PRSI but their entitlement to full benefit will continue.  That has to be welcome because when it was discussed in relation to PRSI it was considered they might lose some of the benefits.  I hope this will obviate the situation of people being employed and not having PRSI paid for them.</P>
    <P>As we look forward to 1992 and the single market we must take cognisance of the necessary changes in our taxation scheme.  VAT rate reductions in particular will be a costly measure, but, undaunted, the Minister has set aside £78 <Col N="1633" /> million this year to reduce the VAT rate from 25 per cent to 23 per cent.  Even at this rate VAT is high, but remember the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition put VAT up to 35 per cent in 1983.  The benefit of the 2 per cent reduction will be widespread, with many commodities, food and others, reducing in price to the customer.  I have no doubt that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, will be vigilant to ensure that these reductions take place.</P>
    <P>In line with EC harmonisation it was necessary for VAT on electricity to be increased from 5 per cent to 10 per cent, and I am pleased to note that the Minister arranged with the ESB to absorb this. VAT on telephone bills has been introduced at 10 per cent and I am sure the Minister's confidence that this can be implemented without additional cost to telephone users will be borne out.</P>
    <P>It has always been a feature of the budget that the old reliables such as drink, cigarettes and petrol were hit.  This year there is no change in excise duties on these commodities.  Indeed, with the VAT rate change they should decrease in price.  While these measures are sure to please most people, in relation to non-alcohol drinkers the reduction of 20 per cent in duty on soft drinks is welcomed. I have always been concerned about the effects of teenage drinking, and any measure that lessens the presssure on teenagers to drink alcohol in public places and public houses will get my full support. Too often the difference in price between a soft drink and an alcoholic drink in a pub is so marginal that there is no incentive but to drink alcohol.  I will be particularly interested to ensure that soft drinks are subsequently reduced in price.  The two speakers previous to me mentioned the high cost of non-alcoholic drinks particularly in relation to young people.</P>
    <P>Two relatively small but nonetheless extremely important measures deserve mention.  Both affect people and their way of life.  The first is the special doubling of allocations for adult literacy to £1 million.  There are estimated to be over 100,000 adults in this country who have varying degrees of reading and writing <Col N="1634" /> difficulties.  I know some such people and I hope this increased allocation will be of benefit to many.  Something the rest of us take for granted should not be denied to others because of lack of money.  I wish this scheme every success.  In 1990, which is Adult Literacy Year, I hope this will receive more attention from Government Departments, the media and the public at large.  We are all concerned about the environment and the damage we have done to the earth in the past. Indeed, it is now known that even if we were at this moment to stop the pollution the earth would still continue to deteriorate for the next 25 years purely as a result of our past actions.  What little this country can do we must do.  In this respect I note the reduction of 10 per cent in the tax on lead-free petrol, giving a price difference of 10p per gallon between leaded and unleaded.  I commend the Minister on the reduction on LPG by 50 per cent which makes a difference of an almost unbelievable 45p per gallon.  That massive drop in the price of LPG, an environmentally friendly fuel, should be published more.</P>
    <P>Over the years I have urged a system of positive discrimination in relation to the education of people from the disadvantaged areas.  As I have mentioned, all the socio-economic groupings are represented within the inner city area in my constituency, where unemployment can go up to 60 or maybe 70 per cent.  The problems there are financial, economic and educational, and anything that will help to alleviate them I really welcome. I welcome the announcement in the Budget Statement that the allocation of funds for disadvantaged schools has been almost trebled from £0.6 million to £1.5 million, and that is additional to the 125 extra teaching posts announced recently by the Minister for Education.  I will be personally in touch with her to ensure that some of these will go to Dublin Central.</P>
    <P>Only by providing a sound financial footing and a strong economy can we hope to achieve our European aim. <Col N="1635" /> Ireland is a small nation, yet will rightfully take its place in the new Europe. This budget has gone a long way to making this country financially strong and secure.  Over the past few years we have successfully turned the tide in our favour. We control our own destiny and in the hands of this Government our destiny can only be one of prosperity.  This budget is a vital and important part of the groundwork involved in making our future secure.  It is readily admitted by all sides that it will succeed in its aims.</P>
    <P>The greatest testimony to the acceptance and success of this budget is the extent of the Opposition reaction to it over the past week or so.  I think it is fair to say that the whimpering of Fine Gael, the whining of the Labour Party and the whinnying of The Workers' Party taken together have not enough huff and puff to blow any house down, and particularly this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>The opening financial position of the Minister for Finance placed him in a very strong position to implement radical changes in the economy. Our reduced borrowing requirement is due entirely to Deputy Dukes's Tallaght strategy whereby he gave conditional support to Fianna Fáil provided they adopted the Fine Gael strategy of reducing public expenditure and the borrowing requirement to an acceptable level.  This the Minister carried out with our help and the success of this strategy speaks for itself.  Yet in spite of this good economic climate there are possible storm clouds on the horizon which need to be watched carefully.  For instance, 21 per cent of current expenditure for 1990 is to service the interest on the debt. Much will depend on the trend in interest rates prevailing throughout the year.  If they rise further, the cost to the Exchequer of servicing the debt will increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us now look at the revenue side. Once again, income tax at 34.9 per cent will provide the main source of revenue. Again, sadly the PAYE taxpayer is being asked to share too great a burden.  If I <Col N="1636" /> were to make positive comments on the budget they are on the following.  I greatly welcome the increase to £45 per week in the allowance paid to the carers of the elderly.  However, there are many relatives caring for old people in their homes without adequate remuneration.  The increase in the allowance is greatly welcomed, but I add a word of caution. There are 66,000 carers, but to date only 22,000 are in a position to receive the carers allowance.  This is due to the grave restrictions placed on people before they are eligible to receive the allowance.  I believe the positive elements of the carer's allowance will be totally eroded if the eligibility guidelines are too restrictive and too severe.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the increased allocation, although not nearly adequate, to the mentally handicapped.  These children and their parents need help.  The good work of the centres such as those in my own constituency, Scoil Cormac, Scoil Aongusha, and the day care centre in Cashel has gone largely unnoticed by the State.  The voluntary organisations such as the associations for the mentally handicapped are in many cases providing the facilities and services that should be provided by the State.  Far too often their contribution is taken for granted or ignored but if it were not for them the Government would be in a very embarrassing position regarding their contribution to the provision of services for the mentally handicapped.  Despite the increased allocation in the budget, the schools in my constituency will still be without the services of a speech therapist, social worker and psychologist.</P>
    <P>If this budget was to have the correct emphasis, it should have focused on the following areas: employment creation, reducing emigration, alleviating poverty, attending to the problems of agriculture and those of rural areas.  The Government aim to create 20,000 new jobs this year.  This is not enough.  This target is far too low as unemployment has increased dramatically yet again.  The unemployment figure for 1989 was 232,000 people.  This level of unemployment is frightening and is indicative of the <Col N="1637" /> Government's failure to create employment, with its consequent high cost to the State.  If the Government were really serious about the problem, the Minister should have been far more adventurous in creating a mechanism to encourage employers and manufacturers to employ more people.  Of course this would require a dramatic reduction in the level of PRSI to both the employer and the employee together with a reduction in taxation levels.</P>
    <P>There is something wrong with Government policy when, in order to reward somebody, an employer has to pay £3 so that an employee gets £1.  There is a need to encourage mature, well-educated people who have both the ideas and initiative from the private and public sector to go out and start up their own businesses.  They need to be encouraged by the provision of risk capital and leave of absence from their place of employment. Second, and equally important, there is a need to encourage small indigenous Irish industries to expand. This could be done by the provision of interest-free loans and the employment of experts to help run their businesses.</P>
    <P>The PAYE taxation relief does very little to help people at work.  What has really gone unnoticed is that the personal allowance of £2,500 for a single person and £4,100 for a couple has not been altered.  Even though the tax rates have been reduced from 56 per cent to 53 per cent and from 32 per cent to 30 per cent, this will have little effect on the take-home pay of the lower income groups, who need it most of all.  The balance is totally in favour of the better off.  For example a single person earning £5,000 per annum will take home an extra 75p per week, whereas a person earning £30,000 per annum will take home an extra £15 per week.  Similarly, a married couple earning £10,000 per annum will take home an extra £1.80 per week, whereas a couple with an income of £30,000 will take home an extra £13 per week.  I believe this proves there is an imbalance in taxation.  While I totally agree with reducing the rate of tax from 56 per cent to 53 per cent, not enough <Col N="1638" /> benefit will accrue to the low paid.  This is a sad reflection on the Government's attitude to those in the lower income groups.</P>
    <P>The most urgent and pressing problem on families in south Tipperary, as all over the country, is emigration.  Approximately 40,000 people emigrated in 1989, comprising in the main poorly skilled young people who could not secure employment at home and not well educated people who perhaps emigrate to gain experience and to further their career.  The towns and villages of south Tipperary have been decimated by emigration on the part of many young people to another land to which they have no wish to go.  When one speaks to any GAA or rugby club member one will be told how difficult they experience it to field a team in their parishes.  There is much talk of many parish clubs having to amalgamate in order to keep games going.  I urge the Minister to provide a subsidy of perhaps 50 per cent of the air fares of genuine club players to enable them return home to play games, thereby maintaining them in contact with their native clubs.  This too would keep individual clubs going while maintaining young players in contact with their homes.</P>
    <P>I hear much talk of the great future there is in this country.  Nonetheless my judgment is influenced by the scores of people who travel by Slattery coaches from the towns of Tipperary, Cashel, Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir to England each weekend, whose numbers last year were greater than ever, again reflecting the high level of emigration.  It is my belief that the post-budget period will see no improvement in that respect.</P>
    <P>My next concern is with the level of poverty obtaining, much of it hidden, in our towns and villages.  While the social welfare budgetary increases proposed are to be welcomed, they do not go far enough.  Father Seán Healy, co-ordinator of the Justice Office of the Conference of Major Religious Orders, has estimated that up to 36.4 per cent or one million people live in poverty.  The Government must now take initiatives likely to create jobs, co-ordinating job creating policies <Col N="1639" /> with taxation so that the unemployed will be allowed contribute to their development and that of their community without losing their social welfare benefits.  I contend social welfare payments should be raised quickly to the minimum levels recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare &mdash; to £60 a week for single people and £96 a week for couples.  Equally I contend that the long-term unemployed, those over 55, should be allowed receive their social welfare benefit without the necessity for signing on at labour exchanges week in week out.  In addition unemployed people should be allowed receive their full social welfare entitlements while engaged in any form of education.</P>
    <P>From an agricultural point of view the budget has been disappointing, a strong, dynamic agricultural industry constituting the backbone of our economy. Likewise the budget has failed to tackle the elimination of TB and brucellosis, creating enormous hardships for farmers. Government bungling of this scheme over so many years has been unbelievable. Yet the Minister refuses to adequately compensate farmers compelled to dispose of reactors to factories. The financial implications of a serious TB or brucellosis outbreak are formidable, if not shattering, as any farmer or banker will confirm, the incidence of such outbreaks having been the cause of financial disaster for many farmers.</P>
    <P>A second major issue in agriculture today is represented by the low incomes of beef and cereal farmers, many of whom now experience difficulty in surviving. This aspect is highlighted by the statistics contained in the management survey carried out by Teagasc.  Yet the Government have done little about it.  To his credit, the leader of the IFA, Mr. Gillis, saw fit to by-pass the Department of Agriculture and go directly to the Commission in Brussels in an endeavour to explain the inherent problems and seek a solution. Within an industry where exports are so important, it is unbelievable that the real problems of the low incomes of beef and <Col N="1640" /> cereal farmers continue to be overlooked. In agriculture, as in all economic activity, there must be a balance struck and a sense of direction to Government economic policies with, above all, an incentive to invest.  After all it was investment on the part of private industry and companies that lifted Japan and Germany out of their former poverty to the prosperity they enjoy today.</P>
    <P>There has been total failure to provide any incentives for investment in agriculture in this budget.  The enforcement of a régime under which the bulk of all capital investment is to be paid out of income tax at 53 per cent is wrong and stupid.  In recent times Irish agriculture has been starved of investment.  These latest budgetary provisions do little, if anything, to rectify that position.  On the one hand the Government demand the erection of expensive buildings and farmyard renovations to deal with pollution control while the only incentive they offer are delayed grant payments for such investment.  Apart from the control of pollution, I can honestly say that little or no investment has taken place in agriculture in recent times.  There was no hope of any such investment prior to the introduction of this budget and none thereafter.</P>
    <P>Another problem being experienced by farmers today is that of inheritance tax, constituting a major burden on many of them.  The Minister went halfway to easing that burden by indexing the allowances. Surely the threshold should have been reviewed; in other words, indexing should have applied retrospectively. What was originally intended as a wealth tax represents a severe burden on many farming families today, families barely in receipt of a viable income.  As a result, the inheritance of a farm today constitutes more of a burden than a privilege. It is regrettable that in this latest budget the Minister did not go the whole way to deal with this enormous problem.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increased allocation for agricultural education which, when one thinks about it, is merely abolishing discrimination against those who pursued an <Col N="1641" /> agricultural education which had been allowed obtain for far too long.</P>
    <P>The problem of how rural areas can be maintained intact constitutes a major issue of concern to all of us today.  I include all rural towns and villages, where people should be encouraged to live. Industries and factories must be attracted to these areas with roads and services being improved.  It would be my hope that the new regional college in Thurles will soon be opened and will encompass a rural development institute because it is in such places that the problems of rural areas can be tackled and solutions found.</P>
    <P>There was much talk of prudent management of our economy in the Minister's Budget Statement, yet funds continue to be wasted continuously.  There appears to be a greater willingness on the part of this Government to spend millions of pounds on, say, a hype of the EC Presidency than mere thousands more sensibly. Eventually the Government will have to listen to the voice of the people and take real notice of their needs.  It is not sufficient to merely address those needs with clichés about democracy.  The introduction of this latest budget afforded them a real opporunity to heed people's needs and address their wishes.</P>
    <P>All of us politicians must endeavour to right the wrongs prevailing in our society, to eliminate the imbalances, lifting those at the bottom of the scale.  The budgetary provisions failed to rectify the inequalities and injustices prevailing in our society.  The budget failed the voiceless, the poorer sections of our community.  It contained very little worthy of praise and much too much worthy of criticism.  Our people deserve better.  Their needs and wishes should be listened to.  I urge the Government to do so because they failed miserably in this latest budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Noonan, Limerick West) Michael J. (Limerick West) Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick West):</i> I am glad to have this opportunity to contribute to this budget debate.  As we face into a new decade we also face an open European market of 320 million people, constituting a real new challenge. <Col N="1642" /> If we are to be successful in that challenge we must adopt a progressive attitude. This is no time for looking back over our shoulders, dwelling on what happened in the past or on what should have been done.</P>
      <P>We sometimes assume that we have lessons to learn only from the European Community.  That is not so. We should be looking also toward Eastern Europe, many of whose nations face challenges even greater than ours and with great courage.  They have torn down many barriers in order to gain independence.  We have that independence but we must now confront the challenges ahead of us.  In producing so realistic a budget, in producing so humane a budget, in producing so controlled a budget, my colleague, the Minister for Finance, has taken the first step on the vital road in front of us.  As each and every person knows, along with the opportunities there are also many pitfalls and problems.  At times it will not be easy but nothing worth while was ever easy.</P>
      <P>People may say why was this not done or why was that not done, but the vast majority of the public are more than pleased with this budget.  The only opposition is ritual opposition, the sort of opposition you would expect to get to something worth while.  Opposition speakers realise it is a very good budget, a very good budget that they did not have a hand in, a very good budget that does not require a so-called national consensus as back-up.  It is a good budget, full stop.</P>
      <P>At the moment our main priority is to create more jobs and this budget is central to achieving that.  When Fianna Fáil came to office on 10 March 1987, our economy was in tatters and national morale was at an all-time low.  Since then Mount Everest has been conquered in monetary terms.  The way the national finances are being tackled is the only way. There will be a payoff; there already has been a payoff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This budget will ease a lot of the problems and heartache for our social welfare recipients.  There have been increases of 5 per cent across the board and 11 per cent of an increase to our long-term <Col N="1643" /> unemployed, bringing their income to £52 a week.  This will allow them to raise their heads in their local communities.  Also in this budget there are two new significant schemes in the social welfare area.  There is a clothing allowance, which will be operated through the supplementary welfare allowance and will assist families in particular difficulties to provide for their children's school and winter clothing.  Also there is a new carers' allowance.  This £45 per week will be paid to people in respect of certain relatives who care on a full-time basis at home for such persons.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which was signed in 1987 by the Government and all the social partners has been an outstanding success with an average growth rate of 3.5 per cent.  This, and the reduction in Government borrowing from £2,145 million in 1986, or 13 per cent of GNP, to £449 million or 2 per cent of GNP in 1990 have created a sense of optimism, a sense of direction.  They are seen as glaring examples of prudent management of our economy.</P>
    <P>If I may jog your memory without going into too much detail on the public finances: back in 1982 to 1987 when the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition were in office, our debt-GNP ratio rose from 94 per cent to 130 per cent and national debt doubled from £12.5 billion to £25 billion. Foreign debt increased by £4,000 million and our budget deficit reached an all-time record of 8.5 per cent of GNP.  As I said, we want to look to the future and I think we can do so with confidence.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil's strong management of the economy since the Government took office less than three years ago has meant that the national debt has fallen by a staggering £100 million and our budget deficit has been reduced to less than 1.5 per cent of GNP.  The main reason our position has been enhanced is because <i>Building on Reality</i> was a complete failure and the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> has been an outstanding success. Fianna Fáil's success was by reducing expenditure.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, our priority must be to create more jobs.  At the <Col N="1644" /> moment our unemployment rate is still too high.  This Government are doing their utmost to create the right environment for expansions of existing industries and the creation of new industry. The expansion of the social employment scheme to cater for an additional 5,000 people and a new employment training scheme will upgrade and sharpen people's skills, thus enhancing their opportunities of obtaining employment. The IDA, Shannon Development and many other agencies are promoting Ireland as an ideal location for foreign industry to set up.  It helps that, thanks to the Government's agreement with the social partners, the number of work days lost due to strikes has dropped significantly and continues to drop.  This is a major incentive for an outside company to set up here.</P>
    <P>Limerick, the capital of the mid-west, is at present going through a period which could be called an economic miracle unparalled in its history.  At present £55 million worth of investment is taking place.  There is, for the first time, a mediaeval precinct with the focal point being King John's Castle which when restored fully will bring an estimated 200,000 extra people to the city.</P>
    <P>The convention centre at Limerick race course is also at an advanced planning stage and, hopefully, will be completed early next year.  These projects with world rate standing will be instrumental in the success in 1991 of arrangments to mark the tercentenary of the Siege of Limerick.</P>
    <P>On the agricultural front, farming is going through a very productive phase. We have received an extra 11 million gallons of milk which will be distributed to farmers with small milk quotas, to new entrants to the dairy scene and to others. Farmers in rural corners of the country will receive large cash injections due to the upgrading of the disadvantaged areas. Details of the survey which was carried out will be presented to Government and will be available very shortly.  Then the list of areas will be submitted to the EC Commission in Brussels for approval.  As <Col N="1645" /> announced by the Minister for Agriculture and Food, it is also the intention to introduce an appeal system after the EC approves the list of areas to be designated or reclassified on foot of the data gathered during the nationwide survey. This will ensure that there is no undue delay in getting submissions to Brussels.</P>
    <P>There has been exceptional growth in forestry planting, in mushroom growing and in fish farming which I will go into later.  Sheep numbers have more than doubled since 1980.  Many sectors of the economy are experiencing dynamic growth and development based on renewed confidence in the economic and fiscal management by the Government.</P>
    <P>Exports have been buoyant over the last three years.  For the second year running, we will have a trade surplus in excess of £2 billion which is equivalent to 10 per cent of GNP.  Very few countries outside of south-east Asia are able to show a comparable performance.  We will also have a balance of payments surplus for the third year running, which is virtually unprecedented.</P>
    <P>Farmers will also benefit from this budget with the flat-rate VAT refund to farmers being increased to 2.3 per cent. This is an extra £6 million in the farmers' pocket in 1990.  People have said that Ireland is the begging bowl of the EC.  A disadvantaged area in west Limerick is no different from a disadvantaged area in Germany, France or elsewhere.  If Irish farmers are to be successful and are to stay on the land, they will have to add value to their area.  We must accept that each of us is European, but that does not mean that we cannot also be Irish.</P>
    <P>As I have outlined earlier, this country is benefiting very significantly from being a member of the EC.  A total of £539 million in assistance will be available to Ireland from the Structural Funds this year.  In addition, some £18 million of commitments from the Social Fund in 1989 will be carried forward to this year, bringing a total of assistance to £557 million.</P>
    <P>We must not forget, as far as our <Col N="1646" /> exports are concerned, that the European market will be our biggest breadwinner, and even more so when the market will be open to all trade activities in 1992.  One of the major achievements of last year was to secure funding of up to £3 billion for the National Development Plan.  This plan will enable us to improve the competitiveness and the productive capacity of our economy, and to fund investment in both enterprise and infrastructure. Three years ago our economy was in a weak condition to face the challenges of the Single Market but today we can look forward to it with a reasonable degree of confidence.</P>
    <P>The new Civic Centre which will house the entire staff of Limerick Corporation, will be occupied within a week.  This is in the heart of the heritage precinct.  Early next year the Revenue Commissioners will be decentralised to Limerick and this will put up to £1 million in circulation in this city.  People could call Limerick a city on the move as it is going through transformation from being an old city to being a completely new city.  All this will be for the betterment of the people.</P>
    <P>National morale was never as high. People are more than happy with the policy decisions being taken and, above all, there is a very high degree of co-operation among all concerned.  This will enhance the competitiveness of Ireland as a nation, thus generating as much self-sustaining employment as possible.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> has identified the marine sector as being capable of generating more wealth through increased employment, output and exports.  The marine sector contributes significantly to employment and incomes in areas where the need is most acute and there are few alternative sources of employment.</P>
    <P>This Government's commitment to develop our national resources is contained in the National Development Plan which envisages a total capital investment of £45 million in the fish processing sector over the plan period.  Investment on this scale has the potential to attract £20 million in aid from the guidance section of the European Agricultural guidance and <Col N="1647" /> Guarantee Fund.  Indeed, in 1989 a total of £4 million was awarded to Irish fish processing projects.</P>
    <P>State support for this sector is directed towards achieving the objective of building a strong internationally competitive fish processing sector.  The attainment of this goal will involve the optimum utilisation of raw material supplies by the processing sector through appropriate financial support, investigation of new alternative sources of supply, quality improvement and strengthened marketing. The prospect of achieving this objective has been greatly enhanced by the adoption on 19 December 1989, of Council Regulation (EC) No. 4042/89 on the improvement of the conditions under which fishery and aquaculture products are processed and marketed.  This regulation was adopted within the framework of the reform of the Community's Structural Funds.  The regulation sets out a number of objectives, the most important of which with regard to the Irish fish processing industry is that EC financing should (i) contribute to the economic and social cohesion of the Community and (ii) take account of the needs of the Community's less-favoured regions.  In accordance with the provisions of this regulation Irish fish processing projects qualify for EC assistance up to a maximum of 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>Regulation 4042/89 will be of particular importance to the fish processing sector as it prepares for the single market in 1992.  Indeed I would point out that the fish processing sector has entered a significant new phase which is characterised by greater integration, operational scale, cohesiveness and professionalism. Market demand varies from species to species but products based on whitefish, farmed salmon and shellfish and prepared sea food meals show strong signs of growth.  Availablility of fish supplies will, however, be central to the realisation of these opportunities.  The main objective is to create maximum value-added and employment in Ireland which of course, is our primary concern.</P>
    <P>Since their inception in 1987 the <Col N="1648" /> Department of the Marine have given a high priority to protection of the marine environment from the damaging effects of pollution.  My Department controls dumping at sea operations by means of permits under the Dumping at Sea Act, 1981.  Dumping is only allowed where this option is considered environmentally acceptable and is the only practical solution available for disposal.  Each application to dump at sea must include details of the considerations given to alternative methods of disposal and each dump site is monitored to ensure that there are no harmful effects on the marine environment.</P>
    <P>Measures are being taken to reduce the prospect of pollution by dumping at sea.  As part of its obligations under the Oslo Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping from Ships and Aircraft, Ireland has agreed to the cessation of the dumping of industrial waste at sea by end 1995.  The Taoiseach, in announcing Ireland's Green EC Presidency, pledged cessation of the dumping of sewage sludge at sea by 1998.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Marine have an ongoing marine monitoring programme which places particular emphasis on our waste disposal sites at sea.</P>
    <P>My Department hope to have a Sea Pollution Bill placed before the Oireachtas this year.  This Bill is intended to update the Oil Pollution of the Sea Acts, 1956 to 1977, and to give effect in domestic law to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978, known as Marpol 73/78. Marpol covers the prevention of pollution from substances as follows: oil i.e. noxious liquid substances, harmful substances, sewage and garbage from ships. The Bill will also give effect to a 1973 Protocol to the 1969 Convention on Intervention on the High Seas.  The Intervention Protocol empowers states to take action in relation to ships on the high seas which may threaten pollution by substances other than oil.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Marine have a pollution operations group who are activated when there is a threat of or spillage <Col N="1649" /> of oil or other pollutant.  The group are currently directing and controlling operations to minimise damage to the coastline and mussel beds in Bantry Bay consequent on the recent incident involving the 68,000 tonne bulk carrier <i>Tribulus</i> with 122,000 tonnes of iron ore on board which has taken refuge in Bantry Bay.</P>
    <P>One of my responsibilities in the Department of the Marine is the area of search and rescue.  The State, as a signatory to the Convention on the High Seas (1958) and the Convention on Safety of Life at Sea (1974) is required to provide a maritime search and rescue organisation. The whole area of search and rescue has attracted considerable media and public attention in recent times.</P>
    <P>Indeed, it was with great sorrow I heard the news of the tragic death of leading seaman Michael Quinn, who lost his life while trying to rescue stricken trawlermen off the Cork coast recently. I would like to take this opportunity to sympathise with his brother and sisters.</P>
    <P>As you are all aware, the Review Group on Air/Sea Rescue which was established in February of last year, is due to report shortly.  The recommendations in the report will be worth-while and we all look forward with interest to examining it and eventually presenting it to the Government.</P>
    <P>This budget will enable all social partners to work with the Government on the strong foundations laid in 1987.  We can look to the future with optimism, confidence, trust and hope, particularly in relation to our young people.  We can go forward in this decade with the same spirit of confidence &mdash; the Government working with the social partners &mdash; as we have done over the past three years.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister of State, like his colleagues in Government, is glad to see the people <Col N="1650" /> who are sick and tired of the Government's policies leaving the country because opposition is disappearing.  The country is denuded but the opposition is disappearing to the United States, London, Australia and elsewhere.  We hear glib phrases now and then about the upwardly mobile, highly educated Irish who can go to any country in the world and do well for themselves.  That is a lot of nonsense.  It is my view that only onetenth of our emigrants leave the country voluntarily.</P>
      <P>The economic and social policy pursued since 1987, and continued by the new coalition, is decided and controlled by one factor, the size of the national debt.  That is the big frightener and that is the excuse for all cut backs and decisions in regard to the economy.  The disadvantaged, the handicapped, whether mental or physical, are deprived so that the Government can pay the banks.  The education of our children is made more unequal so that the Government can pay the banks.  Our health services and local government services have been destroyed although taxes are increasing because the Government must pay the banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The simple policy of the Government is to increase unemployment, increase poverty so that they can pay off the banks.  In the last decade taxes have been abolished for certain sectors.  I imagine that we have the only Government in the world who have abolished a series of taxes in recent years.  Fianna Fáil abolished road tax, rates, wealth tax, land tax, reduced capital gains tax and, in the budget, reduced corporation tax from 43 per cent to 40 per cent.  That reduction took place at a time when everybody expected that it would be increased. We have continuously pointed to where money can be got to pay the national debt or for health and education services but our suggestions have not been accepted. We have pointed out that our property tax, our wealth and corporation taxes are the lowest in Europe and among the lowest in the world.  Our rich are allowed to get off the hook while the poor must <Col N="1651" /> pay the banks for our terrible national debt.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that Ceausescu, the infamous Romanian right wing leader, impoverished the economy of his country by putting everything on the line to pay off the national debt.  He went so far as to export food which was badly needed by his people in order to obtain money to pay off the national debt.  The Taoiseach, and others, constantly turn on me about Romania but I should like to ask them how Romania accumulated that debt.  Ceausescu accumulated it because he was great friends of people like George Bush and Margaret Thatcher.  In fact, Margaret Thatcher brought Ceausescu to England and had him decorated by the Queen.  She had to rush to remove that decoration before Christmas to clear the books lest it could be said by future generations that she was great friends with Ceausescu.  That is the kind of man he was, the kind of support he had and that is why he was given all the facilities of the IMF.  He succeeded in accumulating a national debt that was greater than ours and he wrecked the economy and impoverished his people to pay it off.</P>
    <P>There are great similarities between our Government and leader and the former leader of the Romanian government. They have private islands, private dachas, private helicopters and great wealth.  There are probably gold taps in Kinsealy just as there were in Ceausescu's bathroom.  There are similarities between the two countries.  My main point is that Ceausescu, by concentrating on paying off the national debt, impoverished his own people and that is precisely the line being taken by the Government and the Taoiseach.  It is the Taoiseach who decides the line to be taken by the Government.</P>
    <P>Economists and commentators in the media expected that in the budget corporate taxes would be increased and taxes on labour would be reduced.  We have been shouting for many years that the taxes on labour were too high and that the taxes on capital were too low.  It is marvellous to see that even the PD's are <Col N="1652" /> pushing that line.  However, Fianna Fáil do not accept it.</P>
    <P>As spokesman for my party on Education, I should like to refer to how education was treated in the budget.  In the famous <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> there is reference to the Government recognising the importance of the educational system in the promotion of equity in society.  One would have expected that following that statement something would have been done to promote equity but that has not happened. That programme stated the burden of adjustment in the economy would not fall on the disadvantaged.  It stated that various measures would be taken to assist disadvantaged groups such as the physically handicapped and so on.  It stated that the Government would continue to encourage and foster the participation of the disadvantaged at all levels of education.  We were told that the numbers from disadvantaged areas going on to third level education would be increased.  However, far from assisting those people the Government have seriously cut back on education.  There have been cutbacks in the area of remedial education, psychological services and so on.  Inequalities in society have increased to such an extent that I am amazed that any of the three teachers' unions voted for the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  The funny thing is that the one union that voted against that programme, the ASTI, is the one whose support the Taoiseach expected he had.  I am sure he expected that the general secretary of that union would bring in the votes for him but he failed to do so.  I would not like to be in his shoes.</P>
    <P>The Government did not live up to their <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> The Minister for Education made commitments in regard to pupils with special needs but they have been broken.  Her treatment of pupils with special needs is a bad omen for education.  The Minister broke commitments in regard to remedial teachers and the psychological service.  In July, again in the autumn and before Christmas, we were told that extra remedial teachers would be appointed <Col N="1653" /> and a school psychological service pilot project would be instituted in 1989 but now, well into 1990, that project has not been implemented.  It is important to note that two-thirds of our primary schools do not have the services of a remedial teacher.  There is no Department of Education service for primary pupils in need of psychological assessment.</P>
    <P>The children involved have particular needs and it is almost unbelievable that the Minister would make repeated promises and fail to deliver to those pupils who are in need.  The Minister's assurances were all the harder to take seriously when recent figures showed that at least 26,000 pupils are still in classes of more than 40 pupils.  That is taking place despite the assurances two years ago by the Minister that 39 would be the highest number of pupils to any class.  The Minister gave a figure of 26.7, or something of that nature as the class size.  In fact, the majority of classes in the growing suburban areas I represent in Dublin West average 34 and many are over 40 pupils per teacher.  There must be immediate action on class size to implement the promises given 18 months or two years ago on class sizes and also on remedial teaching and the psychological service.</P>
    <P>The problem with remedial teaching is that we do not even know what schools have remedial teachers doing that work. While they have remedial teachers, those teachers must do ordinary subject teaching because of the lack of staff.  Trained remedial teachers are now doing ordinary classwork.  While the Department of Education may say there are so many remedial teachers in a school, in fact, there may be none because they are teaching ordinary classes and do not have time to do the remedial teaching.  This is an absolute shambles of an educational service and it is an absolute disgrace that this should be happening in the nineties. We do not have the remedial teaching service and we do not have the schools psychological service.</P>
    <P>We want immediate implementation of the promises made and also an expanding <Col N="1654" /> service for the disadvantaged areas in accordance with the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  I dislike that term &ldquo;disadvantaged areas&rdquo; because it appears to suggest it was accidental or that they just happened to be disadvantaged.  They are disadvantaged because of the policies of this Government and previous Governments through the years who ensured they were disadvantaged because that is what the policy of ignorance is all about.  There was a great poster around the city about 18 months ago about the politics of ignorance: educate that you may be free, as Thomas Davis said.  The other side of that coin is, keep them ignorant and you keep them in slavery; that is what it is all about.  These areas are deliberately disadvantaged by the Government.  The lack of remedial teachers causes major problems such as destructive pupils in classes.  This is a very serious problem in many schools in urban areas where there are larger classes. There are social problems in the family or general social problems in the area of unemployment and deprivation etc. Therefore, the children in the schools need much more care, remedial teaching, guidance, counselling and psychological service than in many other areas, which they do not have.  This causes serious disruption in some schools where there may be ten, 15 or even 20 or 30 very destructive pupils.  This can bring the whole school to a standstill and it can ruin the education of the other 90 per cent as well as the children themselves who need very special attention.  That is happening in schools of which I am aware.</P>
    <P>I have written to the Minister about this problem in some specific schools, but the Minister's reply has been very unsatisfactory.  The principal of one school wrote to me pointing out that what you do not spend on education today you will spend tenfold on prisons tomorrow. He is absolutely right.  The Minister needs to address the question of remedial teaching very rapidly.  Decisions are also being made by the Department which the Minister should kick out the window.  I cannot understand how Departments of Education are allowed to get away with these <Col N="1655" /> decisions against the wishes, possibly, of Ministers but certainly the same policies go from one Government to another and eventually they are implemented.</P>
    <P>I wonder how the five year cycle began. That is another area of inequality.  A five year cycle is imposed on the public education system and yet the private schools have a six year cycle.  The very pupils who need the six year cycle do not get it.  It is a two-tier educational system and I think it is deliberate.  It is wrong that the Minister should allow these Department policies to be implemented, to be put into effect without taking into consideration the effect they are having on the children. The Minister should restore the six year cycle to all VEC and community and comprehensive schools which have not got it.</P>
    <P>In relation to guidance counsellors, we do not get any information or statistics from the Department.  It is very interesting that the Institute of Guidance Counsellors recently produced some statistics, following their national survey in second level schools, in regard to guidance counsellors.  It is an absolute disgrace that 22 per cent of schools have no guidance counsellors whatsoever, others have a guidance counsellor but they have to deal with so many pupils they might as well not be there at all.  They found also that vocational schools have been most severely deprived of a professional guidance and counselling service.</P>
    <P>I find it rather strange that in the Department of Education there appears to be a constant and deliberate attempt to run down the VEC system; 34 per cent of VEC schools have no guidance counsellors, 18 per cent of other secondary schools have no guidance counsellors and 5 per cent of community and comprehensive schools have no guidance counsellors, while 19 per cent have only a part-time service.  The inequality is being deliberately fomented and pushed and, far from eliminating inequities in society and in our education system as the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> sets down, it has increased.</P>
    <P>I deliberately avoided speaking on this <Col N="1656" /> topic until after the vote had been taken as I did not want to influence the teachers as it was up to them to make their decision.  I am amazed that any teachers' union could vote for that <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> with that issue still standing untouched in the education area.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the cost of primary education.  Article 42.4. of the Constitution reads: &ldquo;The State shall provide for free primary education ...&rdquo;. That is a constitutional requirement.  The cost per pupil of running a school has been estimated to be £42.  That includes heating, maintenance etc. plus the payment of teachers.  The capitation grant was £26.50 up to this budget and it has now been increased in this budget by £1.50.  The capitation grant is £28, the cost per pupil is £42, which leaves £14 per pupil to be paid by parents.  In other words, the State pays two-thirds of free education costs and the parents pay the other one-third for the so-called constitutional right of free education.</P>
    <P>I have some letters which were sent to parents to show what is happening in our schools as a result of the Minister not providing free education.  In one school in a relatively deprived area with fairly high unemployment a letter goes out to the parents saying: &ldquo;In line with other schools we look for a £20 contribution per family per year&rdquo;.  They say they need that money for things like rewiring a very old school building, installing a fire alarm system, facilities for piped TV-video in classrooms, lighting equipment and so on, things connected with the ordinary running of the school.  They have to pay for such by levying £20 per family per year.  Another school in a well off area of south county Dublin notifies parents that the budget for their school comes to over £18,000, that the Department of Education grant is expected to amount to £8,000 and that they will have to raise £11,000. The other school would be raising their one-third, presumably, which in this case would be £4,000; but this school is raising £11,000 by what the Department calls local contributions and they say that these contributions are imposed on all national <Col N="1657" /> schools by the Department.  This school asks for £60 for one child, £90 for two children or £120 for three or more children.</P>
    <P>Can you just visualise the difference between those two schools, one trying to scrape up £20 per family &mdash; and for those families that is a hell of a lot of money and it is hard for them to find &mdash; and another school that can get £60 per child? Can you imagine the difference in the equipment and facilities of those two schools and the difference in the quality of education that each of those two schools can give?  There are the best of teachers in both.  When there are good teachers with these great facilities and equipment in their school they can provide a far better quality of education than the other schools.  I can think of another school where one would not get £20 per family.  If they can produce £5 they are doing well, and the quality of education in that school of course is less again.</P>
    <P>What I am saying is that everything the Minister has done has reduced equity in the education system.  It is far worse now than it was in 1987 when this <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was initiated.  I would ask the Minister to try to produce some equity in our educational system and to fight against various things that her Department are imposing on her.</P>
    <P>Last, I want to refer to this famous bovine TB eradication scheme.  This has been described as the greatest scandal in the history of the State by no less a person than Dr. T. K. Whitaker, and I absolutely agree with him.  It was said that £1 billion had been spent on this.  That £1 billion was surpassed five or six years ago.  The expenditure is now up to £1.3 billion and bovine TB has still not been eradicated. We must ask where did the money go, who benefited, and who lost.  I believe there were great benefits to some people. There were great benefits to sharks and chancers.  Over the years I have been told many stories about how the slaughtered animals arrived in butchers' shops or in meat plants after farmers had been compensated for the deaths of the animals and probably left destitute after losing their herd.  I have heard stories that the <Col N="1658" /> meat can still arrive at a meat plant or even in a butcher's shop with the TB areas dissected and removed.</P>
    <P>There are all sorts of stories also in regard to the vets.  The statistics which I get when I put down questions show me that there are approximately 1,000 vets involved in the scheme but they get £10 million a year so that is £10,000 per vet per year.  It is a nice little hand-out and the vet carries on and has his practice as well and keeps things ticking over.  Why disturb that; it is going on now a quarter of a century?  It may be even carried on for another quarter of a century.  I remember when Mark Clinton was Minister for Agriculture he tried to introduce a scheme whereby the tests would be done by qualified technicians who would do a simple test, tag the ears and go off about their business.  The vets would not have that and went on strike; they must do every job themselves.  It is like the doctors saying they will not have nurses but will do every little injection themselves. The vets would not have the technicians doing a job which could be more efficiently and more rapidly done by them.  Of course in that case the vets would not be getting their £10,000 a year.</P>
    <P>Those are the benefits on one side. There are the losses on the other.  There are the farmers who lost their whole livelihoods.  There are the taxpayers who are paying out this money every year. They are paying out money for nothing, throwing it down the drain.  It was money which should have gone to our health services and our education services or any other services one cares to mention. The taxpayers did not object; they wanted bovine TB to be eradicated and the majority of farmers want bovine TB to be eradicated.  Why do we not recognise that there are crooks and chancers out there who are ripping off this money from the taxpayers.  This is why the scandal goes on.  Now what do they want to do?  They are the ones who are now trying to blame the badger.  They are saying the badger is the cause of it all.  The badger was there for the last 25 years and we never even thought of him.  Now he is the cause of the TB eradication scheme not <Col N="1659" /> working, the badger which is one of the loveliest and gentlest of all our mammals here.  I heard a farmer on TV say, when somebody asked him, that it might be the birds who carry the disease.  The beef is so important that any animals, whatever they are, must all be destroyed.</P>
    <P>The key question I want answered is this.  There is a Border up there between the Twenty-six Counties and the Six Counties.  They could eliminate TB in Northern Ireland without ever killing a badger and they eliminated it years ago; but on this side of the Border all the badgers are suddenly full of TB and they are the ones who are infecting the animals.  Can some of these expert farmers, many of them on these benches, explain to me why the situation is so much worse down here in the south than it is in the North in regard to badgers, and why they must be eliminated here?</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate was adjourned I was making the point that the proposed environment protection agency should make the fullest utilisation of our existing third level institutions in the areas of research and equipment.  Rather than spending huge sums on equipment for educational purposes alone it would make a lot of sense if we could make use of and expand the equipment and facilities which are available in establishing an environment protection agency.  For far too long we as a society have not used adequately the resources, knowledge, expertise and research facilities available in our third level institutions. I appeal to the Minister to take on board these suggestions when she is establishing the new agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would further ask the Minister to ensure that any new agency will have the power to monitor the operations of local authorities particularly in regard to waste disposal and sewage treatment. Local authorities in general have been rather tardy in their approach to these issues and are falling way behind in the area of sewage treatment in general.  For example, the entire sewage of Cork city is discharged raw into Cork harbour.  Cork County Council discharge sewage raw into Cork harbour and they have plans to pipe this sewage to Passage West and discharge it raw into the harbour there. Apart from its economic and industrial role, Cork harbour is a wonderful tourist amenity providing boating, bathing and <Col N="1661" /> fishing facilities, yet it is being polluted on a daily basis by the local authorities in the area.  Such sewage should be treated and both the Government and the Department of the Environment should, as a policy priority, compile a national action programme which will ensure the setting up of secondary sewage treatment plants in all coastal towns and cities over the next few years.</P>
    <P>In fairness, the Minister made provision in the recently announced environmental package for the construction of sewage treatment plants in our coastal towns.  I welcome the provisions announced in that package.  The environmental package announced by the Minister represents a milestone in the development of Ireland's environmental policy.  It also highlights the need for the establishment of an environment protection agency to ensure that all local authorities produce specific plans relating to the provision of sewage treatment plants.  Last year I tabled a motion to Cork Corporation calling on the authorities to formulate plans to construct a sewage treatment plant to treat all sewage discharged from Cork city into the harbour.  My proposal was agreed in principle but to date no action has been taken.  I think both the engineers and management envisaged a long time scale for the setting up of such a plant.</P>
    <P>In the light of the Government's recent announcement I again tabled a motion calling on Cork Corporation to submit specifically designed plans for a secondary treatment plant to the Department. The overall lack of initiative shown in this area by the local authority in question, and indeed by other local authorities, is a clear illustration of the need for an independent national environment protection agency which will give an impetus to desirable environmental measures which, for a variety of reasons, local authorities might be reluctant to give.  There are a number of examples where local authorities tended to put short-term financial needs before desirable environmental measures.  It is extremely important that an environment protection agency would be able to force <Col N="1662" /> local authorities to take on board and implement these measures.</P>
    <P>Another area which demands serious consideration is that of landfill sites in cities and large towns.  It is totally unacceptable to locate large landfill sites in very close proximity to densely populated areas.  At present Cork Corporation propose to extend the use of the existing landfill site for another 20 years and in doing so to bring it within very close proximity, almost within 100 feet, of a densely populated housing estate.  I call on the Minister and the Government to examine this issue.  I hope that the proposed new agency will examine the question of the disposal of domestic sewage and in particular landfill sites.  They should also explore alternative means of disposing of domestic waste and the whole process of incineration.  Perhaps the Department could put forward some concrete proposals in relation to this issue.</P>
    <P>A number of people in senior management in local authorities are not looking ahead to what will happen in 20 years because they will not be there.  I have asked the senior management in these local authorities what will happen in 20 years' time when landfill sites are full and what choices will be open to us then.  If we have to make choices in 20 years' time why not make them in five years' time instead?  I should like the Minister to include this issue within the terms of reference of the new environment protection agency.</P>
    <P>The location of the environment protection agency has generated considerable interest.  I would urge the Minister to give serious consideration to locating the agency in the Cork area, perhaps in an area close to the lower harbour which has a heavy concentration of chemical industry.  The satellite town of Carrigaline would be an excellent location for the agency because of its close proximity to the Ringaskiddy industrial estate, about which we have heard so much, and to the harbour area in general which serves a rich agricultural hinterland. As I have mentioned already, there are two fine third level institutions <Col N="1663" /> in Cork, University College Cork and the Cork Regional Technical College, which could provide the new agency with substantial research facilities and a steady stream of graduates qualify in various disciplines pertaining to the environment annually.  I again ask the Minister to seriously consider locating the proposed environment protection agency in Cork.</P>
    <P>In her speech the Minister identified a number of flaws in Deputy Shatter's Bill, particularly in the Second Schedule.  The wisest course of action is to await the publication of the Government Bill which is being prepared following considerable consultation with interested parties.  I should like to pay tribute to Deputy Shatter for his active and constructive approach to this issue.  His Bill is detailed and contains many laudable provisions, some of which can be incorporated in the Government's Bill.  This approach indicates that the Fine Gael Party agree with the concept of and need to establish an independent environment protection agency.  In that sense Deputy Shatter's Bill has contributed to the overall debate on the environment and increased awareness in the public mind about our environment, which I believe will grow in importance as the years pass.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House well knows Ireland started on a rather dangerous course of borrowing in the seventies and it has been a severe struggle, which has caused much hardship to people, just to stabilise the growth of our debt during the past decade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the environment, the reality is that we have been running up unpaid debts with nature for an awful lot longer than the seventies.  We must get on top of the problems in the nineties. The Government have seriously under-estimated the extent of the behavioural change that will be required if we are to do something solid in securing a better environment and economic behaviour sustainable in the long term for our children and their children's children when they come to deal with development in the world.  Sadly, the Government in the <Col N="1664" /> programme they have published have made a very poor attempt to deal with a very serious problem.</P>
    <P>This is the first opportunity this House has had to examine the environmental action programme published by the so-called green Presidency, which amounts to nothing more than a good public relations exercise.  The Government did not even go to the trouble of including a section on an environmentally sensitive use of recycled paper.  It is probable that several tropical rain forests had to be chopped down to enable this document to be published.  It is the most glossy document to be published by the Government in recent times and even contains colour pictures.  The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, went for a very elaborate launching.  All that was missing to complete the perfect job of public relations was the presence of the Green President himself.</P>
    <P>The document contains no solid analysis of any environmental problem.  There are many references to the spending of money and the programme is stretched over a period of ten years so that the figures appear big enough for the newspapers. However, the Government fail to fix any baselines against which we can judge progress on any of the suggestions made on the spending of money.  In that sense no serious attempt has been made to identify the targets which we hope to achieve through the spending of £1,000 million and no indication is given of how we can monitor progress.  Furthermore no effort was made to have a planned approach to environmental problems. The only conclusion I can come to is that there are votes in the environment and the Government want to appear to be doing something on the environment so that they can stay on side with these voters.  It is sad that this document has been put together in the way it has.</P>
    <P>The document contains a curiously clouded fly sheet which you may have noticed, a Cheann Comhairle.  This is very appropriate as its main purpose is to cloud our vision of the suggestions made. There is no commitment to reform.  I would like to examine some of the <Col N="1665" /> elements of the document.  Almost 95 per cent of the money to be spent under this marvellous programme on the environment is earmarked for water and sewerage schemes.  A figure of £930 million is mentioned as going to be spent during the nineties.  This is an impressive figure but the Government fail to point out that this represents a cut of 40 per cent on what we spent during the dismal eighties when the environment deteriorated rapidly.  This fact dulls somewhat the gloss the Government have been trying to put on their new-found zeal for the environment.</P>
    <P>One project picked out for special attention is the provision of secondary treatment at the Ringsend sewage treatment plant.  The foundations for this project were laid in 1986 when a steering committee was set up to develop a water quality management plan for Dublin Bay.  However the Government on coming into office scuppered that plan and abolished the steering committee back in 1987.  They now seek our applause for their conversion at this late hour to the idea that there should be an improvement in sewage treatment facilities in Dublin.  The reality is that the provision of secondary treatment facilities is long overdue in Dublin.  Indeed existing EC directives demand the provision of tertiary treatment facilities in Dublin and states that areas suffering from high degrees of pollution should go for tertiary treatment facilities.  As someone who swims off the Bull Wall I can tell this House that this is probably the one place in Dublin where Dublin Corporation provide bathing shelters and that they have had to hammer on notices on those shelters stating that they are not meeting the required environmental standards.  If that is not an indication of the need to go beyond the provision of secondary treatment facilities and do as the EC recommend I do not know what is.</P>
    <P>The document is full of promises but when we read it closely we will see they fall far short of what is being done in the rest of Europe.  The Government boast that they are planning to cut sulphur dioxide emissions by 30 per cent but fail to <Col N="1666" /> point out that this falls short of the efforts being made by our EC colleagues, virtually all of whom are committed to a 40 per cent reduction.  Ireland has received an exemption from the requirements of the EC Directive in this area and is now trying to trumpet an achievement which falls way short of what they are seeking to do.  The Government also boast that they are committed to stabilising nitrogen oxide emissions, this at a time when our EC partners are committed to reducing their 1980 emission levels by 20 per cent. We are only committed to stabilising emissions at their 1987 level.  Once we begin to delve to see what is meant we realise that it falls far short of what we need.</P>
    <P>Reference is made to the need to protect the ozone layer but no attempt has been made to ban the offending CFCs.  It does not even set a date by which they are to be eliminated.  The document claims that energy conservation is the most effective contribution we can make to the greenhouse effect but it fails to mention that we have one of the worst records in Europe when it comes to energy efficiency and energy conservation which has been studiously ignored by the Government.  I will return to that issue later.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other points I would like to pick up as it is important that we take a critical look at this document if it is to be, as it is trumpeted to be, the programme for the nineties when we tackle environmental problems.  For example, the document states that there is going to be a 10p differential between the price of lead-free and leaded petrol. That decision was implemented in the budget but again the Government fail to mention that the average differential in the EC is between 14p and 15p.  Ireland is also one of those countries which dragged its feet when it came to the implementation of exhaust emission levels in motorcars, yet we have been told that this is going to be the green Presidency.  They promise that by 1998 there will be no sludge dumping but this is no leap forward or great achievement. <Col N="1667" /> We are all aware that international conventions stipulate that it will be illegal to do so by that date.  Therefore all the Government are saying is that they will not act illegally beyond a certain date in the nineties.</P>
    <P>The section dealing with the issue of recycling and restricting the use of biodegradable products is pathetic.  It is purely flannel and no targets have been set down on what reductions will be achieved and no policy instruments have been advocated to show how these will be brought about.</P>
    <P>I would like to examine the important question of energy conservation.  It rings very hollow to hear the Government speak about energy conservation as it is they who cut investment for the development of new conservation techniques to one-tenth of their 1980 level.  We are last in the European league of countries making an effort to deal with this problem. They sidetracked the last special European Fund for a five year energy conservation plan into long-standing projects which were dusted down from the shelves of the ESB and Bord na Móna. Instead of producing a new impetus for conservation, nothing of any value emerged. They have even ignored proper energy management in their own buildings.  There have been numerous reports indicating the very large conservation options there are to save money in Government buildings.  A figure of 20 per cent has been shown to be quite possible to save in this regard.  All the Government have done so far is talk about having a pilot project in the Department of Energy's own building to see if some savings could be made.  Is that anything like launching into a major initiative on the energy conservation front?  It is a pathetic response from the Government in the area of conservation.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael have done very careful analyses of the possibilities in the energy conservation area.  In March 1989 we published our programme of what could profitably be done and we indicated that £100 million could profitably be invested over ten years in this area.  What do we <Col N="1668" /> find in this great new strategy we are to be told about?  A commitment of £0.5 million and not a shred of detail as to what the Government plan to do to make energy more efficient.  That amount will go no distance towards the 40 per cent we need to cut off our £3,000 million energy bill.  That is what other countries are setting themselves as targets.  That is what we have to achieve if we are to join with them in doing something sensible about conservation needs and the need to cut carbon dioxide emissions.  That is not what we are having.  All we have from this Government is a hope and a prayer and a paltry £500,000.</P>
    <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I see you are tending to nod off.  You probably share my feeling that the heat levels in this House bear testimony to the lack of seriousness on the part of this Government to do anything about maintaining sensible heating standards in their public buildings.  We are all here sweltering and the building is grossly overheated. Instead of tackling the Department of Energy's buildings, maybe the Government could add this building to their list.</P>

      <P>A number of other issues need to be looked at in the plan the Government are presenting to us. Given the time available I had better move on, but it is important to bear in mind that this is a very cobbled-together strategy, bearing all the hallmarks of a last minute job.  I found it particularly amusing in the light of that document, to read the Minister of State's speech and her description of Deputy Alan Shatter's Bill as opportunistic, an effort to jump on the bandwagon, showing all the hallmarks of being rushed and details not adequately thought out.  If that criticism were to apply to anyone's action it should be to that of the Minister of State's colleague &mdash; and I presume she had some role herself &mdash; in putting this programme together.  I have tried to look charitably at the Minister of State's comments on Deputy Shatter's Bill to see if there were <Col N="1669" /> some reasonable grounds for throwing out what I believe is an excellent initiative by an individual Deputy.  Far from bearing the hallmarks of being rushed or opportunistic, it bears the hallmarks of an extraordinary amount of detailed research by an individual Deputy with very little back-up to do the sort of work needed to put together a Bill of this detail and comprehension, as the Minister of State well knows from when she was on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>The approach by the Minister of State and the Government is less than gracious to what was done in this Bill.  I see no real grounds for throwing this Bill out in the criticisms the Minister of State put in the Dáil.  They seemed to distil down to a few items.  She makes an unexplained claim that the division of functions between the Minister, the agency and the local authorities is not rational.  Unfortunately, she did not go on to say in what way she thought it was not rational.  The only thing she said was that the agency should be made the licensing authority for some individual industrial plants as well as the functions envisaged by Deputy Shatter.  Maybe that is a worthy proposal and could very reasonably be needed as an amendment on Committee Stage but in no way does it contradict the spirit of what Deputy Shatter's Bill is trying to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>She makes a series of rather semantic objections to the phraseology used by Deputy Shatter in the objectives he set out for the agency.  She claims that &ldquo;respecting the value we place on our environment&rdquo; is too ambiguous a term to be in a Bill.  I have dealt, admittedly mostly in the energy and communications area, with several Bills.  Many of the statements of general functions of a Bill or of the Broadcasting Commission are couched in very broad terms of this nature and no one sought to think how a legal interpretation might be put on all the individual words.  Perhaps we could wait for the parliamentary draftsman who may say, &ldquo;Let us have a tighter phraseology on this&rdquo;, but I think nobody in this House could object to the idea that when we set up an environment protection agency it should respect the value we <Col N="1670" /> place on our environment.  That is only semantic quibbling.</P>
    <P>There is similar quibbling when the Minister of State objects to the notion that Deputy Shatter is seeking to step up the level of environmental monitoring. We all want to step up the level of environmental monitoring.  Members on all sides of the House realise we have fallen behind, but the complaint is that this notion of greater environmental monitoring is unclear because it does not say what it is greater than.  It is greater than what?  With the greatest of respect to the Minister of State, I cannot see that is a sound foundation for throwing out this Bill.</P>
    <P>Another objection made here is that the Oireachtas should not be concerned with the staffing and duties of the agency. To my mind most of our time in this House is devoted to looking at Estimates that deal with nothing but the staffing and duties of different Departments and agencies of Government.  That is precisely what we are sent here to do.  We are here to stand over the spending of taxpayers' money to see that we get value.  Again, I cannot see that her objection to section 24 (b) of the Second Schedule is honestly founded.  The Minister of State and the Government at this stage should reconsider all this.  These objections may have some validity in them and could be introduced on Committee Stage when we could thrash them out and assimilate them into what is a very worthy Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State was remarkably silent on what I believe are the fundamental pillars of this Bill which differ entirely from the proposals as rumoured in the newspapers though, sad to say, no Bill has yet been introduced.  There are fundamental differences in what we are trying to achieve and what the Government appear to be considering, and a number of these are the nub of this debate and the reason the Government are throwing out this Bill.  It has nothing to do with the earlier comments.  They revolve around our insistence that this agency should be strong and independent.  That <Col N="1671" /> means not only an independent appointment, to which the Minister of State appears to have agreed in her reference to some other agencies like the Director of Public Prosecutions, but they have an independent budget.  The Minister of State will recall that when she was on this side of the House she was one of the Deputies loud in their criticism of the way the Government attempted to strangle the independent Ombudsman by lack of adequate funding.</P>
    <P>It is against that danger that the system that has been drawn up here has been sought to be put in place.  We need an independent environmental agency whose budget is assured.  That means that their budget would go to a committee of this House and then to the Dáil.  It would have great political momentum behind it.  It would not be satisfactory that the independent Environmental Protection Agency should go the way the Ombudsman's Office tragically went in recent years.  I urge the Minister of State to comment on that point, because I think an agency's budget is just as important as the terms of appointment for this agency.</P>
    <P>Equally, Deputy Shatter's Bill has been very innovative in introducing real reform in the way we conduct our business in the Dáil.  He refers to a committee of the Dáil which would have a real, practical role in monitoring progress in improving our environment.  That is what I believe we were elected on this side of the House to do.  The Minister of State is in a privileged position among Deputies in that she is close to the tasks but I believe that the voice of Members from all parties should be heard on the environment. I think the proposed structure is a marvellous innovation which I would like to see the Minister of State take on board.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister of State is committed to improving the way the Dáil conducts its business and I think this is a practical way in which we could make great progress.  There are other elements of the Bill which sadly are missing from the proposals surfacing in Government press releases.  One of these is the power <Col N="1672" /> to initiate proceedings against public bodies who fail to honour their responsibilities in regard to the environment. Again, I think this is a very important element of the Bill.  Indeed the Minister of State had to go out to Poulaphouca to see how a State agency was not respecting what she and her Minister regarded as their responsibility in regard to the environment. This happens all too often, not just in that individual case but quite regularly. Deputy Shatter quite justifiably made provision in this Bill to give power to this agency to investigate and make recommendations on any element of environmental control by whom so ever it was carried out and by any public body that is threatening the environment.  He is giving the agency power to bring proceedings against them and to take effective action to deal with that.  Far from being, as the Minister of State suggests, an irrational way of conducting a relationship between local public bodies and the agency, I believe this is a highly rational way of dealing with things.  It means that the Environmental Protection Agency only get involved in the affairs of a local authority or other public body if they have good reason to believe that such a body are failing in their duties.  The agency have power to investigate, recommend and take effective action.  That is what environmental protection is all about.  It is not only about monitoring and producing reports but about taking effective action to deal with problems. We have had reports on the smog problem in Dublin since Adam was a boy but it has taken years to deal effectively with it and the matter still has not been resolved.  We need an agency of the type that Deputy Shatter encompasses in his Bill and that is an important element of environmental control.  I am sad that the Minister of State has not dealt with these practical innovations or said what the Government feel about them.  This is the nub of what we are trying to do and has nothing to do with the quibbling on semantics I described earlier.</P>
    <P>I have been involved to some extent with Deputy Shatter in the drafting of this Bill.  I am particularly concerned with <Col N="1673" /> the area of radiological protection.  In Fine Gael's view it is vital to include radiological protection within the overall remit of a coherent approach to environmental protection.  I think this responsibility has been sadly neglected by the Minister for Energy over the years.  It is four years since the incident at Chernobyl and the National Radiological Protection Institute have not even produced embryonic recommendations on how we could deal with another such incident.  We do not even have a suggestion from the Department of Energy as to how they will deal with radiological protection.  They have done nothing at all about it.  We still do not have in place an emergency plan and a continuous monitoring system that would deal fully with a radiological threat to the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Energy recently went back on a solemn commitment that was made by the former Minister, Deputy Ray Burke, to take Britain to court because of her failings in the area of nuclear safety.  Equally, the Minister for Energy has failed to take effective action to deal with the 35,000 Irish homes that are exposed to excessive risk from radon. There has been a long history of evidence about this risk, and recent reports indicate that exposure to radon gas is the second greatest cause of lung cancer, second only to smoking.  This is a very serious problem.  None of the problems that are vital in the radiological protection area has even been touched upon by the Minister for Energy.  This is not the fault of the present incumbent alone but of successive Ministers for Energy.</P>
    <P>I completely reject the Government's plan to keep radiological protection within the Department of Energy and under the thumb of the Minister for Energy.  Two years ago we saw the disgraceful muzzling of the Nuclear Energy Board by the former Minister, Deputy Burke, when he insisted that all of their subsequent statements would have to be sanitised by his Department because he was not satisfied that they should give the public an independent view of radiological protection issues.  Recently the <Col N="1674" /> Minister for Energy acted wholly inappropriately in my view in appointing a chief executive to the Nuclear Energy Board without placing an advertisement in the newapapers or having open competition. He appointed a civil servant who was seconded from his Department.  That is no way to deal with the appointment of a chief executive of what is supposed to be an important independent agency dealing with radiological protection. Equally I believe it would be senseless duplication if the body dealing with radiological protection was under the Minister for Energy, but that is not the important thing.  The Minister for Energy is ill-equipped to deal with the issue of radiological protection.  He is not interested in it, he has not bothered with it and he is not capable of doing anything about it.</P>
    <P>Radiological protection is an environmental issue and must be seen as such.  It is becoming more and more the case that countries that have a large nuclear sector are trying to wrap the shroud of environmental merit around them saying that nuclear energy is environmentally friendly.  This has emerged because the task of radiological protection is all too often put under the thumb of Ministers for Energy whose interest is to see that we have cheap energy and is not primarily concerned with the environment.  That is why I believe it is critical that the area of radiological protection, an important area of environmental protection, is under a strong independent agency of the type advocated by Deputy Shatter in this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is not too late for the Minister to reconsider her position on the Bill.  I think the Bill is a readymade vehicle which will provide excellent legislation for the nineties.  As yet the Government do not appear to have produced a Bill.</P>

      <P>There have been plenty of promises and indeed a statement.  I had occasion to ask the Taoiseach today whether some of the stated legislative schedule set out in the environmental document would be met; he said that he <Col N="1675" /> would not commit himself but to come to his office and that we could talk about it.  That is no way to deal with this issue of having environmental protection legislation passed.  The Bill before us in my view is excellent and a great deal of work has been done on it by a Deputy who is more than willing and has a proven record of accommodating views from all sides of the House.  I ask the Minister of State at this late stage to agree to take the Committee Stage of this Bill where she could bring forward her proposals for amendments and improvements which would certainly be taken on board.  We would then have genuine joint effort by Members in this Chamber to frame a Bill on the important environmental front that would protect us in the nineties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first occasion I have had to address the House while the Minister of State, Deputy Harney, has been representing the Government.  I congratulate the Minister on her appointment and wish her well in this important Ministry.</P>
      <P>The whole question of the environment has moved to centre stage and rightly so.  For a number of years well meaning individuals were highlighting problems relating to the environment and the need to protect it.  To some extent they may have felt that theirs were voices crying in the wilderness but the growing international awareness of the importance of the environment and also some major catastrophes in various parts of the world, particularly relating to industrial operations, have highlighted the need to look more closely at our own arrangements for protecting the environment.  I welcome the major debates under way on environmental issues and the need for governments throughout the EC and the rest of the world to take proper action to protect the environment and to discriminate positively with regard to investing in environmental protection.  Only by acting individually as governments and countries and then collectively on an international scale can we hope to make real progress on these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1676" /> All of us understand that an emergency far from Ireland can have major repercussions for us.  We saw what happened in the Chernobyl incident, the effects of which were felt across the Continent of Europe to our own country.  It affected the products on some of our farms and in our neighbouring country, Wales, the infection of sheep was directly related to what happened at Chernobyl.  The world is very small in relation to natural or industrial disasters and for that reason there is a need to spell out clearly where governments are going in relation to protecting the environment.</P>
    <P>We must start in the area of education. The protection of our environment is not confined exclusively to the major issues which we speak about in debates of this kind, such as air pollution control, water pollution control, marine and inland water pollution; these are the topical issues, but the protection of the whole environment in which we live goes far beyond that.  Education beginning in the primary school has an important role to play.  Damage to the environment is equally important if it occurs in our parks where we have decided to plant thousands of trees and have discovered damage due to vandalism.  The graffiti artist has an impact on the environment. Major road developments which do not take account of the topography of an area impact on our environment and have to be taken into account.  These may not be as topical as the major issues to which I have referred but nevertheless they are extremely important, right down to the basic issue of litter in our streets and open areas.  All these matters must come into the debate on protecting and improving the environment.  I welcome debates of this kind because they continue to highlight the need to take action in specific areas.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the environment action programme which has been announced by the Government. This constitutes a blueprint for the future and I would not be nearly as pessimistic as Deputy Richard Bruton when he referred <Col N="1677" /> to the various sections of that programme. To be successful an action programme must be specific and set out targets and objectives.  This has been done.  One can study in any section of the programme the targets which have been set and in time these may be measured against performance.  It will be an easy matter to monitor what is happening throughout the nineties and ascertain if the targets of this programme are being met or ignored.  The objectives are written down at last in a global way.</P>
    <P>The programme would be weakened to some extent if the financial resources were not made available to support it. Too often we have had reports seeking certain specific achievements, not necessarily in the area of the environment. Some of these reports have been good on rhetoric and sound on what might be desirable, but they have lacked the necessary financial support.  This action programme is strong because it sets out the targets and objectives and matches them with the financial contribution, spelling out in detail the finance to be made available under the various sections.  Provision has been made in the 1990 budget to deal with the implications of the environment action plan and to get underway in regard to meeting specific targets and objectives.</P>
    <P>That is an indication of the commitment of the Government and the Minister to achieving those targets.  Some of them are undoubtedly very ambitious and will take the decade to achieve but at least the targets and objectives are set out and there are dates by which we can monitor the performance of the programme. It will be an easy matter to watch the Estimates prepared each autumn and the budgets produced in January each year to see if the commitment of the Government is being maintained by virtue of the financial resources made available to support the continued implementation of this excellent action programme.</P>
    <P>There are several areas within the programme on which progress has been called for by individuals, organisations and local authorities.  The report refers to most of the areas that have given cause <Col N="1678" /> for concern and in respect of which there is need to improve environmental protection and other aspects of the environment. This programme constitutes a beginning which will need to be backed up by additional financial investment and legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, in referring to the Government's proposed Environment Protection Agency, has clearly spelled out the role envisaged for that agency.  Indeed, its role will be extremely important in dealing with the issues to which I have referred in regard to the protection of the environment.  It is envisaged that the agency will be responsible for the control and regulation of development likely to cause a major risk to the quality of our environment.  All of us welcome that provision because, for too long, the control and regulation of developments has been dispersed among different agencies largely dependent on local authorities.</P>
    <P>The agency will also be responsible for the general monitoring of the quality of our environment, an essential prerequisite to any orderly protection of the environment.  The agency will also support back-up and advisory services together with environmental research. That will be the broad thrust of their functions as the Minister envisages them.</P>
    <P>I am keen to ensure that the new agency will not be divorced completely from local authorities because the latter have a very important role to play in planning control and regulations.  Any agency involved in the protection of the environment will be required to work fairly closely with the planning authorities through the various local authorities. That is why I welcome the Minister's commitment to there being a linkage between the agency and the various local authorities.  It would not be wise to divorce this agency from the local authorities because of the unique role the latter have been playing in environmental matters.  I envisage the role of local authorities continuing to be important in this area.</P>
    <P>Turning to the Bill before the House, undoubtedly there are some provisions <Col N="1679" /> with which none of us would quarrel. Indeed, it might have been easier for Deputy Shatter to achieve his objective had he awaited the Government Bill and sought to insert various provisions of this one therein.  That would have been a reasonable alternative course of action. That is at present being done in another special committee of this House, that on the Companies Bill, of which committee I am a member, when differing points of view from different sides of the House can be accommodated.  I should have thought it might have been possible to do the same with regard to this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>No, they are more than welcome to operate; we welcome that. Any suggestions I make are done in a positive fashion.  Indeed, the suggestion I made in regard to the Fine Gael Bill was done in the best of spirits and not intended to antagonise the proposer of this Bill, who I am sure spent a great deal of time and effort bringing it thus far.</P>
      <P>There are certain aspects of this Bill which will give rise to concern and it is with those I might deal now.  For example, in section 1 there is a definition of &ldquo;contaminant&rdquo;.  There has been much debate on what precisely would form a contaminant.  For example, in agriculture this raises an important issue, when slurry might be deposited on fields which, under normal weather conditions, need not pose an environmental problem. However, it must be recognised that, if weather conditions deteriorated rapidly, that slurry could then become a serious contaminant.  That contingency is not spelled out in the definitions section and could give rise to difficulties for the agricultural sector.  It is possible to carry out such an exercise on land which can be affected by conditions other than carelessness on the part of anybody in that sector.</P>
      <P>I might refer also to the proposal to have an environmental commissioner appointed.  In his contribution Deputy Shatter referred to the remunerative conditions of such an appointee being equivalent to those of a High Court judge.  I am led to the conclusion that perhaps the Deputy has in mind the appointment of a High Court judge to this post.  I should have thought that any such appointee should be drawn from a scientific or technical background.  It is my belief that, in order to be suitable, any such appointee be highly qualified on a scientific or technical basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also intrigued by the proposal that an Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment be established.  From my limited experience in this House the intention behind the establishment of any <Col N="1681" /> such committee is to remove from this Chamber powers that ought rightly remain here.  There is also reference to staffing arrangements and financial management. I would not be convinced that the management of the agency, as proposed in this Bill, would lend itself to that mechanism.  I see no reason we should not establish the agency, give them their independence, appoint staff in accordance with their terms of reference and allow them come into being on that basis. I cannot see any compelling reason to establish a special committee of this House to deal with and oversee that agency.  I would much prefer to see that take place in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>The next issue I would like to refer to is the establishment by the agency of regional environmental units. Essentially, the idea makes sense but nowhere can I find an elaboration of that proposal.  To be successful, the establishment of regional units would require a very considerable investment in technology. They would be toothless wonders if they were not supported by major technical investment.  Nowhere, in any of the documents from the Fine Gael side that I have read, can I find reference to that fact.  Local authorities, individuals and organisations probably would have less confidence in those regional units if they were not supported with the sort of investment I am speaking about.  As I am coming to the end of my time&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe the Deputy would take the time to read the Minister's speech regarding his own Bill.  He said there would be regional units.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but he has gone on to indicate that it is essential that those regional units would be properly staffed and also, as I understand it, that they would receive the appropriate investment from a technological point of view. That is the problem that existed previously when, for example, individual large industries were simply unable to get support from local authorities for monitoring testing, analyses and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why we want to set up regional units.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>One need not go further than Tipperary in this regard.  The <Col N="1683" /> regional units must have proper investment and support.  Nowhere in the Bill, as proposed by Deputy Shatter, can I find clearly spelled out how this agency will be accessible to the public.  I have studied the Deputy's contribution on this Bill but I cannot find in it the specific entitlements of the public to have accessibility to the work of the agency.  If such accessibility does not exist, when the agency involves itself, for example, in deciding on environmental issues in an industrial development the confidence of the public, or indeed local authorities or any other State agency, would be very much diminished.  That is an important issue.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment stated he will ensure that an information centre on the environment will be established and he has provided in this year's Estimates and in the budget, a sum of £500,000 for such a centre.  That is the correct way forward.  The type of agency which we on the Government side are speaking about would attract people who need information and assurance.</P>
      <P>The Government's commitment to establish such an information centre augers well for the Government Bill which will soon be published.  The capacity of such a centre to link up by computer with our library services around the country would enable more and more young people to become involved in matters concerning the environment, to take up projects at school on the issue and to participate in debates and discussions on environmental issues. As I said at the commencement of my contribution, it is in that way that we will strengthen the awareness of the need to protect, improve and enhance our environment. That is the difference, as I see it, between the Fine Gael Bill which we are discussing and the proposal from the Government with regard to information availability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To some extent there is an overlap between the agencies of State with regard to air pollution, water pollution, the planning laws, waste and other environmental aspects.  We have to find a way in which we can bring all of these organisations <Col N="1684" /> more closely together so that they will function more efficiently, be more accessible and will contribute in a much more positive way towards dealing with matters of concern with regard to the environment.</P>
    <P>I would like to touch on the need to come to grips with the whole question of the handling and storage of toxic waste materials.  This is an important issue that has bedevilled this country for some time. There was a safety valve up to recent times whereby we could export such waste material but the export outlets are closing off rapidly and, therefore we will have to come to terms with the need to provide our own facility.  I welcome the Government's commitment to allowing the establishment of a waste incinerator but I would caution the Minister that it will be necessary to tread very carefully in the establishment of such a facility.  It is essential that the general public be assuaged and that they have confidence in such a project.  No attempt should be made, as happened in the Baldonnel area of my constituency, to locate such a facility without the consent of the public. That project was cancelled due to large-scale public demand in the area.  Nevertheless, it does not take away the necessity to provide such a facility.  The Government's approach to a waste incinerator is the correct one but I caution the Minister to ensure that all aspects of it are considered thoroughly before location and type is finally decided.</P>
    <P>I have touched on the various weaknesses of the Bill.  I believe the best approach to the protection of the environment is to take on board the programme as published by the Government but this would have to be supported by appropriate legislation.  All of us accept that that will have to be done.  The agency could not act independently of local authorities. They would have to have the necessary resources and staff and would have to be accessible to the public.  It is for that reason that I particularly welcome the Minister of State's commitment that an advisory council be established.</P>
    <P>The Minister has assured us that various interested groups and organisations <Col N="1685" /> would be represented on that council and that it would not be confined to individuals, professional bodies or organisations who might have a particular interest.  I want to see on that council representatives from a broad range of organisations, perhaps taking different points of view on the environment.  It is only in that way that the public, individuals, industrialists, local authorities and organisations, will have the necessary confidence in an agency that will play a most important role in the future development of this country.  This agency will impinge on all our lives and the way in which the environment protection agency as envisaged by the Government discharge their functions will to some extent determine our quality of life.  I welcome the Government's initiatives and I respect Deputy Shatter for putting forward his Bill, but I would ask him at this stage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is a welcome change that before Christmas and again tonight we can have a fairly detailed though limited discussion on an issue at the heart of our quality of life and at the heart of industrial development policy.  Whether or not we agree on the details of the Bill, at least we are now talking about this important issue.</P>
      <P>If practices on this earth remain unchanged man will not survive another 50 years on this planet.  Most environmentalists would agree that unless our civilisation alters its course of environmental destruction we are on a rendezvous with global disaster.  I am not overstating the situation.  This year alone one acre of tropical rain forest will be destroyed every second and several species of wildlife will disappear each month. We have changed the make-up of the earth's atmosphere.  Each year carbon dioxide levels are increasing by 0.4 per cent, methane levels by 1 per cent and chlorofluorocarbons by 4 per cent and the nitrous oxides in our atmosphere will be increasing by 0.25 per cent.  These figures are meaningless to a lot of people but such activity cannot continue without inflicting serious harm on the human race and on the planet.  In our drive for financial growth we have fouled our air, land and water, and we have plundered and squandered our natural resources to such an extent that the human race has become the enemy of the planet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now must look nearer home.  What can we as a people do about the pollution of our land, seas, rivers and atmosphere? We can do a lot.  We were very ignorant until recently of our environmental obligations. Indeed, environmental protection was not a political issue until three or four years ago.  Up to then it was a Cinderella issue where a few cranks like myself and Deputy Gerard Brady came into the House troubling a Minister on an Adjournment debate to debate nuclear dumping, the pollution of our waterways and so on.  There was little interest in the issue.  At one time Deputy Brady and I arranged a visit to Windscale and we found it hard to get any takers for the visit.  Thankfully the scenario has <Col N="1687" /> changed and every Tom, Dick and Harry, not to mention a few Charlies, is an expert on environmental pollution.  We now have a green Taoiseach and a green Presidency in the European Community.</P>

      <P>Also the Marys and the Pádraigs.  Times have changed, <i>Deo gratias.</i> Unfortunately it is too late for many of our lakes, waterways and forests where the damage is irreversible.  There is time to reverse a lot of the damage that has been done but even to this day we have no clear-cut programme on environmental protection.  We pay a lot of lip service but we have no real policy.  Despite all the controversies in recent times in relation to environmental protection and industrial development there is no need for conflict if we have a proper policy.  Industrial development and environmental protection can easily co-exist if we have safeguards and laws to ensure that they can go hand in hand.</P>
      <P>The last time I counted the agencies responsible in one way or another for environmental protection, I counted 11, including the local authorities and health boards.  That disjointed approach to environment protection resulted in overlaps in some areas and serious omissions in others and led to frightening inadequacies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lot of the controversy which arose recently &mdash; and I have in mind my own beloved south-west region &mdash; arose because of a lack of confidence in the statutory bodies responsible for environmental protection.  The statutory bodies neither had the legislation to back up what they wanted to do nor the resources to carry out their obligations under existing law.  The time is long overdue for an adequate environmental protection policy and an agency.  I proposed such an agency a number of times in 1983 and also in this House and in the Fine Gael <Col N="1688" /> environmental policy document published in 1985, long before the 1987 policy document of the PDs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>A man before my time. Many things had to go wrong, however, before we came around to realising that central overall control was needed.  Long before environmental protection became an issue projects were drawn up but the Government were only jolted into activity by the recent controversies resulting in serious job losses and retarded industrial development in the regions.  The rise of the Green Party and the Chernobyl disaster jolted the Government into activity too.</P>
      <P>We heard some double talk this evening on the disposal of toxic and industrial waste.  There is double-talk in the environmental action programme, promises, promises.  There is no indication of any action in relation to an issue that has badly compromised us in our dispute with Britain on the dumping of nuclear waste off our coast and in the selling of Ireland to multinationals.  We do not have a policy on the disposal of hazardous, toxic or industrial waste. Despite all the hype, the Government are passing the buck and asking some promoters to bring about the introduction of a toxic waste treatment plant somewhere in Ireland.  I submit the reason we do not have such a plant is a lack of backbone.  The Government will not make a decision; it is like the itinerants, they can go anywhere except in my backyard.  That is what has happened in relation to this issue and it has compromised us internationally and at home on a number of points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much lip-service in relation to nuclear dumping and the discharge of nuclear waste into our seas. Ministers thumped tables and made grand speeches about Britain being brought before the European Court in relation to nuclear dumping.  They talked about Britain's irresponsible attitude but it was all hot air because, at the end of <Col N="1689" /> the day, we could not do anything as we were dependent on Britain to dispose of our toxic and industrial waste.  I was in Sellafield two years ago and the authorities there proudly took me to one of their dumps nearby and showed me where they accepted and disposed of some of the Irish nuclear waste.  That totally undermined my argument in relation to their stance on the disposal of nuclear waste.  It compromised the Government and me in this regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton was right when he said that the radiological question should be taken out of the hands of the Department of Energy.  Indeed the Nuclear Energy Board &mdash; as they were then &mdash; were hostile to some of my pronouncements because they had a vested interest in the matter.  They were tied to the policies of the Department of Energy and compromised in their attitude to the whole question of nuclear waste and its discharge into our seas.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Shatter published his Bill &mdash; and when the Government indicated that they would publish theirs in relation to an environmental protection agency &mdash; I said that the agency should have their centre in Cork.  It would be an exercise in decentralisation and a commonsense approach because Cork and the greater Cork area are major centres for pharmaceuticals and chemicals in this country.</P>
    <P>In relation to the pollution of our rivers, a very alarming report landed on my desk recently.  It is called <i>The Greening of the River Lee</i> and contains a report from the south-west fisheries board that the River Lee is not beautiful any more but is the most polluted river in the country.  It gives reasons for this and puts forward proposals as to how the problem could be resolved.  The case of the River Lee can be repeated ten times over in the rest of the country; recognition should be given to the report and the proposals taken into consideration by the new agency.</P>
    <P>Sewage treatment is also a major issue and members of local authorities and this House can no longer stand over the practice of local authorities in dumping and <Col N="1690" /> discharging sewage into our rivers and harbours.  I hope the aspirations contained in this document will be followed through by real action.  The discharging process, even by my own local authority and Cork County Council into the River Lee and Cork harbour, should be terminated as soon as possible by a major allocation from the Government for a modern sewerage plant which will treat sewage outfall from the town and city.</P>
    <P>Environmental protection policies cannot be taken in isolation because they are indirectly linked to our policies in relation to energy.  There was a terrible contradiction in the budget.  It talked about transferring to clean sources of energy but the Government imposed extra VAT on electricity which will inhibit the growth in its usage.  I ask the Government to be more consistent in this regard.</P>
    <P>I do not have time to go into the nuts and bolts of the Bill as Deputy Shatter did so in his usual brilliant fashion at the outset of the debate.  However, I ask the Government, during their Presidency of the EC, to let this Bill go through the House.  It has been clearly thought out and, if I get an opportunity to debate it on the next Stage, I will make certain points.  I appeal to the Government not to kill the Bill.  It deserves to be passed for the good of the country, the environment and our industrial development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Deputy Allen for sharing his time with me.  I congratulate Deputy Shatter on an excellent, well researched and well thought out Bill which has been warmly welcomed by many agencies.  Indeed it is the only Bill that deals with setting up an environmental protection agency. Despite an announcement on 5 December &mdash; obviously timed to pre-empt the debate in the House &mdash; and despite the publication of this non-environmentally friendly document on the hardest quality paper, Deputy Shatter's Bill is the only authentic one.  The Government's document is printed on paper which any environmentalist will tell you causes the most destruction and takes the most <Col N="1691" /> number of trees to produce.  I would have thought, at the very least, that the two Ministers in the Department of the Environment would have followed the example of other agencies and independent groups and published the document on recycled paper.  However, they did not.  It is on highly glossy paper which is very unfriendly to the environment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flood said Deputy Shatter should have waited for the Government Bill.  Deputy Flood has now left the House but I suggest we will be a lot older and greyer before that Bill is introduced. I am nearly one year older since I first heard talk about the Government bringing in an environmental agency protection Bill.  It is interesting to note that when the Minister of State, Deputy Harney, was on the Opposition benches as a member of the Progressive Democrats, her party were very strong in their demands that the Government should accept Deputy Shatter's judicial separation Bill.  They called on the Government to accept such a Bill as they did not have one of their own.  The Minister of State should use the same criterion now and accept Deputy Shatter's Bill as I am sure he would be quite content to accept necessary amendments.  If we have to wait much longer for a Government Bill the impact of the green Presidency will be lessened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For many years we have had a schizophrenic attitude to the environment. During the sixties we attempted &mdash; and succeeded &mdash; in selling this country as a very good industrial location on the fringe of Europe, a place that had a fine environment, a pleasant lifestyle, clean rivers, clean seas and clean air.  We sold ourselves aggressively in that way but all the time we neglected to look at the downstream effects of some of the industries we were welcoming.  Even more serious is the fact that by subterfuge and deception we encouraged industries to set up here on the basis of false promises.  For example, an industry on the north fringe of Dublin city that makes an industrial diamond product came here making it <Col N="1692" /> clear that they would have a non-hazardous chemical waste to dispose of.  It was understood that that waste could not be disposed of at the usual domestic tip-head and they were assured that a proper facility would be available for them within one year of them commencing operations.  That industry employs 400 people.</P>

It is my belief, and that of my colleagues in my party, that this matter merited a great deal more, and more detailed consideration than can be given to it in the space of ten minutes.  However, I should like to thank the Chair for allowing me this opportunity at least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing with the result of a series of storms that have hit our coast and the country since the middle of December.  We have had a succession of storms since 15 December which have wreaked havoc around the country.  I should like to catalogue some of the more visible damage that has been done.  The damage can be found around our coast. It can be found in Arklow, where I spent some time this morning looking at the effects of storm damage on the north beach and on the harbour.  We have all seen the pictures of the damage done at Kilmore Quay where the sea wall was broken and a number of fishing boats wrecked while in the harbour.  Many boats were damaged and a great many of them have since been forced to use other <Col N="1693" /> ports because they cannot use their home port.  Damage has been caused in Dungarvan, and Tramore is in a extremely bad state.  The harbour and the pier at Ballycotton were damaged.  There was damage at Union Hall and at Sligo.  There are many examples around our coast of the effects of the storms.</P>
    <P>We have had floods throughout the country.  We have had flooding in the Shannon Basin.  The area south of Athlone has now become a new lake. That flooding extends along the east side of the Shannon and through the midlands. We have seen flooding in areas where it has rarely been known before. We have seen pictures of Carlow town where people have had to instal walk boards along the two sides of the street. The county council are providing a shuttle service with a tractor and trailer to get people from one end of the town to the other.  We have seen pictures of floods running through the streets of Clonmel. There are floods along the Lee Valley in Cork.  I will use my influence to get a boat for the Ceann Comhairle when he is going home at the end of this week's session.</P>
    <P>In all those areas we have seen the effects of storm damage and rising water. In fact, in many places we are not equipped to deal with the problems.  Livelihoods have been put at risk.  A good part of our fishing fleet has been tied up because of the storms, and those families are facing the results of a substantial period without any income.  That is not to speak of the skippers who have seen their boats destroyed or severely damaged. We have seen farms flooded to an extent that has not been seen for more than 30 years.  Whole townlands are under several feet of water and the farmers will be unable to carry out their normal farming operations for some months to come.  There are people in the constituency of the Minister for Education who put up with this year in and year out but their problems are being experienced on a much wider scale than has been seen for a long time.</P>
    <P>Businesses throughout the country have had to close up for several days.  It will take some of them quite a long time <Col N="1694" /> to get over the effects of flood damage on their stocks and machinery.  Many homes have been flooded.  One of the most eloquent testimonies of what that does was visible in a picture shown the other night of an elderly lady in the upstairs room of her house in Clonmel.  She has been confined there for a number of days because nobody can get in or out of the House.  She certainly cannot get in or out. In Blarney, for example, a local authority estate of 65 houses has been flooded. Examples can be multiplied and found all around the country.</P>
    <P>What has been the response to this so far?  I have to say that the response has been absolutely pitiful.  The Government have made some money available.  They have made money available, for example, to Kilmore Quay but the amount made available will go nowhere near repairing the damage to the sea wall. It is not just the problem of repairing that damage that we have to look at.  Kilmore Quay is a good example of where protective works have been breached.  The normal action of the tide on unprotected areas inside will continue to cause more damage.  The rising and falling of the tides for as long as those protective works remain broken will continue to cause difficulties, create more damage and build up more difficulties and, potentially, more future cost in dealing with it.  A tiny fraction of the amount of money required has been made available to a couple of the places that have been badly hit.  There has been nothing for most of our coast and nothing at all for areas inland that have been subjected to flooding.</P>
    <P>We learned this afternoon that a Cabinet committee is being set up.  Four Ministers will sit down and consider what might be needed.  That is the classic placatory delaying tactic.  It is a substitute for action.  God knows we have seen the Government set up committees to beat the band.  We had two more in the health sector last week.  Every time a problem comes up we seem to get a new committee. There has been a refusal to engage in a debate on this issue tonight. The Government do not like debate. They do not seem to want to talk about <Col N="1695" /> anything in the House.  They do not seem to want to hear what the House has to say or can offer by way of advice.  I wonder why?  Is it because they do not like talking about these things?  Is it because they are shy?  Is it because they do not have anything to say?  Or is it because &mdash; this is probably the real explanation &mdash; they do not have any understanding of the scale of the problem that has hit the country in the last two months?</P>
    <P>The Government dropped from their application for Structural Funds any effort to put together a programme of coastal protection.  That was a deliberate decision taken by the Government.  They had it in mind at one stage to include coastal protection works in their application for EC funds but, for some unexplained, incomprehensible reason that has been dropped.  That, in the light of what has happened in the last two months, can only be described as total ineptitude.  The last straw came today.  I could not believe my ears when I heard the following and I asked one of my press office staff to ring RTE to check it.  The announcement was made that Commissioner MacSharry had made the princely sum of £120,000 for the relief of what he called hardship caused by storm damage.  He has offered £120,000 when thousands and thousands of acres around the country are flooded.  My goodness, one would not pay the man one year for that sum.  Not content with keeping farm incomes permanently down by keeping his thumb firmly on farm prices he is now going out to insult us by making £120,000 available to resolve this problem.</P>
    <P>Let us look at what is needed.  It is clear that the 1963 Act is not the answer to this problem.  The 1963 Act allows local authorities to declare an emergency. National Exchequer funds will be made available but local authorities up to now have had to provide 50 per cent of the money themselves.  That is, for all practical purposes, a dead letter because local authorities do not have discretionary funds available to them on anything like the scale that is required <Col N="1696" /> here.  I saw one example of it this morning. For some of the work that needs to be done in Arklow money has been made available from central funds, but Wicklow County Council have had to raise a loan of £500,000 to add to it and Arklow Urban District Council are faced with the prospect of raising a loan of £500,000. They will not be able to pay the interest on it.</P>
    <P>What we need to do, therefore, is to make available a realistic amount of funding to deal with immediate repairs to protective works so that the long-term work can be put in hand later.  We need an action programme to cover all the principal coastal protection works that are needed and all the principal protection works that are needed in our main inland waterways.  It is clear that we need protective work, preventive work, on the Shannon and on the Lee and one or two other major watercourses.  When we put that programme together we need to urgently put together an application for funds from the European Community's Structural Funds, out of the unallocated £3.5 billion that remains to be spent for the current period.  If that work is not put in hand very quickly we will see continuing damage where protective works have been breached, and we will see continuing damage to the economy of many areas of this country, to tourism and to agriculture, because of the effects of continued flooding.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear from the Minister for the Environment, goodness knows, I doubt that he has much of a concrete nature to offer us&mdash;if I may coin a phrase and use a pun &mdash; but I would like to see the dawning realisation on the part of the Government that there is a problem here that will not go away and that needs to be addressed urgently.</P>

      <P>We can all appreciate the extent of the recent flooding.  We have all witnessed in our own constituencies some of the worst effects of the continuing storms and flooding.  We can all readily join with the Leader of the Opposition in sympathising with all those who have suffered <Col N="1697" /> losses because of these floods and storms, and as a Government, we are anxious to help in any way we can.</P>
      <P>First, I would like to refute any suggestion of a lack of concern on the part of the Government for the plight of people affected by the very severe weather which has been hitting the country over the past couple of months.  The House will be aware that the Taoiseach announced earlier today the setting up of a Cabinet subcommittee to examine and report on the extent and impact of the recent storm and flood damage as a matter of urgency. The subcommittee will comprise the Ministers for Finance, the Marine, the Environment and Agriculture and Food whose Departments have the appropriate expertise to assess the various forms of damage which has occurred.  It is grossly unfair of Deputy Dukes to criticise the Government for setting up this sub-committee at this time.  Had we not done so, he would have been in here pillorying me and the Government for not taking that action.  When we do the proper thing I think it is encumbent upon the Leader of any Opposition Party to be generous enough&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In so far as my own immediate area of responsibility is concerned, may I remind the House that following detailed assessments by the relevant local authorities and by my Department of the damage caused by the storms over the October bank holiday weekend, when areas of the north east experienced extremely heavy rainfalls, and by the storms which hit the east and south coasts <Col N="1698" /> on 16 and 17 December, I recently notified local authorities throughout the country of road grants totalling a further £1 million by way of assistance towards the cost of remedial works to roads and bridges affected by the storms.  That dealt effectively with the difficulties that arose last October and December.</P>
      <P>Local authorities may also avail of the significantly increased discretionary grants in 1990 for regional and county roads to undertake remedial works to roads and bridges arising from the bad weather.  The grants under this heading to county councils amount to over £63 million in 1990 compared with £47.4 million in 1989&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Serious damage along the coast has been reported following the storms of recent weeks.  The first extensive damage occurred following the storms of 16 and 17 December.  The south and east coasts were particularly badly hit and blackspots already inspected by representatives from the Department of the Marine included Bray harbour and the esplanade, Arklow harbour and the north beach, Kilmore Quay harbour and Rosslare Strand.  The Department of Finance sanction has already been received for the expenditure of State funding on Kilmore Quay.  The Minister for Finance announced a provision of £950,000 in the budget for grant assistance in respect of Arklow north beach.  The Minister for the Marine gave a lengthy reply on the question of coast protection earlier today and there is no point putting it on the record again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House may take it that the Cabinet subcommittee will now set about their task of assessing the storm damage.  For <Col N="1699" /> my part I have asked all the major local authorities to prepare reports in respect of damage to public roads and bridges and, if relevant, to water and sewage installations.  The Minister for the Marine is undertaking a full review of all coast damage for the subcommittee and the Minister for Agriculture and Food is having the farming position monitored and will be attending to that matter later this week.</P>
    <P>Indeed, we must record our appreciation to all those who helped and who are still helping in the present inclement weather conditions and the difficulties that have arisen therefrom.  I pay tribute to the Garda, the Defence Forces, the fire brigade and, indeed, all those involved in the emergency services generally.  I would also acknowledge my colleague, the Minister for Education &mdash; who is in the House &mdash; who played a very active and effective role in organising some of those emergency services in her own area over the weekend.

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be as brief as I can. The House has heard the difficulties of the Minister in trying to allocate moneys to areas of need throughout the country. I want to relate to this House a story of a local authority that has difficulty accepting money because of their internal managerial problems which have been aggravated severely by the failure of this Government to make adequate provision to that authority to provide a valuation service that would enable them to provide quotations to corporation tenants who have applied to purchase their flats.  The injustice to which I refer is that people are now paying maximum rents in local authority flats which are in excess of what <Col N="1701" /> they would pay if they were making mortgage repayments plus, probably, a service charge, if we knew what that service charge was.</P>
      <P>My concern is that of the 13,000 flats in Dublin Corporation's estate, most recent figures suggest that in excess of 1,300 have applied to purchase those flats and I am aware that that figure is probably higher as of now.  Certainly in my constituency of Dublin south-east my own calculations would suggest that some 400 and 500 applications have been made to purchase flats and that would cover up to 2,000 people.  They are being denied the right to purchase their home under the sales scheme that was introduced by the current Minister, because of unwarranted and totally unnecessary delays in the department of housing within Dublin Corporation.  The answer that has been given to me by the people in Dublin Corporation is that they simply cannot do the job because of the backlog of applications and the shortage of skilled professional staff.  It appears that each applicant's dwelling has to be individually valued by the valuer or member of his staff and that the sheer logistics of this task will result in no corporation flat applicant being looked at until 31 March and that offers will only begin to be made after 31 March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reality between the making of an offer and its acceptance and the consequential processing of that paper until such time as somebody on the maximum differential rent in a local authority flat transfers to a mortgage there can be a time-lag of six to nine months at least, if one is lucky.  In the course of all of that time people who would otherwise be getting income tax relief on that portion of the mortgage which would be eligible for such relief will find they are paying in excess by way of differential rent of what they would otherwise pay and on which they get no tax relief.  I regard that as unjust and I am here to ask the Minister what course of action he is prepared to take to remove this injustice to my constituents and indeed to other local authority tenants in the Dublin area.  I am <Col N="1702" /> unashamedly talking about a particular problem, in a particular area.</P>
    <P>I suggest, because I do not need to elaborate the point I have made, that the injustice speaks for itself and the Minister is sufficiently well briefed with the facts to concur with what I describe as being an accurate presentation of the situation that exists at the moment.  As many of these people want to buy their flats outright and there will be large sums of money coming into the local authority, it would not be unreasonable, in order to obviate what would clearly be a financial disadvantage to them if the sales scheme is prolonged, for the local authority to be empowered or directed to take on, on a contract basis for such time as is necessary, the necessary professionally skilled valuers or whoever is required, working to the terms and conditions laid down by the Chief Valuer in Dublin Corporation and in a manner that would enable every applicant to Dublin Corporation who lives in a flat to get a quotation as quickly as possible.  The cost would be paid for out of the rapid draw-down of proceeds which would follow from that.  That is really what I am saying.  We would avoid the problems that will result if people have to wait another 12 months to have their mortgage documents signed and get their tax entitlement.  The Minister should bring forward the scheme and allow the people who want to buy their flats to do so without any further delay and by using the resources that will come from the proceeds of the sales, the local authority would be enabled to hire the additional staff to complete the job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Deputy Quinn for contributing.</P>
      <P>The response to the special scheme for the sale of local authority dwellings which I introduced in February 1988 was exceptional, with 45 per cent of all tenants submitting applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of Dublin Corporation 8,875 tenants applied to purchase their houses under the scheme.  The 1988 tenant purchase scheme also allowed the sale of flats and maisonettes, at the local <Col N="1703" /> authority's discretion, although it was recognised that there were certain legal and practical difficulties in their sale.  The 1988 scheme for the sale of flats was notified to tenants by Dublin Corporation on 25 November 1988 and 1,361 tenants applied to purchase their flats.  Due to the late notification by the authorities in general of the 1988 sale of flats scheme, I introduced a new scheme for the purchase of flats early in 1989.  This enables tenants of flats and maisonettes to avail of the generous terms offered to tenants of houses under the 1988 tenant purchase scheme.  At the request of housing authorities, I have extended the closing date of this scheme from 31 December 1989 to 30 March 1990.</P>
    <P>With regard to the staffing position in the corporation, first I should explain that it is not my function to provide staff for the corporation.  The provision of staff is entirely a matter for the local authority itself subject to the various controls laid down.  In addition, the manager has complete discretion as to the allocation of staffing to the various programme areas in the corporation.  It is entirely a matter for the manager to decide as to the most effective manner to deploy staff bearing in mind the needs and requirements of the various work programmes.  In recent times staff numbers in the corporation have reduced in common with reductions in staff numbers which have been made generally in the local authority service and throughout the public service.  The corporation now has discretion to fill posts within its overall reduced staffing levels and the designation of such posts is entirely a matter for the manager.  The Deputy refers to a lack of valuation staff as a direct result of cutbacks.  I should explain I understand the corporation attempted to recruit temporary valuers towards the end of last year.  However, the competition was not successful as suitable candidates with the required qualifications were not available.</P>
    <P>The administration of the 1988 scheme and of the 1989 flats and maisonettes <Col N="1704" /> scheme has been simplified as pre-sale repairs which caused delays in previous schemes were removed.  It will take time to have all applications processed.  I suppose we are the victim of our own success in this.  The Deputy may rest assured, however, that once a tenant has submitted his application, the application will stand good even if a delay should arise in having it processed.  I am assured by the corporation that every effort is being made to have applications processed as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Because of what the Deputy has said I will ask the corporation to consider the question of temporary contract valuers but I have to say that when we wanted to take them on before Christmas we could not get them.</P>

      <P>I will put that point of view to them.  All I can say is that we would very much like to see the whole process speeded up.  We have simplified the arrangements as much as possible.  I want to get them off the desk as quickly as possible.  There has been quite a good speeding-up on the total number being completed, particularly in 1989, and it is suggested to me that that figure can be very much enhanced this year.  I will keep in mind what the Deputy says and convey his wishes in that regard to the corporation. He and I are both <i>ad idem</i> in so far as the success of this scheme is concerned.  We want to bring it to a happy conclusion.</P>

      <P>With regard to location, the bulk of the jobs created in the aquaculture industry in Donegal, Galway and Cork.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 96 together.</P>
      <P>I am glad of this opportunity to once again emphasise the Government's strong commitment to the creation of employment through the development of aquaculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Estimated output from this sector reached a value of £30 million in 1989, <Col N="1500" /> with 850 full-time and 1,300 part-time jobs.  This activity has a strong regional and coastal dimension and provides valuable income and opportunities for many communities where development options are otherwise extremely limited.  We plan to bring output up to £70 million in 1991 and to have the employment up to 3,500 jobs.</P>
    <P>We are satisfied that these targets can be achieved without disrupting other sectors and in accordance with the highest environmental standards.</P>
    <P>We are now well advanced in the preparation of new mandatory Codes of Practice for the industry and will be shortly putting in place a comprehensive ongoing inspection and monitoring programme.  I am satisfied that we will be soon in a position where it will be difficult to find any industry which is more closely regulated and monitored than the aquaculture sector.</P>
    <P>All new proposals will where relevant come within the scope of the environment impact assessment procedure. Authorisation will only be given after due public notice, the full assessment of all objections made and comprehensive technical assessments by the professional and technical staff of my Department.</P>
    <P>I would stress that as the licensing authority I am not going to be influenced in my judgment by orchestrated campaigns against the aquaculture sector.  My judgments are going to be based on well founded scientific advice and the standards and procedures applicable generally to developments in this country. To adopt any other approach would, in effect, close off development possibilities in this and other sectors and undermine reasonable aspirations for significant employment growth in many regions.</P>
    <P>As regards suggestions that a White Paper might be published, I have no plans in this regard at the moment.  I will, however, be making statements on an ongoing basis regarding the implementation of the various proposals I have mentioned in this statement.</P>

    <P>The Government have approved these programmes and are providing the resources to ensure that the objectives of the strategy will be achieved.</P>
    <P>As recognised in the strategy, the area with the greatest potential for employment creation is the fast growing aquaculture sector which is expected to account for close on 50 per cent of the targeted additional employment.  It is estimated that since the launching of the strategy up to 500 additional jobs would have been created in this sector alone at the end of 1989.  In addition, a substantial number of jobs are being generated in the other sectors of the industry.  For example, in processing, due mainly to greater availability of raw materials from expanded aquaculture production and increased landings of non-quota fish species, it is estimated that about 350 jobs have been created in 1989.  The corresponding statistics for the fishing and ancillary services sectors indicate the creation of an estimated 120 and 50 additional jobs respectively for the same period.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1502" /> It is clear from the preliminary figures I have quoted that significant progress has already been made towards the achievement of the employment targets set out in the BIM Strategy and I am confident that the employment target for the period as a whole will be achieved.</P>

      <P>Statutory responsibility for the protection of rivers and lakes from the depredations of poaching is vested in the seven regional fisheries boards.  While none of these boards would accept that an unprecedented level of poaching exists at present, there is a recognition that in certain Border county areas, coarse fish stocks are coming under growing threat from the activities of poachers who have established lucrative outlets abroad for species such as perch and bream.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regional fisheries boards are <Col N="1503" /> keenly aware of the importance of preventing poaching and have given as much attention as possible to tackling the problem over the years.  Additional equipment was recently purchased which should assist the boards' staff in providing a more effective service in this area.  My Department will continue to monitor the situation to ensure that optimum use is made of available resources in this regard.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would urge all concerned citizens to increase their vigilance where possible and to report all identified incidents of night poaching to the authorities. An increased level of assistance from this source would form an important and valued part of the boards' drive to combat the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 27, 28, 47, 56, 89 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>State funding for coast protection has been transferred from the Commissioners of Public Works to my Department from 1 January 1990.  Under the Coast Protection Act, 1963, local authorities may propose protection schemes, to be undertaken by the Commissioners of Public Works, provided that there is progressive encroachment of the sea as distinct from occasional or abnormal storms.  Since 1963, six schemes were undertaken in accordance with the Act.  I have included a tabular statement for publication in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>I intend to carry out a fundamental review of procedures for State funding of coast protection.  I am not persuaded, for the present at any rate, that the coast Protection Act is necessarily the best vehicle for dealing with proposals for such schemes.  I am aware of the considerable dissatisfaction that has been expressed at the long and complex procedures, required by the Act.</P>
      <P>I do not propose, however, to change the existing procedure whereby local authorities are primarily responsible for coast protection.  This includes identifying coastlines subject to erosion, dealing with day to day maintenance of the coastline and responding to the aftermath of occasional storms.  My Department's role will be to facilitate the implementation of permanent schemes, where warranted, to prevent progressive erosion by the sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not have an estimate of the damage caused by recent storms but I am <Col N="1507" /> aware that it was quite considerable.  I am at present assessing the damages to the coastline which will require coast protection measures.  It is clear that such measures will require a substantial programme of coast protection activity but at this stage my Department does not have the resources for such a programme.</P>
    <P>I was fortunate in being able to secure emergency funds to assist Wicklow County Council with the severe erosion problem at North Beach in Arklow.  I regret that I am unable to make similar funds available to other local authorities which are faced with these unforseen coast protection problems.  I would, nevertheless, like to assure Deputies that <Col N="1508" /> I am pursuing all available avenues, including the EC, in search of additional resources.</P>
    <P>The scale of funding required for coast protection schemes is very substantial. Individual schemes can cost in the region of £5 million each.  The OPW had applications for about 85 such schemes.  It is therefore clear that coast protection problems will require a sustained programme over a lengthy period of time.</P>
    <P>I have replied at length to these questions, because I want Deputies to appreciate that no magic wand exists to solve long-standing erosion problems, the causes of which can seldom be judged without close study and observation over a period of time.</P>

      <P>Based on the information available to me I estimate that 100-150 additional jobs will be created in the fish processing sector in 1990.</P>
      <P>The investment programme to be undertaken in 1990 will be influenced to a large extent by the amount of EC FEOGA aid approved for projects.  The additional jobs will arise from (i) projects already approved for FEOGA aid but not yet started, (ii) the expansion of existing enterprises and (iii) the start up of projects not yet approved for FEOGA aid, but expected to be approved and started up by the autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's commitment to the development of our natural resources is contained in the National Development Plan which envisages a total capital <Col N="1511" /> investment of £45 million in the fish processing sector over the period of the plan. Investment on this scale has the potential to attract £20 million in aid from FEOGA.  Indeed, in 1989 a total of £4 million was awarded to Irish fish processing projects.</P>
    <P>State support for the fish processing sector is directed towards achieving the objective of building a strong internationally competitive fish processing sector.  The attainment of this goal will involve the optimum utilisation of raw material supplies by the processing sector through appropriate financial support, investigation of new alternative sources of supply, quality improvement and strengthened marketing.</P>

    <P>The decline in tonnage over the period has been due to a number of factors.  The liquidation of Irish Shipping Limited in November 1984 resulted in the removal of more than 127,000 deadweight tons from the Irish register.  The continuing trend towards the use of container ships has also resulted in the more efficient utilisation of cargo space.</P>
    <P>In 1987, a package of incentives was introduced to encourage investment and expansion in the shipping industry.  The Shipping Investment Grants Act, 1987, provides for the payments of grants of up to 25 per cent of the total cost of the purchase of new and second hand ships up to seven years old.  In addition corporation tax levied on shipping companies has been reduced from 50 per cent to 10 per cent and shipowners have access to business expansion scheme funding. Companies may also seek funding from the National Development Corporation.</P>
    <P>The combined effect of these incentives and the general increase in demand has resulted in a 20 per cent increase in the carrying capacity of the fleet since mid-1987.</P>
    <P>A feasibility study is under way which will examine the question of access transport requirements.  The outcome of that study will assist in determining future policy in relation to shipping.</P>

      <P>In the meantime, I am anxious to use the powers which are at my disposal under the Foreshore Act, 1933, to tackle threats which may be posed to beaches at Ballybunion and Beale, County Kerry by the removal of beach material.  In that connection, I have had a prohibitory order prepared under section 6 of the Foreshore Act, 1933, to prohibit removal of beach material from Beale Strand and I hope to sign the order shortly.</P>
      <P>I am also considering what action is necessary in respect of Ballybunion Strand.

      <P>Only one Irish chemical company is licensed by my Department to dump fermentation waste at sea.  Dumping is carried out in accordance with conditions set out in the licence, which are designed to minimise any adverse effects the dumping might have.  Since 1986, when 783,000 tonnes were dumped, the amounts have been decreasing steadily.  The volume in 1989 was almost 445,000 tonnes.  The company recently announced that it will cease its dumping at sea operations later this year.  The waste will be given further chemical treatment and disposed of on land.</P>
      <P>Extensive surveys of the dump site were undertaken in 1982 and 1988.  These indicated that there were no adverse environmental impacts from dumping in the vicinity of the dump-site.  Under the terms of the licence, the company is also obliged to send my Department on a quarterly basis the results of chemical analyses of the waste being dumped.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the <i>Zeebrugge</i> ferry disaster in 1987 my Department have been concerned about our capacity to respond to accidents involving sea ferries.  An accident to a passenger ferry is potentially the most serious maritime emergency we could face.</P>
      <P>Soon after the <i>Zeebrugge</i> disaster my predecessor established the National Ferry Safety Committee, made up of technical officers of the Irish ferry companies and officers of my Department. This committee reviews safety procedures and standards on board Irish ferries and recommend any necessary improvements.</P>
      <P>From the point of view of legislation, all the recommendations which were made by the inquiry into the <i>Zeebrugge</i> disaster, with one exception, have been implemented.</P>
      <P>My Department recently held a seminar on ferry safety for professionals which included among other topics a lecture on fire at sea, its detection and extinction.  As a result of this seminar, it was decided that training in fire fighting was needed for all ferry staff.  The National Ferry Safety Committee will oversee the implementation of appropriate training courses.  The committee are planning to draft a ferry operations manual, designed to minimise fire and accident risk by ensuring good working practices.</P>
      <P>Although every effort is made to minimise the risk of fire or accident on board a ferry &mdash; and passenger ferries have an exceptionally good safety record &mdash; emergencies can occur and we must be prepared to respond to them.  The Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre (MRCC) at Shannon is responsible for co-ordinating action to deal with emergencies when they occur.  They have specific procedures laid down for coping with an incident of fire on board a vessel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of fire involving a crosschannel ferry, early notification of the UK and/or French authorities, as appropriate, is part of the plan.  International co-operation, particularly where many <Col N="1517" /> hundreds of persons are potentially at risk, is a <i>sine qua non</i> of effective search and rescue.</P>
    <P>There have been three exercises carried out in the last two years simulating accidents to ferries operating between Great Britain and Ireland.  Very valuable lessons have been learnt from these exercises. The calm and businesslike way in which the crew of the <i>Columba</i> handled the recent emergency shows the benefits of frequent practice of emergency procedures.  As recently as last October my Department had observers at a fire-fighting exercise on board the <i>Columba.</i> The exercise involved the RAF and the Gwynedd Fire Brigade, as well as the Irish Air Corps, the Naval Service and Dún Laoghaire Fire Brigade.  The National Ferry Safety Committee are arranging a similar exercise on board a B &amp; I ferry.  In view of the co-operation and interaction between UK and Irish ferry services, the response to a marine casualty in respect of an Irish ferry would be similar.</P>
    <P>In the light of experience in exercise and actual emergencies, contingency plans are amended.</P>

      <P>Threats to the marine and freshwater environments may come from a large number of sources.  An effective monitoring programme provides the necessary information for deciding on the most effective counter-measures.  In 1990, the programme for Ireland's marine waters includes projects to determine levels of metals and nutrients around the Irish coast and water quality in areas involved in fish farming and shellfish production.</P>
      <P>With regard to inland fisheries, while the local authorities have primary responsibility for maintaining water quality, the regional fisheries boards are involved daily in its protection and are doing so effectively.  This activity includes monitoring, advising on potential problems, tracing sources of pollution and fish kills and bringing prosecutions against offenders.</P>
      <P>For 1990 and subsequent years, special plans are in place under the Government action plan on the environment for speeding up the rehabilitation of Lough Sheelin. I consider these waters to be the flagship of our national programme for water quality improvement.</P>

Funds from local sources are also being raised.</P>
    <P>Protection is a very important aspect of fisheries development and recently I launched 11 new surveillance boats which will make inshore protection very effective.

      <P>My responsibilities as President of the Council relate both to fisheries and maritime transport.  Major programmes of <Col N="1520" /> work for both areas have been agreed and I am hopeful of significant progress on a number of fronts.</P>
      <P>In the fisheries area my main priorities relate to scientific research, technical conservation measures, Mediterranean policy and small scale fisheries.  Other detailed matters, such as marketing standards for tuna, the herring market situation and requirements for submission of data on landings, joint ventures as well as ongoing third country agreement negotiations, will also arise.</P>
      <P>As regards the priorities, I am putting particular emphasis on taking a hard look at the community role in scientific research relating to fisheries and especially in the area of the rationalisation and co-ordination of research.  My emphasis on this issue arises from a serious concern about the absence of a coherent Community research strategy and about the dearth of scientific advice generally.  Such advice is central to the proper management of fisheries.</P>
      <P>The proper management of fisheries also requires the adoption and implementation of proper conservation measures. This is of particular concern in the North Sea.  I will be pressing for the formulation of concrete proposals and the making of significant progress during the Irish Presidency.</P>
      <P>I will also be aiming to have launched a Mediterranean initiative designed to broaden the application of Community conservation and structural policies to the Mediterranean region.  This is a difficult dossier but an important one as I believe that the Presidency should place particular emphasis on the concerns of all member states.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the biggest priority on the fisheries side is the pushing ahead with new proposals for a structural programme for aid for small scale fisheries. This, of course, could be of particular interest to this country and I have agreed with the commissioner that this will be moved forward as an urgent matter.</P>

These proposals are currently under discussion and will feature prominently in the work programme of my Presidency.</P>
    <P>My aim is to reach agreement between member states on the early implementation of as many as possible of these important proposals and specifically those proposals to set up an EC register for all member state ships over 500 cwt; promote research and development in new technology on board ships; reciprocal recognition of seafarers' qualifications by member states; reciprocal recognition of equipment certificates (e.g. life saving appliances); tax concessions on seafarers' income and social costs in return for lower gross wage levels; improvement of the proportion of food aid shipments carried by Community vessels; and expansion of port state control inspections to include working conditions of the crew.</P>

      <Quest>the reason for the delay in giving sanction to Drogheda Harbour Commissioners, County Louth, to carry out the decision of the board as notified to his Department on 11 July 1989 to increase the pilotage rates as per the recommendations of a Rights Commissioner; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the four pilots are handling 700 vessels per annum and some years eight pilots were handling on average 450-500 vessels; to the fact that no increase has been granted to these pilots since 1987; if his Department are in breach of the terms of the Programme for National Recovery; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I have in this regard received and am having examined a specific proposal.  I have asked the promoter involved to give public notice of his proposal and I will allow the normal period for the lodging of any observations or objections by interested parties.  I have also asked my Department to hold consultations with representatives of major environmental groups as well as with representatives of the shellfish industry.</P>
      <P>In developing the aquaculture industry, there is an important role for research into new species and their suitability for cultivation in Irish conditions. Successful developments in this regard could open substantial new market opportunities and provide new jobs both in primary production and processing.</P>
      <P>Great care must be taken, however, to ensure that such developments do not damage native stocks.  Any proposed development must be subject to full professional assessment and stringent conditions must be applied.</P>
      <P>Any decisions I take on this specific proposal will be based on the results of the examinations and consultation process which is now in train and a positive decision from me to allow the project to proceed will be taken only if it is supported by the best professional and scientific advice.</P>

      <P>Since President de Klerk's accession to power last year, there have been a number of positive developments in South Africa.  Also, within the past ten days President de Klerk has taken further very significant steps, most notably the release on 11 February of Nelson Mandela.

Our approach during the Irish Presidency will be based on this position of the Twelve.</P>

      <P>Most foodstuffs, particularly <Col N="1530" /> staple foods such as meat, fish, dairy products, vegetables, bread, cereals etc., are zero rated for VAT purposes and accordingly are not affected by the reduction from 25 to 23 per cent in the standard rate announced in the budget. The reduction gives scope, however, for price cuts of 1.6 per cent in the wide range of other goods and services affected by the change.</P>

It is not clear to which embargo the Deputy is referring, but since March 1987, numbers have declined from 352, to 295 at 31 December 1989.  Due to a major restructuring in 1984, it is not possible to compare the numbers serving in individual sections on the dates mentioned by the <Col N="1531" /> Deputy.

      <P>Submissions both for and against the development of a salmon farming project at Inishfarnard Island off the Beara Peninsula have been received by my Department. These were received following publication of, and the inviting of submissions on, the Environmental Impact Statement which the promoters were directed to commission by my Department under the relevant EC Environmental Impact Assessment Directive.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Impact Statement which includes consideration of the socio-economic effects of the proposal on the local community, and the submissions received subsequently, are currently being examined by the technical and administrative staff of my Department who will report to me shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Licences in respect of a pilot salmon farming project at the site in question <Col N="1533" /> were issued last December.  The licences are of three months duration and limit production to 50 tonnes.  Because the promoters wish later to produce in excess of 100 tonnes, the public consultative process already described in connection with the Environmental Impact Statement apply; and the question of further licensing of the project will only be decided following full consideration of the views expressed by interested parties in that context.</P>
    <P>The use of Nuvan from time to time to control sealice in farmed salmon by the promoters at the site in question, would as is the case at all marine salmonid farms, be subject to the strict controls imposed by my Department.  As I indicated to the House on 30 January Nuvan's active ingredient dichlorvos does not persist in the marine environment as it breaks down in seawater; and I would refer the Deputy to my reply of that date.</P>

There is no increase in the fee for smaller boats.</P>

I am not in a position to say at this stage when details will be announced.</P>
      <P>I am not aware that confusion exists between the proposed environmentally sensitive areas scheme and the designation of certain areas as being of scientific interest.  Under the former scheme, annual premiums, part-funded by the EC, may be paid to farmers who agree to introduce or maintain farming methods which protect the environment or maintain the landscape in areas which have been specifically designated as sensitive from an environmental point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, areas of scientific <Col N="1547" /> interest are ones identified by the Wildlife Service of the Office of Public Works as part of their on-going collection of data on flora and fauna.  These areas would include certain peatlands, dune systems, burial sites, woodlands, grasslands, coastal headlands, fens and marine areas. Payments are not normally made to farmers in areas of scientific interest and no restriction in relation to farming practices are laid down.  However, full co-operation exists between the Wildlife Service and my Department to ensure that structural measures grant aided by my Department will not adversely affect the environment in these areas.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The arrangements for payment of rent supplements will be reviewed in the light of the increased rates of social welfare payments announced in the recent budget <Col N="1553" /> which come into effect in July.  It is not possible at this stage to say what the revised arrangements will be but, in any event, after-rent incomes will be fully protected against inflation.</P>

Her late husband, who died on 20 October 1989, had been in receipt of a retirement pension, which included a free fuel allowance.

      <Quest>if he will change the regulations to the disablement pension which will enable recipients of disablement pension whose disablement is assessed at more than 20 per cent to take a gratuity in exchange for their disablement pension in cases of exceptional hardship.</Quest>

      <P>Disablement benefit is a long-term benefit payable under my Department's occupational injuries scheme and is normally paid after injury benefit has ceased to be payable.  Payment is made in respect of the assessed loss of faculty, either physical or mental, resulting from occupational accidents or prescribed diseases and the level of payment varies with the percentage loss of faculty involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation provides that where the claimant's disablement is assessed at less than 20 per cent payment can be made either by way of a gratuity or of a weekly <Col N="1554" /> pension.  Where the level of disablement is assessed at the rate of 20 per cent overpayment can only be made by way of a pension.  Payment of a gratuity instead of a pension is clearly warranted where the amount involved is relatively small and where the weekly pension would also be very small.  It is not clear, however, that payment of a gratuity in other cases would in general be in the interest of claimants.  Any change in these provisions would be a matter for legislation.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the provisions of the deed of transfer agreed to by the person concerned and his son on 12 September 1988, the latter has undertaken to support and maintain his parents during their lifetime.  Consequently, the person concerned was not awarded a free fuel allowance.</P>

      <P>I have received a report from Cork County Council, and from other local authorities, outlining the extent of the damage caused to public property during severe weather in October and December 1989.  In the case of Cork county, the report includes information about the cost of damage in the Midleton area which, I understand, covers Ballycotton and Gyleen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated in reply to an Adjournment debate on 7 February 1990, road grants totalling £1 million have been notified to local authorities in areas affected by the October and December storms by way of assistance towards the cost of remedial works to roads and bridges <Col N="1566" /> which fall within the area of responsibility of my Department.</P>
    <P>Much of the damage caused by the December storms which affected the east and south coast appears to relate to coastal defences.  I understand that the local authorities concerned have raised this aspect with the Department of the Marine.</P>
    <P>With regard to the storms which have occurred within the past week or so, I have asked local authorities to prepare reports in relation to damage to public property falling within my area of responsibility.  When these reports have been received, I will consider appropriate action.</P>
    <P>In any event, it is open to local authorities to use the significantly increased discretionary grants for regional and county roads notified for 1990 to undertake remedial works on these roads arising from the recent storms.  The grants to county councils under this heading amount to £63.1 million in 1990 compared with £47.4 million in 1989 and £33.4 million in 1988.</P>

      <P>Early in 1988 a review of the range of food items available on the GMS was carried out by a group established by the GMS (Payments) Board.</P>
      <P>The group examined the range of food products available on the GMS taking clinical importance, usage, and retail price, into account.  The group recommended the removal from the GMS of a number of items which could not be considered to form a basic and essential part of patient diet.  Therefore, gluten-free biscuits and crackers, and a number of pasta products, among others, were removed from general availability on the GMS list.  Gluten-free brown and white bread and bread mixes remain available on the GMS as do gluten-free flour, bran and baking powder.</P>
      <P>The products removed are low cost items, readily available in supermarkets and retail pharmacies.  Health boards do, of course, provide financial assistance towards the cost of requisites which are not available on the GMS scheme, if there is genuine financial hardship being incurred in their purchase.  Anyone who considers that the purchase of these items is causing them hardship should contact their local health board to make application for assistance.</P>

      <P>The position in relation to national schools is that since these schools are under local patronage and management, arrangements for the use of premises after school hours or outside term time are a matter for the board of management of each school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1575" /> I have no objection to the use of schools by community groups, provided: that the prior permission of the individual board of management be obtained; that the assent of the trustees be obtained; that an undertaking be given that every care will be taken to safeguard school property and that any damage to the school premises or equipment will be made good by those responsible for the activity; that arrangements be made to leave the premises in a clean and tidy condition for the reception of pupils so that school work will not be affected; that an adequate insurance against damage by fire be effected if the ordinary policy of insurance taken out by the school authorities does not cover the use of the school buildings for purposes other than national school purposes; and that the board ensure that sufficient charge is made to cover any expense incurred in providing heating and lighting during the use of the school by outside groups.</P>
    <P>In so far as community schools are concerned the deeds of trust in respect of such schools provide for their use for community purposes.  The question of when they are used for such purposes is basically a matter for the board of management of each school.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the use of vocational and secondary schools outside of school terms is a matter for the managerial authorities of these schools.</P>

      <P>The statistical data at primary level requested by the Deputy is set out in the attached table which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>As pupils in a major urban or suburban area are not confined to any particular school catchment area, it would neither be feasible nor appropriate to attempt a precise identification of post-primary places available by school.</P>
      <P>The overall position regarding available post-primary accommodation in areas adjoining and accessible to the Castleknock area, and information from the various post-primary school authorities in the adjoining areas indicate that there is adequate accommodation to serve the needs of the Castleknock area.</P>

      <P>Section 10 of the Intermediate Education (Ireland) Act, 1878, contained provisions in relation to accounts of the Intermediate Education Board of Ireland.  By order dated 8 June 1923, the Intermediate Education Board was dissolved and a board of commissioners, called the Intermediate <Col N="1586" /> Education Commissioners, was established to exercise in Soarstát Éireann all the functions which were on 6 December 1921 exercisable in that area by the Intermediate Education Board.  Two further orders dated 31 March 1925 dissolved the Intermediate Education Commissioners, transferred their jurisdictions, powers, duties and functions to the Minister for Education, vested certain assets of the commissioners in the Minister, provided that the statutory funds of the commissioners should be wound up and disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer in such a manner as the Minister for Finance should appoint and that the expenses of the public services in connection with intermediate education should be paid as from and after 31 March 1925 out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>With the exception of endowments under the Educational Endowments (Ireland) Act, 1885, all moneys at the disposal of the Minister now and for the past ten years are accounted for in the Appropriation Accounts which are submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General in the form and within the time required.  Accounts of endowments controlled by the Minister under the Educational Endowments (Ireland) Act are audited by the Local Government Auditor in accordance with the 1885 Act.</P>

      <P>I have already outlined in some detail the position regarding the implementation of the programme in relation to both public and private projects in my reply of 30 January 1990.  As stated, day-to-day administration, including evaluation and selection of applications, is a matter for the administering agencies, i.e. OPW in relation to State expenditure and Bord Fáilte and SFADCo in relation to all other projects. Consequently the information requested is not readily available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operation and progress of the Tourism Programme over the next four years will be monitored by a committee chaired by my Department, which will include representatives from the EC Commission.  A preliminary meeting took place on 22 January last and the first formal meeting of the committee is scheduled to take place next month.  The <Col N="1594" /> Commission have already nominated their representation of the committee.</P>
