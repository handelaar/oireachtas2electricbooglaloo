      <P>I have notice of motion under Standing Order 30 from Deputy Spring.  Will the Deputy please state the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with Standing Order 30 I gave you notice of my intention to raise, at the commencement of public business, a matter of important public interest requiring urgent attention.  The matter is as follows: that this House views with concern the agreement concluded yesterday between the banks and Mr. Larry Goodman which leaves the company concerned in a dominant position in the beef processing industry.  This House demands a statement of full disclosure of all the actual and potential implications of the agreement for taxpayers, workers in the beef industry, farmers and beef producers and the national interest.  This House further calls on the Minister for Industry and Commerce to make a full statement on all these matters prior to announcing any decision that he might make under the powers vested in him by monopolies legislation and further calls on the Minister to satisfy himself that there are no further questions to be asked <Col N="1714" /> about the conduct of the previous management of this company before agreeing to the management structure now proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Having fully considered the matter I do not consider that it is one contemplated by Standing Order 30 and I cannot, therefore, grant leave to move the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Ceann Comhairle not agree that this is a specific matter of general public importance which has arisen suddenly in that the report has just been published?  It is likely to develop significantly before the Dáil will, in practice, have a chance of discussing it because the Minister may approve this under the mergers legislation, and may do so at any time, without the approval of the Dáil.  Because of the Minister's involvement through the mergers legislation, it is a matter within the current responsibility of the Government.  Therefore, on all five points which govern the admissibility of questions of this kind, the matter is in order under Standing Order 30.  Will you accept a submission from me that your ruling should be reconsidered in the light of the facts and the order which I quoted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot allow further discussion on this matter now.  I have made my ruling in accordance with precedent but, since the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy John Bruton, has challenged my ruling in the matter I can only tell him that the matter raised fails to meet some of the criteria, namely, that it is not likely to develop significantly before the Dáil will, in practice, have an opportunity of discussing it.  Further, my information at present is that the examiner's report is before the High Court today which makes the matter technically <i>sub judice.</i>  The matter, therefore, is not within the current responsibility of the Government.  Further, the application of the monopolies legislation is contingent on the court's decision and, in any event, would be dependent on the ministerial <Col N="1715" /> investigation under statutory entitlements. These are some of the reasons I have taken the precaution, at the request of Deputy Sean Barrett, of circularising all Members in respect of the criteria which apply to Standing Order 30 and the Chair will adhere rigidly to that precedent and procedure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect &mdash; I thank you for having circulated that material which is particularly helpful to Members &mdash; I submit that in your re-examination of this matter the issue is likely to develop further before the Dáil has an opportunity of discussing it in that there is no provision for a Dáil discussion on this matter currently.  The Minister is likely to make a decision on the mergers legislation in relation to permission for this matter before the Dáil has an opportunity of discussing it.  There is a tight timetable in relation to business for the rest of this session and unless the Government agree to postpone the Christmas recess, we will not have an opportunity of discussing the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;WHEREAS the child shall enjoy a special protection, shall be given opportunites and facilities by law and other means to enable it to develop physically, mentally, and socially in a healthy and normal manner in the conditions of freedom and dignity.</P>
      <P>WHEREAS in the enactment of laws for this purpose the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration.  The child wherever possible will grow up in the care and under the responsibility of its parents.  Society and the Public Authorities shall have the duty to extend particular care to children without a family and to those without adequate means of support: the child is entitled to receive education which will promote its general culture and enable it on the basis of an equal opportunity to develop its abilities.</P>
      <P>WHEREAS the best interests of the child should be the guiding principle of those responsible for his education and guidance: the child shall in all circumstances be among the first to receive protection and relief: the child shall be protected against all forms of neglect, cruelty and exploitation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks to insert in our law part of the United Nations Charter which declares clear legal rights for children.  It is aspirational in tone but it is also detailed.  We have discussed this proposal in the select committee.  At that time the Minister of State said there was an updated United Nations Convention which went further and that consultations were taking place which would lead us to ratify that Convention.  The Minister can correct me but my understanding is that that Convention has not been ratified.  Therefore, the purpose of this amendment still stands, that somewhere in our legal code there should be a clear assertion that we acknowledge the primacy of the need for the protection of children and the need to ensure that <Col N="1725" /> positive discrimination is given to the protection of children, and that in all aspects of our laws the best interests of the child should be served.  That should be a guiding principle for those who are responsible for the care and education of our children.  It would be a serious omission not to insert a preamble of this nature in the legislation.  In view of the fact that the Minister's commitment to ratifying the Convention has not been adhered to, the arguments made on Committee Stage still stand.  On this historic occasion &mdash; given that the last time we had a major children's Act was 1908 and that it may well be 100 years before we have another &mdash; I ask that the Minister accept this amendment as an aspiration and a statement from all the House as to our best intentions for children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Those of us who were involved in this Bill feel almost like a family as we have been working for so long on this legislation.  It is the intention of all sides of the House and all shades of opinion that we seek to have this comprehensive and very good Bill enacted as speedily as possible.  We had a long debate on Committee Stage on the merits of inserting the amendment now proposed by Deputy Yates into the Bill.  As I understand it, the only line of opposition from the Minister at that time was, first, that it was not usual to have such a preamble and, second, it had no legal force as it would not be an integral part of the Bill.  Basically, we have an agreed view that this is not normal legislation.  It is, as Deputy Yates has indicated, the first major legislation updating the legal framework as regards children's welfare since 1908.  For that reason it should be dealt with separately and a statement of principle, as embodied in the amendment before us, which is a worthwhile one, would be the right signal to set for all that follows and all the work that has been put in by all sides of the House, by the officials of the Minister's Department and by the Minister himself in bringing forward, at the close of this century, a legal framework which is closer to what the children of this country deserve.  On <Col N="1726" /> behalf of the Labour Party, I support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment, on which I recall we had a lengthy debate at the end of our Committee exercise earlier in the year.  While I share my colleague's relief that at last we are on the final stages of this important Bill, I would like to remind the last speaker that we did have major legislation called the Status of Children Bill which dealt with the care and welfare of children, a Bill which I had the great honour of introducing in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I share the concern of everybody to get this legislation through as expeditiously and efficiently as possible.  I am concerned at legislation of this nature which comes in just before the Christmas recess and tends to be rushed through.  I hope that will not be the case.  When the Bill goes to the Seanad I hope it will have the same care, time and attention given to it as on Committee Stage in this House.  Many comments made by the Minister during Committee Stage gave me great hope.  I believe we will see fundamentally changed legislation given that we have the Law Reform Commission report on child sexual abuse, in which a number of recommendations were made for this legislation.  I am depressed by what I have seen in the Minister's amendments in specific areas.  That does not mean that I and the people on this side of the House will cease trying to have amendments included and to have the Bill further amended at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to think back on the goodwill and the care with which he dealt with the Committee Stage debate and to look at what Deputy Yates is attempting to bring in &mdash; a credible aspiration or statement to indicate the importance and status of this Bill.  A two line title does not achieve that.  It would be regrettable if the Minister did not understand what we are seeking.  Anything that is said from this side of the House is meant well and should not be seen as threatening. Ideal legislation is legislation which is amended by the whole House.  The people who take legislation such as this seriously and who spend much time and trouble in consultations and come back <Col N="1727" /> with the views of those people who are working in child care should have their views taken on board.  On this point it has yet to be proved that the important issues brought up during Committee Stage have been taken seriously by the Minister.  I do not want to talk for the sake of talking because I, too, want to get this Bill through the Dáil; I ask the Minister to go back to the pleasant and co-operative attitude he adopted on Committee Stage and to bring it into this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the other Deputies who expressed their appreciation of the fact that this Bill has now reached Report Stage.  There are a large number of amendments for Report Stage.  As The Workers' Party spokesman on Health I insist that this legislation, which is so important, be enacted as quickly as possible because many agencies out there are crying out for legislation at this time.  We in The Workers' Party limited the number of amendments which were tabled, and I hope the amendments put down will be dealt with in a manner which will enable the Bill to be enacted.</P>
      <P>I have studied the amendment proposed by Deputy Yates.  One would find it difficult to object to its inclusion as a Preamble to the Bill, and I am supporting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of Report Stage and I hope we will be able to get through it as efficiently and as effectively as possible without having to rush through some of the more important sections.</P>
      <P>Like my colleagues, I want to express my gratitude to the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Noel Treacy, for the attitude he adopted to the points raised by us on Committee Stage and for the way he responded to them.  I look forward to the same kind of constructive debate on Report Stage and hope the Minister will be open to including in the Bill the provisions we believe are important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe any more constructive provision could be included in the Bill <Col N="1728" /> than the preamble proposed in Deputy Yates's amendment.  I know it was pointed out on Committee Stage that it was unnecessary, unusual and almost impossible to include such a preamble in the Bill but all Members, in particular those who were on the Committee, are aware that this is one of the most fundamental Bills to be brought before this House.  We have been constantly made aware that this Bill will have to protect the most vulnerable section of our society, children, who do not have the maturity to proclaim and demand their rights.  We, as legislators, have a responsibility to protect those children in as comprehensive a Bill as possible.  I do not believe there could be a more comprehensive, guiding or fundamental provision than this preamble.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is contained in this preamble which states &ldquo;... in the enactment of laws for this purpose the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration&rdquo;.  It also provides that the child is entitled to receive education which will promote its general culture and enable it, on the basis of an equal opportunity, to develop its abilities.  We have never achieved this and we owe it to children to include this provision in the Bill.  The preamble further provides that the child shall, in all circumstances, be among the first to receive protection and relief.  I would like to think that every section of the Bill would take into account the provisions proposed in this amendment.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and his Government recognise the importance of the UN Convention from which this preamble has been taken.  Indeed, the Taoiseach travelled to the United Nations to support the Convention on behalf of this nation. I hope that when this Bill and the other small pieces of legislation which are still outstanding are passed we will be able to ratify the Convention on children's rights.  We will be a disgrace until we do that.  I believe this preamble focuses on what this Bill will have to achieve.  The Bill will stand by itself and, regardless of precedent, the preamble proposed in amendment No. 1 should be included in the Bill to remind us all of its importance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I and my team from my Department are delighted to be back here for the Report Stage of this very important and historic Bill.  I sincerely thank the previous speakers for the very generous and warm statements they made here this morning.  I gave a number of commitments on Committee Stage and I will do what I can to honour those commitments and be as fair and generous as possible throughout this Report Stage debate.</P>
      <P>The amendment before us was already debated in detail on Committee Stage.  It is based on the declarations of the rights of the child adopted by the United Nations some years ago.  However, the matter has progressed a good deal since then and the United Nations has now adopted a convention on the rights of the child which goes further than the original declaration from which this amendment is taken.</P>
      <P>This convention was recently signed by the Taoiseach at the United Nations Headquarters in New York with a view to its early ratification by the State.  It has been examined by the Department of Foreign Affairs in consultation with other relevant Departments with a view to establishing what legislative and other steps may be necessary to enable the State to ratify the convention.</P>
      <P>The convention itself goes much further than the old declaration.  For example, it refers to the child's need for appropriate legal protection before as well as after birth.  It also provides specifically that in all actions concerning children, whether by public or private social welfare agencies, courts, administrative bodies or legislatures, the best interest of the child shall be a primary consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the rights of the child recognised by the convention are the right to life itself; the right to freedom of expression; the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; the right to privacy; the right to protection from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse; the right to an adequate standard of living and the right to rest <Col N="1730" /> and leisure.  Section 3 of this Bill provides that we will regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration. I think that provision encompasses and embraces much of what is in the convention and covers what it stands for.</P>
    <P>I could go on but I think what I have outlined makes the point that the convention is a much more substantial and far-reaching document than the old declaration and that it would be a mistake to enshrine the declaration in law when the Government are actively pursuing the question of the ratification of the new convention.  We have signed that convention and are examining the legal consequences pertaining to its ratification. This will be done in due course and in view of this I sincerely ask Deputy Yates to withdraw his amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleagues and I tabled some 200 amendments on Committee Stage and only 10 per cent in my name were pressed to a vote.  It is not something I intend to do often on Report Stage &mdash; although we have over 25 hours' debate on this Bill time is scarce &mdash; but I will do so on this occasion.</P>
      <P>The type of language used in the Bill is important.  My amendment provides that the child shall enjoy a special protection; the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration; it will be the duty of public authorities to extend particular care to children; a child is entitled to receive education and the child shall in all circumstances be among the first to receive protection and relief. I believe the language used in the amendment encapsulates all the important aspects in the protection of the child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage, the Minister used the convention in his argument.  We all know human rights conventions are easily signed, but it takes a very long time, perhaps a decade, to ratify them. I believe we have an opportunity this morning to deal with this important issue <Col N="1731" />&mdash; I feel very strongly about this.  The Minister also said on Committee Stage that he relied upon the Constitution and natural law to give children these rights. It is questionable whether the primacy of children's rights is endorsed in our existing law and in our Constitution, given the conflicting rights of others.  I will be withdrawing some amendments and appealing to the Minister to accept others, but I believe the question should be put on this amendment, first, to ascertain numbers, and, second, as a further attempt to enact this important statement.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Not later than 12 months from the date of the enactment of this Act, and at the end of each subsequent 12 months period until the entire Act has been brought into effect, the Minister shall lay before each House of the Oireachtas a report detailing the progress made in bringing the Act into effect.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In my opening remarks I stressed the importance of the legislation that the Dáil is about to enact.  The reason I attach so much importance to it &mdash; I am sure everyone else recognises this fact &mdash; is that many changes have taken place in society during the past decade and will continue to occur, not all for the best. Very often these changes have resulted in family problems and where such problems arise the children can be the first to be affected.  We cannot deny this fact. We see this happening all over the place and we have received various reports from the health agencies and so on.  As I pointed out, there is a necessity to enact legislation to deal with this.</P>
      <P>Once we have decided there is a need to enact legislation to deal with this, it is only reasonable to request that we incorporate an amendment into that Bill which reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1732" /> Not later than 12 months from the date of the enactment of this Act, and at the end of each subsequent 12 months period until the entire Act has been brought into effect, the Minister shall lay before each House of the Oireachtas a report detailing the progress made in bringing the Act into effect.</P>
    <P>We debated a similar amendment on Committee Stage but I have amended that amendment and changed the figure to 12 months.  That is very reasonable.</P>
    <P>The question which must be asked is what good reason could be put forward for not agreeing to an amendment which would result in a report being laid before the House on the progress made implementing the law to be enacted.  Having regard to the fact that many pious platitudes have been advanced concerning the need for this legislation, my one fear is that it could be left to gather dust on the shelves in the Minister's office.  I fear that is what is going to happen.  Quite recently we noticed that there will be no significant increase in the amount of funding to be allocated to the health services over and above the rate of inflation.  How, therefore, can we expect the personnel involved, who are already overburdened, to implement this legislation?  The Workers' Party have considered this matter very carefully and attach great importance to the need for a report detailing the progress made in implementing the Bill before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment which we debated on Committee Stage. I would like to restate my position.  The House is in agreement that this Bill has been a long time gestating and has its genesis in the task force on child care established by my distinguished predecessor as a Deputy for Wexford, Mr. Brendan Corish.  Various forms of this Bill have appeared before this House either in the name of a Government Minister or, in one case, in the name of a Private Member.  Quite frankly, I think it is a reasonable request that once this Bill is enacted by the Oireachtas &mdash; I hope within the next couple of months &mdash; we will not forget about it.  Given that it has taken so long to frame, draft <Col N="1733" /> and put in place the legislative framework we desire, it is only reasonable that we be given the opportunity annually to see how far we have progressed in turning our aspirations into reality.</P>
      <P>The section which will allow the Minister to bring in either a portion or the whole Bill, as he deems appropriate, should have a counter-balancing mechanism which would enable the Dáil to monitor the progress made by the Minister and give us the opportunity, annually, to address the issues which have occupied so much of our time during the past few years.  This is a reasonable and sensible amendment and I hope that on Report Stage there will be evidence of the Minister's goodwill, which we enjoyed on Committee Stage, and his willingness to accept an amendment which would allow proper monitoring of very important legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I supported this amendment on Committee Stage and I support it now as many new rules, structures and provisions will flow from this legislation once enacted.  To allow those of us in Leinster House and child care agencies outside to monitor and understand what is happening, there is a necessity to adopt this amendment, which is both credible and necessary.  During the Committee Stage debate the Minister said that since this had never been done and was unheard of, it would not be done.  I suggest that we should consider doing things that have never been done before.  There is a need for us to reform the way we do our work here to make sure that our legislation is working because, having prepared and enacted legislation, it is both futile and expasperating to find that no one knows what happened to it or that it has not been put into force.  This amendment is well worth thinking about and I hope the Minister will either accept it or give a commitment to bring in something in keeping with the intention of the amendment.</P>

      <P>I, too, support the amendment and wish to remind the Minister that in responding to our first amendment to the preamble he stated that it should not be included because we <Col N="1734" /> have advanced beyond that point.  Taking him at his word and recongnising the advance being made in the area of child care, I ask the Minister to take this progressive step and to make sure that a report is laid before the House.  I am well aware of the fact that not alone would such a report be of importance to the legislators, as it would allow them to monitor continuing needs, but would also be of importance to the health boards, child care agencies and the alliance of child care workers as it would acknowledge and put down markers regarding that work being done and comments made by them.  I presume that if such a report were to be laid before the House we would be in a position to welcome public comment from interest groups.  To effectively monitor the implementation of this very important Bill it will be necessary to adopt this amendment.  Bearing in mind the Minister's progressive ideas on this Bill, I now rely on him to respond positively.</P>

      <P>I can understand the reasons Deputy Sherlock introduced this amendment, but I am afraid it would take away from the need to probe and ask questions on the Order of Business on the progress made implementing the Bill. From a practical point of view, I foresee a difficulty in this proposal, in that the Minister of State, his officials and Department could spend the entirety of their time reporting to the Oireachtas without being able to implement the regulations or whatever other measures need to be implemented.  I foresee that this would lead to another fall-back position in which the Department would be strangled into having to spend most of their time on paperwork and less time in implementing the provisions of the Bill. It would be my hope that once this Bill is enacted the health boards would take it upon themselves to ensure that progress is made, that within the health board and their community care structures those committees would report to the members of the health boards or to whoever is involved in the care of children within those structures.  I would suggest that would be a progressive step, as opposed to reporting to the <Col N="1735" /> Oireachtas, which would really only add another layer of administration to a Department rather than implementing regulations or parts of the Bill which may not have been implemented and which may take somewhat longer to do.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 2 in the name of Deputy Sherlock seeks to reopen in a slightly different way the question discussed and decided by the full House when we debated this Bill here on 1 November 1989, 13 months ago.  On that occasion Deputy Sherlock and his colleague, Deputy McCartan, tabled an amendment which sought to compel the Minister to bring all sections of the Bill into force within 12 months of its passage. As I explained then, and confirm today, it is the intention of the Government to have the Bill fully implemented and operational as soon as possible.  It will be possible to implement many of its sections within the next 12 months but other provisions may require more time before being properly implemented.  That is why the Government are opposed to a fixed implementation date; that is consistent with all legislation.</P>
      <P>For example, all of the new legal procedures in relation to placing children in care will necessitate the drawing up of new and expanded rules of court.  These rules are not drawn up by the Minister for Health but by the relevant rules of court committee, comprised largely of members of the Judiciary.  It may take some time for that committee to complete their deliberations, given the complexity of the issues involved and the need to ensure that the rules are watertight.</P>
      <P>It will also be necessary for the Minister and my Department to prepare detailed regulations in relation to the placement of children in foster care, the inspection of residential facilities for children and the provision of pre-school services.  These will take some time to prepare, particularly if we are to allow for consultation with the various voluntary bodies and staff groups.  All of these steps will take some time but I can assure the House that the Bill will be implemented as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1736" /> I note that Deputy Fennell has left the House.  She spoke about reform and reforming.  We are here reforming child legislation that has been on the Statute Book for almost 100 years.  As Deputy Barnes said, we are making great advances.  The officials of my Department eagerly await the passage of this Bill, as do the officials of the health boards, professionals in child care right across the board and professional voluntary organisations involved with child care nationwide.  We as a Government and the Department of Health collectively will do what we can to ensure that the provisions of the Bill are fully implemented as soon as possible.  Nonetheless, we must take into account the legal constraints on us and the complexities of the Bill.  We must ensure there is nothing left to chance, that when rules and regulations are laid down they are watertight, operable, will withstand the test of law and will be fair and equitable right across the board.</P>
    <P>Against that background, I do not think there is anything to be gained by requiring the Minister for Health to produce regular reports on progress in implementing the provisions of this Bill.  The opportunity is there for the Opposition at any time to table a Private Members' motion, to question the Minister at Question Time, to raise matters under any system available to us in this House for airing matters such as these.</P>
    <P>As my colleague, Deputy Coughlan, has said, were we to deploy our existing qualified staff and place additional responsibilities on them to produce reports for these Houses in respect of this or any other Bill, we would not be serving the country well or indeed getting value for money.  The opportunity is there at any time for the House to decide whether that needs to be done.  As we have now aired this issue for the third time in the House, in November 1989, in the Special Committee earlier this year and again today, I would respectfully suggest to Deputy Sherlock that he withdraw this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Sherlock's amendment No. 2.  The Minister would appear to be endeavouring to put <Col N="1737" /> forward a smokescreen here.  Indeed, his arguments and those advanced by Deputy Coughlan are totally bogus.</P>
      <P>Clearly the level of commitment on the part of this Government to child care services will be very questionable once the provisions of this Bill will have been enacted.  Even a cursory glance at the 1991 Book of Estimates would indicate that there is no increased provision for child care services, no programme management structure to be established for child care services, no new structures within the Department of Health to liaise on child care services with the eight health boards.  There is no new development by way of the provision of centres for the referral of deprived children. There are no new family support mechanisms to deal with the problems of abused children, nor are there any structures being put in place to rectify the under-reporting of child abuse in certain parts of the country.</P>
      <P>Therefore, when we rip away the veneer of the Minister's public relations exercise <i>vis-à-vis</i> this reforming legislation we see that once he is no longer accountable to this House, once the Bill is passed, there will be no mechanism available to use whereby we can bring him or his Department to heel&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or indeed the Minister's successors, in respect of whom the same would apply.  For example, we might have future Ministers or Ministers of State who might have a total disregard for or interest in this area.  We are not just personalising this issue; we are talking about future decades of child care.  It is a farce and a disgrace for Deputy Coughlan and the Minister of State to assert here this morning that it would be too much trouble for departmental officials to produce a report on the services once a year, that that would strangle them with paperwork.  These people are accountable to the public and to this House.  This House has never insisted on adequate accountability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we look at section 8 (1), as amended <Col N="1738" /> by the Special Committee, we see it reads:</P>
    <P>A health board shall, as soon as may be after the commencement of this Part and thereafter annually or as may be directed by the Minister, have a report prepared on the adequacy of the child care and family support services available in its area.</P>
    <P>It is all right for the eight health boards to produce a report but it is not all right for the Department to give an overview of the position.  It must be borne in mind that the Minister has also rejected a national children's council, which would oversee the work being done in an independent way.  This means that what the Minister is saying is that not only can he not ensure that a year is a reasonable period within which to have all the regulations drawn up but he is also ensuring there will be no annual accountability to this House, to the country, for the national child care services and, furthermore, no independent watchdog put in place.</P>
    <P>Arising out of the debate we had in this House in November 1989 and the further debate in May of this year, the need for acceptance of this amendment was never greater.  The Minister says that because we have rehashed the arguments, the arguments advanced by Deputy Sherlock and my colleagues are not valid.  I contend they were never more valid because they have been totally ignored.  It is not unreasonable to say that the rules of court, the regulations in relation to foster care, those in relation to residential homes should be made available within a year.  A year is an adequate period within which those rules can be put together.  The Minister has referred to people eagerly awaiting the passage of this Bill.  We do not want circumstances to arise in two or three years' time in which these people still eagerly await the regulations to be made under this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

      <P>Yet we have absolutely no say in or control over the matter.  The more we examine this, the greater the <Col N="1739" /> need for this amendment to be accepted. A year is a reasonable period and I feel it is essential, because no other structures are being put in place and I understand some of those structures we are proposing are now going to be ruled out of order. The need for this was never greater and we will be supporting the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Three times the Minister replies and says, &ldquo;As soon as possible but there are these problems.  They have to refer to certain sections, the Judiciary and so on&rdquo;.  I am now convinced that the Minister and his Government have no notion of implementing this legislation. Beyond any doubt I am convinced and I will say why.  There is no shortage today of advisers to the Minister in the Dáil. Deputy Coughlan talks about adding another layer of bureacucracy to this.  I tell Deputy Coughlan that all this is asking is that a report be prepared on the progress of implementing the legislation which this Dáil will very shortly enact. Because there are so many different agencies dealing with child care services, it is natural that there could be problems about co-ordination of effort, consequently it will be necessary to have a progress report.  What are we talking about?  We are talking about little <Col N="1740" /> children being deprived because there is no legislation at present to provide against that.  We know thoroughly well there are people out there willing and able to do this job and they belong to the statutory bodies or voluntary bodies.  We are told that because it is so complicated the Minister might not be able to come in here with a report and that it would put a burden on the officials of his Department to prepare such a report. That is ludicrous in such important legislation as this.  All that is being sought is that a report be prepared detailing the progress in bringing the Bill into effect.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider this, otherwise it will be taken by all those people who are waiting patiently for this legislation to be enacted that the Minister and his Government do not serously intend to bring it into effect at all.  I have to say that much because I see quite clearly there is no valid reason that a report should not be prepared, whatever progress is made within 12 months.  There may not be much progress but there ought to be progress because of the urgency of the situation.  Surely it is reasonable to ask for a report on that progress, and that is all this amendment is doing.  I ask the Minister to accept it.</P>

      <P>In page 5, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;foster-parent&rdquo; means a person other than the child's natural parents who undertakes the care and maintenance of the child,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>First, I would like to say that I am very disappointed amendment No. 3 has been ruled out of order because it is at the core of what was in the Kennedy Report.  I will come back to that matter later. Throughout the summer there was shuffling between the Departments of Health, Education and Justice on child care services and juvenile justice, and that was most unsatisfactory.  In relation to the comments made by the Minister of State and the Minister for Health last May, that one Department would take overall responsibility for all aspects of child care, and that the matter would go before Cabinet for a final decision, I would like to know the outcome of that process.</P>
      <P>In regard to amendment No. 4, I believe foster parents deserve greater recognition and it is important that they are defined in the legislation.  This is a legal definition &mdash; I got some legal advice on this &mdash; and I would ask the House to accept may amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 4 from Deputy Yates is grouped with amendments Nos. 143 and 150.  Deputy Yates's proposal to insert a definition of &ldquo;foster parents&rdquo; is designed to facilitate later amendments from him in relation to section 34, removal from foster care or residential care.  I have put down a number of amendments in relation to section 34 and I would like to refer to them now.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that section 34 provoked widespread opposition from foster parents, who feared the arbitrary removal of foster children by health boards.  It was discused at great length at the special committee on 1 May last and I gave an undertaking to review the matter for Report Stage.  Without reopening that discussion, I would like to remind the House that the purpose of section 34 is to enable a health board to remove a child whom it has placed in foster care or residential care.  There are many reasons why a health board might need to remove a child.  It might be to reunite the child with his parents; to move him to a more appropriate placement; it might be that the child himself wishes to move; it could even be that there are allegations that the child is not being properly cared for in his current placement.</P>
      <P>I do not think anyone would disagree that the health board should have the right to remove a child where necessary. I accept, however, that we must guard against arbitrary, unplanned or inappropriate removals.  Foster parents, in particular, need to have some sense of security that their fostering placement will not be abruptly ended without very good reason.</P>
      <P>Given all the different situations that can arise, it would not be practicable to set out in the Bill the precise circumstances in which a health board should be entitled to remove a child.  I propose that these should be spelled out in regulations which would be made by the Minister for Health under the proposed new subsection (1) to be inserted by amendment No. 143.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My other three amendments, Nos. 148, <Col N="1744" /> 149 and 150, are consequential on the proposed deletion of existing subsections (1) and (2) and the insertion of the new subsection (1).  These changes go a long way towards meeting the concerns of fostering parents for security in relation to their situation.  In view of my amendment, I would ask Deputies to consider withdrawing their amendments to section 34.  As regards amendment No. 4, I suggest to Deputy Yates that there is no need to insert such a definition and that he might consider withdrawing that amendment also.</P>

      <P>That is the point I want to raise.

We are dealing with the definition section of the Bill.  I do not think it would be appropriate, and it would be very difficult for us to follow, if we were to deal with section 34 out of sequence in conjunction with this amendment. It is quite appropriate that reference be made to the section but presumably we will have a full scale <Col N="1745" /> debate on that section when we arrive at it.  As of this moment, the only matter to be addressed fundamentally is a definition of foster parent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important amendment which illustrates something of some importance.  This Bill has been around this House for two years and its intent is to tackle a number of problems relating to children and their welfare.  It is designed to provide for a form of care for children by way of statutory mechanisms other than residential care, and to get away from the old terminology of the Children's Act, 1908.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the last ten years we have sought to encourage people to become foster parents of children whose parents were unable to care for them, either in the context of long-term or short-term foster care.  Throughout the course of this <Col N="1746" /> debate &mdash; I have been involved in debates at various stages of the Bill &mdash; there has been a remarkable reluctance on the part of the Department, and the Minister for Health, to recognise that people called foster-parents exist, and to set out in clear legal terms the position of foster-parents. I welcomed the Minister's opening remarks.  A number of us on this side of the House raised the problems that could arise if health boards were given an arbitrary power to remove foster-children from the care of foster-parents.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has started to address this; whether it would be more appropriately addressed in substantive statutory measures and regulations we will deal with at a later stage.</P>
    <P>There is something extremely odd about a Bill designed to set up a new legal structure for foster care which does not at any stage appear to recognise the existence of people called foster-parents who are caring for children out of concern for their welfare.  This amendment highlights one of the many defects in the Bill.  The definition of a foster-parent, as tabled by my colleague, Deputy Yates, is relatively simple and straightforward and could interlink with some of his later amendments. It is extraordinary that nowhere in the Bill is the Minister prepared to acknowledge the fact that, in that terminology, foster-parents exist.  In fairness to the Minister, the Bill is seeking to make new provisions with regard to the care of children outside of residential institutions.  That is a mutual objective on all sides of the House.  We have had the Bill for two years.  The association of foster-parents are doing a super job and they have made an input into the amendments required to ensure that the Bill is workable.  People are encouraged to become foster-parents.  It would seem to be a natural corollary that this Bill would define who is a foster-parent and what is meant by that term.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will correct me if I am wrong but there are regulations in being which refer to the &ldquo;boarding out&rdquo; of children.  For example, under the Health Act, 1953, there are boarding out regulations.  This Bill is designed for the year 2000, not just 1990.  It is reasonable to expect that the rights of foster-parents, <Col N="1747" /> the role they play in caring for the children and who we mean by the term &ldquo;foster-parent&rdquo;, should be clearly defined and set out in this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 4 stands on a firm foundation in its own right.  I want to reinforce what has been said.  As a result of the kind of language referred to by Deputy Shatter, boarding out of children etc., there has been a negative image of foster-parents and fostering. This has led to a reluctance on the part of couples who dearly want to raise children in their own homes to take on that kind of responsibility.  They feel fostering is not legally recognised or acknowledged.  They are fearful that by acting as foster-parents they will not have the same rights or be given the same recognition or support for their parenting as is given to natural parents.  They feel they could lose out and that the children could be removed from them.</P>
      <P>A positive affirmative attitude towards fostering must be encouraged.  Foster-parents give love, care and personal attention to the children they foster.  The protection and support of the child is paramount and, as a result, we must define the term &ldquo;foster-parent&rdquo; in this Bill.  I was amazed to hear the Minister say in reply to Deputy Yates that the legislation does not include foster-parents at all.  When we are talking about parenting and the care of children they must be one of the first groups to be recognised and defined in the Bill.  I hope the Minister recognises that and responds positively and urgently to it.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment and wonder why should there be any debate on the question.  Section 2 of the Bill defines &ldquo;child&rdquo; and also &ldquo;health board&rdquo;.  It is imperative that the Minister define the term &ldquo;foster-parent&rdquo;.  That is all he is being asked to do.  People might have recourse to law and it is imperative that the term be defined.</P>

      <P>The reason Deputy Yates wants to have the definition of foster-parents included in the Bill is that he is anxious to have children who are in foster <Col N="1748" /> care covered by the Bill.  The Minister did not take this into account.  The only children dealt with in the Bill are those of natural parents who are taken into care by the health board.  If they are later placed in foster care the Minister has no interest in them.</P>
      <P>The Minister has tabled an amendment to section 34 suggesting that the health board may in accordance with regulations made by the Minister remove a child in its care from the custody of any person with whom he has been placed by the board under section 30.  That refers to a child going into foster care.  If that is so, we must address the question of the rights of foster-parents.  Is it possible for children to be suddenly taken from foster-parents for whatever reason?  In such a case foster-parents should be able to make a case for themselves because there is maternal love between the mother and the foster-child.  I have had many foster-parents contact me when health boards want to take the children back.  Sometimes it is for a good reason, for example, the natural parents are in position to take care of the children.  However, we should not disregard the excellent service given by foster-parents or their feelings for the children.  In the interests of the child we must have regard to all those who look after him.  The Minister should reconsider the matter.</P>

      <P>Foster-parent means a person other than the child's natural parents who undertakes the care and maintenance of the child.  In my non-legal opinion, if I were a brother or sister and looked after a child I would not be a foster-parent.  I do not want the Opposition to hijack the trust and admiration I have for a foster-parent.  It is one of the most difficult jobs anyone could undertake because it is uncertain and requires a lot of commitment, not only from the mother and father but from other siblings. Foster-parents have often been neglected in that they have not been commended for the great work they have done for our young people and the health boards.  They have been an excellent follow-through for any kind of problem in <Col N="1749" /> relation to child care.  I am fully committed to promoting fostering and foster-parents and helping them in the best way possible.</P>
      <P>In defining foster-children, I do not know if Deputy Yates's amendment is as concise as it should be because other people &mdash; who would not be deemed foster-parents &mdash; undertake the care and maintenance of children.  I refer to grandparents. I do not disagree with the view that we should recognise foster-parents in the Bill because they do not get due recognition, but I do not know if the amendment would solve the problem.</P>

      <P>Fostering is one of the oldest and most natural ways of dealing with children who are at risk or disadvantaged in any country.  In Irish life when there was a problem with too many children in a family or if a mother was too ill to care for them, someone in the community would take a child and, very often, fostered it for life.  I see the extended family in the context of foster-parents and have had inquiries from constituents related to children in extreme difficulties.  I am thinking of one in particular, an aunt who fostered a child but who had no rights to maintenance or any of the benefits which would have been given to her if she had not been a family member.</P>
      <P>We need to redefine the whole notion of fostering in terms of care for children at risk, disadvantaged or in trouble.  The way ahead is not to put them into institutions, however wonderful, attractive and modern they are.  As someone who was reared in a family and who in turn, reared a family, it is clear that we should be thinking of a family structure in fostering and every possible support and help should be given to develop this type of care.  Is it the Minister's intention to bring in a definition &mdash; and regulations &mdash; in relation to fostering in some other Bill?  Is this one of the follow-on provisions for which we can hope or is he saying that if the definition is not accepted in this Bill, it is the end of the debate as far as foster-parents are concerned?  The Bill is silent in this regard and I am sure it is not something about which the Minister wants to boast.</P>

      <P>We seem to have reverted to discussing amendment No. 4 even though I had proposed we would group them.  However, to avoid confusion, we will stick rigidly to this amendment. I do not have any difficulty in regard to the definition of &ldquo;foster-parent&rdquo;. The Bill does not define &ldquo;foster-parents&rdquo; but, as far as I am concerned, &ldquo;foster-parent&rdquo; means a person with whom a child has been placed in foster care by a health board under section 30 (1) (a).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 4, tabled by Deputy Yates, seeks to insert a definition of &ldquo;foster-parent&rdquo;. My point is that the expression &ldquo;foster-parent&rdquo; does not appear anywhere in the Bill and, therefore, there is no need to define it.  The expression &ldquo;foster-parent&rdquo; appears in amendments Nos. 146 and 147 tabled by Deputy Yates but, unless we assume that these will be accepted, there is no need to accept the definition.  As I explained, <Col N="1751" /> amendment No. 143 in my name renders Deputy Yates' amendments unnecessary.</P>
    <P>His amendment No. 3 is defective because he says that &ldquo;foster-parent&rdquo; means a person other than the child's natural parents who undertakes the care and maintenance of the child.  It does not refer to a health board or to the fact that a health board would place that child with those people.  It also does not take into account that brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts or direct blood relations? may care for children.  Is a child to be removed from the care of such relations? The amendment is vague and indefinite and does not cover the health board placing of children.  I suggest that Deputy Yates' amendment is ineffective and that he withdraw it.</P>

Perhaps we should stick to correct procedure if the Minister does not intend to be helpful.</P>
      <P>I thank the Opposition Members for their support.  As I was saying before the Minister intervened, for the Minister to imply that foster-parents are not required in legal terms and are, therefore, not referred to, clearly means that he has not read the particular page of his brief or the Bill because Part VI of the Bill goes into some detail about foster care.  Section 30 states that the most preferable form of care in which children should be placed is that most akin to the family type setting, which is by placing him or her in foster care.</P>

      <P>Section 32 (1) says that the Minister shall make regulations in relation to the placing of children in foster care by health boards.  Without reference to this House, we will have a whole series of regulations but they cannot mention <Col N="1752" />&ldquo;foster-parent&rdquo; because there is no such being in our legal language.  Surely it is of the utmost assistance to the Minister and foster-parents &mdash; and the notion of promoting fosterage and foster care &mdash; that we should have a definition of &ldquo;foster-parent&rdquo; in our legal code?  It is quite baffling that the Minister should seek to deliberately exclude any reference to foster-parent. The Minister has not put forward his own alternative but has sought to dodge the issue.  We cannot have regulations without having a definition of foster-parent.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Minister and Deputy Coughlan's point as to this definition being incorrect, I got legal advice on it. It is true to say that from judicial pronouncements, the health board is a legal person when it comes to the care and maintenance of children.  How can we differentiate between the health board being a person, and a foster-parent, because they are separate entities?  We have entered as usual into a potential legal minefield in which the High Court and the Supreme Court will be appealed to by foster-parents opposing regulations introduced by the Minister.  We will have a legal abyss in trying to deal with this because the Minister has not confronted the issue.  I regret this and I intend to press the issue.  Time will show that the Minister should accept this definition or should have brought forward his own definition.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 16, after &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;be under a statutory duty to&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having put down two of the three amendments which have been shot down, I <Col N="1754" /> share the sentiments of the last two speakers.</P>
    <P>This amendment deals with section 3 (2), which relates to the core of the health boards' duty.  This issue was dealt with before and the Minister was not sympathetic. However, it is important to place a statutory obligation on the health board to carry out the functions set out in this Bill.  Under the Health Act, 1970, a health board shall do lots of things such as provide a dental service, an optical service, hospital services, primary care services and general medical services.  As we know, in a lot of respects they are not providing those services because of financial constraints.  The financial picture for 1991 clearly indicates that finance is not being made available to implement the provisions of this Bill.  The Minister has not referred to that at all this morning. The Minister has not even sought to deny that there will not be enough money in 1991 or in future years.  Perhaps the Minister will say how much he intends to allocate in the future to fulfil these provisions.</P>
    <P>This is a core issue.  We are seeking to place upon health boards a statutory duty to provide child care facilities and care services.  A chief executive officer at the annual estimates meeting should not have to say that under the Health Act, 1970, he is obliged to observe a financial stringency so as not to go into deficit or that he will be obliged to take certain action. We all know that in the late eighties chief executive officers were forced to take certain action.  If we leave it as weak as &ldquo;shall&rdquo; or in some instances &ldquo;may&rdquo; provide functions, in effect the juggernaut of the Department of Finance will bulldoze through the good intentions of this Bill and will ensure that it is neutered to the extent that the extra services envisaged will not be provided.  I would ask the House to agree with me that this is of much importance to children but that it may not be of such importance to health boards who have to provide a wide range of services under financial pressure. Those health boards have been a depository for every extra health facility introduced, without any reform, in 20 years.  We know that our present structures are overburdened in terms of how <Col N="1755" /> much health boards can discuss at a monthly meeting.  I do not want child care to come under &ldquo;any other business&rdquo; on the agenda.  We mean to put it at the top of the agenda.  Therefore, section 3 should place health boards under statutory obligations rather than whimsical notions that may be rejected by chief executive officers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy not agree that the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is quite adequate?  Legal opinion stated that the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; did impose a statutory obligation. I cannot understand how Deputy Yates' concerns would be met by the inclusion of this formula of words.  I understand from the legal people that the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; would stand up in court and it would be proved that there was a clear unambiguous statutory obligation imposed.  I accept that the Deputy has concerns but not that the inclusion of the formula of words he is proposing would do away with those concerns.</P>
      <P>If the Department of Finance want to wave their big wand to prevent the implementation of certain sections of the Bill they will do so anyway.  If that attitude was adopted the inclusion of five or six words would not make any difference. If we accept that the Bill is a meaningful Bill imposing statutory duties on the health boards we should go ahead with it.  How did Deputy Yates come to the conclusion that this formula of words would improve the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the argument made by Deputy Fitzgerald in that we normally assume that where a legislative provision says &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, it is binding. Those of us who have been charged with monitoring the implementation of health legislation in recent times can be forgiven for having our confidence eroded somewhat, when we have regard to the Health Act, 1970, and the impositions laid down by that Act of the Oireachtas on health boards to provide a range of services which clearly they do not provide. Deputy Yates can hardly be faulted for trying to underscore the importance of this section by putting in a different form <Col N="1756" /> of words from those which have clearly been ignored by health boards up to now.</P>
      <P>I share Deputy Fitzgerald's concern that the extra few words do not amount to much but they amount to this much: they are a signalling by this House and the Oireachtas that we are serious.  Whatever about the provision of dental services, which the Oireachtas was serious about in 1970 and seems to be less serious about enforcing now, when it comes to this Bill we are serious and we want to signal clearly to health boards that this duty is to be taken seriously, acted upon seriously and as a matter of urgency. For those reasons, there is some merit in taking a line which many would argue as being superfluous but it is a clear underscoring of the importance of this section by the Oireachtas, and for that reason I support it.</P>

      <P>For the reasons as stated, I, too, support the amendment.  It is inevitable that it should be included.</P>
      <P>In section 3 (3) reference is made to section 57 of this Bill.  Section 57 (1) states:</P>
      <P>The Minister may give general directions to a health board in relation to the performance of the functions assigned to it by or under this Act and the health board shall comply with any such direction.</P>
      <P>Section 57 on its own is very vague and gives the Minister power to direct the board.  The section we are referring to sets out the duties of the health board. All we are seeking is that it be made a statutory duty.  I support the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand why the Deputy is trying to underscore and if possible reinforce the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  I take the point made by Deputy Liam Fitzgerald that it carries the same legal interpretation. However, it is a matter of concern to all of us, as we go through this Bill, that it is not in word only but that we must have the back-up to ensure the strength of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, which, in legal terms, is presumably the same as a <Col N="1757" /> statutory duty, and that the health boards are equipped to carry out such a statutory duty whether it be described as &ldquo;shall&rdquo; or &ldquo;be under statutory duty to&rdquo;.  On this side of the House we share a common concern that &ldquo;shall&rdquo; may not be supported by the resources that are needed to make it a reality and to allow the health boards and other agencies to carry out such statutory &ldquo;duties&rdquo; as are implied in that word.  I am particularly concerned about subsection (3) which states:</P>
      <P>A health board shall, in addition to any other function assigned to it under this Act or any other enactment, provide child care and family support services, and may provide and maintain premises and make such other provision as it considers necessary or desirable for such purposes,...</P>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that we have no infrastructure of child care and family support services throughout the country under the health boards at present.  We have a skeleton service for children most at risk but not any national concerted, cohesive structure to the extent that in a recent published report on child care in the European Community Ireland came last.  We as legislators must ensure, as we go through the final stages of this Bill, that the resources to make these a reality must be involved as well.  The child care and family support services, as cited in the Bill, are totally and completely missing. We do not have child care and family support services.  In order that the full legal statutory duty of the health boards be implemented, what will the Minister, the Department of Health and this year's budget do regarding subsection (3)?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 8 from Deputy Yates is unnecessary.  Section 3 (2) provides that the board shall do certain things.  The word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; when used in the Bill means that something must be done.  In this case the health board must take the steps and comply with the conditions set out in subsection (2).  The board does not have any discretion in the matter.  The insertion of the phrase &ldquo;be under a statutory duty to&rdquo; does not alter this in any way.  A board <Col N="1758" /> is under a legal obligation to act in accordance with this subsection regardless of whether this phrase is contained in the Bill.  I clearly recall the debate on this issue on Committee Stage and I was pleased that Deputy Howlin concured with me on that occasion.  If we were to insert these words in this section it could cast doubts on other sections where the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is used without the addition of the same words again.  Deputy Barnes referred to a European Commission report.  I suggest she is referring to a report relating to the day care provision for the children of working parents.  That is the only report I know of that was published recently.</P>

As far as Deputy Yates and the House are concerned, we debated this matter on Committee Stage.  This is the exact same debate again and the situation has not changed.  Adding these words would not make one iota of difference to the Bill or improve it in any way.  If I were to accept the amendment we would have to put in several other amendments which would have no effect on the legal status of the Bill or on the implementation of the Bill by the health boards.  Therefore, I appeal to Deputy Yates to withdraw this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's reasons for not adding the additional obligatory sentence required. In the normal course of events all of us who are involved in legislation, in either of the two Houses, have always been happy with the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  Arising from our experience of the 1970 Act and all the obligations thereby placed on health boards, I have found that by resolution at health board meetings they plead inability to provide a service which the 1970 Act said they &ldquo;shall provide&rdquo;. They pleaded inability to do so because <Col N="1759" /> of a lack of finance and because of cutbacks. I read the Health Estimate which was published the other day.  No commitment is given by the Government to provide adequate funding to ensure that health boards can and shall by law, legislation, statute or regulation carry out their functions.  Will there be a specific budgetary allocation for the health boards so that they will have to put the provisions in this Bill into operation and be kept with no discretion in the matter, they will be required by this House to carry out their functions in the Bill?  I do not want health boards to plead inability to carry out their functions afterwards if a budgetary allocation in the Estimates would enable them to do so.  The Estimate takes into account inflation and special increases for staff but there is no provision for improved services through the health agencies.  This is the only point which concerns me.  Normally I would accept that the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; would make it obligatory for them to carry out certain functions but in the past they have pleaded inability to carry out their obligations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If the inclusion of these words in other sections will improve the Bill and the health boards and the Government know we are serious about this issue then so be it&mdash; both the legislation and the position of children at risk will be improved.</P>

      <P>I welcome these provocations. When I referred to different sections in the 1970 Health Act, some chief executive officers said to me &mdash; this answers Deputy Fitzgerald's point&mdash;that the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; does not equal the word &ldquo;will&rdquo; and that to put someone under a statutory duty would extend this provision. In the interests of time, I will allow the question to be put on this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 18, after &ldquo;protection&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and co-ordinate information from all relevant sources relating to children in its area&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 9 relates to section 3, which sets out the functions of health boards.  My amendment provides that not alone shall a health board take such steps as it considers requisite to identify children who are not receiving adequate care and attention but that they should also co-ordinate the information which is available.  One of the problems in this area is the lack of co-ordination between school attendance officers, juvenile liaison officers and voluntary organisations such as the ISPCC who run the Childline service.  A wide range of people &mdash; interested neighbours, parents and relatives &mdash; have a fund of information about children who are at risk and who need to be identified.  I believe it is important that we insert in the Bill the additional clause proposed in my amendment so that not alone would there be an obligation on the health board to take such steps as they consider necessary once they have identified the children but, in order to identify such children, they would be in a position to co-ordinate the information from all the sources to which I have referred.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this point.  It is not a major issue but a provision in regard to the co-ordination of information needs to be included in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3 (2) (a) clearly refers to children who are not receiving adequate care and protection and my amendment refers only to such children. My amendment proposes the inclusion of the words &ldquo;and co-ordinate information from all relevant sources relating to children in its area&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;protection&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>When I worked as a <Col N="1762" /> social worker it was standard practice in case work that one should do that oneself.  It is puzzling that this amendment should be included in the Bill because the normal practice in case work is that the social worker who would normally make a case for a child would get in touch with a juvenile liaison officer and if someone is in trouble with the Garda or a child is missing from school the social worker would get in touch with either the school principal or the school attendance officer.  I do not see the relevance of including this provision which is normal practice for social workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very strong views on this amendment because I recently discovered from discussions with officers of a health board that in one day three social workers called to the same family. There is need for an amendment to co-ordinate the information available in this area.  For example, a social worker from the health board could visit a family early in the day, a psychiatric social worker could visit them later and if there were a housing problem a social worker from the county council could also visit them. That has happened.  I saw straight away the merit in this amendment, which merely seeks to co-ordinate the information available.  The inclusion of this amendment in the Bill would be very worthwhile and I support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support this amendment because there is a deep concern among the child care workers to whom I have spoken that there is either a total famine in care and monitoring of children at risk or there is a feast where several agencies are monitoring the one family, particularly if they receive any kind of publicity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this context I should like to remind the Minister that the Law Reform Commission report on child sexual abuse and their consultation paper dealt with the need for the director of community care or the medical health officer to be under a general legal duty to hold a case conference in cases of suspected child sexual abuse which would not have been rejected as unfounded.  When I asked a social worker about this he said it is a <Col N="1763" /> problem and that there is a reluctance by the director of community care or the officer in charge to hold a case conference.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of this amendment in the Bill would be one way of ensuring that all those involved in a particular case are brought in to share their experiences or information so that they can make a decision on the treatment or resolution of the problem.  I believe that recommendation is made on page 87 of the Law Reform Commission report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely social workers looking after children in need or in danger would be negligent if they did not co-ordinate information from all relevant sources relating to children in their area. I would have thought that that need not be stated.  However, if Deputy Yates means to advertise &mdash; I use the word advisedly &mdash; and educate the public on the services available, we could take that on board but I would have thought that social workers &mdash; I have no doubt that they do &mdash; would do this automatically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>We would all like to think, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said, that this is being done but, first, I should say in relation to the need for co-ordination and case conferences to which Deputy Coughlan referred and about which Deputy Sherlock gave details from his own experience, we may end up with duplication with the people involved wasting their time and effort.  With that in mind, it is both wise and sensible to have co-ordination.  Judicial and public inquiries on children at risk were set up in Britain &mdash; I instance the child sexual abuse cases in Cleveland.  One of the greatest failings of those inquiries, and it was a human failing, was that they could not attribute blame to anyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing with people who are under pressure and who may not be able to avail of a communications system which would make it easy for them to co-ordinate their efforts.  The greatest lesson learned from those public inquiries was that there was a lack of co-ordination when it came to the sharing of information between the people concerned <Col N="1764" />&mdash; the police in some cases and school attendance officers in others.  The most remarkable feature of those inquiries, and perhaps the most upsetting, was that there was a lack of co-ordination when it came to the sharing of information and the case conferences.  This led ultimately not just to child abuse but to tremendous trauma being experienced by parents and social workers.</P>
    <P>It is unfair where discretion and sensitivity is called for on the part of certain workers not to share the responsibility. It is also unfair to ask only some workers, without making some attempt at co-ordination, to make very grave decisions which could rebound on them not only in terms of their careers but also in human terms.  To be fair to the children, parents and workers involved, responsibility should be shared as this could prevent mistakes being made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The best argument in favour of the amendment has been made by speakers on the other side of the House.  I respect the view expressed by Deputy Coughlan, who said that this happens. Indeed many of us believe that it happens automatically and this should convince the Minister that there should be no problem about inserting this amendment, which seeks to ensure that it happens.  It is our experience that even though information is sought and received by different agencies and people the lack of co-ordination has led to problems. In an effort to be helpful we could send so many people to investigate that people will be turned off giving the required information.  If the information received from all sources could be co-ordinated this would be to the betterment of all.</P>
      <P>Deputies on the Government side have convinced us that this does happen and, if this is so, why not ensure that it does happen by including this provision in the Bill?  If information is to have any value it must be co-ordinated and used for the betterment of all children at risk.</P>

      <P>I have listened with great interest to the contributions which have been made on this amendment and I am convinced from what he has said <Col N="1765" /> that Deputy Yates has tightened up the amendment somewhat.  We debated a similar amendment on Committee Stage and it a seemed to refer to all children.  It is my interpretation that the amendment now refers only to children who are not receiving adequate care and protection. Deputy Coughlan spoke about professional ethics in the performance of duties by social workers and others.  She said that they do co-ordinate information in their case work.  Having listened to the very detailed contributions made, and in view of the clear commitment by Deputy Yates, I will accept the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) inform children of their right to be consulted prior to any action or change in their circumstances and allow for a child to initiate a review of their circumstances.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to point out that despite all the rhetoric and verbiage we all say that the rights of children should come first.  On this amendment we are dealing with the criteria within which health boards operate. Amendments Nos. 10 and 11 give practical effect to all our good intentions in relation to children.  They propose that any child in care should be informed of what decision has been taken about the type of care, that there should be prior consultation and, most important &mdash; I will certainly be pressing amendment No. 11 but I am open to negotiation on amendment No. 10 &mdash; if a child, and we <Col N="1766" /> are dealing with children up to the age of 18, makes a request not to be sent to a particular home, wishes to leave a particular foster parent or wishes to be left with a grandmother, this request should be documented.  In years to come they should be able to look back and see that they did state they were very unhappy at that time.  It is very important that they be given this opportunity.</P>
    <P>What I am looking for is a procedural matter.  I realise this may not be possible and on Committee Stage it was stated that we could have children of four or five years of age who are a bit daft or whose imaginations could run wild and might not know what is good for them. We can rest assured that, even if it is harmless, a request should be documented.</P>
    <P>I am not saying they should be given a veto.  We have received submissions from the Child Care Coalition in relation to the statutory review procedure.  It is very important that requests from children should be documented and put on the record.  I ask the Minister to get this matter right.  It may be dealt with by way of regulation but it is absolutely vital that this is stitched into the Bill and is not left to the chief executive officer, or any other person, to act in a single-minded fashion. Often social workers feel that they have a monopoly of wisdom in relation to what is in the best interests of the child but they just might be wrong.  It is because of that that it is important when a child makes a request for a change of circumstances or change in care that it is documented so that, in a year or two's time, when it comes up for review under the review procedure, that will be clearly imprinted in such a way that there would be consistency and the best interests of the child served.</P>
    <P>I would ask the House to accept these amendments, particularly No. 11.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated in the past that I support the initiatives being taken by the Director of the National Museum in conjunction with county or regional interests to facilitate the development of local museums.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The director is liaising in that regard with local authority officials and other representative groups in a number of <Col N="1768" /> counties including Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Tipperary, Wexford, Louth, Mayo, Sligo, Roscommon, Monaghan and Donegal.  Some of these centres already have viable local museums.  In such cases, the National Museum is assisting them by way of advice and the loan of some of its artefacts on a temporary or permanent basis.  In all instances, the extent to which it will be possible to loan National Museum material is contingent on the National Museum securing adequate assurances from the promoters of local museums as to such matters as security, temperature and humidity controls at local museum venues.  These operational questions are essentially matters for the professional judgment of the director and his staff.</P>
    <P>The National Heritage Council is at present finalising recommendations on the development of regional museums which would have a close working relationship with the National Museum.</P>
    <P>I will ensure that any worthwhile proposals brought to my attention in this context will be examined in a positive and constructive manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that finance will be the ultimate determinant in relation to whether those local initiatives go ahead; in view of the fact that there are many fine artefacts and items of historical significance &mdash; such as axeheads, spearheads, arrowheads, and so on &mdash; literally locked away in basements and other hidden accommodation of the National Museum, which will never see the light of day; also in view of the fact that there is an operational programme for tourism in existence, would the Taoiseach agree that local authorities should be encouraged to engage in such joint ventures?  For example, in the town with which the Taoiseach is very familiar, Castlebar, there is the old Church of Ireland building which Mayo County Council have recommended and there is a local small museum in Knock, would the Taoiseach agree that these should be given the necessary priming finance to enable them rehabilitate to their local environment those objects and artefacts <Col N="1769" /> at present locked away in the National Museum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of finances of local authorities is a matter primarily for the local authorities themselves and the Minister for the Environment; that is not strictly my responsibility.  But, as far as I and the National Museum are concerned, we are very anxious to encourage local authorities to proceed as comprehensively as possible with the sort of concept the Deputy has outlined.  I understand that Mayo County Council have passed a resolution calling for the establishment of a local museum.  That would certainly find favour with the National Museum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the question of regional museums, would the Taoiseach agree that it would be preferable that we should widen the pool from which material could be drawn for these museums, from simply the National Museum, to include all the national collections, for example, material from the National Library and the National Gallery with a view to having exhibitions around particular themes rather than simply exhibitions confined to what may happen to be in one institution, namely, the National Museum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a different point.  The question of local or regional museums is one which is related strictly to museum-type artefacts; the relationship there should quite clearly be with the National Museum.  In so far as any other institution in concerned &mdash; for instance, the National Gallery &mdash; a completely different set of circumstances and considerations would apply.  As the Deputy knows, the Arts Council do encourage the exhibition of some of their collection in different parts of the country and in different buildings.  The question of exhibitions of that kind, by either the National Gallery or the National Library would be a different matter altogether, something which can be looked at in a different context.  At present the concentration in this question, as far as I am concerned, is on trying to have a network of local and regional museums around the country in which a great deal of material can be exhibited, either on temporary or permanent loan, which is particularly appropriate to the region or county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that, for example, in the case of an exhibition of objects from the National Museum, let us say about 1798, it might also be relevant, in addition to <Col N="1771" /> displaying the objects, to display papers from the National Library or paintings from the National Gallery which relate to the same period?  Would the Taoiseach not agree that we should draw on all the national collections, not just that of the National Museum, with a view to developing a coherent understanding of our past through a regional network of museums?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be appropriate in the case of exhibitions from time to time for particular purposes or on particular themes.  But what Deputy J. Higgins and myself are dealing with in this question is the establishment of permanent museums <i>in situ</i> either in a county or region in which there would be permanent exhibition of artefacts, even folk artefacts.  But the type of exhibition Deputy John Bruton has in mind is something that is arranged from time to time in particular venues in relation to particular themes or subject matters.

      <P>I do not want to go into that matter at this time.  As the Deputy knows, the Brooke initiative is still under way.  It is hoped that, arising out of that initiative, there will be a series of talks between the parties in Northern Ireland, between the parties in the North and the Government here and between the two Governments.  The purpose of all these discussions will be to bring forward some new type of arrangement which will be satisfactory all round for Northern Ireland.  The question of devolution of powers will certainly, I am sure, be part of those talks, so I do not particularly want to be drawn into giving a view of one kind or another at this stage when such a view might be in conflict with what one or other of the parties will be putting forward in the talks.  I would prefer that all these matters be put on the table during the course of these talks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>At the meetings I and relevant Ministers held with the trade union, employer and farm organisations on 8 and 10 October 1990, it was agreed that detailed negotiations should be undertaken on the scope and content of a possible new programme for economic and social progress.  It was also agreed that these negotiations would be conducted between representatives of the organisations concerned and senior Government officials with a view to the preparation of a series of detailed proposals for decision, in due course, by the Government and the organisations concerned.  This was the procedure successfully followed in the preparation of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
      <P>To date, 33 such negotiating meetings have been held and the discussions at these meetings have been proceeding in a constructive and satisfactory manner. When the work of these meetings has reached a more advanced stage there will be further meetings between myself and the relevant Ministers and the social partners with the purpose, if possible, of concluding agreement on a new programme for economic and social progress for the decade.</P>
      <P>I am sure that all Deputies will welcome a satisfactory outcome to these negotiations as a consensus approach to economic and social progress, as the success of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> proved, is undoubtedly the best approach in a small open economy such as ours.</P>

      <P>Can the Taoiseach indicate within what time frame he expects the negotiations to include or at what point does he feel a position will be reached where the various social partners will have recommendations to make to their respective organisations?  I am sure he will be aware that the current agreement expires shortly and that certainly the trade union movement are in the process now of preparing claims for the coming year.  When does he think this agreement might be concluded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Progress is good and <Col N="1776" /> I think we are getting near to a fairly conclusive stage but, as the Deputy knows, this sort of negotiation, particularly when it is quadripartite, can yield unexpected difficulties from time to time.</P>
      <P>I have no particular reason to expect at this stage that we will not be able to move fairly soon now to a conclusion. It would be desirable, of course, if the negotiations could be successfully concluded before the end of the year and that is very much in everybody's mind, but I would not like to be pinned down too much on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it then that the expectation is that the proposals in relation to the agreement will be concluded by the time the budget comes around close to the end of January.  Has the Taoiseach taken account of the statement by the General Secretary of the ICTU on the question of tax reform and his statement in October and that he did not see how the Congress could recommend any agreement if substantial progress was not made in the 1991 budget on reducing the burden on the majority of PAYE taxpayers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two questions. First, what is the proposed term of the new agreement?  Is it a two year time frame or a three year time frame?  Is there a proposal for a ten year time frame in respect of certain matters?  Further, have any of the partners indicated in any way that their agreement to the programme is contingent on certain decisions being taken in the budget?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>First, the Congress put forward the idea of a ten year strategy, but that is not a ten year programme. That is a proposal to which we responded very positively and which I think is an excellent one.  I would visualise things <Col N="1777" /> proceeding in this way, that we would have a ten year strategy right across the board for economic, social and all other objectives.  Into that ten year strategy a number of successive programmes would fit with the objective of achieving the overall strategic aims within the ten year framework.  At the moment the question of the length of time of this programme has not been settled.  The Government would naturally favour a three year programme, if possible the same as the first one, but that is still up for discussion. There are no specific proposals from any side on the table at this stage of the discussions in connection with the forthcoming budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a final point in relation to No. 3.  The reason for my other question about tax reform was that in responding to my earlier question the Taoiseach indicated that it would be concluded, hopefully, by the budget. If it is to include tax reform then clearly we will not know what is involved until the budget is published.  How, therefore, can we expect that agreement can be reached in advance of the budget?</P>

      <P>For instance, in the case of Economic and Monetary Union what happens in the ECOFIN Council at which my colleague, the Minister for Finance, is our representative, has been processing the work of preparation for the IGC on Economic and Monetary Union over the last year and before that, and that is an ongoing process in that council.  The same is the case with regard to political union, which is primarily the responsibility of the General Affairs Council.  They have been working and meeting preparing for the IGC on Political Union.  There is no question of individual member states coming along to the Summit in Rome and planking down some sort of document or submission. That is not relevant; that is not the way it works.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that he is displaying a lamentable lack of information about the facts in the replies he has given?  Could I draw to his attention the fact the President Mitterand and Chancellor Kohl have published a joint declaration on the inter-governmental conference in which they go into considerable detail on behalf of their national governments about matters such as the extension of the competences of the Community, the withdrawal of the veto of individual countries and many <Col N="1781" /> other matters in regard to economic, political and monetary union?  Would the Taoiseach agree that his statement that national governments have not been making submissions is quite simply untrue and, in his case, culpably ill-informed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am a little bit better informed about the procedures of the European Council than the Deputy. I have personally presided over two European Councils during the Irish Presidency, and I have been at a very considerable number of European Councils over the years.  I am fully aware of how these Councils do their business and how they proceed; and I want to tell the Deputy that what I am saying to the House is the correct procedure.</P>

      <P>You are just wrong. Would the Taoiseach like me to furnish him with a copy, which I have in my possession, of the joint declaration of President Mitterand and Chancellor Kohl?  The fact is that the national governments of Britain and Germany have tabled their own policies for large countries and our Government have failed to table any policy.  In other words, we have a Government that are not putting forward any positive proposals on this matter to represent the interests of a small peripheral nation which has specific interests.  I repeat that in this matter the Taoiseach is both culpably ill-informed and culpably negligent in the performance of his duties.</P>

Would the Taoiseach not agree that the European Parliament and a special conference of the national parliaments of the member states have made recommendations?

An aontóidh an tAire Stáit gur beag dul chun cinn atá déanta le dhá bhliain anuas ar aon cheann acu seo; nach bhfuil aon dul chun cinn le feiceáil?

      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos, ní féidir liom glacadh leis nach bhfuil rud ar bith ag tarlú ar Oileán Thoraigh. B'fhéidir go bhfuil an ceart ag an Teachta nár tharla rud ar bith idir 1982 agus 1987, ach tar éis 1987 chuir an Rialtas beagnach £4 mhilliún ar fáil chun dul i mbun scéim thithíochta ar an oileán.  Ina dhiaidh sin, fuair mise cead ó Aire na Gaeltachta, ón Taoiseach, £66,000 a chur ar fáil maidir leis an suirbhé sin.  Tá a fhios ag an Teachta, agus ag an Teachta Dukes chomh maith, gur iomaí uair a chuaigh Aire na Gaeltachta ag an am sin chun na <Col N="1788" /> Roinne Airgeadais chun airgead a fháil le suirbhé a dhéanamh agus ní raibh siad ábalta cead ar bith a fháil ag an am sin.

    <P>In addition to the 745 general service recruits a total of 104 apprentices joined the Defence Forces since 1 January 1990. Forty-eight were assigned to the Air Corps and 56 to the Army Apprentice School.  The total number of non-commissioned officers and men who left the service during the period 1 January 1990 to 31 October 1990 was 430.  The average age of non-commissioned officers and privates in the Permanent Defence Force is 34 years.</P>

    <P>All of the foregoing claims fall to be implemented under the terms of clause 3.4 of the elaboration of clause 3 of the 1987 Public Service Pay Agreement, which was agreed with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  This provides for payment on the following basis:&mdash; 40 per cent with effect from 1 May 1991, 30 per cent with effect from 1 March 1992, and 30 per cent with effect from 1 September 1992.</P>
    <P>Provision has been included in the 1991 Estimates for the Public Services for the aforementioned awards and it is my intention that the appropriate phased amount will be paid in 1991.</P>
    <P>In addition to the foregoing, there is a number of claims on hands which have <Col N="1799" /> not yet been processed to finality under the appropriate clauses of the pay agreement. Deputies will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to speculate on the likely outcome of such cases. However, should the question of payments in respect of such cases arise in 1991, it would be my intention to make any necessary financial provision in the budget as is customary.</P>

      <Quest>the discussions, if any, he or his Department have had recently with the officers of the Central Bank on exchange rate policy; if he will outline the Government exchange rate policy; the reason after closely tracking the Deutschemark for over six months the Central Bank have now departed from this policy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Exchange rate policy <Col N="1800" /> is a matter for determination by Government and there is ongoing contact with the Central Bank on the implementation of this policy.  The consistent approach for the past few years has been to maintain a strong position within the exchange rate mechanism of the European monetary system and this has been very successful in terms of confidence in the currency.  There has been no change in this policy.  It is a matter for the Central Bank to operate exchange rate policy on a day to day basis by using the available instruments, namely exchange rate movements within the EMS band, changes in interest rates and interventions in the foreign exchange market.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Is the Minister aware that the Central Bank, having stayed within 1 per cent of the German Mark &mdash; and being, for most of a six month period, on a par with the German Mark &mdash; varied that policy about two weeks ago and are now allowing a wider degree of divergence?  Will he comment on this change in policy?  Was it authorised by the Government?  Does it indicate a softer exchange rate policy?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that it does not indicate a change of policy.  It was not organised by the Government and it is not the first time it has happened.  Some commentators are reading far too much into this.  There is no question of a change of policy and I want to emphasise that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The stated policy of the Government is to remain within the EMS band with a divergence of 2.25 per cent.  For the last six months or so the bank have operated a policy which kept the punt within 1 per cent of the mark.  That variation was changed about two weeks ago and I should like to know whether the change was after consultation with the Government. Does he consider this part of the day-to-day operation of the policy by the bank?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider it as part of <Col N="1801" /> the day-to-day operation of the Central Bank.  It is not a change of policy, it was not done at the instigation of the Government and it was not connected with any discussions between the Central Bank and the Government.  I would point out to the Deputy that what happened over a few months was that the convergence became a lot closer as a result of some weakness in the Deutschemark because of the uncertainties as to what the cost of reunification would be.  In recent times, with the increase in German interest rates, the marketplace was strengthened and consequently the variation moved somewhat.  Since 1987 the differential between Irish and German rates has been reduced from the then level of 9 per cent to what it was last Friday 11½ per cent.  That is a clear indication of where the Irish exchange rate policy is going.  We aim to continue that. That is what it is all about.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that Deputy Kemmy is referring to the White Paper &ldquo;Serving the Country Better&rdquo; which was published in September, 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This White Paper brought together various measures to be taken to improve efficiency and quality of service in the public service.  The process of improving organisation, systems and procedures is an ongoing one, and a substantial programme of developments is under way in relation to improved management and personnel systems, increased use of information technology, re-location of Government offices and reviews of <Col N="1802" /> efficiency in various departments. Among important current developments are the introduction of administrative budgets, which will give new freedoms to departmental managements and promote economy and efficiency.  This is a major initiative which will have a significant effect on the management of the Civil Service.  In addition there are the Efficiency Audit Group, who are conducting high-level reviews of a number of Departments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Would the Minister not agree that not a single initiative has been taken to reform the Civil Service in any way since the then Department of the Public Service was brought under the control of the Minister for Finance in 1987?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not accept that at all.  I have taken what I believe to be the very new initiative in relation to the administrative budgets, starting from 1991, 1992 and 1993 where Departments will have responsibility for the management of their own administrative parts of their Estimates on the basis of giving the Exchequer a 2 per cent reduction for each of the three years.  It gives them flexibility as to whether they want to save money on numbers, promotions or whatever.  It takes them away from the heavy hand of the Department of Finance and the Public Service.  It is a move in the right direction.  We have also taken to step to implement the policy on merit payments for assistnat secretaries. We hope that when that is in operation in that respect it will be subsequently devolved down the line.  Information technology is widespread throughout the service.  The Efficiency Audit Group look at every Department to see where efficiencies can be carried out and where savings can be made.  We are continuing the decentralisation programme, and a few additions to that programme have been announced.  Staff numbers were frozen from 1987 onwards but now that the numbers have settled down we are beginning to fill some of the spots that need filling though we are holding a tight <Col N="1803" /> rein on the numbers back to 1977 figures. Management and development training is going on at a very fast rate and performance relates to pay.  We have various other commissions who have reported on, for instance, how health funding should continue in the future.  There is an ongoing programme of new initiatives.  I am trying to let the people in the system manage and to lift the morale which has been fairly low for some time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>A series of important measures have been taken in the last few years which have now begun to result in an increased tax yield from the financial institutions.  This yield will continue to grow accordingly as these measures take full effect.  The measures are as follows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accelerated capital allowances are being <Col N="1805" /> progressively eliminated; from 100 per cent for capital investment made prior to April 1988, these allowances now stand at 50 per cent and will be terminated by April 1992.  This will reduce the tax loss arising from the use of such allowances by the financial institutions, both as regards their own investment and in their leasing activities.</P>
    <P>Restrictions have been placed on section 84 lending.  First, a levy on such lending was introduced in 1986.  Secondly, an overall volume restriction on domestic-sourced section 84 loans was imposed in 1989, with no new lenders permitted, and no new such loans were allowed for Shannon service companies from 12 April 1989.  In 1990 a further volume restriction was imposed, limiting each lender to 75 per cent of their loan volume as at 12 April 1989.  These measures have resulted in an increased tax yield from this area, which will rise over the next few years as compared to what otherwise would have been the case.</P>
    <P>The corporation tax rate of 35 per cent which applied to profits of mortgage business undertaken by the banks and building societies was raised in April 1989 to the standard rate.</P>
    <P>In 1986 an important restriction was imposed on the way in which life assurance companies could set off their expenses as between their different classes of business.  The levy on premiums for life assurance linked investments was increased from 1.7 per cent to 3 per cent in 1987.  The bank levy which was introduced in 1981 as a direct response to the low level of corporation tax paid by the banks was increased from a level of £25 million in 1988 to its current level of £36 million.</P>
    <P>The operation of all these measures is constantly being monitored and kept under review.  Any further measures in relation to changes in taxation of the financial institutions are a budgetary matter, on which I do not propose to comment at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister indicate how he defines growth in a <Col N="1806" /> return from the banks?  Is it a percentage of their declared profits or is it the actual figure in terms of millions of pounds paid by them from one year to another?  The Minister is aware that the declared tax paid by the AIB is 32 per cent of profits while for the Bank of Ireland the figure is 26 per cent, which is less than the rate paid by many PAYE workers.  Can the Minister indicate in what way he measures the expected growth?  Can he tell us also what other measures he proposes to take to increase the growth rate in whatever way he measures it?</P>

      <P>I do not propose to get into the budgetary matters here.  The Deputy will appreciate that as a result of actions I have taken it will be some time before the increases come through.  Corporation tax paid by banks, life and nonlife assurance companies and building societies for the yearly accounting period ending between the end of September 1988 and the end of December 1989 is estimated at £75 million to date.  This is an increase of about 20 per cent over the amount paid in respect of corresponding accounting periods in the previous year. Account must also be taken of the amounts raised by the bank levy, section 84 levy, life assurance levy; in all, the yield from these in 1989 came to over £19 million.  There will be an increase again this year because as accelerated allowances decrease and section 84 loans are less available the amounts available for write-off of tax are much less and, consequently, they filter through the system over a period of a couple of years.</P>

      <P>The Minister still did not answer the question as to how he measures the growth.  He indicated there had been an increase of 20 per cent over what was paid on previous occasions.  In what way does that relate to the actual profit made by these institutions?  What steps are taken to examine the question of deferred taxation by the banks, which I believe is substantial?  Does he have any figures on the amount of deferred taxation?</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>the factors which caused the substantial increase in business expansion scheme investments in the years 1988-1989 and 1989-1990; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The amounts of investment notified to the Revenue Commissioners in 1988-89 and 1989-90 as having been raised under the business expansion scheme were £25.5 million and £78 million respectively.  These figures compare with totals of £0.9 million in 1984-85, £4.4 million in 1985-86, £6.9 million in 1986-87 and £9.9 million in 1987-88.</P>
      <P>Take-up of the scheme, which was introduced in 1984, grew over time as investors and promoters became more familiar with it.  The increased level of economic activity in recent years will have contributed to this trend.  Thus, investment in the sectors to which the business expansion scheme applied from the beginning, manufacturing and certain internationally-traded services, rose from £8.9 million in 1987-99 to £14.7 million in 1988-89 and £26 million in 1989-90.  This latter figure excludes the case of a single company raising £23 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also, as the Deputy will be aware, the <Col N="1810" /> Finance Act, 1987, extended the coverage of the scheme to include qualifying shipping and tourist traffic undertakings and special trading houses.  Investments notified to the Revenue Commissioners in these areas rose from £0.4 million in 1987-88 to £10 million in 1988-89 and £27.9 million in 1989-90.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Deputy will be aware that in the years he mentions the scheme was made the subject of significant abuse, by way of the provision of guaranteed returns for investors in certain BES projects. As the House will be aware, I introduced measures in the 1989 and 1990 Finance Acts, not only to deal with this abuse but also to limit the scope of the scheme and put a ceiling on the amount of investment in a single company which could qualify for relief.</P>

I would also remind the Deputy that over 600 companies have raised money under the BES scheme since it was introduced. No scheme has ever been introduced that was not abused in some shape or form.  The scheme is the subject of a review by an interdepartmental committee as to its effectiveness in the whole area of risk capital provision and job evaluations, etc.  When that comes to hand the Government will make their decision in due course.  If Deputy Garland has information to back up some of the wild statements he has made, he should contact me.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support amendments <Col N="1912" /> Nos. 10 and 11 in the name of Deputy Yates, which seek to broaden section 3 by establishing in it the fundamental right of children to have their wishes and views taken into account.  I am impressed by the desire of Deputy Yates to do this.  He has made it clear that it is not in any way a veto which would be given to the child but would ensure that their views would be listened to and recorded so that if any reference was required subsequently it would be on the health board files.</P>
      <P>I see very little which could be opposed in the two sections which it is proposed to add.  I am anxious that the wishes of the child would be documented.  Paragraph (d) of amendment No. 10 provides that children would be informed of their right to be consulted prior to any action or change in their circumstances. While I remember the lengthy debate we had on Committee Stage on this section &mdash; the Minister referred to cases when a child might not be in a position to make a valued judgment of his circumstances or might be too young or not capable of doing so &mdash; I do not think that should, as a general rule, preclude children from having the opportunity to voice their views, have them listened to and documented. There will be many instances when children will be very willing and able to express a view.  I am sure it will be a matter of course any way that that view will be listened to but it is important, if we are enacting legislation, to lay down what we want to happen in clear legislative terms and not just come to a consensus view that this will happen in any event.  If we want it to happen we should spell it out.  This is one of the things we consistently said during the debate on Committee Stage.  I believe both these amendments should be strongly supported by those on the Opposition benches and I hope they will be accepted, as the previous amendment was, by the Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Miss Coughlan Miss Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Miss Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in favour of amendment No. 10 because under the Bill the health board will have a statutory obligation to look after the welfare of children.  Section 3 (2) (b) (ii) provides <Col N="1913" /> that a health board shall, in so far as is practicable, give due consideration, having regard to his age and understanding, to the wishes of the child.  If the health board or social worker says to children who have been sexually abused or abused in any other way that they believe they should be taken into care or removed from their families, there are many children who would fear the repercussions of accepting that advice &mdash; they may believe, as in the old saying &ldquo;the devil you know is better than the devil you don't know&rdquo;.  Many children would not have any idea of the best thing to do and out of sheer fear could go against what would be in their best interests.  That would be my biggest fear in relation to explaining to children their rights in a situation like that.  There might also be the problem that a child would run away and a health board would be faced with a bigger calamity than they started with.</P>
      <P>At the same time, I am very much in favour of the proposal that a child's view should be seriously considered.  Children will know what they want at a certain age and, as legislators, it is our obligation to look after their rights.  The Minister took that point on board on Committee Stage and I believe amendment No. 142 in his name will incorporate many of the proposals we would be putting forward.  I am very much in favour of reviews for children in residential care.  I worked in this area and it is very important that children are not left in care for, say, two years without a review taking place and perhaps that type of care is no longer necessary.  I think this is provided for in the Bill and I do not see the necessity to reiterate it in this amendment, and furthermore I do not agree with the practice of explaining to children their rights in certain situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">

      <P>Section 3(2)(b)(ii) provides that &ldquo;a health board shall, in so far as in practicable, give due consideration, having regard to his age and understanding, to the wishes of the child&rdquo; and so on.  Is it not reasonable to follow-on from that by including the paragraph <Col N="1914" /> that Deputy Yates proposes in his amendment, that the health board shall inform children of their right to be consulted. We should remember that we are talking about children of up to 18 years of age, who would understand and who are entitled to be consulted prior to any action or change in their circumstances. This is a logical and reasonable request and I support this amendment.</P>

      <P>I have very serious reservations about the part of the amendment which proposes that children should be informed of their right to initiate a review of their circumstances as, quite frankly, if we are talking about young children this amendment could lead to chaos.  Young children would not understand what this means and in the case of teenagers there are different degrees or levels of understanding. I wish to convey those serious reservations and question the wisdom of pushing this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking amendments Nos. 10 and 11 together, under section 3 (2) (b) health boards will be placed under an obligation to give due consideration to the wishes of the child, assuming of course that the child is of sufficient age and intelligence to express a view. However, the obligation will be subject to the proviso &ldquo;in so far as is practicable.&rdquo; This is in recognition of the fact that it is not always possible or practicable to consult the child or have regard to his wishes.  For example, where there is an immediate and serious threat to a child's safety it would not be practicable to consult the child about the making of an application for an emergency care order. Similarly, a health board could not be bound by the wishes of a child, otherwise what would the health board do in a case of alleged sexual abuse if the child wanted to return home and resume living with the alleged abuser?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy's proposal on the other hand, that a child should have a right to be consulted before any action is taken in relation to him, is not realistic.  This <Col N="1915" /> could serve to prevent health boards from taking action to protect children in certain situations, particularly in an emergency. If, for example, the health board were unable to consult the child, under Deputy Yates's proposal the board would be prevented from taking action to protect the child.  I am sure that this is not what Deputy Yates intends but it seems that this could be the effect of what he is proposing.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I want to make it clear that I support and accept the principle of children in care being kept informed of their progress and being consulted as far as possible before any decision is taken which might affect them.  Social workers, child care workers, foster-parents and others who deal with children on a day to day basis are well aware of the importance of this.  I would like to draw the attention of Deputy Yates and the House to amendment No. 142 in my name, which would require the Minister for Health to make regulations which would make it mandatory on health boards to carry out regular reviews of the cases of children in care.  If the Deputy is prepared to withdraw these amendments, I would be happy to give an undertaking that the question of giving a child in care a right to initiate a review of his own case will be sympathetically considered when the regulations under amendment No. 142 are being drawn up.</P>

      <P>Again, it comes down to a question of emphasis.  The purpose of the Child Care Bill is to give priority to the rights of children, which in some cases supersede the rights of parents in the interests of the child.  The Minister has said that he envisages children being consulted but is there anything wrong with the concept that it is proper to consult children, to talk to them and build up their confidence at a time when they are experiencing trauma, are in trouble and in need of someone to talk to?  Such a process of consultation might be welcomed by them.  I am aware that there are some children who do not have the intelligence which would allow them to <Col N="1916" /> veto what is to be done but if they express a wish &mdash; we have to take into account the fact that circumstances may arise where they would express a wish &mdash; what is wrong with the concept which Deputy Yates has spoken about of documenting that wish?  It may not be possible to grant it at the time but perhaps within a year or two when the case is being reviewed it may prove to be of benefit to the social worker or health board concerned with their welfare.</P>
      <P>I know we are dealing here with hypothetical examples but I would like to think that children are not going to be treated as numbers in a lottery game and that it will be remembered that they are human beings with special problems, not of their own making.  Would it not be of benefit to the health boards and agencies responsible for them to know what children are thinking or are talking about and what they would like us to know?  There is nothing wrong with the principle of what Deputy Yates is trying to achieve. Indeed, it restates some of our aspirations outlined in the Bill without making it too bureaucratic and I think it is a reasonable one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that if I withdrew amendment No. 10 he would consider the question of allowing a child to initiate a review.  On that understanding, I will be happy to withdraw the amendment.  However, I feel very strongly about amendment No. 11 and feel there would be great potential for injustice, hardship, misunderstanding and damage to children if their views were not recorded.  In reply to Deputy Fitzgerald, who said children may not be the best judges and that their desires may not be in their best interests, I consider it very important that a child's wishes are recorded.  I consider this to be a vital legal protection for children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will certainly press amendment No. 11 because if a child wishes to have his circumstances reviewed this should be recorded.  The social worker or the health board may say no, that they disagree and tell children they cannot go back.  If the views and wishes of children are recorded <Col N="1917" /> evidence in regard to them could be accumulated over a period.  This is patently reasonable and, seeing that I have agreed to withdraw amendment No. 10 on the understanding that the Minister will consider the points I have made when drawing up the regulations, I ask him in turn to accept amendment No. 11.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 10, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>Prior to tabling this amendment both Deputy Howlin and I had consultations with social workers.  The purpose of the amendment is to firm up what we believe should be in the Bill &mdash; we hope the Minister will agree with us &mdash; without disturbing the thrust of the Bill.  If the amendment is accepted section 4 would read:</P>
      <P>Where it appears to a health board that a child who resides or is found in its area requires care or protection and where it appears to be in the better interests of the child to do so it shall be the duty of the health board to take him into its care under this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment would change the <Col N="1918" /> emphasis.  The social workers, the professionals in this area, are anxious that we do this because the words used in the Bill could lead to ambiguity.  We are anxious to strengthen this section without disturbing the thrust of it as initiated by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is identical to one Deputy Howlin tabled on Committee Stage when we gave it long, arduous debate.</P>
      <P>I might explain that the purpose of this section is to provide a statutory basis for what is usually referred to as &ldquo;voluntary care&rdquo;.  This refers to circumstances in which children are received into care with the agreement of their parents.  It also covers the admission of children who have been deserted or abandoned.  It is the most common avenue of admission to care; approximately 65 to 70 per cent of children in care enter into care in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the phrase &ldquo;that he is unlikely to receive unless he is taken into care&rdquo; is to require a health board, before taking a child into care, to investigate whether the child's need for care and protection can be met by any other means short of admission to care.  For example, it might be that the provision of a home help or social work support would help alleviate difficulties and render admission to care unnecessary.  In the case of an abandoned child a health board might try to arrange to have the child looked after by relatives.  The phrase acts as a type of filter to prevent inappropriate or unnecessary admissions to care.  Of course, having considered the available options, if a health board are satisfied that admission to care is the best or only course for the child, then there is no obstacle to that.  Indeed the relevant health board would be under a duty to take the child into care in such circumstances. I would be concerned that the effect of the proposal of Deputies Howlin and Ferris in this amendment would be to remove this safeguard, <Col N="1919" /> making admission to care too readily available as an option.  This also runs counter to the principle of minimum intervention, one of the cornerstones of child care policy.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I regret I am unable to accept the proposed amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister has not found it possible to accept our amendment.  Certainly its provisions would not envisage that the &ldquo;taking into care&rdquo; facility would be resorted to without having taken due regard to or seeking another view on the subject.  Surely the words contained in the phrase &ldquo;and where it appears to be in the best interests of the child to do so&rdquo; obviously involve a procedure of investigation and so on. Certainly we would not rule out the possibility of a health board taking somebody into care if they considered it to be in the child's best interests.  That would not rule out the possibility of the relevant health board resorting to other family members to be the carers of the child concerned.</P>
      <P>I know this was discussed at the Special Committee.  I know that professionals working in the field were anxious that we endeavour to bring the Minister round to our viewpoint, that this was a better form of wording.  However, in view of the Minister's outright condemnation of our wording, there is no point in our wasting the time of the House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 43, to delete &ldquo;Nothing&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Without prejudice to the provisions of Parts III, IV and VI, nothing.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1920" /> The purpose of amendments Nos. 15 and 20 is to deal with concerns expressed at the Special Committee about certain matters in relation to this subsection. First, there was concern expressed that the phrase contained in section 4 (2) that &ldquo;Nothing in this section shall authorise a health board to take a child into its care against the wishes of a parent...&rdquo; might be interpreted as applying to all admissions to care and, as a result, a health board would not be able to seek an emergency care order, an interim care order or care order unless the parents agreed.  Clearly, that is not the intention. The need to comply with the wishes of the parents arises only in the case of voluntary admissions under the provisions of section 4.  In all other cases the health boards would be able to seek orders for the placement of children in care regardless of the parents' views.</P>
    <P>Second, there was also concern expressed at Special Committee that the effect of section 4 (4) &mdash; which requires a health board in the case of a child who is taken into voluntary care because he is lost, because his parents are missing or have deserted him, or to attempt to reunite a child with its parents &mdash; might be to require health boards to return to their parents children who had, for example, been abandoned even though those parents might be unfit to have care of them.  Again, that is not the intention. In such a case a health board would be able to apply for an emergency care order, or a care order, as they saw fit.</P>
    <P>The insertion of these amendments makes it clear that the powers and duties of a health board under this section are without prejudice to their power under Part III to seek an emergency care order, under Part IV to seek an interim care order or a care order, or under Part VI to place a child in foster care or residential care.</P>
    <P>I might add that these amendments also meet the point raised by Deputy Yates in his amendment No. 17, which he might now consider withdrawing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>As I recall our discussion in relation to section 4 and voluntary <Col N="1921" /> care, the Minister is quite right in so far as section 4 (2) did lead to some ambiguity.  I have no difficulty with the manner in which the Minister has now proposed to tidy up that subsection that, notwithstanding other relevant sections of the Bill, it is with regard to voluntary care only that a health board can do what is contained in section 4 (2).</P>
      <P>As I recall it &mdash; I stand to be corrected here &mdash; the insertion of the words &ldquo;without a court order&rdquo; in my amendment No. 17 would give greater flexibility to a health board.  Section 4 (1) reads:</P>
      <P>Where it appears to a health board that a child who resides or is found in its area requires care or protection that he is unlikely to receive unless he is taken into care, it shall be the duty of the health board &mdash;</P>
      <P>I am seeking to insert the words &ldquo;without a court order&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
      <P>to take him into its care under this section.</P>
      <P>I am trying to facilitate the health boards, where there is voluntary care, that they would not require any form of legal jurisdiction by getting a court order.  That is a somewhat separate point from what the Minister is tidying up.  In so far as the Minister is dealing with this area of responsibility, I am quite happy about that.  But I am endeavouring to give greater flexibility to health boards, so that there will be no question of legally verifying a child being taken into care in voluntary care circumstances by having to go to court, or in the event of anybody subsequently raising the matter &mdash; to the effect that there was no legal care order, emergency care order or any other type of order having been obtained.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is consequential on the changes made in section 30 on Committee Stage.  It was proposed originally that, where it was not possible to reunite a child who is lost with its parents, or whose parents are missing or have deserted him or her, a health board would be empowered to place the child in the care of a suitable person, for example, a relative or friend.  However, in the light of the new provisions inserted in section 30 on Committee Stage, it is proposed that the child be dealt with in accordance <Col N="1923" /> with that section.  Section 30 enables a health board to make the following arrangements with respect to a child in their care:</P>
    <P>(a)  by placing him in foster care,</P>
    <P>(b)  by placing him in a children's residential centre ... or other place of residence,</P>
    <P>(c)  in the case of a child who may be eligible for adoption ... by placing him ... with a view to his adoption, or</P>
    <P>(d)  by making such other suitable arrangements ... as the health board thinks proper.</P>
    <P>It will be seen that section 30 makes a greater range of options available to the health boards than does section 4 (4).  It is proposed, therefore, that the provisions of section 30 should operate rather than the words be deleted in the amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">

      <P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 15, after &ldquo;interests&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, giving due regard to the wishes of the child&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is self-explanatory.  It is a repeat of a discussion we had on Committee Stage. It arises in section 4 of the Bill.  I am seeking to provide that the wishes of the child be given some attention.  As the Minister has it termed, it is just &ldquo;the best interests of the child&rdquo;.  That is, of course, a subjective term because what one social worker may think is in the best interests of the child the parent might not think is in the best interests of the child.  Deputy Shatter outlined on Committee Stage in some detail reservations he had in certain cases whereby what was subsequently proved in court to be not in the best interest of the child was not necessarily the wishes of the child either in the initial decision made by the health board. Therefore, I feel it would be prudent to add these few words, &ldquo;giving due regard <Col N="1924" /> to the wishes of the child&rdquo;.  I do not feel it alters in any way the substance of the voluntary care section here, it just tidies it up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I say in support of this amendment that it would be rather odd for the Minister not to accept it because under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1954, where disputes arise with regard to custody of children, in particular when children reach the age of 10 or 11 and upwards, since 1964 the courts have had due regard in practice to the wishes of children.  &ldquo;Having due regard&rdquo; does not mean that if a child has a perception of what should happen that is clearly contrary to the welfare of the child a court will make the order the child says should be made.  It has meant in practice that a social worker's psychiatric assessment reports which record the view of a child are given some weight where the views of the child coincide with what is in the interests of the child's welfare, where there are two possible options which would result in the child's welfare being equally protected but there is a clear wish on the part of the child to follow one option rather than the other.  Judges in the courts have on occasions taken it on themselves to talk to older children to ascertain what their wishes are in the context of reaching a final decision. Therefore, I urge the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is anything controversial about the amendment.  It would accord with practice in other areas of child care law as it has operated for a number of years.  I see no reason why such due regard to the wishes of the child should not be taken on board where a voluntary care situation arises.  I urge the Minister to take it into account, and I draw his attention to the growing international awareness and practice in this area in which it is now being recognised that adults do not always know best for children and the children's wishes should be given a degree of seriousness in determining what steps should be taken on their behalf.  In a report by the Law Reform Commission on the whole area <Col N="1925" /> of child sexual abuse, the commission in that context emphasised the importance of adults listening to what children say and what they are reporting and giving them a degree of credibility that perhaps up to now they have not always been given.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already inserted in section 3 a new provision requiring health boards in the performance of their functions in relation to the care and protection of children to regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.  That provision applies automatically to the actions of a health board under this section, so it is not necessary to make this insertion here.  Section 3 (2) (b), Part II of this Bill also refers to the wishes of the child and section 23 imposes the same duties on the courts.  I think there is no doubt about it, the interests of the child are the first and paramount consideration at all times, be it in the health boards responsibility or in the interpretation and duties of the courts towards the child. The Bill is very strong in that area and I think we are all at one on that.  Therefore, this amendment is unnecessary and I would be sincerely grateful if Deputy Yates would withdraw it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the Minister's point.  However, I think he has missed my point and Deputy Shatter's point which is that this section deals with voluntary care.  It does not deal with the courtroom situation or with any legal care order.  It deals with a code which will operate purely in the confines of section 4.  In the instance of voluntary care it is important that we extend the provision &ldquo;having due regard for the wishes of the child&rdquo;, where practicable, to this section. In the same way as the Minister used this argument against my earlier argument, saying because it was stated elsewhere in the Bill it applied, that he was refusing to accept an amendment and was moving his amendments to tidy this up, I think my argument holds equally valid.  I ask him, therefore, to reinforce what he has said by allowing section 4 to be improved <Col N="1926" /> in this way.  Therefore, I will press my amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and declared lost.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 22a:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Each health board shall, without unreasonable delay, arrange for the preparation of a family assessment report as to the suitability of a person or a married couple to adopt outside the State when requested by such person or couple to undertake such assessment and upon the conclusion by the health board of such enquiries as it deems appropriate, shall furnish a copy of such report to the person or couple who requested such report and to the lawfully designated authority in the State to which an application to adopt has been made.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is to tackle an area that has not been tackled.  It was raised in passing during Committee Stage.  This relates to section 6, which imposes an express duty on health boards to provide, or ensure the provision of, in their area a service for the adoption of children in accordance with the Adoption Acts, 1952 to 1988.  It is to do with ensuring that the health boards process adoption applications of a domestic nature; where, as is usually the case, a married couple seek to adopt a child in a health board area, the health board social work team will carry out whatever assessments are necessary on the couple, they will properly advise the mother of the child as to the purposes of placing the child for adoption and its legal implications, and matters are properly processed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill entirely ignores something that is becoming a growing phenomenon in this country and which we have not yet sought to address by way of legislation.  There has been a dramatic decrease in the number of children made available for adoption in recent years. Until 1984-85 there were in the region of 1,200 or 1,250 adoption orders per annum <Col N="1927" /> being made by the Adoption Board.  The number had reduced to 615 orders made in 1989 and fewer than 400 of those were made in favour of married couples who were unrelated to the child they were adopting.  The remaining adoptions were either made in favour of people who were related to the child, such as grandparents, or, in the majority of instances, it was the mother who had the child outside marriage subsequently adopting her child jointly with her husband who was not the father of the child, so that following marriage the couple would in law be mother and father.  Fewer than 400 adoption orders are currently being made in respect of childless couples in this country and that has resulted in an increasing number of couples trying to adopt outside Ireland.  We have had instances of that in various countries in South America such as Chile, Equador and Peru.  We have also had instances of adoption in India, the Philippines and other countries.  This year has seen a dramatic illustration of that.  It is my information that there are now, on average, two or three Irish couples per week travelling to Romania to adopt children.  It is my understanding that there have been in excess of 120 Romanian children adopted by Irish couples since the beginning of this year.</P>
    <P>One of the problems that Irish couples adopting in Romania are experiencing is that they need to have a social worker assessment report carried out to satisfy the authorities in Romania that they are appropriate couples to adopt.  There is great difficulty in this area because health board social workers will not carry out assessments as employees of the health board, for the purpose of foreign adoption, and the adoption societies, who only have a domestic role in the area of adoption, will not carry out such assessment reports either.</P>
    <P>This amendment is designed to impose a duty on the health boards in this area. It reads:</P>
    <P>Each health board shall, without unreasonable delay, arrange for the preparation of a family assessment <Col N="1928" /> report as to the suitability of a person or a married couple to adopt outside the State when requested by such person or couple to undertake such assessment and upon the conclusion by the health board of such enquiries as it deems appropriate, shall furnish a copy of such report to the person or couple who requested such report and to the lawfully designated authority in the State to which an application to adopt has been made.</P>
    <P>In effect, it seeks to ensure that if a couple who wish to adopt outside the State go to a health board looking for an assessment to be carried out so that they can satisfy the authorities in Romania or elsewhere that they are a suitable couple to adopt the social workers attached to the health board would carry out the necessary and proper assessment.  It is my contention that this State has an interest in ensuring that, when adoption orders are made outside the State in favour of Irish couples living in Ireland, those adoption orders are made in favour of couples who are suitable to adopt.  We also have a duty in the context of the tragedy that is unfolding in Romania.  There are few Members of this House who have not watched television programmes and read articles depicting the horrific predicament of young children and babies locked away and abandoned in orphanages in Romania, who lack basic health care, education, nutrition, and the basic thing in life that all children require, an amount of love and attention.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a fortunate opportunity to ensure that the health boards will co-operate by carrying out such assessment to facilitate Irish couples who wish to adopt and who wish to give assurances to the Romanian authorities, and authorities in other countries, that they are appropriate people to adopt.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister can accept this amendment.  I hope he will see it not as something being tabled in a party political context.  This is an enormous Bill and it is very easy to miss various issues we can deal with.  Since Committee Stage, the need to address this problem has become even more apparent.  I would invite the <Col N="1929" /> Minister to take this amendment on board to impose an obligation on health boards to carry out such assessments and to facilitate couples in Ireland who are appropriate to adopt, who are happily married and do not have children of their own, to adopt outside Ireland.  I would ask the Minister to do this in the context of what must be his own knowledge in this area, that currently many adoption societies are refusing even to take new couples on to their waiting lists because although there has been a substantial increase in the number of children born outside marriage &mdash; almost 11 per cent of total births &mdash; there has been a substantial increase in the number of mothers retaining their children.</P>
    <P>I hope this amendment will be seen in the spirit in which it is proposed and that the Minister will see fit to take on board. It is an amendment that would commend itself to many people outside the House who have been watching the problems that are unfolding in Romania and who would like to see our Government providing the necessary support and facilities to ensure that these children are given the possibility of a proper family life with Irish couples who are willing to open their homes to them and provide them with that family life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief because Deputy Shatter has very competently covered the situation.  The difficulty here is that these childless couples who are going to Romania have to go through a number of different procedures to bring home a child.  First, they have to get approval from the Department of Justice to bring the child into the country, and that requires sending off birth certificates and so on.  The second difficulty is to get acceptance from the Romanian authorities and they increasingly require as a basic measure of acceptance &mdash; in other words, the suitability of such parents to adopt &mdash; an assessment from the health board's local social worker.  As demand has increased for these assessment reports the health boards have been increasingly reluctant, due to manpower <Col N="1930" /> restrictions or pressures of work or whatever, to give such assessments out.  One's ability to get these assessment reports depends on what part of the country one comes from and by which health board one is serviced.  This is totally unfair.</P>
      <P>We need to bring uniformity into the situation.  We need to facilitate the people who genuinely cannot adopt at home.  We know there are crazy age restrictions because of the difference between the demand and supply in regard to adoption here.  The Minister could, with this legislation, allow all parents, as of right, to have this assessment carried out.  The assessment may well conclude that they are not a suitable couple to adopt, but if it was favourable it would greatly enhance their prospects.  I know people who have gone to Romania two and three times and they still have not been able to sort things out conclusively; therefore, it is very important that these assessment reports be made available to them.</P>
      <P>The timing of this Bill is fortuitous and section 6 gives us the opportunity to deal with this situation.  I would ask the Minister to accept it for what it is and in a spirit of generosity, because it is a tragic situation for both the children and the parents concerned.</P>

      <P>We all know these problems exist but I wonder if this is the right time to address them.  I understand that consultations are taking place at the highest level to address them.  There is no reference, however, in this Bill to the mechanisms for adoption.  I wonder if it is not inappropriate to introduce an amendment like this into a child care Bill. This is essentially a Child Care Bill, not an adoption Bill.  Surely my legal friend across the way must be aware that an adoption Bill would be a far more appropriate mechanism to address this problem.  I would like the Deputy to respond to that when he has an opportunity to conclude on the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment proposed by Deputies Shatter and Yates. Extraordinarily from my constituency, <Col N="1931" /> quite a number of married couples have gone to Romania and have brought home children they adopted there.  The circumstances surrounding the preparation for that are well documented.  It is appropriate that every investigation possible be carried out before people go to Romania. The Department of Justice insist that a family assessment or an assessment by a social worker be carried out as to the suitability of the adoptive parents. Initially there were no problems but because of problems being experienced by the administrative authorities it is becoming increasingly difficult to get social workers to carry out assessments. The only children available for adoption are those in Romania.  Under a system in that country legal documentation must be submitted to the Department of Justice for approval before the people visit the authorities in Romania.  Often two visits must be made to that country.</P>
      <P>This amendment puts an obligation on us to ensure that the adoptive parents are suitable but it also provides that there should be a system in Romania under which people can get information on the children, whether they are healthy, are not HIV positive and so on.  The childless couples from Ireland who are anxious to adopt children should be able to do so having been given clearance, firstly, by the authorities here and, secondly, by the Romanian authorities.  While this is not an adoption Bill, as has been mentioned by Deputy Fitzgerald, it is a Child Care Bill.  Children who come from another jurisdiction to Ireland to be adopted are not Irish nationals.  They have to go through a procedure of naturalisation so that they eventually become citizens and obtain their own passports.  The children will be our responsibility and it is at the initial stage that we should become involved.  The adoption of the amendment would certainly go a long way towards meeting the concern of adoptive parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last weekend people were pointing out the deficiencies in the Bill and said it does not address this dimension, which has arisen since the Bill was introduced. <Col N="1932" /> I ask the Minister to seriously consider the argument made by my colleagues, which is a good one.  We sought legal opinion this morning on an amendment such as this but, in the meantime, we are prepared to support the amendment before us, which meets some of our concerns.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>Most Deputies have been asked in recent years by constituents to give a stamp of approval to the adoption of Romanian children, but one feels very inadequate about that.  There is a certain irony in this considering the need for such documentation and so on.  Very caring, well-meaning and loving couples go to Romania to adopt children who are living in appalling circumstances.  Those who have listened to radio reports or seen programmes on television on this matter wonder how any civilised state could allow such a thing to happen.</P>
      <P>We are very fortunate that this amendment has been put forward.  I suggest that the Minister seriously consider taking it on board.  Surely he must have known that this was the way this side of the House would be thinking.  Being a Child Care Bill, it is appropriate that this provision be inserted.  I respectfully suggest to the Minister, if he claims that the place for it is in an adoption Bill, that the position in regard to Romania will have changed by the time such a Bill is introduced. I support this amendment and ask that it be given sympathetic consideration.</P>

      <P>Like other Deputies, I have been contacted in relation to Romanian adoptions.  I understand the frustrations of people who find that <Col N="1933" /> children are not available here for adoption. An opportunity has arisen not only to provide an additional pool for adoption for parents here but also to be helpful to a country which has major problems of its own.  I do not think the amendment is appropriate to this legislation.  I hope an amendment to the Adoption Bill will be forthcoming.  Like Deputy Yates, I believe there are other problems not only in the context of foreign adoptions but in regard to the relevant age of families who are entitled to adopt.  Many people feel the age limit is very restrictive.</P>
      <P>We have always had an excellent reputation of having a very good adoption society.  We have been very diligent in ensuring that the people involved in adoption go through a long process so that no mistakes are made.  I fear that, perhaps in ten years' time, the Romanian Government will say to the people of Ireland: &ldquo;We would like our children back&rdquo;.  Hindsight is a great thing.  It is very important that this amendment is taken in its proper context.  It would be most inappropriate to include it in this Bill.  This is a matter on which we all have views.  I hope the Minister will address the problem as quickly as possible and, perhaps in the very near future, we will see an amendment to our adoption laws, not only to deal with foreign adoptions but with other problems that have arisen over the years.</P>

      <P>Very weak arguments have been made against what is a clearcut amendment.  It is easily understood and is a follow-on from section 6 (1).  It provides that without unreasonable delay arrangements should be made for the preparation of a family assessment report.  We are talking about children in care and the adoption of children.  Reference has been made to Romanian children and, therefore, it is reasonable to have this amendment inserted in the Bill.  I support it.</P>

      <P>I share the concern expressed by all Members in relation to the problem that has arisen with the adoption of Romanian and other foreign <Col N="1934" /> babies.  I do not think this is an appropriate Bill in which to insert this amendment. I question why it has been introduced at this stage.  Some Deputies have said they have heard no good reason why it should be excluded but I have heard no good reason why it should be included.  If it was such an important amendment, and had been carefully considered, I venture to suggest that it should have been included in the original list of amendments and not on a white sheet, labelled No. 22a.  I am sorry that I have to raise the issue of why this proposal should be before us at this late stage.  The special committee who were set up to deal with this Bill worked very well and everyone co-operated on it.  There was no mention at all of introducing this proposal then and I query the appropriateness and the motivation behind introducing it now. Perhaps later tonight we will know why it was put down today.</P>

      <P>If it were serious and if the Deputy were so concerned about it he would have introduced it a lot earlier and it would have been raised in the Committee.  It is inappropriate.  I do not withdraw any remark I made concerning the motivation behind the proposal.  The motivation is suspect.  I would not support the amendment because it addresses only a tiny part of the serious problem that it purports to address.  I do not think we should play around with the emotions of <Col N="1935" /> people who are caught up in this.  This area requires much more than a totally inappropriate last minute amendment which does not address the problem. Consequently, the Deputy should withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I deprecate the fact that there is a note of aggression now which was not present during Committee Stage. This is not helpful.  I do not think an idea is any less good because it is thought of late rather than early.  I have often dealt with legislation where important ideas were made late in the day.  The Minister and the Department have been dealing with this Bill for a long time, yet 32 pages of ministerial amendments were issued last Friday.</P>
      <P>It should not be said that, simply because they were circulated as late as Friday last and that the Minister did not think of them over the last two years, they are inferior.  The reality is that every suggestion put forward here is worth debating.  If the argument is that the proposal would be only a partial solution, that it would not be comprehensive in its scope, the same argument could be used against enacting many of the sections because they are only partial solutions which affect a few people.  Thankfully, child sexual abuse is not so rampant in the population that it affects the majority.  We are dealing with children and with the rights of children.  If we can protect and defend the rights of a single child by introducing a section or clause in this Bill it is worthy not only of debate but of serious consideration.  That is the basis on which we have progressed legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Let us get things back on the rails and give serious consideration to any amendment that comes before us, regardless of the colour of the paper it is printed on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation was put in sharp focus for me in recent months as a result of television reports from Romania.  I do <Col N="1936" /> not feel it is necessary to apologise for that.  I commend Deputy Shatter for seeking to use the earliest opportunity to bring some form of order and authority into the area of adoption of children from these depressed areas.  We have seen the visible suffering of children who have been totally abandoned and neglected. Teenage children were confined in tiny cots and so are grossly deformed.  There are loving parents in this country who wish to adopt some of those children and that issue merits consideration in the House.  Legislation might be needed but the Government have not seen fit to bring it before us.  It is up to the Opposition to use whatever vehicle it can to bring forward ideas for amending legislation.</P>
    <P>The argument that it does not fit into this Bill is spurious.  It is to fit into section 6, which deals specifically with the issue of adoption and states that each health board shall provide or ensure the provision in its area of a service for the adoption of children in accordance with the adoption Acts.  It is a natural follow-on to insert the amendment now proposed. There should not be any contention on the issue.  It is bad policy not to support an amendment because we do not like the colour of the paper it is written on or because we do not think a particular vehicle is the most suitable one for it.  If the amendment is good and worthwhile and is designed to improve the lot of any adopting family or of any child it is worth considering and I support it.</P>

      <P>I assure the House that my acceptance or rejection of any amendment is based entirely on fact, information, legal advice and a genuine sincerity to ensure that we enact the best law.  I assure Deputy Shatter that I do not either accept or reject amendments on the basis of the party proposing them. I do not operate in that way.  For the past three and a half years it has been my privilege to be on this side of the House playing a particular role.  I accept amendments, as they stand before me, in a most sincere way and with the aim of ensuring that we enact the best possible law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1937" /> Last Thursday we published 32 pages of amendments.  These were based on firm commitments given during a long Committee Stage debate that we would review, examine and bring forward amendments on Report Stage at the request of Members who had serious doubts or asked questions about different matters.  We will continue to do that as we go through the Bill in order to accommodate the House.</P>
    <P>With regard to the amendment before us, the question of inter-country adoption is a complex matter.  There is no one who accepts that more than Deputy Shatter. It involves questions of national and international law.  It is the subject of urgent consultations betwen the Minister for Health and the Attorney General. The role of health boards in this delicate area is one of the questions presently under consideration.  In view of this it would not be appropriate to pre-empt the outcome of these consultations by inserting a provision in this Bill.  I ask the Deputies to withdraw the amendment to allow the negotiations and discussions that are presently under way at the highest level to be brought to a positive conclusion and to enable the necessary amending legislation which may emanate from these discussions to be brought forward. Until the discussions are concluded I do not see any sense in proceeding with a piecemeal matter like this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Shatter drafted this amendment and I am satisfied with the quality of the words used.  I notice that in his reply the Minister did not say that there was any particular wording or language used that was inadequate.  A number of points were made.  Deputy Dempsey's remarks were contemptuous <Col N="1938" /> and I am glad the Minister distanced himself considerably from them.  They were irrelevant.</P>
      <P>This should be put into sharp focus because three questions were put to the Minister for Health in relation to the problem of foreign adoptions, particularly of Romanian children.  On 29 November last Deputy Shatter asked the Minister to indicate whether he had any intention of bringing legislation before this House to tackle the problem in regard to children being adopted abroad. In reply, at column 673 of the Official Report, the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon stated:</P>
      <P>We are having discussions with the Attorney General and we want to be helpful.  We would not be doing a service to Irish people seeking to adopt abroad or the infants if we rushed willynilly into law.</P>
      <P>Later I asked the Minister whether he was aware that foreign adoptions of Romanian children were running at the rate of about three per week and that there was a very substantial demand for such adoptions.  I said:</P>
      <P>In regard to the Taoiseach's strictures about the Order of Business may I, for future reference, ask the Minister if he is promising legislation in this area, yes or no?</P>
      <P>For once the Minister gave a very clear answer.  He said:</P>
      <P>No, I said nothing which would amount to a promise of legislation in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no legislation &mdash; or adoption Bill &mdash; in this area.  There is no hope for these people.  It is not a case, as Deputy Dempsey said, of playing on the emotions, it is trying to solve practical problems for people who are being turned away by the Romanian authorities because they cannot get basic assessment reports from some health boards, although they can from others.  We are trying to give an immediate response and I am pleased that today my party made <Col N="1939" /> arrangements &mdash; again through the good work of Deputy Shatter &mdash; to produce comprehensive legislation in the form of a Private Member's Bill which will deal with all aspects of adoption and the lack of recognition of foreign adoptions.</P>
    <P>If you adopt a foreign child at present the position is the same as it was in regard to illegitimate children some years ago &mdash; there is no legal provision for it.  This is a quite separate matter, it is a case of getting the health board to do these parents a favour, to provide an assessment report.  It does not require a fundamental rewrite of our adoption law, that is another day's work with which this party will deal in view of the fact that the Minister will not.  What we are being offered by the Minister of State is not some merit based approach to the pros and cons of what is required, we are being offered a dismissive rejection of a vital amendment in relation to people who are caught in an emotional vacuum by virtue of the fact that they cannot get these <Col N="1940" /> assessment reports because more of them are in demand than heretofore.</P>
    <P>There are two issues, one is a major adoption Bill which will be a separate day's work and the second is the health boards in so far as they must provide child care services <i>vis-à-vis</i> adoption.  Within the provisions of this Bill we are seeking to insert a simple additional paragraph which would mean that the Minister and the House would be saying that when the assessment reports are requested they must be granted.  Perhaps the Minister could say that in certain circumstances, there would have to be a genuine need for these assessment reports.</P>
    <P>I regret that Deputy Shatter could not again contribute but we will be pressing this amendment to a vote unless the Minister is prepared to reconsider the matter. I am very disappointed that the amendment could not have been seen in the spirit of the urgency and personal circumstances of those concerned and accepted on that basis.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 33, to delete &ldquo;Without prejudice to section 4,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 23 and 24 are similar to those made to section 4 &mdash; amendments Nos. 15 and 20 &mdash; and seek to clarify the circumstances in which a child can be taken into and maintained in care under this section.  The new subsection provides that in general a health board will not be able to take a child into care with a view to his adoption against the wishes of the parent or person <i>in loco parentis.</i>  Similarly, a health board will not be able to maintain a child in care with a view to his adoption against the wishes of the parents.</P>
      <P>The only situation in which a health board can act under this section against the wishes of the parent is where there is a court order under Part III or Part IV, for example, where the child has been placed in the care of the health board by the courts on the grounds that he has been assaulted, neglected or sexually abused. The health board may consider that the long-term interests of the child would best be served by placing him with suitable persons with a view to them adopting him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I want to emphasise that nothing in this section alters the provisions of our adoption legislation.  A child cannot be adopted against the wishes of his parents unless the High Court is satisfied that the parents have failed in their constitutional duties to care for the child and that it is in the best <Col N="1943" /> interests of the child that he be adopted. The Adoption Act, 1988, makes provision for such exceptional cases and the health boards will continue to be subject to the strict terms of that legislation.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(4)  Without prejudice to Parts III, IV and VI, nothing in this section shall authorise a health board to take a child into its care against the wishes of a parent having custody of him or of any person acting <i>in loco parentis</i> or to maintain him in its care under this section if that parent or any such person wishes to resume care of him.&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 25:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 47, after &ldquo;services&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;including community groups, child care practitioners and representatives of children with mental handicap.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to the membership and possible composition of the child care advisory committees.  This matter was discussed on Committee Stage.  I am not satisfied with the wording provided by the Minister.  It is too general and could allow certain community groups involved in play groups and other localised facilities, particularly in urban areas and areas of deprivation, to be included in the child care advisory committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister specifically rejected the inclusion of people involved in mental handicap.  An organisation called SWIM &mdash; Social Workers in Mental Handicap &mdash; are providing an excellent service.  They have an <Col N="1944" /> indepth knowledge of the deficiencies in these services provided for such children. It would be wrong to assume that children in care did not include mentally handicapped children.  There has been an increasing demand in all areas of mental handicap for a principle of integration in education and in care.  It strikes me as the wrong policy option for the Minister to state &mdash; as he did on Committee Stage &mdash; that mental handicap was a completely decompartmentalised, separate area from child care and that there should not be an overlap.  In my view there should be an overlap.  Therefore, I am seeking that the membership of the child care advisory committees would include community groups, child care practitioners and representatives of children with mental handicap in preference to the Minister's more bland and vague choice.</P>

      <P>If I remember correctly, we had some long arduous debates in relation to the child care advisory committees and some useful points were taken up and have been looked at by the Minister, as we can see in amendment No. 26.  Amendment No. 25 is very restrictive. It seeks to include community groups, child care practitioners and representatives of children with mental handicap in child care advisory committees. At the time, wrongly or rightly, there was much media hype in relation to facilities for the mentally handicapped&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's amendment is more widely based and would, I hope, incorporate the members Deputy Yates wishes to have included as well as others, and it would depend on the availability of certain groups in the health board areas. Perhaps there are more organisations in <Col N="1945" /> one health board area than another.  That is an area that would need to be looked at rather than being specific in relation to the membership of the child care advisory committees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the child care advisory committees is to involve the greatest possible expertise in health board areas to sit on these committees, and to advise the health board in the performance of their functions under this Bill.  I consider that the section as drafted is sufficiently broad to encompass the sections dealt with specifically by Deputy Yates' amendment.  In his amendment Deputy Yates wants to ensure that community groups, child care practitioners and representatives of children with mental handicap would be included in the group of people who are not necessarily excluded.  I would have read this section as being open to all these groups which Deputy Yates seeks to include but I was not privy to the Committee Stage debate of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Yates said the Minister had not intended to include representatives of children with mental handicap in these committees.  If the Minister said that on Committee Stage, then this amendment is very necessary.  I would not support a section in the Bill which would exclude people with a special responsibility for the handicapped and children who are mentally handicapped, because some of these children will be in care at some time.  It is important that people who are dealing with them regularly, professionally and otherwise, would have an opportunity to sit on these child care advisory committees.  I would hate to think they would be excluded although the section, as drafted, does not exclude them specifically.  I need to hear the Minister's confirmation that they would be included because, if what Deputy Yates says is correct, I would be very concerned and would insist that the words proposed by Deputy Yates be included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been looking at section 7 of the Health Act, 1970, which <Col N="1946" /> brought into being the local health committees. I would draw an analogy between what was incorporated in that Act and what is now proposed.  The position then was that the Minister should make regulations to establish, in relation to the functional area of each health board, such number of committees and so forth.  Under the provisions of this Bill the health board shall establish the health care advisory committees.  Why, then, is it not acceptable that the health board should have the right to include such representatives as are suggested in the amendment?  In the debate on my amendment No. 1 to the Minister's amendment No. 26 I will deal with the wording of his amendment.  What is wrong with including such groups as community and child care groups?  According to the Bill, it is the health boards who will establish the child care advisory committees.  Why should there be a restriction on some groups?  There should not be any restriction; all we are asking is that these groups should be specifically mentioned.  I support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there has been some slight misunderstanding of what the Minister said on Committee Stage.  I think he said that he would not specifically include mental handicap groups.  He made the point that he was not being restrictive by not mentioning certain groups or focusing the mind of a health board towards a particular group but rather he would prefer to leave this provision as wide as possible so that health boards would take on the best people in a wide range of organisations.  If I recall correctly, Deputy Howlin referred at that time to a particular group who operate in County Wexford who would not operate in other parts of the country.  He was anxious to ensure that health boards would not be constricted by naming specific national organisations, thereby excluding organisations in a particular town, county or health board area.  I am sure when the Minister is replying he will clarify this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would prefer to leave this provision as open as possible in order to allow the <Col N="1947" /> greatest degree of flexibility to health boards to take on the best possible range of people to serve on these bodies.  If specific reference was made to mental handicap groups, community care groups, voluntary organisations and so on, I would be afraid that health boards would make decisions on the basis that the Minister intended that only national organisations should be represented on child care advisory committees.  I believe the Minister's amendment is appropriate in this case and I support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have always had a horror of empire building and forming structures just for the sake of it, I would not favour initiating something which was not there before.  However, we have to set out in this legislation the relevant groups who must be represented.  I would stress very strongly the need to have representives of the mental handicap groups on these bodies.  The mental handicap groups are marginalised in our society and they are almost without a voice in putting forward the argument for residential care.  The arguments put forward by the mental handicap groups are very sound &mdash; their children should have the same right to education, training and care as any other child.  I do not believe they have the avenues to achieve this and as child care advisory committees will advise the health boards on such matters I believe this group and the other groups referred to by Deputy Yates should be specifically referred to in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 25 is identical to an amendment we discussed in detail on Committee Stage.  We went through the same arguments at that time. Section 7 (2) already provides that the child care advisory committees shall be composed of persons with a special interest or expertise in matters affecting the welfare of children.  This expression clearly covers what Deputy Yates referred to as &ldquo;child care practitioners&rdquo;. With regard to the reference to community groups, the existing subsection <Col N="1948" /> specifically provides for the involvement of representatives of voluntary bodies providing child care and family support services.  This expression is sufficiently broad to cover any type of voluntary body who could have a genuine contribution to make to the work of the committees.</P>
      <P>I can easily concur with what Deputy Fennell and other speakers have said about the mental handicap group but there is also the physically handicap group and so on.  We have left this provision as broad as possible so that there can be the widest representation and broadest consultation.  Consequently, this amendment is not necessary and I would be sincerely grateful to Deputy Yates if he would withdraw it.</P>

      <P>As the Minister rightly said, we had a long debate on a similar amendment on Committee Stage.  I do not want to hold up the proceedings any further but I have received requests from people who want to know exactly what constitutes expertise as referred to in section 7 (2).  This is not defined in any way. Is it envisaged that it will be up to the individual health boards to decide what in their view is special interest or expertise in matters relating to the welfare of children?  It is important that there should be some clarity on this point.  I think all of us are anxious for the provision to be as inclusive as possible so that groups who are genuinely working in the field of child care would be entitled to have their views heard by the health board.  What exactly does the Minister have in mind in regard to expertise?  I do not recall this being spelled out in any detail on Committee Stage and certainly not today.  I am not sure that the Minister can reply&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wish to assure Deputy <Col N="1949" /> Dempsey that I have nothing personal against him but every time he makes a contribution he causes me some difficulties. He said that if he could recall correctly the discussion on Committee Stage, the Minister was as open as possible, he did not wish to exclude any group, he wished to give full consideration to all groups and it was not so much a case of ruling out the mental handicap group as not being specific.  I should like to quote from the proceedings of the Special Committee on Wednesday, 10 January what was said by the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy.  He said:</P>
      <P>Deputy Yates wishes to include representatives of services for the mentally handicap but the mentally handicap services already have their own well organised network of regional committees.  These are working well and I see no reason to duplicate their work by extending the remit of the committees we are establishing here to the field of mental handicap.</P>
      <P>It is not a case of the Minister being open, broad and so on; he was being quite specific.  He was slamming the door in the face of any potential inclusion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is a requirement to be more specific in these areas.  Therefore, I will be pressing amendment No. 25.  I welcome amendment No. 26 in the name of the Minister.  In the context of what Deputy Howlin said, I should like to point out that there was a detailed line <Col N="1950" /> of questioning specifically on the number, composition and length of service of the members of the advisory committees but the Minister was unable to give any answers as he had no firm views at that stage on any of the questions.  Will he answer those questions in the limited time available to him to deal with amendment No. 26?</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(5)  The Minister shall give general directions in relation to child care advisory committees which may include directions on any matter relating to the membership, constitution or business of committees (including a provision empowering a committee to co-opt one or more members) and each health board and child care advisory committee shall comply with any such directions.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the Special Committee I accepted proposals from Opposition Deputies that there should be an obligation on the Minister to give directions under this subsection and also that provision should be made to enable the Minister to give a direction empowering a committee to co-opt one or more members.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 26:</P>
      <P>In the third line, to delete &ldquo;membership,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Here again I will draw an analogy with the 1970 Health Act and reckon we have to be very careful on this one.  The Bill at section 7 states &ldquo;that a health board shall establish a child care advisory committee to advise the health board on the performance of its functions under this Act and the health board shall consider and have regard to any advice so tendered to it&rdquo;.  That is fine, no one could object to it.  The only thing we object to is the Minister's amendment, which states that &ldquo;the Minister shall give general directions in relation to child care advisory committees&rdquo;. On the one hand the Bill will give the health boards power to set up health care advisory committees, while on the other the Minister now wants to insert an amendment which would take away that power entirely.  The two are in conflict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment states that such general directions may include directions on any matter relating to the membership. There would be some sense in putting forward an amendment proposing that provision be made for the drawing up of regulations covering such committees, including a provision on membership for bodies who have been mentioned previously and others actively engaged in the child care area and in related activity.  On the one hand the Bill states that the health boards &ldquo;shall&rdquo; establish child care advisory committees while on the other the Minister, according to the amendment, &ldquo;shall give general directions which may <Col N="1952" /> include directions on any matter relating to the membership, constitution or business of committees&rdquo;.  That is not the way to go about it and I do not believe the Minister should have that power.  For this reason I propose that in the third line the word &ldquo;membership&rdquo; should be deleted.</P>
    <P>The 1970 Health Act gave local committees the duty to advise the health boards but I should point out that these committees no longer meet as their powers have been taken away.  I see the same thing happening with the child care advisory committees, which the health boards will establish, as the Minister, if his amendment is accepted, will have the power to tell the boards who the committees should consist of and what their powers and functions should be.  If this were to be done by way of regulation to be handed down to the advisory committees it would be fair enough.  The Minister should not have the power to give directions on any matter relating to the membership.  However, that is exactly the power he is seeking in his amendment. For this reason I oppose the amendment and seek to have amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 26 adopted.</P>

      <P>We must dispose of amendment No. 1 and indeed amendment No. 2 to amendment No. 26 before we come to deal with amendment No. 26.  I take it, therefore, that Deputy Howlin will speak to Deputy Sherlock's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to comment on the Minister's amendment and the two amendments to his amendment.  I should say that I welcome the Minister's amendment and that he is acting in good faith and keeping the commitment he gave at the special committee.  I requested him at that time to make it mandatory on the Minister for Health to give directions on matters relating to the establishment of these advisory committees and take on board the submission made by Deputy Yates on the matter of co-option.  He has <Col N="1953" /> acted on that in good faith and I welcome the amendment very much.</P>
      <P>A whole range of issues was raised at the special committee, including the one I raised a few minutes ago, and I hope the Minister will respond to it.  We often find when enabling legislation is introduced to establish committees such as these, and this is understandable, that the details have not been worked out. However, it is not understandable in this case because the timescale involved has enabled the Minister and his officials to come up with a detailed view on the way these local child care advisory committees should be constituted, on what is meant by the particular wording of the legislation in front of us, including what is meant by &ldquo;special interest&rdquo; and &ldquo;expertise&rdquo;.  I expect the Minister to give us a definition of both those terms.</P>
      <P>I cannot support Deputy Sherlock's amendments because one of my strong fears as expressed at the special committee was that, having regard to the vagueness and looseness of the section, there would be inconsistency nationally as between one health board and another in relation to the composition, membership and scope of the committees.  It is imperative that not only should the Minister have the power and duty to determine the scope and membership and the mechanism for appointment to the committees but that the health boards should be obliged to act upon those recommendations, otherwise there will not be a consistent pattern across the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people argue in favour of freedom of action at local level but, unfortunately, because of our political establishment, political dominance does not often work in the best interests of health policy at health board level.  At least we are given the opportunity to monitor it from the Oireachtas.  I hope the Minister's amendment will be enacted unamended as I could not bring myself to support either of the two amendments to the amendment in relation to the role of the Minister with regard to membership or the duty of the <Col N="1954" /> advisory committees to act on suggestions made by the Minister.  It is right and proper that those provisions be in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take some time to give a detailed overview to the House on this, probably the final occasion we will have an opportunity to hear in detail what he wants to put in place in relation to the local advisory committees.</P>

Sometimes it is felt here that Ministers should not have responsibility at local level, that there are inherent dangers in that; at other times it is felt important that the strength of direction be shown by the Minister's involvement.  Generally, we would follow the line of the last speaker and express our satisfaction with the Minister's amended amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

      <P>Presumably Deputy Sherlock means, in regard to amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 26, that the reference to &ldquo;membership&rdquo; is designed to enable the Minister to appoint members to these committees.  That is not the case.  Appointments will be a matter for each health board.  The only role envisaged for the Minister is in setting down classes or types of persons or bodies from whom the membership should be drawn.  However, the Minister himself will not be involved in appointing members to the committee.  Therefore, I would be grateful if Deputy Sherlock would withdraw that amendment.</P>
      <P>The effect of amendment No. 2 to amendment No. 26 in the name of Deputy Sherlock would be to enable a health board or a child care advisory committee to consider any directions given by the Minister and, having considered them, ignore them.  I am not sure that that is what Deputy Sherlock intends but that would be the effect of his proposal. In view of that, I would also ask Deputy Sherlock to consider withdrawing amendment No. 2 to amendment No. 26.</P>

      <P>As regards the constitution of the local advisory committees, I want to be truthful and fair to the House and say that we have not given consideration to this area.

      <P>I refer briefly to my amendment No. 2 to amendment No. 26 and point out that I want to include the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; rather than the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;; that has been the case throughout Committee Stage.  I am very sceptical about the whole section we are now debating and the amendments.  I have good reason to be sceptical because of the position of the local advisory committees of health boards.  However, I will leave that aside for the moment.  If the relevant health boards will have the authority, is there anybody here who would say &mdash; whether on the Government or Opposition side of the House &mdash; that the health board or health board agencies are not eagerly awaiting the enactment of this Bill?  Of course they are, and once <Col N="1956" /> they are given the power under the provisions of this Bill they will be eagerly setting up their local advisory committees. I am very wary about the power the Minister will retain to direct the health boards to appoint members or indeed specify the other functions of the health boards.  With regard to the point made by Deputy Howlin, it is indeed more likely that henceforth demands will come from below rather than direction from above in this regard.  For example, it is estimated that, in the Southern Health Board area, the cost of implementing the provisions of this Bill could be as much as £2 million.  Does the Minister mean to tell me that that amount will be provided? I do not believe it will be.  I do not see any provision therefor.  I foresee quite clearly that the reins will be held very tightly by the Minister and his departmental officials.  That is why I feel strongly about the matter.  However, I am impressed that the Minister has said that he will not be appointing the members of such local advisory committees. Why then include the word &ldquo;membership&rdquo; in section 7 (5)?</P>

      <P>In page 8, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1957" />&ldquo;(7)  Each child care advisory committee shall have the following powers and functions:</P>
    <P>(a)  it will have access to all information relating to child care services in its area;</P>
    <P>(b)  it shall make recommendations in relation to the improvement of child care services to the child care authority;</P>

    <P>(g)  it shall draw attention to individual child cases as it sees fit and promote the development of child care services in its area.&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Where the Minister would be correct would be in accepting my proposals as outlined in my amendment No. 29, in which we have given the Minister a number of options to consider in relation to the powers and functions of the child care advisory committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it clear &mdash; so that there will not be a rehash of that discussion &mdash; I did not, and I am sure this House would <Col N="1958" /> not, envisage that the child care advisory committees would have an executive role to play in second-guessing the decisions of the child care advisory committees. Consistent with that is the need to have access to information, to have the necessary resources and back-up facilities to make a proper independent input into a review of the services, planning for the future of the services and to pass comment on individual cases if they were so concerned.  Therefore, what we are proposing is that initially they should have all the information, that they should make recommendations, consult and receive submissions from the voluntary organisations, produce annual reports of their own and submit their views and plans for the future along with a review of the needs of the children in their areas.</P>
    <P>If somebody is particularly concerned about the treatment of an individual case, he or she should be able to have it referred to the relevant child care advisory committee for further consideration.  It is not good enough that the Minister should state here that now he has conceded the question of minor matters of co-option and so forth everything is in order.  The only basis on which we could withdraw amendment No. 29 was if we heard the Minister's draft regulations.  It seems no thought has been given to these regulations. I thought the Minister said they had not gone that far down the road, that they were so busy they had not time to do the draft regulations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Excellent, because my views have not changed.  My views are very clear.  I propose we include the provisions in subsection (7) (a) to (g) in amendment No. 29.  I was reflecting on what Deputy Sherlock said &mdash; that we do <Col N="1959" /> not know how long these advisory committees will last &mdash; but I imagine if you were on the child care committee itself &mdash; namely the health board &mdash; and this advisory committee were causing all sorts of problems you might not be too keen to ratify some of the outgoing members.</P>
      <P>Since they will not have executive power, it is important that we confer on them an independence of role that gives them a useful function.  If they are to be merely a talking shop, purely a paper exercise observing the formalities of giving advice, then I fear they will lapse into irrelevance.  In the context of not having a national children's council and no annual report to the Dáil by the Minister of national child care services, this is the only watchdog for health boards. Therefore, we must take them seriously. We must not come to this House with blank sheets of paper, with no ideas.  We must come forward with positive suggestions, and these suggestions have the support of the Child Care Coalition and all the professionals and voluntary groups. I ask, therefore, that the House accept amendment No. 29.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. In the context of the final stages &mdash; and I am glad we are finally giving this legislation to the health boards, weak as it is &mdash; this section and the acceptance of this amendment is the last chance we have to give the Bill some strength.  At this stage the Bill is as significant for what is not in it as for what is in it.  Deputy Yates moving this amendment mentioned we have no national child care advisory board or authority, no local, separate authority with clear responsibility, but that we are tagging on additional responsibilities to already overburdened health boards.  This is the Cinderella of the services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only committees getting the Government sanction are the local advisory committees.  Despite the case argued by all the Opposition parties and all the voluntary bodies, the Government have turned their mind against everything <Col N="1960" /> else and this is all that remains to give the Bill teeth to fight for the development of the health services.  It was astonishing listening to the Minister today say that beyond the power to co-opt members he has given no furhter thought to what he is going to do with these committees.  I gather he is going to stun us all with his response.  I hope he will because it is extraordinary that, after ten years into the drafting of this legislation and two years into its consideration by this House, the Minister still does not know why he is giving himself powers or why he is establishing these committees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Yates' amendment should be accepted because it is absolutely essential that these committees have teeth, that they have access to information, as is suggested in the first part of the amendment, that they will have power to make recommendations to ensure that emphasis is laid on issues as they emerge, that policy directives are laid down and developed and that the voluntary organisations should be considered. We are asking here for annual reports at local level.  This begs the question why we should not have a national report, but if this is the only mechanism we have, let us make progress with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Plans for the future of the services in the area are absolutely essential and in the context of the amendment the group will be more committed and wholehearted. Other than that, we are leaving it to the community care section of the health board, who are over-stretched at the moment.  Health boards generally are over-stretched trying to develop and maintain existing services without taking on this area.  A strong child care committee is essential and it is a pity it is the only mechanism this legislation allows.  It is vital that they are given the power, support and direction from this House that would indicate that we are serious about this area, that the setting up of these committees is not intended as a sop, that they are not meant to be anonymous, private committees who meet and <Col N="1961" /> nobody will know about them.  We should provide powers and clear functions in the legislation to ensure that the expertise and commitment to child care among the many organisations who, I hope, will be represented on these committees are availed of to the greatest extent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The first utterance I made on Report Stage today was that this was a good Bill, and I believed that.  A great deal of important legislative provision is incorporated in it.  But it is not as good as it could be or as good as it should be at this stage of debate, when so much time and effort have been spent on it.</P>
      <P>Section 7 is one area that, unfortunately, is clearly wafer thin.  Listening to the Minister, one is inclined to come to the conclusion that local advisory committees were put in as a sop, that he did not want a national authority who would have a co-ordinating role, who would be a policy generator in their own right, who would draw up a bill of rights for children, who would have teeth and muscle and who would be listened to.</P>
      <P>To offset that and to have some sort of safety net, he decided to agree to have at least one local child care advisory committee in each health board area.  If you were going to depend on that as your safety net you would not expect it to have holes in it, but clearly the Minister's safety net is full of holes.  What he said on the section was basically that one committee should be established in each health board area, but he has flabbergasted most of us by saying that really he has not thought out what exactly they should do.  At this stage it seems a mite unusual, to put it at its kindest, that the only detailed suggestions before the House on the functions of a committee the Minister is recommending we establish are coming from the Opposition benches.  That is not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no difficulty supporting the amendment because I agree with its provisions, but I am disappointed that there is not a comprehensive ministerial amendment.  He was aware of the Opposition views on Committee Stage.  I am less than satisfied with the degree of reponse I <Col N="1962" /> got to the first series of queries I raised under the Minister's amendment No. 26, which I supported and welcomed.</P>
    <P>I really believe the committees that will be established now will be of much less worth than needs to be the case.  If we are to give them serious functions we should legislate accordingly.  Their role should be spelled out in clear terms in the core legislation and the Minister has already had adequate time to bring that about.  No doubt he will tell us that these functions will be spelled out in due course by way of regulations, but regulations are not legislation and are often used as a device to prevent Members of this House from questioning Ministers about legislation once it is enacted; for instance, on the Order of Business, one can ask about legislation but not about regulations that arise from legislation.  I would be much happier if there were a clear view from the Minister on the role, function, composition and powers of the child care advisory committees it is proposed to establish.  I would be a lot happier if their functions were spelled out in clear legislative terms and we could debate them here.  After all the time that has elapsed since we had a parallel discussion of this issue on Committee Stage, I deeply regret we have made little or no progress.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to remind the Minister of the extreme debate and the passionate requests which were made on Committee Stage on this section.  We came into the debate gravely disappointed that there was not to be a national children's council or child care authority, no overall umbrella group that would be seen as the standard bearer of the rights of children to maintain a certain standard.  I regret that Report Stage has to be squeezed in almost in Christmas week.  I am utterly disappointed because I felt that, given the length of time that has elapsed between Committee Stage and this Stage, things would have been considered and thought out and that we would have from the Minister an outline of the functions and role of the local advisory committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to see local committees that <Col N="1963" /> have vitality and energy and the initiative to make an impact so that people, wherever they are, will be able to make submissions or requests to them and use these committees at local level.  It is regrettable that we do not have stronger national umbrella groups.  What is promised is a pathetic entity.  It will be a poor, limp and sad thing unless the Minister can come in now and give us a commitment that he will put some muscle, drive and energy into these committees. Otherwise, this will be a rather sad part of this Bill and a very regrettable aspect of this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past two weeks I had the great learning experience of attending a conference set up by an alliance of child care workers and all the other agencies dealing with the inadequate support and services we give to our children.  I know other people sitting in this Chamber attended this meeting also.  It was packed with people who for years have coped in their own way, either on a voluntary or professional basis, with the whole area of child care and all its inadequacies, its lack of structure, investment and legislation.  It made us feel, with a fierce urgency, that none of us could sit comfortably through another session or another year unless we had some kind of central, consultative advisory body with teeth that would be listened to and whose members would join forces and, based on their joint experience, bring about the kind of child care services our children deserve.  That alliance consists of the Judiciary who deal with the difficulties and the deprivations of our children every day, right across to children and the people who foster them, whose expectations of this legislation are extraordinarily high.  If we do not give the powers to some committee to monitor and advise and, above all, have a real input into this legislation &mdash; and I join with my colleagues in saying this in the most non-party political way possible &mdash; we will be failing totally to deliver what all those agencies and all those people out there on the ground are expecting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1964" /> Within the confines of Report Stage in which he had to operate, I feel that Deputy Yates's amendment covers in a moderate way, without making huge demands, the basic needs of such a committee. If we do not empower this committee to use its expertise and monitor situations in an independent and autonomous way it will be useless.</P>
    <P>I want to put on record the grave disappointment reflected on this side of the House.  I agree with Deputy Howlin that this has the makings of a great Bill and the Minister and his officials have put so much work and time into it.</P>
    <P>This amendment is one of the most fundamental ways we can improve the Bill and give confidence to that alliance that was set up two weeks ago that it can work and that their agencies will have an input that will be taken seriously, that will not be just advisory, that will not be passed over, that will not be devalued and not listened to.</P>
    <P>My plea to the Minister is that he should accept this amendment.  It is not just recognising what we in this House are saying.  It is recognising what a vast alliance of the most committed people I know outside this House are involved in and desperately need.  It would give them a sense of acknowledgment of their expertise.  Above everything else, it would strengthen this Bill in a way they see as absolutely essential.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing this amendment in the context of a previous amendment from the Minister.  He gave a very positive response to some of our concerns.  We are very pleased that the Minister, in amendment No. 26, is taking positive action and that he will direct local health boards to set up committees by statute.  I have no doubt he will do that.  He talked about membership and powers of co-option.  It is incomprehensible that it will be up to the Opposition to prompt the Minister as regards the areas where these committees should function laying down guidelines, standing orders and so on.  I was surprised when the Minister said he had not really thought about these committees yet.  He said he and the Government are considering them.  He said he wants to deal with the Bill first and then he will consider the committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy checks the wording he will find that that is not exactly what I said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, that is what the Minister meant, but he will have an opportunity to spell out what he meant.  The Minister said he accepts the principle of the committees and that he will have power to direct that they be set up, but he has not yet thought about what they are going to do.  We want to make sure that they will not be talking shops but that they will have a fundamental input into child care and that they will have a role as laid down by this House. For that reason it is imperative that the Minister puts forward his ideas as quickly as possible.  Otherwise, it will fall to the Opposition to decide what we consider <Col N="1966" /> to be the various functions of these committees. That is a reasonable request to make to the Minister.</P>
      <P>If the functions of the committees are being set out in regulations Members will not be allowed to debate the matter.  We can only accept or reject the regulations in accordance with the proceedings of the House.  We cannot amend them or make any suggestions about them.  As in previous legislation, before the Minister brings the regulations before the House he might take the opportunity to consult with the Opposition parties.  That is what is proposed in this amendment.  If he does not agree to do that, it would be improper of us not to put the amendment.</P>
      <P>This also points out the important role we play on these committees.  We would have preferred a national children's council and other structures, even a children's ombudsman.  We would have welcomed a procedure where parents could appeal the decisions of health boards, but the next best thing is the statutory local committees and we would like their role to be defined.  I think the Minister is going to shock us with his response, and I am prepared to be shocked.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I will never shock anyone but perhaps I will be able to <Col N="1967" /> manoeuvre my way into things.  It is a pity that this is a total regurgitation of the amendment Deputy Yates put forward on Committee Stage when we had a long, arduous discussion on it.  Like myself, the Deputy is concerned with paragraph (g), which deals with specific cases and access to confidential information. The Deputy might reconsider this part of the amendment.</P>
      <P>Like all Deputies, I am concerned that the advisory committee would have a statutory role and that it would be an aid to the health boards, the Department and all involved in the child care structure. There has been no Child Cafe Bill since 1908 and the people involved in this area have worked very hard to anticipate the problems that have arisen.  There was no word of child sexual abuse or drugs in the twenties, but these people have moved with the times, and that is to their credit. It is a shame that the legislative process has not done likewise.  However, we hope in this legislation we will be as progressive as possible.</P>
      <P>I see merit in many parts of the amendment &mdash; such as paragraphs (a) and (c). Paragraph (e) refers to the submission of plans for the future of the service.  This comes under the review of services section. The advisory committee could make proposals to the health board for ratification and the review of the needs of children in local areas is very important. I know that the North-Western Health Board would have different problems from the Eastern Health Board or any other health board and that the problems in my area may not pertain to other parts of the country.  To an extent, we can try to have a uniform system but the needs are different in the different health board areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope Deputy Yates will reconsider the amendment.  I also hope the Minister will give teeth to the advisory committee. It would be unacceptable if, after a two year debate, the committee fell on their face.  I believe the Minister will take our views into account when making the regulations.  Perhaps some arrangement <Col N="1968" /> could be worked out between all sides so that the amendment could be accepted.</P>

      <P>As regards Deputy Yates' amendment in relation to local advisory committees, I have very little difficulty agreeing with most of the points he made; I believe they should be taken on board.  There are two points which may be unacceptable, and I think Deputy Yates realises this.  Paragraph (d) states: &ldquo;it shall make annual reports to the child care authority&rdquo;, but since there will be no child care authority that point falls. Paragraph (g) states: &ldquo;it shall draw attention to individual child cases as it sees fit&rdquo;.  Is this a good idea?</P>
      <P>I would like Deputy Yates to tease out the implications of this.  Are child cases, families, or the role of social workers and professional officers dealing with these cases to be discussed in public?  This may be acceptable in a large urban area but when dealing with cases in, say, the town of Wexford, will the committee sit in public?</P>

      <P>I was winding up on what I had to say on this Bill in relation to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution and I touched on the attitude of Fine Gael in relation to that.  The change in attitude of the Fine Gael Party is amazing in view of what was contained in <i>The Irish Times</i> 16 days after the decision in the McGimpsey case when there was an indication from the spokesman on behalf of the then Leader of Fine Gael that there would be no change in Articles 2 or 3 or in the Constitution in isolation.  That rubbishes the argument made by Deputy Barry both in this House and in a letter written to <i>The Irish Times</i> where he endeavoured to say that the change in attitude was as a result of the McGimpsey case.  Subsequent to that decision the Fine Gael attitude in relation to Articles 2 and 3 had not changed.  It is because there was a change in leadership in Fine Gael and because Deputy Bruton articulated his views in a personal capacity subsequent to the McGimpsey case that the change in attitude occurred.</P>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Bruton is present because I managed to find his speech to the rally in Galway last weekend.  It is an amazing speech in view of Fine Gael's attitude through the years.  It was not given the publicity it deserved.</P>

      <P>The Deputy went on to say that both communities should stop looking over their shoulders to Dublin and to London.  I said earlier that the Nationalists in the North look to Dublin. <Col N="1971" /> They do not look to the Six County state and they most certainly do not look to the British Government.  That is one of the reasons the intergovernmental conference which started as a result of the relationship between Deputy Haughey and Mrs. Thatcher in 1980, was set up. It was to enable the Dublin Government to articulate the views and aspirations of the Nationalist community.</P>
      <P>I draw Fine Gael's attention to a very critical editorial directed both at Deputies Bruton and Barry in the <i>Irish News</i> arising out of comments made by them which stated:</P>
      <P>He and Mr. Bruton have moral responsibilities to help bring about lasting peace.  Instead they appear to want to wash their hands of Northern Ireland and hope that it will float off into the Irish Sea....</P>

      <P>Deputy Spring is not present but I was astounded by his contribution.  The reality is sinking in, particularly after some of the media comment over the weekend, and I hope it will sink in on the far side of the House that this will not succeed.  It is important that bad signals do not go out from this House in relation to Articles 2 and 3 which would give the Unionists another idea to latch on to if they have not already done so&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Roche dealt comprehensively with Deputy Byrne's party and I do not intend to add to it, even though I could because of personal knowledge of their previous records.  The Labour Party have done a massive U-turn in relation to this.  They are going against their speeches in the Seanad last March on Articles 2 and 3 and they are also going against the spirit of a motion passed at their 1989 Labour Party conference which specifically rejected a resolution calling for a referendum on Articles 2 and 3.  Therefore, the Parliamentary Labour Party are flouting the wishes of the Labour Party conference for the purposes of political opportunism.  Indeed, on 21 March last Labour Senators savaged the proposal. Senator Upton stated:</P>
      <P>What is being proposed in this motion is a once-off business, it is not part of any package, it is not part of any initiative aimed at bringing peace to the North.  It is piecemeal; it is taken in isolation... I believe that such a debate would polarise the country in a manner that would be divisive and acrimonious.  That is the last thing this country needs at this time...  It would be disastrous to hold a referendum now without having that as part of an overall package...</P>
      <P>Senator Costello said that the motion diverted attention from the real work of bridge-building.  It is an amazing turnaround for The Labour Party to now say that they will unanimously support the Bill.</P>
      <P>Article 2 of the Constitution of The Labour party says: &ldquo;The Labour Party affirms that the national territory consists of the whole island of Ireland, its islands and territorial seas, and it accepts as part of its immediate programme the work of securing social justice and equal opportunities for all citizens...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Spring's speech was probably relevant to the fact that one of his recently acquired members objected to <Col N="1973" /> their previous attitude in support of non-alteration of Articles 2 and 3.  I understand that Deputy Kemmy put the gun to Deputy Spring's head in relation to this Bill and said that if the Labour Party did not support it he would leave the party. That would have had a disastrous effect on The Labour Party.  There is no Labour Deputy here at present but perhaps one of their members would like to comment on that in his next speech to the House.</P>
    <P>My main concern in regard to the proposal is that it is glib and a piece of fashionable gimmickry for the purpose of grabbing headlines and putting the Government on the spot.  If, as Deputy De Rossa said, he does not want to drive a wedge between the two government parties, why did he not consult the government parties beforehand &mdash; particularly the main government party &mdash; and let them know what he had in mind in relation to this?  As far as I am aware, it was not discussed between the two parties.</P>

      <P>If the Provisional IRA were not murdering Protestants for no other reason than that they are Protestants, we would not be talking about Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution. If there was peace on this island it would be considered a mere cosmetic exercise to talk about these Articles.  If there was peace the Unionists would have no more than an academic interest in the matter.  The Bill would then be seen as the tidying up of archaic legislation rather than as a matter of life or death, and it is a matter of life or death.</P>
      <P>The fact is &mdash; and the Taoiseach cannot deny this &mdash; that the Provisional IRA defend their murders by reference to the so-called national struggle.  These Articles of our Constitution define this nation in a way that gives a spurious justification to what the IRA do towards the objective of &ldquo;reintegrating the national territory&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach's reference to Article 29 of the Constitution does not overcome this difficulty.  Article 29 affirms the adherence of this State to &ldquo;the principle of the pacific settlement of international disputes by international arbitration or judicial determination&rdquo;.  Note the word &ldquo;international&rdquo; in this Article.  Article 2 of the Constitution, however, says very clearly that the national territory consists of the whole island of Ireland so, within the terms of the 1937 Constitution, matters concerning Northern Ireland are national matters, not international matters. I contend that the words, therefore, of Article 29 about specific resolution of disputes do not apply as far as the Constitution is concerned to Northern <Col N="1975" /> Ireland in the present wording of the Constitution.  That is why I am strongly of the view that the people of this State should charge the wording of the Constitution so as to deny all excuses to the Provisional IRA.  We should do this ourselves and for our own sake, not as a bargaining tactic with Unionists or anyone else.</P>

      <P>I strongly believe that the content of our Constitution is not something to be bartered in the manner of a huckster.  We should have a Constitution that states our own beliefs about peace, consent and human rights.  We should have it because it is right in itself, not because of some deal we have made &mdash; or might make in the future &mdash; with someone else.</P>
      <P>The Provisional IRA have rendered one service &mdash; and one service only &mdash; to the Irish people, they have torn away the veil.  They have shown the ultimate reality of territorial nationalism, a nationalism which places a higher value on natural physical boundaries, seas, islands and rivers than it puts on the wishes of the people who live within those boundaries.  The ultimate reality of an imposed territorial unity has been shown to us by the Provisionals for what it really is, the face of fascism, the killing fields.</P>
      <P>Ireland under the Provisional IRA would be an island of prison camps and jails, of secret police and of cleansing pogroms.  This is no exaggeration.  One detail in their political programme that came to light due to the discovery of some internal documents some time ago is that the Provisionals intend &mdash; on seizing power &mdash; to impound all passports of Irish citizens.  One could not leave the country without the permission of Gerry Adams. That is the world of Hitler, Stalin and Pol Pot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has become acceptable to refer to the existence of two traditions &mdash; to use the word of the Forum and the Anglo-Irish Agreement &mdash; two &ldquo;identities&rdquo; on this island.  It is worth noting that a few <Col N="1976" /> years ago this recognition might not have been acceptable.  Given, therefore, that there are two identities, given also that we will soon have political unity in Europe as a whole and given that Europe is moving away from the sole concept of nation states and embracing new concepts of federalism and devolution, why should our Constitution continue to stick so rigidly to the concept of the unitary nation state standing alone before the world without reference to any other entities or ways of arranging affairs among its people?  That concept of a nation state, of territorial reunification of nations, was a lot more fashionable in the Europe of 1937 than in the Europe of 1991.  The theory of the territorial imperative to unity so fashionable in 1937 led to a disastrous result just two years later when applied to the case of the free city of Danzig in September 1939.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the Supreme Court in a 1976 judgment on Articles 2 and 3 pointed out that political theories or doctrines have evolved a lot since those articles were first drafted in 1937 drawing, indeed, a great deal from the sad and tragic experiences of Europe in the intervening period.  The Supreme Court in 1976 identified a political doctrine of the thirties as lying behind Articles 2 and 3, namely the doctrine that a &ldquo;nation, as distinct from a state, had rights&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;that a nation has a right to unity of territory in some form&rdquo; and that &ldquo;this national right to unity was superior to positive law&rdquo;.  Thus, in recognising these doctrines of the thirties as underlying Articles 2 and 3, the Supreme Court implicitly recognised in 1976 that those doctrines were then out of date.  If the Supreme Court could see this in 1976, surely it is not too early for the Dáil to recognise it in 1990.  It is fair to point out, however unpalatable it may be to all of us to recall, that the boundary agreement of 1925 was a treaty recognised and registered with the League of Nations, a body of which Mr. de Valera went on to be a distinguished president afterwards, just as the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985 was in its time registered with the United Nations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1977" /> The Taoiseach sought to justify these articles in our Constitution by reference to Article 1 of the German basic law, which says that &ldquo;the entire German people are called upon to achieve, in freeself-determination, the unity and freedom of Germany&rdquo;.  The Taoiseach says that these Articles led to the peaceful reunification of East and West Germany. They did, but only because a majority in East Germany voted first that that should happen, not because of the words in the basic law.  This is not the present case in Northern Ireland.  Article 1 of the German basic law would not be seen in such a benign light by the Taoiseach or by anyone else if instead of being used to justify and underpin the reunification of East and West Germany, it had been used to impose unification with Germany of that portion of Polish Silesia now occupied by a large German minority as distinct from majority as in East Germany. Indeed, the Poles accepted German unification only when Germany had first renounced all claims beyond the Oder-Niesse line.  The Taoiseach might look at this modern parallel with Poland, and their attitude in that matter <i>vis-à-vis</i> Silesia, to see if it helps him &mdash; and he might have more empathy with the Poles than with the Northern Unionists &mdash; to understand Unionist worries about Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution at this time.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Taoiseach and the House to consider how we would have reacted if we were faced for the past 70 years with a substantial minority who did not accept the legitimacy of our State, who looked to Northern Ireland as their political home while a minority among them supported a terrorist campaign designed to overthrow our Government in Dublin.  If that had been our experience over the last 70 years, how kindly would we look at a claim in the Constitution of Northern Ireland of a right to govern the whole island?  Would we shrug it off as mere words on paper?  Would we rush to make concessions in order to cajole the Northern Ireland Government into removing the Articles?  If we are to make progress in politics we must try to put ourselves into the minds of our <Col N="1978" /> adversaries and into the minds of those with whom we do not agree.  Anything else is mere rhetoric.</P>
    <P>Deputy Spring disappointed me when he said, on behalf of the Labour Party, that concessions on so fundamental a symbol as Articles 2 and 3 deserved to be part of a process of give and take to put it at the very mildest.  Deputy Spring even allowed himself to wonder if there was any guarantee that the Unionists would respond positively.  Of course there is no guarantee.  A person would never do any of the worthwhile things in life if he waited for a guarantee of that kind in advance.  It is up to us as citizens of a mature well-established State, sure in our democratic traditions, confident of our independent place in Europe, to take the first step.  We should not wait for the Unionists, who have no State of their own, who are a frightened and beleagured minority within this island, and equally importantly, if not more importantly, a frightened and beleagured minority within the United Kingdom.  We should take the first step.  The reason that so little progress has been made in Northern Ireland over so many years is that the strong have always waited on the weak to make the first concession.  If we persist in that course Deputy Spring will be an old man before any progress is made.</P>
    <P>Another concern repeatedly voiced by Deputy Spring, which I do not understand is that the present Bill would give a veto to Unionists in the Constitution.  The Deputy seemed to argue that such a veto is all right in the Anglo-Irish Agreement where it could be changed but that it is not all right in the Constitution where it could not so easily be changed.  Why this distinction?  I would have thought that a majority in Northern Ireland have an actual veto on unity anyway, unless of course Deputy Spring or others have some unstated intention in unstated circumstances of somehow coercing them into a united Ireland.  I do not believe that that would ever be Deputy Spring's view.  Therefore, I do not understand his <Col N="1979" /> worry about a Unionist veto in this context. Unless we or the British are prepared to contemplate coercion the Unionists already have and continue to have a veto on unity, so why be so upset about putting that fact into the Constitution? That is a fact and we should in the debates in this House have the courage to recognise facts for what they are.</P>
    <P>This is a negative point.  Indeed, this whole debate is rather negative.  We are talking about removing things.  Let us talk instead about the positive business of building peace on this island.  Peace will only come when people feel secure. Changing Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution can go a long way towards making Unionists feel secure.  The Anglo-Irish Agreement, however much Unionists may complain about it, was equally absolutely necessary to give Northern Nationalists an equivalent sense of security.  There is a lot more that can be done to make all sides feel more secure in the future than they do now.</P>
    <P>Let me set out, in the time that remains to me, a balanced programme to bring peace to our island, peace based on what is actually possible.  That, if I may say so as the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, was the great genius of those men who put their names to the Treaty of 1921, the vision to see what was staight in front of them rather than some distant dream. Having first lifted the siege of Northern Ireland posed by Articles 2 and 3, we should then pursue the following five-point programme for peace on this island.</P>
    <P>The first point would be an immediate change in Unionist attitudes to executive powersharing.  At the constitutional convention some years ago the SDLP rightly demanded full powersharing, saying that they represented a community which had been discriminated against for 50 years. If they were to support the existing institutions it was not enough to be a permanent minority on parliamentary committees, even if they held the chair of some of those committees; they had to be at the inner councils where the final decisions were to be made.  The Unionists <Col N="1980" /> tried to counter this by saying it was contrary to the British system of Cabinet Government.</P>
    <P>The SDLP countered that argument by saying that even that system contemplated a form of national Government involving all parties to deal with war or other national crises, as had actually happened during both World Wars in Britain.  The SDLP claimed, rightly to my mind, that there was such a crisis, which continues to exist, in Northern Ireland. When the Unionists rejected that SDLP argument, the constitutional convention collapsed.  The Unionists must &mdash; I repeat must &mdash; change their position on this matter of executive powersharing.  It is a key to further progress.</P>
    <P>The second point would be a European guarantee of minority political rights, of the right to a fair trial, and of the fairness and effectiveness &mdash; which is equally important &mdash; of extradition procedures. European law, whether emanating from the European Community or from the Council of Europe, can provide a more acceptable way of solving difficult problems than simple bilateral arrangements between Ireland and Britain, which can become fraught with unnecessary emotions and suspicions on both sides. Indeed, I would like to see the European Convention on Human Rights incorporated into the domestic law of both Ireland and Britain.</P>
    <P>The third point would be a massive investment in job creation targeted at the ghettoes of West Belfast, at both Protestant and Catholic pockets of prejudice and fear, where terrorism feeds on unemployment.  The object of this exercise should be to see that no young man or woman from, say, Andersonstown or Poleglass should be out of a job if he or she is willing to work.  Nothing would do more to dry up the waters in which the provisional IRA piranha swim than full employment in west Belfast.</P>
    <P>The fourth point would involve a general release of a large number of long sentence prisoners, and short sentence detainees, where, in the view of competent authorities such as police, clergymen and parole officers, the likelihood <Col N="1981" /> is that those released will not return to political terrorism.  In particular there should be widespread releases this Christmas of young detainees.  The fact is that there are too many prisoners serving sentences in Northern Ireland to allow the local communities to assert control over the paramilitaries in the areas from which those prisoners originate.  Nothing would do more to demoralise the Provisional IRA than the loss of the relatives' support groups and the loss of the internal discipline that they themselves exercise over prisoners still in jail.  This is the view of observers such as Fr. Denis Faul, an acute commentator and a most courageous participant in the affairs of Northern Ireland.  What gives his view, in favour of large-scale releases, such cogency is the fact that he is the most relentless opponent of the Provisional IRA.</P>
    <P>The fifth point would be a reappraisal by Nationalists and Unionists of their positions whereby Nationalists would stop looking over their shoulders down to Dublin, and the Unionists looking over their shoulders to Westminister, There is no way that either the SDLP or the Unionist parties can grow to full maturity as long as they see themselves, in any sense, as dependent on outside support.</P>
    <P>Let me conclude by saying a few words about the Bill before us.  I support it because this House must open up this question of Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution.</P>
    <P>I have, however, some major technical objections to this Bill.  It contains not one but two consent clauses: one in Article 2 and another in Article 3.  Regrettably these two clauses are inconsistent with one another; the first refers to the &ldquo;consent of the majority of the people of Northern Ireland&rdquo;, and the second merely refers to &ldquo;consent&rdquo;&mdash; on its own &mdash; without any qualification and in a sentence in which there is reference both to the &ldquo;people of the state&rdquo; and to the &ldquo;people of Ireland&rdquo;.  This sort of confusion suggests that insufficient care was taken in drafting the Bill.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding that, this Bill should pass its Second Stage, but a great deal of <Col N="1982" /> work needs to be done before it can be presented to the people.  I am sure the authors probably acknowledge that.  We would first need a White Paper which would tell the electorate, in terms such as I have used, of the need for a change, would give a clear wording of the new Articles &mdash; and there is obviously room for improvement so far as this Bill is concerned &mdash; would guarantee the continued protection of those who need it through the continuance of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, and would, as do the Preambles to both the 1937 and the Free State Constitutions, underline our desire &mdash; and we are entitled to that &mdash; for the unity of our country.</P>
    <P>Against this background we could then proceed to build a structure of peace on this island and, equally importantly, we could finally come to terms with the existence and the legitimacy of our own State, as no mere provisional entity under the Constitution but as a State with 70 years of proud and permanent achievement to its name.</P>

      <P>Many people must be asking themselves why this Bill has been introduced at this particular time.  That is certainly a question that has occurred to me and I confess that, despite several days of debate, I am no wiser as to the answer.</P>
      <P>Some people see political opportunism as the motive that has caused this Bill to be introduced.  I hope that is not the case. If it were true, I would say in the strongest possible terms that this is the last issue which should be used to score political points or make capital out of.  The people of the North have enough to put up with, they have had enough deaths and suffering to be spared at least that fate and we down here in the South would do well to bear that in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even if the Bill was inspired by worthy <Col N="1983" /> motives, such as a desire to contribute something to solving the Northern problem &mdash; even then, I am convinced that its introduction was misguided and the potential for harm very great.  Can Deputies who have followed events in Northern Ireland over the past 20 years really believe that an isolated, unilateral action such as this will solve the problem? Can they seriously believe that it is as simple as that?  Surely it is plain by now that the problems of our island, and of our relationship with Britain, are complex matters that require a considered, coherent approach and not half thought-out measures?</P>
    <P>I believe very strongly that there is no &ldquo;quick fix&rdquo; solution to the problem of Northern Ireland.  Some Deputies in the debate have given the impression that the amendment of Articles 2 and 3 would have some kind of magical effect on attitudes in the North and on Anglo-Irish relations.  I sincerely believe they are deceiving themselves.  Worse, what they propose would send out a completely misleading signal at a time when negotiations are under way about the three sets of relationships in this island and between Ireland and Britain.  Whatever the intentions of those proposing it, the Bill is ill-conceived and ill-timed.  As the Taoiseach said here last week:</P>
    <P>The proposals in this Bill are superfluous and unnecessary, if not constitutionally offensive, and could upset the broad consensus here on Northern Ireland that has existed since the New Ireland Forum; and they could send signals of despair to many constitutional nationalists whose hopes and aspirations some here are inclined to overlook on occasions like this.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I believe that Dáil Éireann should reject the Bill.</P>
    <P>I was interested to note from the debate that some of the Bill's supporters themselves have doubts about its content and timing.  Deputy Dick Spring made an interesting contribution last week in which he said &ldquo;perhaps the timing and the changes proposed are not appropriate <Col N="1984" /> to the time&rdquo;.  He also said that if Article 3 were amended as proposed we could end up with &ldquo;a new Article which comprises a mix of political aspiration and a legally vague statement which limits the jurisdiction we claim.  He went on to say in trying to find a solution we may end up with a more difficult problem&rdquo;.  He also warned that the way the Bill was worded could be seen as &ldquo;writing a Unionist veto into our Constitution&rdquo;.  I only wish that the Deputy would follow the logic of his arguments to their obvious conclusion and withdraw his party's support for the Bill.</P>
    <P>There was much in Deputy Spring's speech I could agree with but I cannot accept his contention that the Government have not been keeping the political parties down here informed of what they are doing in the field of Anglo-Irish affairs.  The Taoiseach, I and other Ministers have reported regularly to this House on important developments and we have every intention of doing so in the future.  I cannot agree that there is any comparison with Mr. Brooke's consultations with the political parties in the North, which is a different exercise altogether.</P>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish Agreement is the framework for Anglo-Irish co-operation in relation to Northern Ireland.  Deputies are familiar with the provisions of the Agreement so I will not labour the point here but perhaps I may say a few words about the way the Agreement works in practice.  As Joint Chairman of the Intergovernmental Conference, I participate in meetings which are held on a frequent basis &mdash; usually once a month.  A wide range of subjects is discussed at Conference meetings and these are pursued between Conference meetings by officials on a continuous basis.  The subjects dealt with have a direct relevance to the day-to-day lives of the people of Northern Ireland; they include the issue of confidence of the community in the security forces, economic co-operation, the administration of justice and security co-operation. What strikes me and other Ministers who are involved in the process, such as my colleague the Minister <Col N="1985" /> for Justice, is how wide-ranging and important are the issues we deal with.</P>
    <P>Last month saw the fifth anniversary of the Agreement.  Over the period of its existence, the Agreement has brought important changes and reforms in Northern Ireland including new and strong fair employment legislation and more impartial policing of marches.  The International Fund for Ireland, established in conjunction with the Agreement, has been doing good work.  However, there is still a great deal to be done on the agenda set by the Agreement; and we want to see further progress in the period ahead on a range of issues of great importance to the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Over the past year the Irish and British Governments, in an effort to achieve political progress, have been willing to consider new arrangements or structures which would transcend the present Anglo-Irish Agreement.  Any such new arrangement, which would be arrived at through direct discussion and negotiation between all of the parties concerned, would need to give expression to the three relationships concerned &mdash; between the communities in Northern Ireland; between North and South in the island of Ireland, and between Britain and Ireland.  Efforts are being made to find a framework for such talks.  In this regard we believe in particular that the framework must adequately reflect the reality that these three relationships are interlinked.</P>
    <P>This is the position as it stands and we shall be continuing to pursue our objectives in the time ahead with the aim of finding a lasting settlement to the problems that face us on this island. nobody can be in doubt as to the magnitude of the task or the difficulty of attaining success, but I have no doubt that it is through following the policies that I have just outlined that we have the best chance of making progress.  To go down the kind of by-road which this Bill opens up would be totally unproductive, in my view.  It is the worst of timing, to <Col N="1986" /> put it no stronger, to put forward proposals for the amendment of our Constitution at a time when negotiations are at such a delicate stage.  It is bound to confuse the issue and send the wrong signal to both communities in the North.</P>
    <P>It has been argued in some quarters that the Government, in refusing to support the Bill, are displaying inflexibility and an unwillingness to countenance change.  I reject that charge and call to witness our record on the Brooke initiative as evidence of our willingness to be flexible.  In the discussions about finding a way to get talks off the ground, the Government and the SDLP have at all times shown a willingness to compromise. We have gone out of our way to try to accommodate the conditions the Unionists have laid down, only for them to come up with new preconditions. Nevertheless, realising what is at stake, we have continued in our efforts to find a basis for talks.  Neither do we rule out the possibility that a situation could exist one day where entirely new political arrangements would be discussed for this island, nor that Articles 2 and 3 could not be looked at in the context of such new arrangements.  We have repeatedly said that new arrangements or structures which might be agreed for Ireland as a whole would require a new Constitution.  But that is the context in which to consider change, not in the piecemeal, ill-considered way this Bill favours.</P>
    <P>One must ask what would be the likely result if this Bill were to be passed.  The strong likelihood is that, far from promoting reconciliation, it would cause discord and division both in Northern Ireland and here in the South.  Much has been made of the effect that amending Articles 2 and 3 could have on Unionist sensitivities.  This Government are not in the least lacking in their appreciation of the need to respect Unionist sensitivities; we have repeatedly made clear our readiness to enter into dialogue with their leaders.  But we must also have regard to Nationalist sensitivities and these cannot take second place to the obligations we owe others.  We owe it to Northern Nationalists, who have had to put up with <Col N="1987" /> so much over the past 70 years, to leave no doubt of the value we place on what they have achieved and what they aspire to.  They have pursued the Nationalist ideal, by purely constitutional means, and have rejected the men of violence. They deserve better than to be told now that we no longer want a Constitution that gives full expression to the Nationalist ideal.</P>
    <P>What could we expect down here if so charged an issue were put to a referendum? Would it not inevitably result in a divisive and sterile debate?  Perhaps the gravest charge that has been made by supporters of the Bill is that Articles 2 and 3 can be interpreted as justifying the use of violence in pursuit of a United Ireland.  The Taoiseach addressed this point when he spoke here last week, and I would like to repeat what he said:</P>
    <P>I utterly and totally reject the view that our legitimate democratic claim to unity can be construed by any reasonable person as a justification for using violence.  There is absolutely nothing in the Constitution which can in any way justify the continuation of the campaign of violence being conducted by the IRA.  In fact, those who follow the path of violence are making a travesty of the heritage of this country and our conduct since we gained independence, as well as denying totally the fundamental democratic principles enshrined in our Constitution.</P>
    <P>Articles 2 and 3 do not imply any aggressive territorial intent; on the contrary, the Constitution makes it abundantly clear, in Article 29, paragraphs 1 and 2, that Ireland is devoted to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation and that it adheres to the principles of the pacific settlement of disputes.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have adhered faithfully to these principles with the result that Ireland is recognised throughout the world as being committed to the cause of peace and co-operation.  We have been a staunch member of the United Nations for many years and have held firm to the principles set out in the <Col N="1988" /> Charter of that organisation.  Our soldiers have earned the highest reputation serving the cause of peace in many lands on the United Nations behalf.  We fully support the principles set out in the Helsinki Final Act of 1975, recently reaffirmed by the Charter of Paris.</P>
    <P>Our commitment to co-operation and the peaceful settlement of disputes is there for all to see.  The same certainly cannot be said for the men of violence. Do the supporters of this Bill imagine that the IRA, who have not the least regard for our laws or our democratic process, will be persuaded that it represents a fundamental change and that their cause is lost?  Would it not be far more likely that they would see it as a justification for the use of force and for pursuing their own futile agenda?</P>
    <P>Articles 2 and 3 are central provisions of our Constitution, which has been in existence for 50 years, and there is a heavy onus on those who seek to alter them to demonstrate that the case for amendment is persuasive.  I believe that the proposers and supporters of the Bill have failed to do this.  Similarly, I do not believe that there is anything in our present Constitution which could obstruct our working towards a peaceful solution with all sides in Northern Ireland.  This Bill is a diversion and an irrelevancy at a time when serious efforts are being made to move the political process forward.  I reject the political opportunism which lies behind the Bill, and I believe the House should firmly reject the Bill itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I was a member of the Committee on the Constitution who reported in December 1967.  They suggested at paragraph 12 on page 5 of the Final Report a new provision to replace Article 3:</P>
      <P>1.  The Irish nation hereby proclaims its firm will that its territory be reunited in harmony and brotherly affection between all Irishmen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.  The Laws enacted by the Parliament established by this Constitution shall, until the achievement <Col N="1989" /> of the Nation's unity shall otherwise require, have the like area and extent of application as the Laws of Parliament which existed prior to the adoption of this Constitution.  Provision may be made by Law to give extra-territorial effect to such Laws.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that so many good and great people were members of that committee.  Unfortunately and tragically, some have now passed to their reward elsewhere.  The chairman of the committee was the late George Colley, while the membership included James Dooge, Seán Dunne, Denis F. Jones, Seán Lemass, Robert M. Molloy, Michael O'Kennedy, Thomas F. O'Higgins, Eoin Ryan, Gerard Sweetman, James Tully and, as I have already pointed out, mé féin.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 2 of the final Report of the informal Committee on the Constitution stated:</P>
    <P>It was agreed between the political parties that participation in this Committee would involve no obligation to support any recommendations which might be made, even if made unanimously. It was also agreed that the members of the Committee, either as individuals or as party representatives, would not be regarded as committed in any way to report such recommendations.</P>
    <P>It is important to recall that the committee reported on 14 December 1967 and that the troubles began in the North during the period 1967-70 in the real sense.  The deliberations of the committee were held at a time when it could not have been anticipated that in the period from 1970 to 1990 thousands of ordinary decent citizens in the North, and indeed the South, including members of the British Defence Forces, the RUC, the Garda Síochána and our own Defence Forces, would be dead 20 years later and many thousands of people would be seriously injured arising from the ongoing conflict which afflicts that part of this green island of ours.  I now realise, having been a member of that committee, that <Col N="1990" /> what was good for 1967 may not necessarily be good for 1990.</P>
    <P>Article 29 of the Constitution, which deals specifically with international relations and peace, states:</P>
    <P>1.  Ireland affirms its devotion to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation amongst nations founded on international justice and morality.</P>
    <P>2.  Ireland affirms its adherence to the principle of the pacific settlement of international disputes by international arbitration or judicial determination.</P>
    <P>3.  Ireland accepts the generally recognised principles of international law as its rule of conduct in its relations with other States.</P>
    <P>The reason I quote Article 29 of the Constitution is that I wish to indicate that the aspirations for national unity are based on a wish that the ongoing problems in that regard be resolved by peaceful means and that the existing Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution present a threat to no one except to those who wish to see a threat contained in them.</P>
    <P>I was also a member of the New Ireland Forum who reported on 2 May 1984.  The preface to Chapter 1 states:</P>
    <P>1.1  The New Ireland Forum was established for consultations on the manner in which lasting peace and stability could be achieved in a new Ireland through the democratic process and to report on possible new structures and processes through which this objective might be achieved.</P>
    <P>1.2  Participation in the Forum was open to all democratic parties which reject violence and which have members elected or appointed to either House of the Oireachtas or the Northern Ireland Assembly.</P>
    <P>Four political parties took part in the Forum: the Fianna Fáil Party, the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and the legitimate and democratic representatives of the Nationalist population in the North, the SDLP.  Unfortunately, the <Col N="1991" /> Unionists were not represented at the New Ireland Forum.  Evidence was given to the committee by the brothers Christopher and Michael McGimpsey but the point that should be made is that none of the Unionists parties was represented at the New Ireland Forum despite a clear invitation to them to participate.</P>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish Agreement in Article 1.a. affirms that any change in the status of Northern Ireland would come about only with the consent of the majority of the people of Northern Ireland, in Article 1.b. recognises that the present wish of the majority of the people of Northern Ireland is for no change in the status of Northern Ireland and in Article 1.c. declares that if in the future a majority of the people of Northern Ireland clearly wish for and formally consent to the establishment of a united Ireland, they will introduce and support legislation to give effect to that wish.  Again, a clear view is expressed in Article 1 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement that a solution to the Irish problem be brought about by consent and by peaceful means.  Despite the dreadful efforts of the so-called IRA and the extreme Orange organisations, who seek to bomb and maim people into a united Ireland or who seek the continuation of the union with Britain, at all times the democratically elected Parliament in this community, and in that community, have indicated that they do not wish the solution to the problems of the unity of this island to be brought about by violence.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Foreign Affairs has indicated, piecemeal tinkering with the Constitution is no answer to the problem. One of the answers to the problem is discussion of the totality of relationships within and without this island.  Then we can take a look at Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution within a new agreement or a new Constitution.  A legitimate aspiration to unity in Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution is not unreasonable.  I do not see such aspiration as either aggressive or offensive.  In the present atmosphere if <Col N="1992" /> we delete Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution we may well be handing over the question of unity to the IRA, who consider themselves to be the only true upholders of the principle of unity.</P>
    <P>Yesterday in the Seanad Chamber the leaders of all the main Opposition parties indicated that it was unfortunate that the Anglo-Irish parliamentary tier did not have among its members those of the Unionist tradition north of the Border and that, to this day, there remain two empty seats in that assembly, of which I also happen to be a member.  No later than this very afternoon there was strong wish expressed by members of the British side of the parliamentary tier, and the Irish side, north and south of the Border &mdash; on the part of those present &mdash; to have the Unionists there, to have them before us, have them with us, that they be part of us.  Indeed the Taoiseach's often repeated invitation to the Unionists to meet him is unconditional and remains on the table; it is still there.  There is now an opportunity for them to take up that invitation.  They cannot live for ever in the past, in their hope that the past will represent them in the future.  Change must come about.  They must face up to that reality.  I believe that opportunity is now open to them.  Again, returning to what the Minister for Foreign Affairs said, if the Brooke initiative is successful in the context of talk about talks, then what we seek to achieve is sitting down, eyebal to eyeball, with the Unionist tradition of the northern part of this island. That will bring about a real solution to the problems.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Leader of the Labour Party, for whom I have very high regard, when he says that the Bill before the House was badly timed.  He also questioned the political judgment of its proposers.  But that is where I part company with him because he makes these reasonable comments but says, on the other hand, he will support the Bill.  Of course that is his democratic entitlement but it leaves me with a sense of suspended ambiguity.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that the leader of The <Col N="1993" /> Workers' Party should take the opportunity of going to Belfast to criticise the Fianna Fáil position on the Bill, and the Taoiseach in particular.  There is nothing I would like to see more than an all-Ireland Assembly with Unionists sitting opposite the Fianna Fáil Party, the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and The Workers' Party, together with the Nationalist parties, all represented.  If we do not talk, how can we achieve solutions to the problems daily confronting us, more particularly those presented by the men of violence?  If we do not fill the vacuum then it will be filled by those who seek to achieve their ends by force rather than by peaceful means.  That is one of the real difficulties confronting this island at present.</P>
    <P>The Unionist politicians should sit down with politicians from the Nationalist tradition on the one hand &mdash; that is in the North-North talks, then the North-South talks, and finally the third leg of the treble, as it were, the United Kingdom-Ireland talks.  I find it very difficult to understand why they consider us a threat to them, or why, when they are invited to sit down to talk unconditionally they cannot do so.  They cannot see that we do not represent a threat to them or do not seek to intimidate them.</P>
    <P>The Government have been trying for almost a year to get the Unionists into these discussions without any result.  Can we repeat incessantly that we do not intend to represent any threat to Unionism, that all we wish to do is to talk to them with a view to setting out a process, an agenda, for the future development of this island in a democratic fashion?  That is why I believe the Bill before the House and its intent will not achieve its purpose, that it is badly timed and unfortunate. In the circumstances, the unconditional abandonment of Articles 2 and 3 must be rejected at this time.</P>
    <P>The IRA have no mandate whatsoever for their actions.  They have continued to treat with contempt the Easter Proclamation which urged those served the Republic not to dishonour its cause by cowardice, inhumanity or rapine.  A small group of terrorists who have the gall to <Col N="1994" /> call themselves the IRA have hijacked the names of those who fought from 1916 to 1921.  We have allowed them to do so by referring to them as such in the media and even in the Houses of the Oireachtas. The revisionists, the merchants of the new enlightenment, might also remember that some of us in this House would be dishonouring the memories of our fathers and mothers were we to disown the War of Independence as suggested by those who seek to revise history in that regard. There is no longer a need to die or kill for Ireland.  Yet we are forced to observe, on an almost daily basis, the obscenity of horrific atrocities in the North of Ireland and elsewhere committed in the name, though not with the approval of, the Republic.</P>
    <P>Over the past two and a half years I have appeared on television and spoken on radio doing the best, within my competence, to explain Ireland's position in the context of our involvement in the Anglo-Irish Conference, in the overall area of the new Irish relations North and South, indeed the new relations between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  I remember having spoken four times on the British and Northern Ireland media one morning between 7 and 8 o'clock. My reason for so saying is to indicate to the House my concern and interest in this whole area.  I have been involved also in the cases of the Maguires, the Guildford Four and the Birmingham Six.  I have visited and met all of those individuals over the past ten years or more.  Arising out of an accumulation of these experiences, I believe the Bill before the House does nothing to achieve a just solution to the problems afflicting the two communities in the North, or to bring any nearer an era of co-existence between North and South in a final solution to be agreed by all constitutional parties. Where politics fail, violence wins &mdash; that is the danger.</P>
    <P>I listened to Mr. Séamus Mallon, MP, Deputy Leader of the SDLP &mdash; a member of the Nationalist tradition in the North, a man for whom I have the very highest regard and on whose general elections I worked frequently &mdash; in <Col N="1995" /> Dublin Castle this afternoon, when he made a very interesting point about the Bill before the House.  I hope I am not breaking confidences but it is well known what would be Mr. Mallon's view on this Bill.  He said that a referendum on Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution would cause untold damage, could release passions which have lain dormant for many years.  I would like to think I listened very carefully to Mr. Mallon, whom I believe to be one of the authentic voices of Northern Nationalists.  He would certainly represent my point of view on the subject about which we are speaking.</P>
    <P>The 1967 Constitution Review Committee, the 1974 Sunningdale Agreement, the 1984 New Ireland Forum, the 1986 Anglo-Irish Agreement all have this common thread: they seek to achieve by peaceful means the resolution of this dreadful conflict that confronts this island.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I first address Deputy Andrews and, in part, Deputy Dermot Ahern and other contributors from the Government side of the House and say that the Bill before the House seems to be entirely unknown to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are proposing not the deletion of Article 2 and 3 but, in some way, to address their inadequacies and argue for their amendment or augmentation.  It appeared to me that, throughout the contributions of both those Deputies and others, they referred constantly to the suggestion that what was being proposed by The Workers' Party was the deletion of those two Articles.  That is not so.  I can understand their position, perhaps in some way understand Mr. Mallon's view of the Bill, if he, like the other Deputies with whom he has spoken, was under the impression that what we were proposing <Col N="1996" /> was absolute deletion without any substitution.</P>
    <P>It is time that this country faced up to the reality that the territorial claims contained in Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution are a legal and political nonsense and that they are furthermore an obstacle to peace and reconciliation on this island.  It is time also for us, as the elected representatives of the Irish people, to be honest with ourselves and with our electorate, and tell them that maintaining Articles 2 and 3 in their present form will not only fail to bring unity, but are almost certainly delaying the unity of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>It is the wish of my party to see unity in a single state on this island &mdash; that objective is set out in our party's constitution &mdash; but we realised many years ago that this can be achieved only when there is first unity of the people.  Articles 2 and 3, in their present form, are an obstacle to the forging of that unity and must be changed.</P>
    <P>Whatever justification the author of the 1937 Constitution may have felt for including them 53 years ago, they are now an anachronism and there is no justification for maintaining them in their present form.  I am greatly encouraged by the results of the public opinion poll published in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> on Sunday last, which showed that a clear majority of those polled were in favour of amending the Articles to include a &ldquo;consent&rdquo; clause along the lines proposed in our Bill and that only a little more than a quarter of those polled believed that Articles 2 and 3 should be maintained in their present form.  This is a clear public endorsement of the principles contained in our Bill.  It shows, in fact, that public opinion on this issue is far more progressive than most of the opinion in this House.  It also indicates that an amendment along the lines proposed in our Bill could be carried quite comfortably in a referendum.</P>
    <P>Let us look for a few moments at what Articles 2 and 3 actually say and how these words are interpreted, especially in Northern Ireland.  Article 2 says that &ldquo;The national territory consists of the <Col N="1997" /> whole island of Ireland, its islands and the territorial seas&rdquo;.  What this is saying is that the entire island of Ireland is ours, irrespective of the wishes of the people of Northern Ireland.  It is seen by many people within Northern Ireland, who do not share the aspiration to a united Ireland, as a suggestion that they are in some way &ldquo;trespassers&rdquo; on our island.  It is seen as a more subtle and sophisticated version of the &ldquo;Brits out&rdquo; philosophy.</P>
    <P>Article 3 on the other hand, asserts the right of this Parliament and this Government to exercise jurisdiction over the entire island &mdash; again without regard to the wishes of the people of Northern Ireland &mdash; but says that we will not do so for the moment; that we will not do so until we are in a position to exercise as well as claim jurisdiction.  This is understandably seen by many people in Northern Ireland as an expression of hostility. I would repeat the question posed by Deputy De Rossa in his opening address last week, &ldquo;how would we react if the United Kingdom claimed legal jurisdiction over our State?&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We should now accept that the sort of phoney posturing contained in Articles 2 and 3 is nonsense.  Not one other country, not one other member of the EC, not even any one of the more than 150 members of the United Nations, recognises our claim to jurisdiction over Northern Ireland.  In addition, as the Taoiseach himself pointed out last week, by joining the EC and by signing the Helsinki accord we were recognising existing borders between all European states, including the Border existing between this country and the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Why is Fianna Fáil then so strongly resisting bringing Articles 2 and 3 into line with the other international agreements we have signed?  What could be lost by amending them to include an aspiration to Irish unity, based on the consent of all of the Irish people?  Surely this would far more accurately reflect the wishes of the people of this State and would serve to reassure Unionist opinion in Northern Ireland that we have no hostile intent towards them.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to the attitude of <Col N="1998" /> the Labour Party to our Bill.  I very much welcome the fact that the Labour Party have agreed to support the Second Stage of the Bill.  Their decision had a specific importance.  While Deputy Spring had on a number of occasions acknowledged the need to look at these Articles, and while Deputy Kemmy had over the years played a major role in encouraging a reassessment of public opinion on the territorial claim, the Labour Party themselves were the only party in the House, other than Fianna Fáil, who had, up to last week, failed to come out specifically in support of the need for amendment of the two Articles.  The fact that they have now indicated support for the principle of our Bill means that a majority of Deputies in this House support the case for changing these Articles.  As a result of Labour's decision the balance of opinion in the House has now tipped against Articles 2 and 3 in their present form.  The significance of this development should not be underestimated.  As far as we are concerned, a majority in the House, the writing is on the wall for those Articles in their present form.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the Labour Party's decision, I found Deputy Spring's speech last week to be negative and lacking in generosity.  I am not particularly concerned about his lack of generosity to The Workers' Party, but I did find his attitude to those in Northern Ireland who do not share our aspiration to a united Ireland to be particularly begrudging.  It was, as Deputy Ahern who spoke after him said, correctly, a speech that could have been made from the Fianna Fáil benches.</P>
    <P>Articles 2 and 3 are an issue on which the Left should be taking the political leadership.  The use of the so-called &ldquo;national question&rdquo; by Fianna Fáil over many decades has seriously inhibited the development of the Left in Ireland.  Politics here has for too long been about flags, emblems and constitutional symbols, rather than about jobs, housing and emigration.  The Left should be hammering nails into the coffin of romantic nationalistic myths.  We should reject any <Col N="1999" /> suggestion that Northern Ireland represents the &ldquo;fourth green field&rdquo; stolen from us by the foreigner.  We should state quite clearly that the concept of territorial unity has no validity other than as a natural follow-on to the unity of the people.  Here I propose to correct the misquote of James Connolly by Deputy Ahern.  It was, after all, James Connolly who said, and I quote, correctly I believe: &ldquo;Ireland as distinct from her people means nothing to me&rdquo;.  This is a good principle to keep in mind during the debate about these Articles.</P>
    <P>Unlike the Labour Party, or indeed any other party in the House, The Workers' Party are the only one organised on a 32 county basis and with elected public representatives in Northern Ireland.  This gives us a particular insight into the complexities of the situation there.  Our party in Northern Ireland are quite small but, against all the odds, have succeeded in building a considerable level of cross-community support.  Our councillors and members, in their day-to-day political activities, are in regular contact with Unionists and Unionist politicians.  The picture Deputy Spring painted of them was a very ungenerous one, a community unwilling to consider change and who would see amendments to Articles 2 and 3 as a concession to &ldquo;be pocketed and instantly forgotten&rdquo;.  This is a dangerous generalisation, and not a view we share in The Workers' Party.</P>
    <P>The current political attitudes of the Unionist people have to be considered against the background of the vicious campaign of sectarian murder which has been waged by the Provisional IRA against the Protestant people in Northern Ireland.  This is a campaign which within the past ten days claimed another two civilian victims in County Derry.  This is a campaign which, the Provisional IRA claim, is being waged in our name.  Given the viciousness of that campaign it is a tribute to Unionists that they have been prepared to consider any concessions at all.</P>
    <P>There is a fundamental difference in our view and the approach advocated by <Col N="2000" /> Deputy Spring.  We believe that Articles 2 and 3 should be amended as a matter of basic democratic principle.  Deputy Spring seems to be suggesting that they should be used as a bargaining counter, to be granted or withheld as a negotiating lever to extract concessions from the Unionists.  This is very similar to the approach adopted by the Taoiseach, who has said on a number of occasions that changes to Articles 2 and 3 could be contemplated only as part of an overall settlement to the problem of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Deputy Spring also delivered a vigorous critique of the form of wording we are proposing.  We have made it clear that we do not consider our proposals for the amendments to be infallible and that we are quite prepared to consider changes which are consistent with our overall objectives.  It is a relatively easy step to accept in principle that Articles 2 and 3 should be amended.  It is a far more difficult task, as we found, to come up with the ideal form of wording.  We believe that ours is the best wording that has been suggested.  Deputy Spring did not offer any alternative form of wording of his own.  He is a former Tánaiste, with many years ministerial experience.  He has as one of his close political advisers a distinguished former Attorney General.  I look forward to them producing, in time, what they consider to be a better, if not, ideal formula.</P>
    <P>Deputy Spring seemed also to be less than optimistic about the chances of a referendum to change Articles 2 and 3.  I do not share his pessimistic outlook.  As I said earlier, last Sunday's public opinion poll suggested that a referendum could be carried comfortably.  Even before that poll I believed that, given the changing mood in the country, a reasonable proposition, which maintained the aspiration to unity while making clear that this would not be imposed against the will of the people of Northern Ireland, would have every chance of success.  To those who say that a referendum to change Articles 2 and 3 would have no chance of success, I would remind them that six months ago every commentator and <Col N="2001" /> expert in the country was saying that a candidate supported by the parties of the Left could never win the Presidency.</P>
    <P>Finally, let me also correct the record in regard to a statement made by Deputy Spring with regard to the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  He said that he was the first member of the House to suggest the kind of concessions necessary to attract Unionists to the negotiating table &ldquo;principally by removing the elements of coercion that they detected in the Anglo-Irish Agreement&rdquo;.  The then leader of The Workers' Party, Tomás Mac Giolla, made the very same point during the Dáil debate on the agreement in 1985.  A year later, when Deputy Spring was still Tánaiste, Tomás Mac Giolla again emphasised the need to take steps to ensure that the representatives of the Unionist community were involved in the dialogue. He suggested that the Anglo-Irish Conference should be restructured or the Anglo-Irish Agreement itself be temporarily suspended for a period of two or three months in order to achieve this.</P>
    <P>The points I have made in regard to Deputy Spring's contributions are offered in a fraternal spirit &mdash; as I am sure his comments were last week &mdash; and do not in any way diminish the value we attach to the decision of the Labour Party Parliamentary Party to support our Bill on Second Stage.  This is all part of a badly needed debate about Articles 2 and 3 which will be good for the Dáil, for the country and for the relationship between the people of this island.</P>
    <P>In asking the House to accept the Second Stage reading in this House, I am asking the House, in supporting it, to allow the Bill to pass, as it must necessarily then do, to a special committee of this House where it could be debated with a clear and calm attitude.  We must recognise now that since this debate was opened by The Workers' Party a short time ago there is clear evidence of support within the House by a majority of Deputies, and there is certainly support from a majority of people outside, to at least consider and discuss change. Accordingly, I would urge this Bill on the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has accused us in The Workers' Party of a lack of political judgment in bringing forward this Bill.  He claims that a referendum would be politically divisive and unproductive. Our judgement is that the two Articles breathe the spirit of an epoch in Irish political history which, mercifully, has passed.  It was an epoch of inward-looking Catholic nationalism which while it might prate on and on about the need to recover the `fourth green field' was in practice more than willing to forget about the North and the conditions of its Catholic minority.</P>
      <P>It is an insult to the intelligence of Northern Nationalists to claim that they draw any comfort from the existence of these two Articles.  Northern Catholics have been for a long time justifiably cynical about the empty green verbalising which has become the stock-in-trade of Fianna Fáil on this issue.  We do not need any lessons in political responsibility from a politician with the Taoiseach's track record on Northern Ireland.  He may quote the Anglo-Irish Agreement at us now, but we need to remember that while we gave the Agreement critical support he and his then Tánaiste rubbished it as a betrayal of the nationalist objectives of Articles 2 and 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it any wonder that Ulster Unionists have greater reservations about responding to his repeated invitations to &ldquo;openended dialogue&rdquo;?  Of course there are those on the Unionist side who have no interest in dialogue or a move beyond traditional entrenched positions.  But the dominant position amongst the Unionist leadership has become more flexible.  It is this which provides us with a new window of opportunity.  The Taoiseach's predictable and negative response shows very clearly where the main obstacle to the Brooke initiative lies.  For him &ldquo;flexibility&rdquo; means saying to the Unionists that we will agree to get rid of the offensive articles when they agree to &ldquo;new arrangements and structures which might be agreed for Ireland as a whole&rdquo;. In other words, when Unionists agree to stop being Unionists and at last see the attractions of a unitary state, the <Col N="2003" /> Taoiseach would be flexible and magnanimous enough to consider the removal of the Articles.  This is the person who charges us with hindering progress.</P>
    <P>Does he really think that, after the united and bitter opposition of the whole Unionist community to the Anglo-Irish Agreement which gave the Irish Government an institutional right of consultation in the government of Northern Ireland, they can be persuaded to leave the United Kingdom altogether and live amicably in a united Ireland?  The Taoiseach may be prepared to talk to the Unionists but this speech makes it very clear that he is only prepared to discuss the various methods by which they may join a united Ireland. He shares in the mentality crystallised in the two Articles, a mentality which denies them the ultimate right to say no.  It is this anti-democratic component of Fianna Fáil ideology which is the real obstacle to political progress in Northern Ireland.  He accuses us of lack of political judgement, but it is those politicians who have grandiose ambitions that some &ldquo;final solution&rdquo; to the Ulster conflict can be achieved in the near future by using the Brooke talks to slip the Unionists out of the United Kingdom who really lack <Col N="2004" /> political judgement and threaten the possibilities of real but limited progress which exist.</P>
    <P>We do not want to favour Unionists' aspirations at the expense of the aspiration of Northern Nationalists.  What we would challenge is the claim that the majority of Northern Irish Nationalists share in the traditionalistic thinking of the Taoiseach Deputy Haughey.  Recent surveys have clearly demonstrated that those who put Irish unity at the top of their political agenda are a minority of Northern Nationalists.</P>

      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 29a:</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7) Each child care advisory committee shall&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  have access to non-personal information in relation to child care and family support services in its area,</P>
      <P>(b)  consult with voluntary bodies providing child care and family support services in its area,</P>

      <P>and where more than one child care advisory committee is established in a health board area, the provisions of this subsection shall apply with the necessary modifications.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Minister for his co-operation in this matter, which has been exemplary.  He gave a commitment in the special committee to introduce a new section to deal with child care advisory committees.  He said that in response to the committee and in particular to Deputy Yates he was grateful for their co-operation and wanted to assure the <Col N="2008" /> committee that on Report Stage he would bring in proposals for a new section covering this area.  What I am proposing is that each child care advisory committee shall have access to non-personal information in relation to child care as opposed to what I had originally proposed which was &ldquo;all information&rdquo;.  I propose that each child care advisory committee shall consult with voluntary bodies providing child care and family support services; report on child care and family support services in its area when so requested by the health board, and review the needs of children in its area who are not receiving adequate care and protection.</P>
    <P>We can rest assured that the advisory committees will not be talk shops.  I thank Deputies for their support for this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment but I make the point that the fact that this amendment is likely to be agreed does not necessarily mean that child care advisory committees are limited to what is contained in it.

      <P>I am glad the amendment was changed.  What we really want to do &mdash; and this amendment will do it &mdash; is to build up in each health board area a body of information which, I hope, when it is exchanged with other health boards, will also be national.  The information we are building up here will be of help to everybody working in the child care field.  I welcome this amendment.</P>

      <P>Maybe I should attend debates more often when I have this effect on the Minister.  I welcome the <Col N="2009" /> refinements in subsection (a) and the relatively limited powers in subsection (c).  I also welcome subsection (d) regarding reviewing the needs of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection. I hope this will give the committees confidence to raise the kind of issues I see as their primary function.  It is a very welcome amendment which helps to substantially strengthen the Bill.</P>

I would be worried if we were confining the role of the child care committees to what is stated in the amendment but I presume we are doing this in conjunction with section 7 (1) and (2).  I presume the role outlined in those subsections will be included and that we are not strictly confined to this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the contributions of the various Members.  I assure Deputy Flaherty that we know we need to set up committees and to have uniformity in the guidelines set down.  We are not putting something into the Bill just for the sake of it.  I believe in the collective wisdom of the Members of this House and in the democratic process.  I thank Deputy Yates for retabling his amendments.  I am pleased to assure the House that I will accept amendment No. 29a in its entirety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 7 (1) is the key to the committee. It states, &ldquo;a health board shall establish a child care advisory committee to advise the health board on the performance of its functions under this Act and the health board shall consider and have regard to any advice so tendered to it&rdquo;.  That is a broad, wide-ranging subsection which we included as a result of <Col N="2010" /> the Committee Stage debate.  Consequently, we now have the added amendment No. 29a to back up the request of Deputy Dempsey, and other Members, that the committees will not be confined to it.  We will draw up guidelines and I hope the committees will have a key role. I am confident they will make a major contribution to child care services right across the country.</P>

      <P>These amendments are to ensure a maximum level of accountability.  They were discussed on Committee Stage and the difference between my proposed amendment No. 30 and what is already there is that it would be a minimum of one year before the first review of the services would take place, as outlined in section 8, as amended in Committee, under the review of services and annually thereafter.  In amendment No. 31 I am suggesting that all the reports be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas within four weeks of their receipt.  These are not very substantial changes but they are aimed at providing greater accountability. I hope the House will support them.</P>

      <P>As regards bringing reports before the Houses of the Oireachtas, I should like to remind Deputies that the purpose of these reports is to ensure that each health board carry out a regular review of the adequacy of the child care and family support services in their area.  As such, the reports are an administrative tool to assist health board management to identify gaps in services and prepare plans for improvements.  While proposing that the reports be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, Deputies are attempting to shift the debate, and perhaps also the decision making, from the local health board level where it should take place, at least in the first instance, to the national level.  I do not think this is helpful, appropriate or ultimately beneficial to the provision of the best local services. Therefore, I am prepared to accept amendment No. 30 if Deputy Yates is prepared to withdraw amendment No. 31.</P>

      <P>In page 8, to delete line 25 and substitute &ldquo;the needs of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection and, in particular&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>These amendments arise from the discussion on this section in special committee. The purpose of this section is to require health boards to undertake wider reviews of the adequacy of the child care and family support services in their areas. For this purpose, the boards' staff will be required to produce reports for consideration by the health board and by the Minister for Health.  Subsection (2) lists certain categories of children whose needs must be considered in preparing these reports.  The first amendment makes it clear that the report must deal with the needs of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection. This is fully in keeping with the duty imposed on the health boards under section 3 (1) to promote the welfare of such children.</P>
      <P>The second amendment inserts an additional category of children whose needs must be considered, that is the children who are in the care of the board. These are children who have been placed in foster care and residential care by the health board.  While it is intended that regulations under Part VI would provide for regular reviews of each child in care, it is also desirable that the needs of such children as a group should be addressed.</P>

      <P>I would dearly love to be able to accept Deputy Sherlock's amendment but the amendment refers to reports which will be prepared by the health boards primarily for consideration by members of the boards and their child care advisory committees.  A copy of these reports will be furnished to the Minister for Health to enable him to exercise his overall supervisory responsibilities. As the reports will be prepared by the relevant health boards, the responsibility for dissemination and publication should rest with the board rather than with the Minister for Health.  I do not therefore propose to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister give me some reason?  The emphasis is on the fact that the health board shall draw up the report as directed by the Minister, on the adequacy of the child care and family support services in the area.  This is very good and laudable and is exactly what we need so that we can monitor the progress or otherwise of the Bill as it is implemented.  Under the section the health board are also required to submit a copy of the report to the Minister.  As it is the Members of the Parliament who enact the legislation, is it not reasonable to suggest that the Minister having received the report should publish it in a way in which Members of the Parliament could have a copy?  If it is left to the health board or their committees there is no <Col N="2014" /> possibility that Members of Parliament will receive that report to consider whether or not what is being done is adequate.  For that reason I would ask the Minister to think again.</P>

      <P>Subsection (2) prevents the board from delegating to a voluntary body or other person their duty to receive children into care under section 4 or their power to institute care proceedings under section 16.  The thinking is that these functions are so important that they should be performed only by health boards as the statutory authorities responsible for child care and protection. The amendment seeks to enable these functions to be dealt with by an agency approved by the Minister.  I do not see any justification for the proposed change. In the first place, I am not aware of any agency that would have the necessary staff, expertise or access to foster care and residential facilities that would be required if they were to take on this new role.  In any event, it would not be a good idea, now that we are imposing clear statutory duties on health boards in relation to the care and protection of children, to hive off to other agencies some of the key functions in relation to <Col N="2016" /> child care and protection.  This would give rise to enormous confusion and duplication as to the respective responsibilities of the health boards and any agency that might take on this role.</P>

      <P>This is consequential on changes made in Parts III and IV on Committee Stage. The purpose of subsection (2) is to prevent a health board from delegating certain functions to a voluntary body.  The reference in lines 4 and 5 to the power under section 16 to make application for a care order, or a supervision order, has been rendered inadequate as a result of the various changes made on Committee Stage.  For example, it does not cover the power to apply for an emergency care order under section 13, an interim care order under section 17, an access order under section 18 or an order for the recovery of a child under section 37. These are all encompassed by the revised formula proposed in amendment No. 40.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 41:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Payments provided for under this section shall be paid on the basis of fixed terms of renewable contracts with a defined level of service as laid down by the Minister.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I attach some importance to this amendment. Its purpose is to ensure that there will be a clear relationship between voluntary organisations and health boards in providing services.  I am thinking here of organisations like the ISPCC and others. From the point of view of voluntary organisations, it is important that they <Col N="2017" /> should not operate on a hand to mouth basis.  In exchange for a clearcut service requirement there should be some prospect of medium-term security so that these organisations could develop their services without being in a stop-go situation.</P>
    <P>In other areas of the health boards, for instance in relation to mental handicap, there has been friction between the voluntary organisations and the health boards.  I quote Cheeverstown House as an example.  In such cases it is vital that there is not a nebulous working arrangement but fixed contracts which in some cases would be renewable.  I notice that the Minister had some difficulty with this on Committee Stage, purely on the basis of the word &ldquo;renewable&rdquo;.  The Minister felt that that obliged him to renew every contract that would exist.  A contract has a legal life of its own, and it does not have to be renewable.  I was trying to exclude the possibility that they would not be renewable but in some cases the contract would be for a three or a four period.  I do not accept the validity of the Minister's objection on those grounds. There is a real need to formalise the basis and relationship between health boards and voluntary organisations because we all know who is the stronger and who is the weaker.  All the bureaucracy and legal advice are available to health boards; voluntary organisations by their very nature are weak.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with the provision of services by voluntary bodies and other persons.  This work should follow a proper format.  I see this extending to foster care, foster-parents and other areas so that there would be blueprints of contracts of service which would vary taking into account the local and regional circumstances.  I have been lobbied by organisations to say that in some areas, where they are a national organisation, they have different relationships with different health boards.  That is unsatisfactory. There is need for uniformity throughout the country and, hopefully, that uniformity would include the best procedures in all health boards.  It is important that we reassess this aspect on <Col N="2018" /> Report Stage as we have done on other amendments.  I ask the Minister and the House to support some clear-cut proposals but if he has a better wording I will certainly consider it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. It is very important that two things happen: first, that there is proper legislative recognition for the work of voluntary bodies and, second, that their work is recognised professionally, that they would have security of tenure in the knowledge that if their work were of a sufficient standard and recognised by the Minister and his Department they would be treated in a professional manner.  Without going into specifics, we are all aware of cases where excellent work is done by a voluntary agency at local or national level that reaches certain communities and the local health board, strapped for resources, might be envious or downright hostile to the work of such a voluntary agency.</P>
      <P>Where excellent work is being done by a voluntary agency &mdash; and the Minister recognises this in section 10 &mdash; and where a child care service or a family support service is being provided, it is important that this is on recognised conditions over a fixed period and treated in the professional manner the service warrants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spoke at some length on Committee Stage about the family support services. I had the opportunity to study some work being carried out in the UK by reach-out services and family support units there.  I thought they were an excellent model to break the terrible cycle of deprivation, poverty and illiteracy which often besets a family.  Regardless of how much the spotlight is on a family, often we find that resources seem to be channelled to break that cycle, but that is never properly done.  A comprehensive family support unit can achieve that, but that must be recognised.  Perhaps every health board will not be in a position to establish a comprehensive family support unit in every community but where one does exist, set up by a voluntary institution, it should be supported, recognised and <Col N="2019" /> should have a fixed term.  It should not be at war, as often happens, with the health board, who often find themselves strapped for resources and feel that an excellent service in a compact area, unfortunately, sometimes is compared with their strapped service and shows them in a bad light.  There is great merit in this amendment and I ask the Minister to approach it in the same generous manner as he approached previous amendments, and to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, support the amendment. This is a very good section but paragraph (a) is vague.  It reads:</P>
      <P>by a periodic contribution to funds of the body or person;</P>
      <P>At present representatives of the Wheelchair Association are helping mothers with mentally handicapped children. These mothers are being advised by that body that the number of hours they will be able to help them will be reduced in the new year because that voluntary body cannot raise the necessary funds to pay those who are providing that service.  For that reason it is necessary to be specific about fixed terms of payment to such bodies.  Those people are providing a service that enables the parents, particularly mothers, of mentally handicapped children to treat them at home, otherwise they may have to take them into care.  I have experience of that.  This is an area that needs to be addressed.  Section 10 (c) reads:</P>
      <P>by a contribution in kind (whether by way of materials or labour or any other service).</P>
      <P>That is a very good provision.  Where a person is physically or mentally disabled and additional accommodation is required, very often it is not possible for the parents, if they get a two-thirds grant, to provide the one-third needed to provide essential accommodation such as bathroom and toilet facilities.  While this is a good section, the amendment is specific, and I support it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The important thing about this section and the amendment is that the same principle underlines both. What the Minister and Deputy Yates are trying to achieve is that voluntary organisations are adequately rewarded &mdash; that is not even the right word &mdash; for the work they do on a voluntary basis, and that whatever assistance is given to them will allow them to continue that work on a longer term basis.  Whether one looks at the section or the amendment the principle is the same.  The problem is that the amendment states:</P>
      <P>Payments provided for under this section shall be paid on the basis of fixed terms of renewable contracts with a defined level of service as laid down by the Minister.</P>
      <P>One of the basic principles in this Bill &mdash; and I think all sides agreed on this on Committee Stage &mdash; was that we should allow health boards maximum flexibility in the implementation of the Bill.  In the case of the amendment, while I can understand what Deputy Yates is attempting to achieve, I think some of the flexibilty would be removed by bringing the Minister into a relationship in which he should not be involved, &mdash; that is, the relationship between voluntary organisations in the health board area and the health board themselves.</P>
      <P>I agree &mdash; and I think everybody in the House agrees &mdash; that voluntary organisations provide very necessary services to health boards and to different groups and categories of people.  They should not be out of pocket or working on a hand to mouth basis from year to year.  I do not see anything in the section as it stands to prevent agreements from being drawn up between the health boards and the voluntary organisations along the lines suggested in Deputy Yates's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I see a danger in drawing the Minister &mdash; not just the present Minister but any Minister &mdash; into the relationship between the health boards and the voluntary organisations.  If Deputy Yates looks again at his amendment perhaps he will, on mature consideration, see the <Col N="2021" /> point I am making and withdraw the amendment.  I do not think we are at odds on the principle that voluntary organisations should be assisted and helped as much as possible by the health boards in long-term planning, that the rug should not be pulled from under them at a week or two weeks' notice. However, the Deputy's amendment goes the wrong way about achieving this and, therefore, should be reconsidered.</P>

      <P>I support the objectives of the amendment.  Given the amiability, co-operation and understanding shown by the Minister today, I ask him to accept the amendment and, if needed, reword it.  Because the voluntary sector is so essential to all our community services, whether they are for old people, the mentally handicapped or children, it is vital that they be given a guarantee of continued funding and support.  That is the intent of this amendment.  We are very fortunate in this country to have so many people involved in voluntary work.  If the Minister cannot accept this amendment I ask him to accept its intent and come back with his own wording.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem with the motives behind this amendment but I have problems with the language used in it, for example, it refers to renewable contracts.  Voluntary bodies must know where they stand not on a year to year basis but over a period of four to five years.  This should not be done in consultation with the Minister but in consultation with the health board in whose area they are operating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole thrust of the Bill is to bring child care down to health board level. If Deputy Yates reflects again on this amendment he will probably agree that the place to argue and discuss this point and reach agreement on it is at health board level.  Those of us who are members of health boards are aware of the day-to-day and <i>ad hoc</i> basis on which agreements are reached.  I am aware of the problems facing voluntary bodies. Like Deputy Fennell, I believe they do outstanding work and without them the <Col N="2022" /> people they look after would not receive the degree of service they currently receive.  As I said before, while I agree with the motives behind the amendment, I believe this issue should be argued and discussed at health board level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment should be considered in the context of section 10, which provides that a health board may assist a voluntary body.  This is a discretionary section and provides, as worded by the parliamentary draftsman, that &ldquo;A health board may, subject to any general directions given by the Minister ...&rdquo; All the amendment provides is that in the event of the Minister giving a general direction to a health board to give assistance to a voluntary body, it would be appropriate, particularly when money is involved, for them to have a programme which needed a renewable contract with a defined level of service as laid down by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The amendment provides two safeguards for the Minister; first, the provisions in section 10 will come into play only if the Minister thinks fit and, secondly, there will be a renewable contract only if a defined level of services is agreed by the Minister.  The health board will act on the Minister's authority in the beginning.  It is important that voluntary bodies should have some continuity in what they are doing.  One of their problems is that when they start a programme they do not know if they will have sufficient funds to finish it.  There are exceptional circumstances and I believe the amendment, in the context of the wording of the section, is appropriate.</P>

      <P>I concur with many of the sentiments expressed by Members on the other side of the House.  I would certainly like to see voluntary organisations operating on a sound basis and having a considerable degree of security. That point was put to me very recently by a number of voluntary bodies.  Nevertheless, I would be concerned about tying health boards into renewable contracts. We have an awful lot in common but, as my colleague, Deputy Fitzpatrick, said, <Col N="2023" /> if we tie health boards into renewable contracts we will be placing them in a straitjacket, depriving them of a lot of flexibility and reflecting on the professionalism of the people involved. Allowing for the validity of much of what has been said, I do not think this is the right direction in which to go.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a number of difficulties with this amendment.  First, I should point out that section 8 enables a health board to make a once-off grant or a periodic contribution towards the expenses incurred by a voluntary body providing child care or family support services.  In the case of such a once-off grant or periodic payments the question of renewable contracts does not arise. The health board must have the discretion to pay a once-off grant without being tied into a renewable contract.</P>
      <P>While I can see that in certain cases, for example, the provision of ongoing residential services, it would be good practice to have a contact between the board and the voluntary body, it would not be appropriate in other cases, for example, in the case of a small once-off grant to set up a toy library for children.</P>
      <P>I also have doubt about the suggestion that the proposed contacts would be based on a defined level of service laid down by the Minister.  I do not believe it would be practicable to create a situation in which every contact which a health board wished to make would have to be vetted, and at the discretion of the Minister.  However, it seems that this would be the effect of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 3 health boards are placed under a statutory obligation to provide child care and family support services. It is a matter for each health board to decide on the type and level of services required in their area, having regard to the particular needs of that area.  While the Minister for Health will have powers under section 52 to give general directions to health boards in relation to the performance of their functions, I do not <Col N="2024" /> think it would be desirable for the Minister to take unto himself the right to dictate to the health boards in specific detail the types and levels of services which should be provided.</P>
    <P>In response to Deputy Howlin, sections 9 and 10 give recognition to the role of voluntary boidies in the provision of services.  I know the House concurs with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Fitzpatrick that without the voluntary sector the State by itself could not continue to sustain the level of service given to people who need State support. While the health boards need flexibility and discretion and need to be in a position to disburse funds in any given situation, at any given time, to rectify any given problem, I think the voluntary sector would like the opportunity and flexibility to be able to seek funds on a discretionary basis rather than being tied into a contract. Taking all those points in totality, I regret I will not be able to accept this amendment and I would be grateful to Deputy Yates if he would withdraw it.</P>

      <P>I thank the Members who spoke in favour of the amendment.  I do not think there is a need to discuss any further the issues involved as they have been properly thrashed out.  One could read into the Minister's remarks that he is quite happy to live on with the present vague position.  I am not saying there should be a contract for every service but that there should be contracts in a number of areas where there are no contracts at present.  I do not wish to delay the House but I will be pressing amendment No. 41.</P>

    <P>It is important that we notify all Deputies, if they are not already aware of this, that amendments Nos. 43 and 44 cannot be discussed and some of the issues <Col N="2025" /> involved overlap.  Therefore, the importance of amendment No. 42 is underlined.</P>
    <P>What I am seeking is that an obligation be placed on the Minister for Health, under section 11, to carry out a proper assessment of child care needs nationally on an annual basis.  Before one can establish any plan relating to the provision of child care services one must carry out research.  However, the Minister's proposals in section 11 in relation to research are very weak.  That section states &ldquo;the Minister may conduct or assist other persons in conducting research&rdquo; and &ldquo;a health board may conduct or assist other persons&rdquo;.  We have already discussed the wording and we may take it that where it is stated something &ldquo;may happen&rdquo; this will not happen, having regard to the financial pressures&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I firmly believe that the real purpose of the national children's council would be similar to that of the Combat Poverty Agency and many other organisations who speak for those who cannot speak for themselves.  We have recognised in other areas that there is a need for an independent and organised articulate voice who would carry out sound research on which planning and budgetary decisions which are both clear and forward-looking could be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not happy with section 11 as it is too weak.  Therefore, it should be amended along the lines of section 42 with the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; being changed to &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to ensure that a proper assessment of needs is carried out.  There is a difference between &ldquo;need&rdquo; and &ldquo;demand&rdquo; as it is not always the case that lobby organisations identify the need but, instead, rather create a demand.  This is <Col N="2026" /> an important issue and I ask for the support of the House.  The Minister should be in favour of this type of carefully planned approach rather than an <i>ad hoc</i> stop-go type of arrangement which may or may not happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the dismay of Deputy Yates and most of the Opposition Deputies in the House at our inability to persuade this very accommodating Minister that there is a need for a national children's authority or council.  We debated this matter at great length at the Special Committee and, unfortunately, the next two amendments, amendments Nos. 43 and 44, have been ruled out of order as we on this side of the House may not introduce anything which would impose a charge on the Revenue.  That underscores the importance of this amendment, which gets through the barriers put up to obstruct Deputies in trying to amend, for the better, legislation before the House.</P>
      <P>Given that there will not be a national children's authority charged with the responsibility of monitoring the provision of child care facilities, carrying out research, keeping in touch with both national and international agencies on best practices in child care, drawing up a charter of rights for children and doing all the things we would like to see a national children's authority doing, which we outlined in great detail at the special committee, a proper assessment of child care needs should be carried out on a national basis annually.  That is all this amendment seeks to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid it is a very poor second or third best as compared to the council we wanted to establish but for some reason the Minister has resisted this.  I have always found, from my earliest dealings with the Department of Health, a strong resistance to this concept.  I fail to understand the reason.  For those reasons it is important that this minor amendment be accepted so that an annual report is drawn up on the needs of children to see what progress has been made.  As I said, if we can get that much enacted it would be a minor consolation for us, given that <Col N="2027" /> we have failed to persuade the Minister and his colleagues on that side of the House that there is a need for a national council.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but I do have problems with the way Deputy Yates, in this instance aided and abetted by Deputy Howlin and Deputies on the other side of the House, wish to go about it.  Child care advisory committees will be set up at local level in health board areas.  From these eventually a national children's council or something approaching that will emerge.  In principle, I am against ministerial fiat; in other words, directives in tablets of stone coming from Government to the Eastern Health Board, the South Eastern Health Board, the Western Health Board and so on.  Once these advisory committees have been established and once they become aware of and get to grips with the problems in their areas, as a natural progression I would see individuals first of all, and eventually other people from these councils, getting together to discuss the problems facing them to see if pressure could be brought to bear on whatever Government are in power.  At least the initiative would be taken from the ground upwards and not from the top downwards.  I appreciate this is taking the long road but in the longer term we may get a better result if we take this road.</P>

      <P>The purpose of section 11 is to enable the Minister for Health and the health boards to undertake research into child care and family support or to assist other persons in carrying out such research.  The type of research I have in mind here might include, for example, a detailed analysis of the factors in society and in individual families that give rise to children having to be taken into care, comparative studies of the relative advantages and disadvantages for the <Col N="2028" /> child and the family of placement in foster care or residential care, follow-up studies on children who have been in care and so on.</P>
      <P>These are just some examples of possible research topics in the child care area.  I am sure members of the committee and Members of the House would have many ideas of their own.  However, what Deputy Yates seems to be referring to in his amendment is not what I would term research.  The type of assessment he mentions is more like the ongoing administrative or managerial view and assessment of services.  This is going on all the time at both health board and Department of Health level.  We have dealt already with this type of assessment in section 8, which will require health boards to carry out reviews of the adequacy of the child care and family support services in their respective areas. As the House will recall, I accepted an amendment at Special Committee to section 8 which will require these assessments to be carried out on an annual basis.  I might also remind my colleagues that the Minister for Health will have to be supplied with details of every such assessment.  In the circumstances I do not see any need for this amendment.  I would be concerned that it might serve only to divert attention away from the type of detailed research projects I mentioned earlier.  Therefore, I would be grateful if the Deputy would consider withdrawing this amendment.</P>

      <P>This is a missed opportunity on the part of the Minister because whether one calls it &ldquo;assessment&rdquo;, &ldquo;research&rdquo; or something else is somewhat pedantic.  The issue is that there may be no research, there may be no prior assessment on a national level if section 11 is left as drafted.  In my view that is unsatisfactory and needs to be pressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 45:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 23 to 24, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;12.&mdash;The Court may order that any child who is the subject of proceedings under this Act be made available for an assessment procedure.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a most important amendment which we spent some considerable time discussing at the Special Committee on that other fateful day of 24 January last when the Minister gave a commitment to which I will come in a moment.  This was originally tabled as amendment No. 46. I was seeking that, before a child would be taken into care, the court would have the additional string to their bow of being able to get an assessment carried out on the child at the wish of the court.  Arising out of that the Minister gave statistics in relation to fit person orders and so on, which indicated that perhaps it would have been better in some cases had prior assessments beeen carried out.  In response to this, the Minister said &mdash; this is a very detailed point I wish to make &mdash; that he was tabling amendment No. 67 at that time, on page 11 of the old Bill which dealt with that section.  However, I would now submit to the Minister that those amendments basically cover the question of emergency care orders and other specific circumstances.  I think it was Deputy Shatter who went on to point out in some detail that, first of all, the Law Reform Commission in their interim and final reports recommended that children should not necessarily be subject to court proceedings but the court should have the power to have an assessment carried out.  As the Minister may know, in the discussions there was reference to the United Kingdom legislation.  That Bill was latterly amended to allow the court to fill this vacuum that exists as regards getting an assessment carried out.</P>
      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's particular attention to column 254 of the Official Report of the proceedings of the Special Committee of 24 January last, when the Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2030" /> I am prepared to give an undertaking that I will have this matter looked at within the broadest possible spectrum taking into account what the Law Reform Commission recommend and taking into account the views of the members of this Committee.  I am confident we will be able to come forward with an amendment on Report Stage that will encompass all those views.</P>
    <P>At that time I withdrew amendment No. 46, now amendment No. 45.  What we were discussing at that time, what was teased out at the Special Committee, was that the Minister would actually go further than what is now contained in amendment No. 45, that this gap in terms of assessment would be filled.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware of the final report of the Law Reform Commission in relation to child sexual abuse, which endorsed this recommendation.  Essentially, this deals with the issue of assessments to be carried out on children.  The important thing is that the quality of the administration of justice on the part of our District Courts, on the part of what we would like to call children's courts &mdash; as they may develop under the new rules &mdash; would have proper regard to the need for assessment.  The better the assessment carried out on a child the more accurate will be the decision to ascertain what is in the child's best interests, whether it is to go for fosterage, whether it is to be returned to the parents for just a supervision order, whether the child should be taken into care, or whatever. We must ensure the maximum level of assessment.  I would ask the support of the House for this amendment in view of the Minister's previous commitment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

      <P>When a similar amendment was discussed at the Special Committee on 24 January last I gave a commitment that I would examine the need to give the court power to order that a child be assessed without having to place him or her in care.  I want to assure Deputy Yates and the House that I had long, arduous consultation on this matter.  As Deputies are probably aware, <Col N="2031" /> the Law Reform Commission recommended that such a procedure be introduced to deal with suspected cases of child sexual abuse.  I have been exmaining how best to give effect to that recommendation and to Deputies' wishes in the matter.  I propose to achieve this by effecting a number of changes in section 19 dealing with supervision orders.</P>
      <P>I might refer the House to amendments Nos. 98, 103 and 107.  The effect of these amendments would be that a supervision order could be obtained where there were reasonable grounds for believing that a child had been or was being assaulted, ill-treated, neglected or sexually abused. In other words, a health board would be able to obtain such an order where they could show cause for reasonable suspicion rather than having to prove the matter.</P>
      <P>In section 19 (4) a health board, when applying for a supervision order, would be able to ask the court to give directions as to the care of the child.  Amendment No. 107 provides that such directions could include directions requiring the parents to bring the child to a hospital or other place for the purposes of medical or psychiatric examination or treatment. These amendments, taken together, provide a mechanism, through the supervision order, to enable a health board to seek court approval for the carrying out of medical of psychiatric assessment or treatment of the child without having to take the child into care.  They give effect to the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission.  In view of this, I hope the House will be satisfied and that Deputy Yates will be prepared to withdraw amendment No. 45.</P>

      <P>It is a pity that on a piece of paper in relation to amendments that were being grouped there was no reference to this in relation to my amendment No. 45, which the Minister is asking me to withdraw on the basis of some later amendments, because I could have had greater time to consider those other amendments in relation to supervision <Col N="2032" /> orders.  Therefore, I have to do some thinking on my feet on this matter.</P>
      <P>It seems that the question of an assessment to be carried out at the court's discretion now applies to emergency care orders and supervision orders.  I would have to reflect on whether that covers the totality of cases that might arise.  In the discussion we had in Special Committee there was some detail in relation to the gap that existed at the time.  Obviously, we cannot engage in questions but I would be very interested to know, and perhaps the Minister could nod or shake his head, if this amendment more or less conforms with the position in the UK in relation to the powers of the courts for assessment.  If not, would the Minister perhaps consider in the Seanad expounding further on this area with a view to clarifying the situation?</P>
      <P>I feel there is a gap here in terms of ensuring that (a) the courts have more resources and more opportunities for assessment and (b) that more prior assessments are carried out in virtually all cases.  If prior to any supervision order an assessment is carried out, if prior to any emergency care order an assessment can be carried out &mdash; I appreciate that in emergency care cases things may be so urgent that it is not possible to do so &mdash; have we covered the totality of cases where an assessment is required?  I will be happy to withdraw amendment No. 45 if the Minister with the agreement of the House will give some brief comment on that.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;12.&mdash;(1)  On application to it by a parent (in this Act called the `applicant parent'), the Court may, if it is of opinion that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the safety or welfare of any child so requires, by order (in this Act called a `barring order')&mdash;</P>

      <P>(2)  A barring order may, if the Court thinks fit, prohibit the respondent parent from using or threatening to use violence against, molesting or putting in fear the child and may be made subject to such exceptions and conditions as the Court may specify.</P>

    <P>(5)  If, between the making of an application for a barring order and its determination, the Court is of opinion <Col N="2034" /> that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the safety and welfare of any child so requires, the Court may make an order (in this Act called a `protection order') that the respondent parent shall not use or threaten to use violence against, molest or put in fear the child.</P>
    <P>(6)  A protection order may be made notwithstanding that the summons in relation to the application for a barring order has not been served on the respondent parent.</P>
    <P>(7)  A protection order shall cease to have effect on the determination by the Court of the application for a barring order.</P>
    <P>(8)  A barring order or a protection order shall take effect on notification of its making being given to the respondent parent.</P>
    <P>(9)  Oral communication to the respondent parent by or on behalf of the applicant parent of the fact that a barring order or a protection order has been made, together with production of a copy of the order, shall, without prejudice to the sufficiency of any other form of notification, be taken to be sufficient notification to the respondent parent of the making of the order.</P>
    <P>(10)  If the respondent parent is present at the sitting of the Court at which the barring order or protection order is made, that parent shall be taken, for the purposes of subsection (8), to have been notified of its making.</P>
    <P>(11)  An order varying a barring order shall take effect on notification of its making being given to the parent other than the parent who applied for the variation, and for this purpose subsections (9) and (10) shall apply with the necessary modifications.</P>
    <P>(12)  The Court, on making, varying or discharging a barring order or on making or discharging a protection order, shall cause a copy of the order in question to be given or sent as soon as practicable to the applicant parent, <Col N="2035" /> the respondent parent and the member of the Garda Síochána in charge of the Garda Síochána station for the area in which is situate the place in relation to which the application for the barring order is made.</P>

    <P>I suggest the Minister is going to have another sense of <i>deja vu.</i>  He can see the number of related amendments and he will recall the very intense debate we had on this issue of barring orders.  I tabled this amendment on Committee Stage prior to the Law Reform Commission's final report.  At the time my amendment was based on the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, to enable a specific family group to be dealt with.  This was a family not based on marriage because I was aware at that <Col N="2036" /> time, as were many other members of the committee, of the vulnerability of unmarried people who were living together when there was cruelty, violence or sexual abuse in the home, and one member was responsible.  There was no facility under the 1976 Act to debar that person as there is and has been for over ten years in the case of a married father where the father is the culprit.  That was the thinking at the time I tabled that amendment.  There was wide agreement that there was a need for it but the Minister did not accept the amendment.  I will return to the report of that meeting in the context of the Minister's commitment at that time.</P>
    <P>I think there is widespread agreement and awareness of the need for a realistic measure of this kind.  For instance, it is seen as not being in the best interests of the child in every case to remove the child where there is a reported case of child sexual abuse in the home.  This can compound the child's sense of guilt and shame and his or her feeling that he or she is responsible if he or she is removed on a protection order, emergency care order or some other kind of order.  The perceived wisdom is that there should be a provision for removing the person who is committing the assault on the child where that is possible, and not removing the child.</P>
    <P>This proposal has been made several times by the Law Reform Commission in their original consultative paper on illegitimacy.  We have their up to date report and I will read into the record what they recommend.  On page 89 they recommend that the barring order should be available in respect of any person who is or has been a member of the abused child's household or who, while not a member of the child's household, comes into regular contact with the child.  Where a barring order is made in relation to a person who is not a parent or sibling of the child, it should, save in exceptional circumstances, be made only in respect of the child's family home.  The report goes on to make a further recommendation which is very important: that the health board should have the power <Col N="2037" /> to seek a barring order as an alternative to a care order, and the District Court should be given power to grant a barring order as an alternative to a care order where the justice is satisfied that this is a most appropriate method of securing protection of the child.  Further it says that the right to seek a barring order should be extended to the child.</P>
    <P>These are very clear, explicit recommendations and the Minister will recall that at the time we were aware that this consideration was in hand, and when he was replying to the members of the committee on 24 January, he said, and I quote from column 266 of the report of the Special Committee:</P>
    <P>It would be inadvisable and overhasty for us to proceed with changes in the law in this area in advance of the commission's final report and recommendations. I would respectfully suggest, therefore, that the Deputies might consider withdrawing their amendments and leave these matters for consideration on Report Stage, by which time the final report of the commission should be available.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Minister did not give a firm commitment, but overlaying all our debate was the awareness of this important body who would be making direct recommendations on this section.  They have made very clear recommendations in this area.  They say that, because of the difficulties and the technical aspects on child sexual abuse, this warrants different legislation but in the report they say that this section could be proceeded with and that barring orders are a measure that should not necessarily only be part of a special Bill on child sexual abuse and, since they are necessary in other legislation, the provision could be included.</P>
    <P>This Bill will be seriously deficient if we do not have a barring order, an exclusion order or whatever kind of measure will enable the assailant or the abuser to be removed from the child's environment, the child's home.  I ask the Minister, as a sign of his generosity and enlightenment, to give us this measure in this very important Bill.  I am sure he is aware that all <Col N="2038" /> the agencies, child care groups and organisations have expressed grave reservations about the Bill because this provision was not in it originally, and is not in it even in its amended form.  I cannot speak strongly enough about the need for this measure and I ask the House for support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>When this amendment was first mooted I thought it would be very progressive and, perhaps, a solution to a problem but, on examining it more closely, looking at different documents and awaiting the final report of the Law Reform Commission, I can see we could have some problems in relation to the barring order.  At the moment this is limited between spouses, but I would be very worried about the fact that the health board could apply for a barring order.  I do not know whether the lawyers and legal people here, and the Minister's legal advisers, will say whether that can be done.  I think there would be a constitutional conflict in relation to a health board interfering in a marriage, irrespective of our abhorrence or other emotions in relation to sexual abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment also takes from that old maxim that one is innocent until proven guilty.  We may be going down a very dangerous road; we are talking about an alleged offence and there may not actually be proof of an offence.  It is a difficult emotive problem which has become more and more prevalent, unfortunately. We have to consider whether or not a spouse would want the health board to apply for a barring order.  I feel very strongly about the health board being able to intervene in that type of case.  It would be more appropriate for the health board to consider seeking an emergency care order or removing the child.  There would be legal ramifications to applying for a barring order although, at the same time, I can see Deputy Fennell's point.  The Law Reform Commission can only make recommendations.  They do not have all their home work done, in my estimation; if it comes to a constitutional conflict they <Col N="2039" /> ask us to look at that point to see whether or not it is feasible.</P>
    <P>My worry is about the role health boards would take upon themselves. There is also the problem of how this would work in the case of cohabitees and civil law marriages.  Can a brother or sister within a family be barred?  Those are legal minefields in my view.  I know there are other avenues which Deputy Shatter outlined on Committee Stage. Under the Guardianship of Infants Act orders can be made that non-married people leave a home.  There are other avenues open to the courts apart from going for a straight barring order.  The major problems I see are the constitutional aspect of the health board intervening and whether a barring order would actually be effective.  Are we taking it upon ourselves to become the judge and jury prior to the court proceedings? We would need to look very hard at this amendment even though I can see that there has been some popularity for another avenue open to women, especially those who have found themselves in a desperate situation, where they cannot cope, and feel this is the only measure they can take for their own safety and, perhaps, that of their child. I would ask the Minister to clarify the constitutional aspect as I am not one of those legal eagles we have the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I am sorry Deputy Coughlan has left the Chamber because <Col N="2040" /> Deputy Fennell made such a good case on amendment No. 46 that I thought she would have convinced Deputy Coughlan that it was a very clearcut issue.  Amendment No. 46 states: &ldquo;On application to it by a parent (in this Act called the `applicant parent'), the Court may,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I will now speak to amendment No. 66 which states:</P>
      <P>Where a justice is satisfied on the application of a health board or on the basis of information supplied on oath by any person that there is reasonable cause for believing that there is an immediate and serious risk to the health or well-being of a child he may issue an order barring from the home of the child any person whom he believes to be responsible for such risk, for such period as he considers necessary.</P>
      <P>That is very straightforward.  If a child is deemed to be at risk and an application is made to the court it is the district justice who makes the decision on, as is stated in that amendment, information supplied on oath.  There could not, therefore, be any great fear that there would be any abuse of that provision because this is availing entirely of the court procedure. What other way would one suggest to deal with such a serious matter that may arise and, from reports, very often arises? I want, therefore, to support amendment No. 46.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Coughlan spoke about legal eagles.  I am not a legal eagle either and I do not pretend that the amendment under discussion is completely straightforward.  There are certainly complications.  A few fundamental principles are not difficult to follow.  One is that where a child is abused or under threat of being molested there is, in many instances, huge psychological and physical damage inflicted on that child.  Often the removal of that child compounds those psychological damages.  The child is often removed from the support that exists, his own family, his brothers and sisters, and loving parents sometimes. The option should certainly be there for <Col N="2041" /> the court to protect the child not only by removing him to a place of safety but by removing the offender so that the child is safe.  The normal supportive background of the family should remain and the allegedly guilty person should be removed from it.  That is a fundamental principle and is one that is worthy of teasing out in very great detail.  I note the Minister did not in any way distance himself from that principle or the view of incorporating it in this legislation when he spoke on Committee Stage.  He strongly suggested that we should wait for the report of the Law Reform Commission and said that Report Stage of the Bill would be the appropriate forum for making the final decisions on it.</P>
      <P>The Law Reform Commission report acknowledges the difficulties and the reluctance of courts to bar an offending parent from the family home.  It recommends strongly that that provision should be there.  It has been said by a speaker from the other side of the House that the Law Reform Commission are not the beall and end-all when it comes to wisdom in relation to the Constitution, but they are a very important forum of legal wisdom and we should certainly be very aware and cognisant of their opinions.</P>
      <P>It is very important that this provision is enacted, and I say that on the basis of immediate and personal experience in the past week.  A family in my constituency literally had to take to the streets in the middle of the night to get away from an abusing father.  The children literally walked the streets at night looking for alternative accommodation. Certainly in that instance it would be much more appropriate that the offending adult be removed and the mother and children stay in the family home rather than the reverse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On balance, the Minister should have had sufficient time to reflect on the arguments put forward by Deputy Fennell and others on Committee Stage and on the report and deliberations of the Law Reform Commission, which he has had for some time.  I hope he is convinced by the direction of all opinion &mdash; in the Law Reform Commission report and from this <Col N="2042" /> side of the House &mdash; and will accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>When a child is at risk there are two options available, one as suggested in this amendment and the other to put the child in care.  Both options have traumatic consequences for the family and particularly for the child who is at risk.  The option which would perhaps cause the least trauma would be to bar the parent who is causing the problem.  That is the practice that is most likely to be reversed if the situation is not as was thought.  In other words, it is easier to remove a barring order, as is suggested in amendment No. 46, than to get a child out of care.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, barring orders are commonly used as a way of addressing the crime committed in homes, usually by the father.  My experience from talking to constituents is that the making of barring orders is becoming more widespread, in many cases to maintain the whole fabric of the home.  If there are grounds to suspect that a child is at risk from an offending parent it might be easier to adopt the approach suggested in this amendment, difficult as it might be but accepted in principle by the Law Reform Commission, than to go through the whole procedure of putting the child in care, which may be difficult to reverse. Perhaps the Minister, as he said he would do on Committee Stage, would consider this matter now and give us the benefit of his wisdom and the views and consultations which no doubt he has had with his legal advisers.  We will be anxious to hear his response.</P>

      <P>The question of extending the barring order system to child sexual abuse and other child care cases was discussed at great length at the Special Committee.  As the House will be aware, the Law Reform Commission in their recent report on child sexual abuse recommended that a health board should be given power to seek a barring order as an alternative to a care order and that a barring order should be available in respect of any person who is or has been <Col N="2043" /> a member of the household where a child has been abused.  The commission also recommended that the courts should have the option of removing the alleged abuser in a child abuse case as an alternative to placing the child in care under an emergency care order.  It is also proposed that a health board should be entitled to seek a protection order in respect of a child on an <i>ex parte</i> basis and that courts hearing criminal cases should have power to make barring or protection orders as appropriate against persons found guilty of offences involving child sexual abuse.</P>
      <P>I have read the commission's report in detail.  One can quote from any section of it but I would like to quote two sections.  It states:</P>
      <P>In many cases the removal of the child will be more appropriate, particularly where it offers a better guarantee of the child's safety.</P>
      <P>It goes on to state:</P>
      <P>The barring procedure can be, and is sometimes, used at present in cases of child sexual abuse, but its scope is limited.  The three principal limitations are that only a spouse can be barred, only a spouse may apply for a barring order, and a barring order is not available on an emergency <i>ex parte</i> basis.</P>

I want to ensure the House that I have had long, detailed and arduous consultation, deliberations and discussions on this very delicate question. The Government have carefully considered the matter and believe it is not appropriate that such a major change in policy and law should be implemented by way of an amendment on Report Stage of this Bill.  I regret, therefore, that I will not be able to accept these amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>That is more an indictment on the Minister than anything else.  The consultation paper on child sexual abuse states that when dealing with emergencies the courts should have the option of removing the alleged abuser instead of the child from the home.  The Minister quoted very selectively from the report of the Law Reform Commission, but I would like to quote a little more liberally. It states:</P>
      <P>Discussion of barring procedures in the context of child sexual abuse is important because in some cases the most appropriate and the least distressing way of protecting a child who has been the subject of abuse is to order the removal of the abuser from the child's household.</P>
      <P>The report further states &mdash; and this is important:</P>
      <P>We pointed out in the Consultation Paper that a barring order is not at present available where a child is sexually abused by an unmarried parent, a step-parent, a co-habitee ... It is available only for spouses ... We provisionally recommend that a barring order should be available in respect of any person who is or has been a member of the abused child's household... We therefore confirm our recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report also states that more discussion was needed on the balance to be struck between the protection of the right to live in one's own house and the protection of the child's right not to be <Col N="2045" /> abused.  It tosses the arguments backward and forward.  It goes on to say:</P>
    <P>The question must therefore be asked whether such a radical development is justifiable.  We think that it is, provided that the District Court confines the grant of barring orders to appropriate cases.</P>
    <P>The report further states: &ldquo;It should be stressed that the health board's power to seek a barring order would derive from its duty to protect children at risk&rdquo;.  The result of the Minister failing to deal with this issue effectively means he is not prepared to make it the duty of a health board to protect abused children by bringing in a barring order to remove offending adults.  That is extremely sad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister only knew the feelings of guilt which attach to those children.  They feel they are the guilty party and that is the psychological reality. The Law Reform Commission state:</P>
      <P>We therefore recommend that health boards be given power to seek a barring order as an alternative to a care order, and that the court be given power to grant a barring order as an alernative to a care order where the justice is satisfied that this is the most appropriate method of securing the protection of the child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is not prepared to do that. He is not prepared to give district justices that opportunity.  Shame on the Minister. He has deceived us.  Deputy Fennell did not quote from what he said on 13 February, which was that he would give a commitment to the Committee that if amendments were withdrawn he would take into account on Report Stage what Deputies had proposed and the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission. He said we could have a further discussion of the issues on Report Stage. The Minister has reneged on his commitments. He misled the Committee.  He <Col N="2046" /> has not brought forward one amendment to deal with this issue.  It is a scandalous situation of neglect.  He has not put up any argument to say that this is the wrong policy direction.  It is a total cop-out to say that some 82 years after the Children Act, 1908, was passed we are faced with the situation that the Minister and his officials did not see fit to have a barring order brought in.</P>
    <P>In amendment No. 46 we propose to deal with the situation where only the spouse is covered by including the cohabitee.  People should not be left in a situation where alcohol abusers frighten the living daylights out of their cohabitee and the children.  It is a great pity that this matter is being dealt with at this hour of the night when the media are not present to see the scandalous and shameful neglect by the Government in failing to meet their responsibilities in this area.  The Minister might take some temporary succour from that, but when people see that he has given a particular gesture to the Law Reform Commission and has reneged on his promise to the Committee they will view it as a poor day for such defenceless children.</P>
    <P>I do not understand how the Minister fails to see that the abuser must be removed, given his flexible approach on other issues.  Deputy Coughlan was quite wrong to say that in cases where abuse was not proved and there was only a suspicion of abuse no aspersion should be cast on the potential abuser. Aspersions are cast on the young people who make the allegations.  It is appalling to take young people out of their environment and send them to a home.  I remember listening to embittered crying mothers on the Marian Finucane programme whose children were taken away from them by the Eastern Health Board because their violent husbands abused the children.</P>
    <P>It is remarkable that the Minister should see fit to mislead the Committee and raise expectations.  It was dealt with in the consultation paper originally.  He came calmly into the House and said &ldquo;at this time&rdquo; as if there was another time, when there is no other time only now in <Col N="2047" /> this Bill.  It is despicable and shameful.  If the Minister had any self-respect he would give a commitment to the House that when this Bill goes to the Seanad he will introduce an amendment.  The Minister can rest assured that we will vote on each of these amendments.</P>

      <P>I accept Deputy Yates's <i>bona fides</i> no matter how expansive his language.  Since we are discussing the Law Reform Commission Report on Child Sexual Abuse we might quote other relevant passages.  On page 32, paragraph 3.35 it states:</P>
      <P>We emphasise that, if removal of an alleged abuser by a barring order made on an <i>ex parte</i> basis were to be contemplated, it could only be in the most extreme circumstances.  Removal of a parent on an <i>ex parte</i> basis is clearly a drastic remedy in terms of its effects on the rights and on the welfare of the parent.  In addition it may not always guarantee the safety of the child.</P>

      <P>I support the very strong case made by this side of the House and share in the great disappointment we feel that the Minister has not moved in <Col N="2048" /> this area as he indicated he might and as was recommended in the Law Reform Commission report.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage of this Bill our approach to the child at risk was based on the fundamental principle that you take the child out of the situation.  We began to argue on Second Stage that we should examine that.  There may be some advantage in legislating 100 years late in that we can benefit from the experience of other countries.  The Toronto Protocol was pointed to and the view was expressed that the direction child care legislation should go in was to remove the offender rather than the child.  The Law Reform Commission came out in favour of that approach.</P>
      <P>I share the view that this is a grave defect in the legislation and join with the requests made by others that it should be accepted as a fundamental element in our new thinking in relation to children at risk of abuse which should become the essential philosophical plank in how we care for them.  It is very important and highly desirable.  I hope the Minister will respond, if not today, in the Seanad, to the depth of feeling expressed here and to the general disappointment that I am sure will be expressed by other organisations as the news spreads to those who are directly concerned on a daily basis in a voluntary and professional capacity in the area of child care.  The Minister's attitude is out of keeping with his response to other amendments.</P>

We were told the exact same thing then, that it would be unconstitutional to interfere in the intimacy of family life.</P>

      <P>The Minister at the time, the former Deputy Cooney, had the courage to bring in barring orders.  I think this country was the first in these islands to do so and indeed, in many jurisdictions, the practice does not exist even today.  I cannot stress strongly enough how important this measure is and how wrong and unjust it is for this House to refuse to give that protection which has been in existence for 15 years for wives who have been abused.  In refusing to accept this amendment, the Minister is discriminating against children.  The amendment deals with children who are not of a marriage, children of a marriage have this protection.  A parent can now go to a court and get a barring order to protect the children.</P>
      <P>The Minister is saying that children who are born to people living together because they cannot be divorced and remarry in this country will be discriminated against.  If the Minister thinks about it, he will realise that that is what he is saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2050" /> The proposal in regard to the constitutionality of the measure was considered by the Law Reform Commission and they took this matter very seriously. Those of us involved in this area went to seminars and working parties and gave our commitment with all the other people involved in this area.  The Law Reform Commission Report says, in regard to constitutionality, that where the welfare of a child is in question it seems probable that the constitutional duty to vindicate the rights of a child by presenting further reviews would justify the barring procedure. I accept, as the Minister said, that there may not be that many circumstances in which it might be necessary to implement it but it should be there for the extreme cases.  It should be a part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Other things may flow from a barring order, such as non-molestation clauses and protection orders.  Surely the Minister will consider the provision of a protection order, which is part of the barring order procedure?  This is not the end of the matter, I am sorry but this is a threat. It will come up again and again.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 47:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2053" /> In page 9, line 24, after &ldquo;Garda Síochána&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or a social worker employed by the Health Board as such&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This matter was discussed by the Special Committee on 30 February and a satisfactory resolution was not found on that occasion.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 48, in the names of Deputies Howlin and Ferris, is better than mine.  The issue at stake is whether the Garda Síochána should be the sole people or are the most appropriate people to take children into care or carry out emergency care orders.  The notion of bringing a criminal environment into this by the presence of uniformed gardaí is not entirely satisfactory.  At present the Garda Síochána, under the provisions of Part III of the Bill, may remove a child to safety.  Elsewhere in the Bill we have excluded the role of the Garda barracks and diminished the role of the Garda and put social workers, or other specialised personnel, in place.</P>
    <P>In his reply at the Special Committee the Minister stated that he did not think that powers that were available to gardaí should be conferred also on health board staff.  He said it would not be suitable to have them barging in and taking away children in the way gardaí would.  The best balance is achieved in amendment No. 48 which asks that gardaí be accompanied by health board personnel on all occasions, that the tone of the whole approach be not a confrontational criminal type one by gardaí and that instead we have a more professional approach.</P>
    <P>The same points apply in the case of amendments Nos. 52 and 61 in my name. In relation to amendment No. 61, in some cases a designated social worker should be substituted for a member of the Garda Síochána regarding visitation arrangements, inspection of family home circumstances, supervision orders and so on.  This is an important matter and is not one that can be rectified by regulations subsequently, neither is it a matter that can be regulated by the courts subsequently. It is a matter for this House <Col N="2054" /> and one that should be dealt with now.  I ask the Minister to accept some of the amendments to ensure that the Garda, who are very busy dealing with criminal and serious indictable offences, are not left to deal with the most sensitive of family circumstances involving children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important issue.  We had much discussion on it on Committee Stage on 13 February and I have given much thought to it since.  We had a concensus built that gardaí arriving by themselves into a situation of conflict, where a child is the victim, may not be the most reassuring comfort for the child. I read with care again the Minister's argument against devolving the function exclusively to a social worker to act independently. I am cognisant of the argument put forward by him on that occasion that there could be a very violent reaction and that it would not be proper to put somebody, such as a social worker, into that difficult situation.</P>
      <P>On balance we should allow, as suggested by the Minister, the Garda Síochána to implement and enforce the law but that he or she act on the advice of the social worker for the health board concerned. That is most important.  The amendment may not appear very important but for the garda acting in that situation it would be of the utmost importance that he or she have the benefit of a trained social worker to advise him or her.</P>
      <P>If we do not amend the procedure it will be left to the member of the Garda Síochána to decide that he has reasonable grounds for taking action.  If amendment No. 48 in the names of Deputy Ferris and I is accepted it will be left to the garda who arrives at the scene to decide if there are reasonable grounds to act or, if he is advised by a social worker employed by a health board, that the other conditions are met and that the child is at serious risk.  That is a considerable improvement on the Bill as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Yates said, we have moved away from much of the police, Garda station, officialdom and cold aspects of the Bill that were initially ensconsed in it <Col N="2055" /> towards the caring areas so that the victim is not further terrified by a procedure which is designed to protect, save and intervene on his or her behalf.  I urge the Minister to consider the two amendments. I appreciate Deputy Yates suggesting that amendment No. 48 is the more appropriate one and I urge the Minister to accept it.  There was nothing in his arguments on Committee Stage that would in any way rule against acceptance of amendment No. 48.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a number of points to elaborate our concern about the section as drafted.  I would refer the Minister to his reply to the debate in Special Committee.  If the section remains as drafted the Garda Síochána, following a call from a distressed parent, would act if they had reasonable grounds for believing that a child had been or is being assaulted or illtreated. That may arise late at night but the complaint is likely to come from a social worker.  We hope by inserting the words &ldquo;or is advised by a social worker ...&rdquo; that social workers would know they have the power to consult the gardaí to help them enforce an order.  There may be a difficulty if there is not a link between the two agencies.  The garda is important because he is the closest agent of law enforcement.  The uniform may be an inhibiting factor and may be frightening for the child but if a social worker is involved either in consultation with the garda or accompanying the garda it would lessen the trauma that may arise, particularly if the social worker, having worked in that area, has reason to believe that the intervention of the Garda Síochána is necessary.  That is the view the Minister expressed at the Special Committee.  We are trying to meet the Minister's views and have the section as strong as possible.</P>

      <P>I support the amendments for the reasons already stated. Gardaí may be first on the scene in certain circumstances but, without doubt, the people in the front line in cases of family problems are the social workers.  If the <Col N="2056" /> section is adopted without the amendment social workers may say, &ldquo;That is not my job, that is the garda's job&rdquo;.  A child may be at risk, abused, assaulted, ill-treated or neglected.  In those circumstances there may be a delay before action is taken.  It is imperative that the social worker, who is always in the front line in such matters, should be involved. For that reason I support the amendments.</P>

      <P>The purpose of amendment No. 49 is to clarify the circumstances in which a garda will be able, without warrant, to remove a child to safety and also to grant to the Garda the powers of entry for the purposes of this section. At the Special Committee there was an interesting debate about the circumstances in which the Garda should be able to intervene in child abuse cases.  I think it is fair to say that there was a consensus that the Garda should be able to remove a child without warrant only in exceptional cases, for example, where there is a threat of serious violence or where violence has actually been committed. It was agreed by all sides that in the vast majority of cases the removal of a child should only be considered after the careful assessment by the social workers and other professionals of the <Col N="2057" /> child's needs and the overall family situation.</P>
      <P>Where admission to care is considered desirable the usual procedure would be for the health board to seek an emergency care order or to apply for a full care order.  However, cases will arise where the risk to the child is so serious and immediate that it would not be sufficient to follow these procedures.  Amendment No. 49 makes it clear that in such cases a garda will be empowered to intervene without warrant to take a child to safety.</P>
      <P>The second part of the amendment &mdash; I think this covers the points made by Deputy Yates &mdash; contains two features which are not in the current provision and which were raised at the Special Committee.  First, it provides that a garda may be accompanied by other persons, for example, a social worker or doctor, when he goes to remove a child.  Secondly, in order to ensure that there is no doubt about the matter, the Garda are being given a specific power to enter houses and other premises or places in order to remove a child.</P>
      <P>I hope this amendment will be acccepted and that Deputy Yates will consider withdrawing his amendments Nos. 47 and 61.  Perhaps Deputies Howlin and Ferris will withdraw their amendment in the light of what I have proposed in amendment No. 49.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mary Wallace gave me notice of her intention to raise on the Adjournment the matter of Ashbourne second level school and the sanctioning of stage 5 of the building of same.

      <NameTxt>Miss Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this issue, which is very important to the people of Ashbourne and County Meath generally.  Ashbourne is the second largest population area in County Meath. This area, which is close to Dublin, is growing and it is very important that a second level school be provided there.</P>
      <P>At present there are three primary schools in Ashbourne but the second level students from the town have to attend a school in Dublin.  This means these children are removed from their environment and natural community.  It also means that they have to undertake the extra activities involved in their education, for example, games, debates, etc., in another area.  Naturally, their loyalty is divided between their school and home location.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been pointed out in the past, new satellite towns such as Ashbourne lack an integrated social and educational infrastructure.  I believe the people of Ashbourne are lucky enough not to have had any serious problems in this regard. However, it was to ensure the provision of such community structures and services and to serve the expanded community that I was elected the local TD for that area.  I stood for the Dáil because I believed places like Ashbourne and other areas in County Meath should not be seen as mere adjuncts of Dublin city. <Col N="2059" /> Ashbourne and other towns are towns in their own right and as they grow each and every aspect of the community needs to be developed.</P>
    <P>Community development, whether at local or national level, is a question of partnership.  There has been a longstanding local group in Ashbourne who support the provision of this second level school project.  I call it a project because we in Ashbourne know that if it is to succeed there will have to be co-ordination at various levels, community, county council and, most importantly, natural level and, in relation to the school, the Department of Education. Many of the problems which arose in relation to the planning application and access to public lands have been sorted out at council level.  I was glad to have been involved in that process.</P>
    <P>At national level, I am proud that the Government and, in particular, the Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, have responded in a very positive way to the request for a second level school for Ashbourne.  Following my representations, the Minister met the local school committee in 1989 and again earlier this year.  The Minister authorised further meetings between the school committee and officials in her Department. All these meetings have proved to be very helpful.</P>
    <P>I have been given a mandate by the people of Ashbourne to push this issue. I should like to thank the Minister for Education for acknowledging the need for this school.  In the past year-and-a-half considerable progress has been made in regard to the completion of the outline sketch of the scheme, the detailed drawings and specifications.  While I am pleased that so much has been achieved, I hope the Minister will be in a position to sanction stage 5 of the school and to authorise the work to commence.</P>
    <P>Given the progress made in recent months, I do not want the issue of this school to be reduced to a party political one &mdash; I use the word &ldquo;reduced&rdquo; advisedly.  The argument for this school <Col N="2060" /> is obvious, both on educational and demographic grounds &mdash; the town of Ashbourne simply needs this school. We have achieved more over the past 18 months than all the huffing and puffing that went on before by people who wanted to make political capital out of this issue and to reduce it to party political slogans and propaganda.  Progress has been made in this area as a result of a combination of local initiative, representations made to the Minister for Education and, most importantly, the support we have received from her.  We will continue to provide the best for the people of Ashbourne at all levels.  It is in this context that I now ask the Minister to approve stage five of the school and to authorise the work to commence.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Wallace for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  The Adjournment Debate can be used by Members on all sides of the House to very good intent.  It gives Members a chance to raise what are local issues but issues which can be translated into national issues also so that they can be debated in the House in a non-combative and progressive way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I always associate Deputy Wallace with this school because since I took up office she, both as a Senator and a Deputy, has been very much abreast of developments in this regard.  As the Deputy rightly said, there have been some hiccups along the way.  As those of us in the House know, it is much easier to proceed with the provision of a national school which contains two, four, six or eight rooms than with a second level school project which can give rise to problems, for example, in regard to money, site plans, the acquisition of land, planning permission and the possibility of encroaching on other people's preserves and territories. All these problems need to be ironed out but this is not always evident to the correctly impatient parent or community person involved in a project who sees the possibilities of each step being delayed or obviated in one way or another.  As Deputy Wallace has said, the <Col N="2061" /> revised stage 3 sketch scheme proposals were approved by my Department a few months ago and the design team pressed ahead with the preparation of the fourth and detailed stage.</P>
    <P>About 12 months or so ago the cross-party delegation came to see me to present their case as one of urgency which I duly took on board; yet the deputation were fully aware of the hurdles which had to be overcome before we could proceed to the various stages of design.  I am very pleased to be in a position to report to Deputy Wallace and the wider community in Ashbourne that the technical examination of the stage 4 plans has recently been completed in my Department and I will immediately instruct my Department to request the design team for the project to prepare the next stage, that is stage 5, the bill of quantities.  That is one of the last major hurdles to be faced.</P>
    <P>Having seen all the young primary children pouring out on to the street from their primary schools and having noticed the many houses which have been built there, I believe Ashbourne is a town which has been developed in an imaginative way on a green field site in a lovely environment and hinterland.  The community want the best education for their children rather than have them board buses to go to schools in neighbouring parts of County Meath or County Dublin. I am aware that the majority of these receive excellent education, but this town deserves a decent and proper second level school.  This development on a green field site will be unique in that it will not represent a combination of a vocational and secondary schools resulting from demographic changes, the usual community school or college, but springs right up from the needs of the people.  Ashbourne Community School as of tomorrow will proceed to stage five and I have no doubt that I will be back here again responding to questions from Deputy Mary &ldquo;Ashbourne&rdquo; Wallace.</P>

      <P>The condition of the Garda station in Carrick-on-Suir is an example not only of sheer neglect but utter decay.  I regret to say that it is an insult to the people expected to work within it.  It is a disgrace that the Minister and the Department have allowed this building to decay to such an appalling state.  That it has been allowed to remain in such a mess for such a long period of time is an indication perhaps not only of indifference but also of a lack of appreciation on the part of the Minister of the conditions under which the Garda are expected to work.</P>
      <P>Taking the risk of horrifying you, a Cheann Comhairle, and all those listening tonight, I will try as adequately as I can to describe the almost indescribable condition at Carrick-on-Suir Garda station. The building is antiquated and in its present state it is totally unsuited for a modern police force.  It is riddled with dampness and as a result the plaster is falling from the walls, cracks are evident throughout the entire structure, the paintwork is stained and chipped, the wallpaper hangs loosely from the walls, the ceiling is leaking in many parts and there is a constant smell of dampness and decay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to this dreary scene, there is an abundance of rats and mice throughout the entire building.  Many of the rooms are unusable and the kitchen is scarcely adequate for preparing a simple cup of tea.  There is no heating of any type in the locker rooms and because of this uniforms or any clothing becomes unwearable after a short period of time. Water flows freely through the roof of the bathroom and all the walls in the downstairs toilets are cracked and broken.  Further, the kitchen has to be used as an interview room, which is hardly an encouraging environment for carrying out what is perhaps the most essential part of police work.  To put it mildly, hygiene is primitive in that the equipment for testing suspected drunk <Col N="2063" /> drivers has to be kept in the already described kitchen.</P>
    <P>I would like to inform the Minister that despite those appalling conditions the entire Garda force in Carrick-on-Suir are to be congratulated and commended on the standard of service they deliver.  They can boast of a detection rate of between 65 per cent and 70 per cent in their area and if we compare this with the national rate of 33.3 per cent it speaks volumes for the dedication and work of the police force in Carrick-on-Suir.  Surely they deserve better conditions.  Furthermore, this saga has been going on for almost eight years and I certainly claim that they deserve better.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question I tabled, the Minister stated today that the Commissioners of Public Works expect that tenders will be invited.  The people and the Garda of Carrick-on-Suir have had their expectations for too long and they will not be satisfied with a reply bearing the word &ldquo;expectations&rdquo; and containing no definite information.  The Minister also stated that a contract would be placed in the New Year.  I should point out to him that the New Year will have 12 months just like this year and Carrick-on-Suir cannot wait until the latter end of the New Year for improvements to be carried out on this Garda station.  I appeal to him to take urgent action having regard to the appalling condition of the Garda station, and I certainly hope that his response tonight will be far more definite and concise than the reply I got earlier today to the question I had tabled.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Daly, who is away on Government business, to respond to Deputy Ahearn's motion.  I would like to thank her for outlining the problems being experienced by the Garda in Carrick-on-Suir and for giving me the opportunity on behalf of the Minister of State to provide in this House details of what the Office of Public Works <Col N="2064" /> and the Department of Justice propose to do to relieve these problems.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works are aware of the need to improve the station and it is on their priority list of centres needing attention.  They have also had detailed consultations with both the Department of Justice and the Garda about the various items requiring attention at this location.  Deputy Ahearn will be aware at this stage of the reply given earlier today to the Parliamentary Question on this subject to which she has alluded.  The latest position regarding Carrick-on-Suir Garda station is that following consultation with the Garda authorities and the Department of Justice which I have mentioned, the Office of Public Works prepared a scheme of major improvement works.  That scheme provides for refurbishment and alteration works to the ground, first and second floors of the building as well as a number of external improvements.  The contract documents for the scheme are now ready and the Office of Public Works expect to invite tenders early in the New Year.  The commissioners are confident that these works will relieve the problems being experienced and greatly improve the working environment of the members of the Garda Síochána stationed there.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works were recently informed of the water and sewerage problems to which Deputy Ahearn has referred.  This was reported to the Office of Public Works by the Garda authorities who are responsible for maintenance of this nature.  The Commissioners of Public Works have now been asked by the Garda authorities, as the relevant State agency, to attend to the matter and as a result the Office of Public Works are engaging a contractor to rectify the problem.  This is being undertaken immediately.  I can assure the Deputy that the Office of Public Works are fully aware of the problem, that the matter will be attended to.  On behalf of the State, I can say we have made a major investment in the Carrick-on-Suir area in recent years.</P>

      <P>Deputy Carey has given me notice of his intention to raise the matter of the Department of Social Welfare inspectors who are diligently applying the regulations when reviewing long-term unemployment recipients particularly with regard to the &ldquo;not genuinely seeking employment&rdquo; clause.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has some five minutes to present his case and the Minister five minutes to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Creed, who has had similar experiences to mine.</P>
      <P>Many unemployed people are being disallowed their claims by officials of the Department who use the provisions of section 138 (1) (b) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, the section which contains the phase &ldquo;not genuinely seeking work and unable to find suitable employment&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In the administration of these regulations the applications of many people in my constituency have been disallowed. I want to know from the Minister what are the criteria used in defining or determining which persons are genuinely seeking work.  That appears to be the major issue.  What are the relevant criteria?  For example, does the Minister insist that all applicants must cycle to three factory gates and return with three letters, or exactly what does he require of such applicants?  It is doubtful how the departmental appeals officers arrive at such decisions.  In all cases in my experience in my constituency applicants had furnished three letters.  Yet some were successful in their claims and others disallowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have suspicions about the written instructions to these unfortunate departmental officials.  It appears to me that they are instructed to lean on the side of rejection and, in so doing, will spare their masters a great deal of money.  Surely the Minister should take into account the matter of discretion on the part of his officers in such cases, instructing them to <Col N="2066" /> decide in favour of applicants, particularly bearing in mind that they comprise the most vulnerable section of society.  In addition, the Minister will be well aware that everybody offered a job will accept it.</P>
    <P>To date any answers given in this respect have been unsatisfactory.  The Minister owes it to such applicants &mdash; particularly when one remembers that the Christmas bonus is due to the long term unemployed &mdash; to acknowledge that this is a particularly bad time to have their applications disallowed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Carey for agreeing to share his time with me.  I share his concern in regard to interpretation of the clause, which has resulted in numerous unemployment assistance and unemployed benefit applicants being turned down on the grounds that they are not genuinely seeking employment. Within my brief experience of public life I have found that the greatest single issue brought to my attention, across a range of Government Departments, is that of social welfare applicants for unemployment assistance or benefit being refused their claims for spurious reasons. Many, in support of their applications, have been able to furnish a number of letters from industrial concerns showing that they have been refused employment. I have never experienced anything like the anxiety they feel in advance of the hearing of their appeals and their subsequent distress when genuine applicants are refused.</P>
      <P>I share Deputy Carey's assumption that the instructions being issued would appear to be that they should err on the side of officialdom rather than on that of the applicant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one extremely disturbing trend I should like to bring to the Minister's attention, that is discrimination against women in relation to their applications for unemployment assistance and benefit, particularly in the case of married women's applications.  It appears there is a high level of distrust on the part of officialdom of their intentions in regard to such applications.  I <Col N="2067" /> might cite the example of a constituent of mine, a former bank employee who worked in Dublin, moved to the bank in Cork, got married and took voluntary redundancy for economic reasons, with the full intention of returning to the workplace.  Her repeated efforts have been refused.  Her application for unemployment benefit has gone for oral hearing. She has initiated a fresh application for unemployment benefit and is going tomorrow to attend her second oral hearing.  I would suggest to the Minister that no non-genuine applicant would go so far in pursuit of a false claim.  I appeal to the Minister to investigate that aspect of the dissatisfaction with the relevant clause.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>Both Deputies Carey and Creed have mentioned officials of my Department receiving instructions.  I should say first that instructions are set out in legislation. These are statutory officers working under legislation passed by this House.  One of the statutory conditions for the receipt of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance is that claimants must be available for and genuinely seeking but unable to find employment suitable to them having regard to their age, sex, physique, education, normal occupation, place of residence and family circumstances.  The legislation also provides that the onus is on individual claimants to prove they are genuinely seeking work.  Accordingly, it is a question for the deciding officers and appeals oficers to decide whether any claimant has shown that he or she fulfils the condition having regard to the available evidence.  There are no instructions given; they are given by the House and statutory officers work in accordance with the instructions contained in the legislation.  Let us be clear about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All claimants are asked, when making a claim for unemployment benefit or assistance, to complete a questionnaire regarding their efforts to obtain employment. Subsequently, at any stage of their claim, claimants may also be asked about this matter.  In most cases, the replies <Col N="2068" /> given by claimants to this questionnaire will, when taken in conjunction with other evidence available regarding the claimant's employment history, be sufficient to satisfy the deciding officer that the person concerned is genuinely seeking work.  However, if there is any element of doubt about the position, the deciding officer may seek further relevant information on such matters as the extent to which the claimant has made efforts to obtain employment since becoming unemployed; the type of work the claimant is seeking and the reasons for any restrictions the claimant may be placing on the type of work he or she is available to do; whether there are domestic or other commitments or circumstances which limit the claimant's ability to accept full-time employment which would normally be regarded as suitable and whether the claimant has a history of leaving employments frequently, without good cause.</P>
    <P>It is on the basis of the replies given to questions such as these that the deciding officer determines whether the person is or is not available for and genuinely seeking work.  Each case has to be considered on its own merits.  It is a matter for the deciding officer to decide the exact evidence required in any case having regard to the individual circumstances of the claimant.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey raised one individual case.  The person concerned has been in receipt of unemployment payments continuously since 1983.  He was interviewed regarding his efforts to obtain work and arising out of his reply his claim was submitted to a deciding officer for review. His claim was disallowed from 24 October 1990 on the grounds that he had not made any specific efforts to get work. The deciding officer's decision was based on the information submitted by the interviewing officer.  The interviewing officer's report had previously been read to the claimant.</P>
    <P>He appealed the deciding officer's decision and was afforded an oral hearing of his appeal on 5 December 1990.  The appeals officer also took the view that <Col N="2069" /> he was not genuinely seeking work and confirmed the disallowance.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the officers in my Department who are concerned with the administration of the unemployment payments schemes act with integrity and objectivity in their work and apply the relevant provisions of the Social Welfare Acts in a fair and impartial way. Officials are insulated from outside pressures in giving decisions under the Acts and operate independently of the Minister of the day.</P>
    <P>People's rights, in so far as entitlement to social welfare is concerned, are enshrined in the Social Welfare Acts. Under these Acts, it is open to any person who is aggrieved by the decision of a deciding officer to appeal to an appeals officer.  Like deciding officers, appeals officers have statutory independence. This has always been the case.  However, even though justice is being done, it is important in my opinon that it be clearly seen to be done.  For this reason I have recently established the appeals system as a separate independent office &mdash; a development which was widely welcomed by Deputies.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out to the Deputy that in this case &mdash; as in all others &mdash; I am in the hands of the deciding officers and the appeals officers who make decisions under statute.  We may send questions to them or present new evidence to them but we must recognise the independence of their decisions.  It boils down to the fact that neither the deciding officer nor the appeals officer who heard the claimant in person and who were carrying out their statutory functions were prepared to accept that he was genuinely seeking work.  If he has further evidence in support of his case which he feels would be helpful, I would be happy to arrange for an early review of his claim.</P>
    <P>In relation to the case Deputy Creed mentioned of someone taking voluntary redundancy from the bank and then having difficulties subsequently in getting unemployment payment, if the Deputy wishes to give me the details of that case I will inquire into it.</P>

You could not get a more ridiculous situation than that, even in the armed forces of Ruritania.  I do not know what excuse the Minister will make but I do know there is no transport whatever available for the 24 sub-units of the FCA in the Eastern Command and the same, virtually, goes for the rest of the country. How can you maintain morale among the volunteers, especially when they know the previous Minister for Defence promised 60 station wagons?  This information was circulated to the FCA members but none of these vehicles has been delivered.  Station wagons are needed for the basic task of transferring rifles, machine guns and training stores from the barracks to the training centres in towns and villages, one wagon for each sub-unit.  I want to know what the Minister is going to do about it.</P>

      <P>Programmes for modernisation of the Defence Forces transport fleet commenced in 1988.  This programme is based on the disposal of obsolete non-servicable vehicles and their replacement on a phased basis for new vehicles.  As part of this programme a contract was placed in August 1990 for the purchase of 20 mini-buses for use by the FCA and delivery of these vehicles will be completed by the end of this month.  It is also intended to purchase an additional 35 new mini-buses for use by the FCA in 1991, with other FCA vehicles being replaced as financial resources permit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2071" /> On the more general question of training, I would like to point out that mechanical transport is not required for all local training of FCA units and the suggestion that training has been virtually abandoned is not correct.  In the event of an FCA unit not having sufficient transport available for a particular occasion, vehicles assigned to the Permanent Defence Force are made freely available to transport FCA personnel. Furthermore, civilian transport is hired <Col N="2072" /> for the movement of FCA personnel in training, with £109,000 being spent in the first ten months of 1990.  I am satisfied that a programme for the modernisation of the FCA's transport fleet is making a very positive contribution to the FCA training and that overall efficiency will benefit as a result, and these efforts will continue.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>

      <Quest>the reason the estimated cost to the Exchequer of section 84 loans has doubled since 1984.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>According to estimates prepared by the Revenue Commissioners, the gross cost to the Exchequer of domestic-sourced section 84 loans almost doubled from a figure of £69 million for 1984 to a figure of £128 million in 1989. However, the net cost after taking into account the yield from the levy on section 84 loan interest, which was introduced in 1986, is estimated to have risen by only 49 per cent from 1984 to £103 million in 1989.</P>
      <P>It would appear that the two main factors responsible for the increased cost are the increase in the volume of such loans between 1984 and 1989 and the use in recent years of high coupon section 84 loans.  The increased tax loss arises because both these factors result in the bank concerned receiving a much higher amount of tax-free interest from the borrower and having much higher funding costs for off-setting against its taxable income from other lending.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, measures were taken in the 1989 and 1990 Finance Acts to restrict the growth of section 84 lending, the principal features of which were to impose ceilings on the volume of section 84 loans which could be made by existing section 84 lenders. As the figures quoted above for 1989 relate to accounting periods ending not later than 31 March 1989, they do not reflect the effect of the measures in the 1989 or 1990 Finance Acts.</P>

      <Quest>if, in view of the fact that Ireland has been a full member of the EC since 1973, he will outline the reason exchange rate of the Irish pound vis-à-vis other EC currencies is not publicly displayed, quoted or available to Irish people visiting these countries; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the relatively small size of the potential business, banks abroad, particularly those located outside the main population centres, encounter little demand for Irish currency notes.  A bank on the Continent which accepts Irish notes generally has little option but to send them for credit to their Irish correspondent bank.  Handling, postage and insurance costs make this procedure rather expensive.  Some banks abroad have therefore been reluctant to accept, or to quote a rate for, Irish currency notes.</P>
      <P>The decision to exchange or quote a rate for Irish currency notes is a commercial decision for each individual bank. The Central Bank of Ireland has no authority over banks operating in other EC countries, and therefore is not in a position to require individual banks in those countries to accept and supply Irish currency.</P>
      <P>The Irish pound is, however, quoted on foreign exchange markets and in principal banks and foreign exchange retailers abroad.</P>

      <P>The Government decided on 1 August 1989 that all services, including publications, provided by the Government Supplies Agency would operate on a repayment basis with effect from 1 January 1990.</P>
      <P>The position before 1 January 1990 had been that the cost of publications was borne on the Vote for the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>No moneys, therefore, are available within the Vote for the Office of Public Works to fund the cost of free issues of the Dáil and Seanad Official Reports to embassies.</P>
      <P>As I indicated when replying to a similar question 19 June 1990, five embassies agreed to pay subscription charges in 1990 for copies of Dáil and Seanad Official Reports while 13 other embassies which had received the publications free of charge in 1989 did not apply for inclusion on the agency's 1990 subscription list.</P>
      <P>The total annual cost of supplying the Official Reports to all embassies in Dublin would have been £5,740.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 42 and 97 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our latest revised estimate of total receipts from the EC Structural Funds for 1990 amounts to £523.63 million, of <Col N="1822" /> which £410.247 million has already been received.</P>
    <P>A breakdown of total structural spending on a subregional basis is being sent to each of the subregional review committees set up to monitor the Community Support Framework at subregional level.  The breakdown gives details of actual expenditure undertaken in each of the subregions in 1989, an estimate of the likely outturn in 1990 and a three-year combined forecast for the years 1991-1993.  The breakdown shows by main programme area, EC aid commitments, the structural spending associated with that aid and, in addition, the extra investment in structural spending which is funded entirely from domestic resources.  This breakdown will be updated regularly for the various subregional review committees.</P>
    <P>I am arranging to have copies of the subregional breakdown of expenditure for each subregion placed in the Dáil Library for the information of Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Claims for payments of EC moneys are made by three central Government Departments, namely the Departments of Finance, Labour and Agriculture and Food, and are co-ordinated nationally on a sectoral basis.  A regional breakdown is not available in respect of these receipts.</P>
    <P>I propose to circulate in the Official Report a tabular statement showing a sectoral breakdown of receipts from the EC by way of the Structural Fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department have been unable to trace the representations referred to by the Deputy.  I would point out in any event that payments on redundancy already benefit from favourable tax treatment.  Statutory redundancy payments under the Redundancy Payments Acts are exempt from tax.  In addition, the first £6,000 of any <i>ex gratia</i> payment made to an individual on termination of employment is exempt from tax, and this £6,000 may be increased to £10,000 in certain circumstances.  As an alternative to the £6,000, or to the £6,000 as <Col N="1825" /> increased, a taxpayer may claim exemption of an amount known as the standard capital superannuation benefit (SCSB). Briefly, this is calculated as 5 per cent of the individual's average yearly salary, averaged over the last three years of service, for each year of service, less any tax-free lump sum which is received or receivable under any approved or statutory pension schemes, or which he has an option to receive in the future under such a pension scheme.  Where a taxpayer's <i>ex gratia</i> payment exceeds the £6,000, or the £6,000 as increased, or the SCSB amount, the excess liable to tax is subject to a further measure of relief known as top-slicing relief, which ensures that it is not the taxpayer's current marginal rate of tax, but his average rate over the previous five years which is applied to the excess.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to improve this treatment further.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that the current provisions of the tax code, including the urban renewal incentives, are conducive to the preservation of architectural heritage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1826" /> A general income tax relief is available, subject to certain conditions, for expenditure by an owner or occupier on the repair or restoration of a building determined by the Office of Public Works to be of intrinsic significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest, provided reasonable access to the building is afforded to the public.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Finance Act, 1989, provides for income tax relief on expenditure on the repair or restoration of houses in designated areas that are determined by the Office of Public Works to be of signficant scientific, historical, architectural, or aesthetic interest.  The relief consists of an income tax deduction in respect of 25 per cent of such expenditure incurred in a year of assessment by an individual on such a house which is his sole or main residence, with a further 5 per cent allowable in each of the following five years, that is a total deduction of 50 per cent.  I would also point out that mortgage interest relief is, of course, available, subject to the usual conditions, in respect of the purchase or repair of a taxpayer's principal or sole residence.</P>
    <P>Expenditure incurred on the upkeep, including refurbishment, of commercial buildings, situated both in designated and non-designated areas, can qualify for tax relief.  Under the normal expenses rules such expenditure may be allowable for tax purposes if incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the trade or profession carried on in the building.</P>
    <P>The main tax incentive under the urban renewal scheme which is of greatest significance in relation the preservation of architectural heritage is the owner-occupier allowance.  This is an allowance for owner occupiers equal to half of the cost of construction or refurbishment of private dwellings.</P>

      <P>I would draw the Deputy's attention to my statement made to the House in response to a similar question from Deputy Pat McCartan recently.  I have nothing further to add to that statement at this point.</P>

      <P>In replying to the Deputy's question, I must first draw his attention to Article 28.4.3 of the Constitution, which requires the Government to prepare the Estimates and present them to the Dáil for consideration.  The proposal referred to in the question, that the Oireachtas would present its own Estimate to the Dáil, would therefore create constitutional difficulties.</P>
      <P>The present procedure is that the Estimate for the Oireachtas is prepared by the Oireachtas in response to the Estimates circular which my Department sends to all Government Departments and Offices annually.  The internal arrangements whereby the Estimate for the Oireachtas is drawn up are essentially a matter for the Ceann Comhairle and the officers of the Oireachtas.  As is the case for all other Votes, the Oireachtas Estimate, as presented, is examined by my Department in the light of Government policy in relation to public spending prior to its submission to Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under new arrangements operating for the first time this year, if my Department propose to recommend reductions on the draft Estimate, these proposals are forwarded to the Oireachtas for written <Col N="1828" /> response in advance of the Government's consideration of the Estimate.</P>
    <P>Finally, all Estimates are considered by the Government in the context of the ongoing budgetary constraints and, constitutional considerations nothwithstanding, having Estimates considered in isolation from this could lead to a weakening in overall financial control.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for centralised management and language training in the Civil Service rests with the Civil Service Training Centre (CSTC) of my Department.</P>
      <P>The management training provided by the CSTC comprises basic conferences for each grade, which focus on the management role of the grade in question. These conferences are supplemented by a programme of short intensive courses in key management skills such as managing staff and other resources, objective setting and performance measurement and communications skills, designed to improve personal effectiveness.  Organisations development projects are also undertaken.</P>
      <P>As regards languages, training with a practical work focus is provided in both French and German by the language training unit.  Gaeleagras provides training aimed at developing the capability of civil servants to work through Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1829" /> The information sought by the Deputy in relation to the numbers of staff in the CSTC dedicated exclusively to language and management training at 1 November 1987 and 1 November 1990 and the number of participants who attended language and management training in 1988, 1989 and 1990, to date, is set out in tabular statements which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
    <P>No fundamental changes in the operations of the CSTC are envisaged for 1991.  The intention is to continue to develop the services being provided by the centre and to ensure that such services are meeting the specific needs of client Departments.</P>
    <P>The Institute of Public Administration (IPA) is a State agency in receipt of a grant-in-aid from my Department.  The amount of the grant in 1990 is £994,000. Given its agency status, there is close co-operation between the IPA and my <Col N="1830" /> Department; my Department are represented on the board of the institure.  In the training area, there is also close co-operation between the IPA and the CSTC on matters affecting staff development in the public service.  In addition, the CSTC, from time to time, engage the IPA, on a contract basis, to organise on their behalf specialised training in, for example, the area of financial management. The role of the IPA in Civil Service training is kept under review on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>There is no direct financial relationship between my Department and the Irish Management Institute (IMI).  The IMI are in receipt of an annual subvention from the Department of Labour.  The amount of the subvention in 1990 was £350,000. On the training front, there is no special relationship between the CSTC and the IMI.</P>

      <P>There are approximately 210,000 self-employed taxpayers on the Revenue Commissioners' records and of these 39,000, that is 18.5 per cent, had failed to lodge their statutory return of income for 1989-90 as at 1 October 1990. Following on their successful return compliance programme for the year 1988-89, which resulted in an overall income tax return filing rate of 92 per cent, the Revenue Commissioners are about to initiate a similar programme for the year 1989-90. The return of income is one of the cornerstones of a self assessment system and it is therefore the policy of the Revenue Commissioners to ensure that taxpayers who do not meet their statutory obligation to submit a return of income will be vigorously pursued and, if necessary, prosecuted.</P>
      <P>A total of 96 inspectors have been trained for the purpose of carrying out audits under the self assessment system. Thirty-five of these are actually engaged on audit work at present and they had completed an examination of 563 returns for 1989-90 as at 30 November 1990.  A further 349 audits were in progress as at that date.  The remaining inspectors who have been trained for audit work will be progressively deployed in the audit area during the coming year.  I might also add that in the six months to the 30 June 1990 a total of 31,329 audit visits were carried out by officials in connection with the drive against the black economy and in connection with Revenue programme for the PAYE, VAT and construction industry taxes.</P>

    <P>It should be noted that the above figures do not represent established overpayments. Further investigation is necessary to establish if a repayment is due.  In the case of 1989-90 the 1990 tax return may be required to finally compute any refund due.</P>
    <P>Most of the apparent overpayments for <Col N="1837" /> companies are on hands for a short period, i.e., less than one month.</P>
    <P>The turnaround time for dealing with apparent overpayments for the self employed has improved dramatically since new administrative procedures were introduced in the autumn.  The vast majority of the repayments now on hands are for relatively small amounts.  Many of the 1989-90 cases may eventually be found not to be overpaid when the 1990 tax return details become available.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners do not, as a matter of general practice, hold repayments for setting against preliminary tax.  They consider that, primarily from the taxpayer's point of view, it is preferable that the tax liability for each year of assessment be kept separate for payment purposes.  However, any taxpayer who wishes to have an agreed repayment set against his/her preliminary tax can be facilitated.  Such a request would normally be dealt with by the appropriate inspector of taxes.</P>

      <P>The archaeological survey of Ireland has made good progress, particularly in recent years.  There are three stages, the first being the preparation of sites and monuments records.  These have now been completed for twenty counties, four more are in progress and work on the remaining two counties will be commenced in 1991 and completed in 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While resources have been concentrated on the production of the sites and monuments records, progress has also been sustained on the next stage of the archaeological survey, namely, the production of archaeological inventories. Four counties have now been published <Col N="1838" /> to this standard and work is under way on a further 12 counties.</P>
    <P>The final stage of the archaeological survey will be reached in relation to County Louth, with the publication of the detailed archaeological survey for that county in 1991.  It is not possible to say at this juncture when this stage will be reached for all counties.  In addition, an urban archaeological survey was commenced in 1982 and to date this has been completed for 23 counties.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, there is no woman serving at present as secretary of a Department and, given that among the functions of the committee is the selection of persons for appointment as secretary, it is essential that the members be of at least that rank.  For the first few years of the committee's existence no woman applied for any post within its remit.  However, in the last three years the committee have recommended four women for appointment at assistant secretary level on merit, as it is required to do.  I am hopeful that this development will continue and that in due course it will result in a woman secretary and a woman member of the committee.</P>

      <P>Emigrants' remittances are by their nature difficult to identify.  Estimates of emigrants' remittances, including asset repatriations, are included as part of the credit side of the aggregate item, International Transfers, in the Balance of International Payments statement published by the CSO.  The statement does not list the components of the international transfers item separately. However, I understand that emigrants' remittances to Ireland in both 1988 and 1989 have been estimated at between £40 million and £50 million in each year.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to special allowances under the Army Pensions Acts and not to military service pensions, which are payable, regardless of other income, to qualified veterans of the War of Independence.</P>
      <P>Unlike a military service pension, which is a payment for services rendered, a special allowance is a means-tested payment which is intended to supplement the income of needy veterans.  It is additional to normal social welfare entitlements and is exempt from income tax and PRSI. Superannuation payments, including Garda pensions, are assessable as means for special allowances purposes.</P>

      <P>Separate data are not available for profit repatriations by multinational firms.  They are included in the debit entry for &ldquo;Profits, dividends and royalties etc.&rdquo; in the balance of international payments statement published by the CSO.  Published data are available for the first half of this year, which show that gross outflows of profits, dividends and royalties amounted to £1,008 million in that period.</P>
      <P>I have already made a statement regarding these types of outflow in my written reply to a similar question by Deputy Jim Higgins, No. 36 of 10 May 1990.  I therefore repeat my statement of that time, updated as appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These outflows, to the extent that they relate to industry, should be seen in the context of the sector's turnover, which last year amounted to around £18 billion, and of industrial exports, which amounted to almost £12 billion in 1989 and almost £6 billion in the first six months of this year.  The level of profit repatriations in the first half of this year was against a background of increases of around 10.7 per cent in the volume of manufactured <Col N="1844" /> exports and of almost 5 per cent in manufactured output compared with the same period last year.  Reflecting this performance, and also the cumulative benefits of strong growth and improved competitiveness in recent years, average quarterly employment in manufacturing increased by 2.3 per cent in 1989 &mdash; the first such increase since 1980; in the first half of this year there was a further increase of 3.6 per cent, compared to the average of the first two quarters of 1989.  The ability to repatriate the profits earned by their Irish subsidiaries is an important factor in attracting foreign firms to locate here.</P>
    <P>The importance of such firms is illustrated by the fact that in 1987, the last year for which detailed statistics are available, foreign-owned enterprises accounted for 43 per cent of manufacturing employment.  IDA data indicate that in 1989 foreign industry created 8,400 new jobs, bringing their total employment to 89,000 people; in 1988 they purchased £2.8 billion worth of goods and services in Ireland and in the period 1983 to 1989 their grant-aided investment in Ireland amounted to £1.3 billion.</P>

      <Quest>if in his negotiations with the Minister for Finance of the EC and with the EC Commission he has requested consideration of the question of compensation for customs clearance agents who, with the advent of 1992, are in danger of going out of business with consequent job losses in Border areas; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>While recognising the advantages of the completion of the internal market, notably in the general improvement in access and reduction in costs to Irish firms exporting goods and services to the rest of Europe, the Irish Government have always been conscious of the associated threats to the Irish economy, amongst which will be the loss of jobs in work related to the preparation and processing of customs documentation for intra-Community trade.</P>
      <P>The concerns of the Irish Government were paramount in their negotiations with the EC on Structural Fund support under the Community Support Framework for Ireland.  The programmes supported under the CSF are in general geared to preparing for Ireland's entry into the Single Market as well as furthering the general aim of improving economic and social cohesion within Europe.</P>
      <P>The EC has no special arrangements to compensate directly individual customs clearance agents for loss of livelihood resulting from the abolition of internal frontiers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, co-funded by the EC under the CSF, a broad range of training and retraining courses, as well as advice and grant support schemes available to individuals and firms wishing to diversify into new areas of business or to set up in business for themselves.  Customs clearance agents and others threatened by the Single Market may avail of the opportunities through the national agencies responsible for these schemes, FÁS for <Col N="1846" /> training and the IDA for business development.</P>
    <P>As regards support for the Border areas of Ireland, a joint programme under the EC INTERREG initiative is currently being drawn up by the Department of Finance in collaboration with their counterparts in Belfast for submission to the European Commission early next year.  It will cover the years 1991 to 1993 and will contain measures to assist in overcoming the special development problems arising from their relative isolation both within Ireland and within the Community as a whole, in the interests of the local population in the Border area.</P>
    <P>Finally, this programme is intended to prepare for and mitigate problems associated with the advent of the Single Market.</P>

    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are keeping the situation under review; in consultation, as appropriate, with the staff interests concerned.</P>
    <P>There are no plans to relocate any Government office to Dundalk.  It is, however, the Government's intention that sections of An Post and/or Telecom Éireann will transfer to Dundalk.  Progress on this aspect of the decentralisation programme is a matter for the Minister for Communications.</P>

      <P>Tax relief is granted to employees in respect of their contributions to occupational pension schemes approved by the Revenue Commissioners for the purposes of Section 6 of the Finance Act, 1972, and is also granted in respect of employee contributions to pension schemes established under public statute.  Approved schemes may or may not require the members to make contributions towards the costs involved in providing the scheme benefits. Schemes may include provision for members to make voluntary contributions to increase their benefits within permitted limits.  The maximum benefit that may be paid to a member of an approved scheme at normal retirement date is a pension of two-thirds of final remuneration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a member contributes personally, the tax relief granted in any year in respect of the contributions is limited to 15 per cent of the remuneration for <Col N="1858" /> that year of the office or employment being pensioned.  The 15 per cent limit is inclusive of all member contributions, whether voluntary or otherwise, and the 15 per cent limit applies whether or not the member's benefits under the scheme will be up to the maximum permitted, namely pension of two-thirds of final remuneration.</P>
    <P>Employees who are not members of occupational pension schemes may effect retirement annuity contracts approved under section 35 of the Income Tax Act, 1967 &mdash; commonly referred to as personal pension schemes.  Retirement annuity contracts are also available to the self-employed as a means of providing for pension benefits in retirement.  Retirement annuity contracts are marketed by authorised life assurance companies and the maximum tax relief in any tax year in respect of an individual's contributions under such a contract is limited to 15 per cent of net relevant earnings.  The legislation does not impose a ceiling on the benefits of such a contract &mdash; this is determined by the contributions actually paid in and the investment return on such contributions.</P>

      <P>Following a period of employment from 18 April 1990 to 14 August 1990 the person concerned resumed claiming unemployment and pay-related benefit from 17 August 1990.  He is entitled to an unemployment payment of £137.10 per week made up of £134.80 unemployment benefit and £2.30 pay-related benefit.</P>
      <P>Since the period between the last day of an earlier claim and the first day of the new claim exceeded 13 weeks, his current claim has to be regarded as a new claim. The combined total of a person's pay-related benefit and unemployment benefit cannot exceed 85 per cent of a person's earnings in the relevant income tax year.  Because the earnings in the income tax year 1990-91 of the person concerned were at a reduced level, the amount of pay-related benefit payable is affected by the operation of this limit and he is only entitled to pay-related benefit on the current claim at the rate of £2.30 per week. Consequently, his overall entitlement for this claim is less than for his earlier claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of a review of his claim, it was noted that the person concerned has not been receiving pay-related benefit since it became due on 7 September 1990, <Col N="1871" /> i.e., after an 18 day waiting period.

The purpose of the scheme is to provide a means of increasing the incentive to work of people with dependent children by increasing their take-home pay relative to unemployment payments.</P>
      <P>Because of its nature the payment does not apply to social welfare recipients and there are no plans for the introduction of such a scheme for disability benefit recipients.

      <P>Regulations made by the Minister for the Environment under sections 45 and 46 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, in respect of each county specify where special speed limits (which include the 40 mph limit) apply and where exemptions from the built-up area speed limit of 30 mph apply.  In the absence of any provision to the contrary in such regulations, a speed limit of 30 mph applies to all roads in each county borough, borough, urban district and town.  Local authorities are required to provide appropriate traffic signs to indicate the locations where the speed limits operate.</P>
      <P>Regulations relating to speed limits are generally made on a county at large basis and taking account of recommendations made by local authorities, following consultation with the Garda.  It is the practice to accept local authority proposals as far as possible subject to the need, in the case of national roads, to ensure reasonable uniformity throughout the network.</P>

      <P>The planning and carrying out of refurbishment schemes to their dwellings are matters for the local authorities.  The European Communities (Protection of Workers) (Exposure to Asbestos) Regulations, 1989, provide for the safety of persons working with asbestos and require that the Health and Safety Authority, which is the relevant competent authority for this country, must be notified 28 days before asbestos is removed from a building.

      <P>Dietary guidelines prepared by the Food Advisory Committee in 1987 are available to health personnel who give information and advice to the general public on healthy eating.

      <P>In line with Government policy as outlined in the report on the psychiatric services <i>Planning for the Future,</i> the Eastern Health Board have been developing a comprehensive range of community facilities with the consequent reduction in scale of larger psychiatric institutions. One of the principal aims of this policy is to provide people who have been in psychiatric hospitals for many years with the opportunity of living an independent and autonomous life in a domestic environment in so far as they are able to do so.  The main focus of attention in this regard has been on St. Brendan's Hospital, where the number of patients resident at present is 350 as compared with approximately 1,000 in 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A five year patient rehabilitation programme has been put in train at St. Brendan's Hospital with the aim of placing as many as possible of the remaining <Col N="1892" /> patients in suitable community facilities and thereby closing wards in St. Brendan's, particularly in the older buildings.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board are endeavouring to maintain those facilities still in use at St. Brendan's Hospital at an acceptable standard of repair and decor bearing in mind the limited long-term use to which these facilities will be put.</P>

    <P>Application for recognition of a multi-denominational school is usually received in respect of an area already catered for by existing schools.  Accordingly, on foot of the rules quoted, when the establishment of a multi-denominational school is approved, recognition is granted on a provisional basis in the first instance pending experience of the enrolment at the school.  Full recognition is granted in due course, provided the schools have proved themselves to be viable.  A similar position obtains in relation to all-Irish schools.</P>

      <P>According to the current data on enrolment and student attainment for the universities and certain other institutions in the Higher Education Authority sector, the additional cost to the Exchequer of removing the means test for higher education grants would be approximately £50 million in 1990 prices.  This is based on the assumption that full maintenance and fee grants would be awarded to all who qualified under the attainments criteria.</P>

      <P>The main provisions for the <Col N="1901" /> award of a grant under the higher education grants scheme are as follows:</P>
      <P>(i)  a candidate must obtain the prescribed successes in the leaving certificate examination of this Department.  Successes in equivalent examinations do not meet this requirement;</P>
      <P>(ii)  the parents or guardians of the candidate must be ordinarily resident in the administrative area of the local authority administering the scheme on 1 October of the year preceding that in which the necessary successes are obtained in the leaving certificate, and</P>
      <P>(iii)  the total income of the candidate and his/her parents must not exceed the relevant income eligibility limit in the schemes of the year he/she sat the leaving certificate examination.</P>
      <P>All candidates must satisfy these provisions. The higher education grants scheme, including the means test tables, applicable in the case of a candidate or a grant is the scheme of the year in which she/he sat the leaving certificate examination.</P>
      <P>While there is no specific provision in the higher education grants scheme relating to mature students, there is no upper age limit in the scheme at present and it is, therefore, open to a mature student to sit the leaving cerificate examination in the normal way for the purposes of qualifying for a grant on grounds of academic attainments and means.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation, Ireland and the other contracting states have agreed to, in general, allow aircraft registered in each others' countries to overfly their territories.</P>
      <P>There is no international statutory requirement on private owners to insure against liability for loss or damage arising from the operation of their aircraft. While individual countries may impose such obligations, it is understood that very few do so.</P>
      <P>In the case of commercial aircraft, owners' or operators' liability for loss or damage to passengers arising from the operation of their aircraft is generally covered as part of the conditions under which they are granted authorisations to operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 17 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1988, provides that I can impose an obligation on owners or operators of aircraft to insure against, or <Col N="1910" /> otherwise make financial provision to meet, liability arising in relation to loss or damage resulting from the operation of the aircraft.</P>
    <P>I indicated in my reply to Question No. 29 of 5 December that I have arranged for an examination of this matter to be carried out by my Department. Representatives of the aviation industry and private aircraft owners will be consulted through the Air Navigation Advisory Council.</P>
