    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to announce for the information of the Dáil that I have today nominated the Minister for the Marine, Deputy John P. Wilson, to be Tánaiste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>The announcement is for the information of the House and there cannot be debate or statements at this time.  Nevertheless if the Members who have risen, the Leaders of the respective parties, will be very brief, I shall permit a contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully undertake to be brief.  I should like to congratulate the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Wilson, on his appointment as Tánaiste.  The circumstances of that appointment are well enough known and my views are well enough known not to require further elaboration.  I wish the Tánaiste well in the performance of his functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the parliamentary Labour Party I would like to congratulate Deputy John Wilson and to wish him well in the office of Tánaiste. Deputy Wilson has served this House well over many years and I am sure he will be very successful in that office.  Our best wishes go with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1106" /> Would the Taoiseach indicate when he will be appointing a Minister for Defence?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer the Deputy to raise it at another time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make two points.  One is to congratulate Deputy Wilson, the new Tánaiste, and to wish him well in his new responsibilities.  I also want to raise the fact that I had three questions ruled out of order by you, a Cheann Comhairle, one specifically relating to the appointment of the Tánaiste and another relating to the appointment of a Minister for Defence, both of which are obligations on the Government under the Constitution.  The appointment of a Minister for Defence requires the approval of this House before it is made. I find it extraordinary&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave the Deputy the privilege of commenting briefly on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>If you let me finish then you can rule on the matter as you see fit.  I find it extraordinary that questions of that kind are ruled out of order on the basis that the Taoiseach has no responsibility in the matter.  Clearly he does.  The third question related to statements made by the Taoiseach almost two weeks ago regarding events in January 1982.  My question related specifically to the Taoiseach's involvement in that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have communicated with the Deputy and I have nothing further to add to my replies.  He may not pursue the matter now.  He knows that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am simply asking your courtesy to let me finish my point of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have allowed the Deputy quite some latitude.  He will now bring his remarks to a conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking how it can be that three questions, one relating <Col N="1107" /> to the appointment of the Tánaiste, one relating to the appointment of a Minister for Defence and one relating to statements made by the Taoiseach in this House regarding his involvement in the events of 1982, have been ruled out of order on the basis that he has no responsibility in the matter to this House.  How can that be?  How can the rules of this House be extended in that way?  The public outside this House will regard this as a conspiracy to cover up events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a constituency colleague of Deputy Wilson, I offer him my congratulations on his appointment to his new office and wish him every success.  I suggest that in his new post he might use his influence to have the whole of Cavan and Monaghan included in the severely handicapped areas.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2 and 3 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Programmes of activities by the <Col N="1108" /> National Museum, National Library and National Gallery, to mark the occasion of Dublin European City of Culture 1991 have been formulated.  I am circulating details in the Official Report.</P>
    <P>Arrangements are being made by the individual institutions to put these programmes into operation and the costs will be met from voted funds or sponsorship as appropriate.</P>
    <P>I am confident that these activities by our important cultural institutions will make a major contribution to the celebrations in Dublin 1991.</P>
    <P Just="Center">Programme of Activities at the Major Cultural Institutions 1991</P>
    <P>The National Museum of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The National Museum of Ireland will be actively involved with the following special events to mark Dublin's honour as Cultural Capital of European for 1991: (a)  in the summer of 1991, the presentation of a new permanent exhibition of the magnificent collection of Bronze Age goldwork.  This exhibition will not only highlight the best known pieces from the collection such as the Gleninsheen Collar but will also show for the first time some new acquisitions such as the dress fastener from Iry, County Laois.  The exhibition will also include for a short period some important Irish pieces now housed in museums abroad thus allowing the public a unique opportunity to see the wealth and variety of Irish gold which has survived from c. 2000 BC-500 BC; (b)  the exhibition to commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the 1916 Rising, <i>The Road to Independence.</i>  This exhibition outlines the background to the 1916 Insurrection, the events of Easter Week itself, the aftermath and the War of Independence which followed; (c)  other public events such as (i) <i>Upstairs/Downstairs, Grattan's Dublin</i>, an exhibition at 29 Fitzwilliam Street in conjunction with the ESB commencing 1 May and (ii) an exhibition of scientific instruments covering such topics as surveying, optics, astronomy and measurement in its various forms.  The instruments are in the main Irish, most <Col N="1109" /> of them dating to the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.  In all, over 50 instruments &mdash; compasses, telescopes, microscopes, octants, theodolites, protractors and sundials &mdash; will be on view.</P>
    <P>It is also intended to commence work in 1991 on the extension to the National Museum to be provided at the Custom House Docks.</P>
    <P>The National Gallery of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The programme of exhibitions during 1991 will include the refurbishment &mdash; a £5 million scheme &mdash; of the 1968 extension undertaken during 1991 but this will not deter the ambitious programme of exhibitions: (a) in January the gallery will be exhibiting its collection of watercolours by J. M. W. Turner; (b) in February/March, there will be an exhibition focusing on the work of Irish stuccodores and especially on their use of engravings as a source for the motifs employed in their work; (c) at Easter, an exciting collection of drawings and watercolours, &ldquo;Views of Rome&rdquo; from the Thomas Ashby Collection in the Vatican Library will be exhibited; (d) the big summer show in June-July will provide an opportunity to explore the range and quality of the work of Nathanial Hone the Younger (1831-1917); and (e) three further exhibitions have been scheduled for the remaining months of 1991 and information about them will be released in due course.</P>
    <P>The National Library of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The programme of activities will include (i)  an information video on the library and its facilities; (ii)  an exhibition &ldquo;Treasures of the National Library&rdquo;, to mark the opening of the Exhibition Hall; (iii)  other public events &mdash; the &ldquo;Faces of Writers&rdquo; exhibition to coincide with the International Writers' Festival; an exhibition to commemorate Charles Stewart Parnell; and (iv)  the library will be host to the prestigious US based Manuscripts Association during their visit in May 1991.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Taoiseach will be circulating the programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1110" /> Can he comment on whether any of the programmes in any of the three national institutions for which he has primary responsibility has been curtailed or cut back in any way by reason of stringencies in his Department with regard to the allocation of funds?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach indicate in general terms the extent to which he or his Department have allocated money specifically for projects included in the programme?  Could he indicate to what extent the programme for the typical year of each of these institutions will be enhanced or developed to recognise that we are having such an important cultural year in Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should read the programmes for the three institutions. I think he will be satisfied that they will represent a significant contribution to the year.  The finances of these institutions will be considered in the context of the Estimates.  It is a mix because some of these functions are being sponsored and to that extend are not a matter for me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at a disadvantage in not having the specifics.  I am confined to the general.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that some of the difficulties such as personnel shortages, the necessity for the National Library to shorten the hours of availability and difficulties regarding exhibition space in the National Gallery and the National Museum, will be attended to so that throughout the year these important institutions will be at their best?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>A provision of £220,000 has been made in 1990 towards the salaries and running costs of the Chester Beatty Library.  It is subject to the usual requirements regarding the furnishing of accounts to my Department and control over staff numbers and remuneration.</P>
      <P>A particular condition is that early arrangements be made to advertise and fill the post of director.  The provision for 1991 is at present under consideration.</P>
      <P>Discussions have been held by my Department with the trustees on the development of the Library.  The proposals set out in the consultants' report were reviewed and progress can be regarded as follows: Finance: The budgetary system has been revised; a bookkeeper engaged and quarterly management accounts prepared; Staffing; the Western Curator will take up duty this month; Trustees: The trustees accept that fixed-term appointments as trustees are desirable, apart from the three statutory appointments by the President, Taoiseach and ex officio Director of the National Library; Premises: the residential quarter vacated by the former director is being adapted for public and official use; and Stocktaking: a systematic work programme has been prepared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased with the substantial progress which has been made by the trustees in relation to the management and development of the Library.  A number of other issues, for example, capital <Col N="1112" /> development works, sponsorship and Sunday opening remain to be discussed in detail but will be the subject of further consultations between officials of my Department and the trustees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for the information he has given me and, to the extent that progress has been made, I welcome such in respect of the Chester Beatty Library.  Has the Taoiseach received any indication when the post of new director will be advertised and filled?  Would the Taoiseach agree that it is something that should be in place and if at all possible dealt with in advance of the ensuing cultural year in 1991?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure of the exact timescale.  The Deputy can take it that we will get on with it as quickly as possible.  We have been clarifying the job specification for the post, laying emphasis on management functions as well as the academic side.  I can assure the Deputy we will have it in place as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the trustees can the Taoiseach say whether a position has been accepted in regard to an upper age limit, which is very important? Again with regard to the trustees can the Taoiseach say whether his Department have the right and opportunity to appoint an additional nominee to serve on the board of trustees as was recommended in the consultants' report?</P>

If that is not proposed may I request him to take that suggestion on board and recommend it to the relevant people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that all of these matters &mdash; as the Deputy will know &mdash; are the subject of ongoing discussions.  My information is that a systematic work programme has been prepared, presumably with the objective the Deputy has in mind, but I will make sure that is conveyed to the trustees.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>The engineering block building, which is part of the former College of Science complex, together with the corridor linking the building to Leinster House will be completed today, 13 November, and both are being handed over to the Houses of the Oireachtas for final fitting out.</P>
      <P>The building has been finished to a standard suitable for use by Deputies and staff.  There are 34 offices in all and, as is normally the case, the Government Chief Whip will be in contact with the other Whips about the allocation of rooms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fountain, in the quadrangle, is not an afterthought but has been part of the <Col N="1114" /> architect's design from the earliest sketch scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say to the Taoiseach that, while we may all like nice things, very often we cannot afford them.  In the light of the estimated cost of £17.6 million &mdash; coupled with the image of the Government spending to the tune of £10 million on presidential jets, the cost of the EC Presidency and the refurbishment of Dublin Castle &mdash; would the Taoiseach not agree we have gone slightly over the top on expenditure in these areas?  Given the amount of poverty and educational needs of the unemployed would he not agree we have stretched our budget far beyond the limit to which it should have been stretched on these occasions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt fairly fully with this matter before at Question Time.  Of course there is always room for argument on these matters.  No, I do not believe we have gone over the top at all in view of the job we have to do.  I believe that what we are doing in the case of these major public buildings in our capital city is very acceptable to the general public.  We have not that many important public buildings. There is a general wish on the part of the public that we should proceed with this programme.  The comments I hear from the general public are to the effect that they are all very pleased and proud of the fact that at last these buildings are beginning to get their due as important buildings of our capital city.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that the general public are not happy with the amount of funds being spent in these areas; rather that they would be much happier if the Government spent less money on such schemes and devoted the surplus &mdash; which appears to be endless &mdash; to the hospital and educational services?  Furthermore would he agree &mdash; although this is a capital city within Europe &mdash; we do not have the same gross national product as other capital cities in Europe?  Would the Taoiseach agree that it is somewhat like Marshal Bokassa who, in his ostentatiousness, spent huge sums of money in somewhat similar circumstances?</P>

      <P>I want to deal for a moment with the point raised by Deputy Byrne.  It is always possible to advance that sort of argument.  In this case, first of all, we took a decision that the cost of providing a proper Government centre for this nation would be offset to a considerable extent by the sale of the property opposite.  We would not have gone ahead with it were that opportunity not available to us.  Therefore, to that extent, the net cost will not be as awful as the Deputy seems to think.  Secondly, the Deputy should keep in mind &mdash; I think it is in his constituency &mdash; that a very considerable amount of these moneys will be spent on wages of craftsmen and tradesmen.</P>

Matters catered for by the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities are not appropriate to many of the relevant issues that are ongoing and many of the problems Irish farmers are facing at present.

I would not like to undertake any disruption of that balance at the moment.  It was a success the last time and I think we should continue with it.  However, that does not prevent the National Youth Council or any similar vocational education organisation from having a full input into the programme.  That I can guarantee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the United Farmers Association is a new rural organisation founded in Ireland this year as a representative and negotiating body specifically for small and medium farmers, would the Taoiseach not agree that it would be right and proper that, besides making a submission, the body would have a place at the negotiating table?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

That balance is there and has worked successfully.  I would be reluctant to disturb it, but the United Farmers Association understand a submission from them would be very welcome and would be fully considered and discussed with them.</P>

While we would value a major input from the NYC into the programme and discussions, it is not necessary to provide for specific representation at the council table.  The Deputy should realise that it is difficult enough to get these different sections of our society, all the social partners, around the table and to maintain a reasonable balance of representation without bringing in new vocational education groups.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must not infer anything of that sort.  The Deputy can take it that what I am saying to the House is that the composition of the mechanism to produce a programme was carefully worked out between all the social partners concerned.  It is a formula that works.  It is regarded as adequately representational and neither I nor any of the parties would be willing to upset a successful working formula at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not think that it is time that Deputy Molloy was asked to resign his seat on the local authority as he had done quickly under a previous Taoisigh in 1970 and 1977?  Does the Taoiseach not consider it a serious matter, in fact a scandal, that a Minister should remain on a local authority and on subsidiary bodies of a local authority where obviously serious conflicts of interests can occur and where a Minister can use his position to influence decision as I have evidence of recently in Galway where the Minister mentioned in the Taoiseach's reply misused his position in influencing an important decision on a subsidiary body of a local authority?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not consider it his duty, as a previous Taoiseach did, to ask Ministers to immediately resign from local authorities? It is now 18 months since Deputy Molloy became a Minister and not alone is he on one local authority but he is on two local authorities and several subsidiary bodies of those local authorities. He very seldom attends, but he attends when there is something influential to be decided.</P>

First, the Deputy must not take it that I am accepting any criticism that he makes of my colleague.  I do not accept that.

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the action the Government have taken to encourage the expansion of the Irish registered fleet. On entering Government, a grants scheme was introduced in November 1987, providing financial support of up to 25 per cent towards the cost of ship purchase.  In that year's Finance Act, the tax levied on shipping companies was reduced from 50 per cent to 10 per cent and shipping companies were granted access to funding under the business expansion scheme.</P>
      <P>These measures have made a significant impact as may be deduced from the fact that since mid-1987, the capacity of the Irish registered fleet has expanded by more than 45,000 tons to approximately 183,500 tons, a percentage increase in excess of 30 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may also be aware of the major study of our access transport requirements which was carried out earlier this year.  That study sought to establish future priorities and identify the most effective means of combating the problem of peripherality in the context of the Single Market.  A high level inter-departmental group is currently examining the study and will shortly be reporting to the Government in the matter.  I am hopeful that when the facts of the situation have been established, a strong case can be made for Community support for improving our access transport services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am constrained in what I can say in response to the second part of the Deputy's question by the fact that legal proceedings have been initiated which render the matter <i>sub judice.</i>  In the circumstances, I would refer the Deputy <Col N="1132" /> to the parliamentary questions answered on 24 November 1987 and 3 May 1988 by the then Minister of State for the Marine, Deputy Pat the Cope Gallagher. On both occasions the Minister of State gave details to the House of the legal and financial sensitivities which pertain to the question of compensation for the former employees of Irish Shipping Limited.</P>
    <P>In response to the first part of Deputy Gilmore's question, I can inform the Deputy that no extra costs arising from the liquidation of the company have been incurred by my Department since 16 May 1990.  As to the second part of his question, I would point out that as legal proceedings have been pending since the middle of 1989, I have not met with representatives of the former employees over the past 12 months nor have I received a request for such a meeting.  In reply to the remainder of the Deputy's question, I do not propose to set up a sworn public inquiry into the matter. Since the matter is already the subject of pending legal proceedings, it would be inappropriate to pursue the course of action suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to convey to the Minister my congratulations on his appointment as Tánaiste. In relation to the reply he has given to the two questions he has taken together, can he state how many individual summonses have been served on the Government arising from the liquidation of Irish Shipping?  Can he confirm that the claims are intended to establish that the then Government were negligent in their handling of the Irish Shipping case and if a Hong Kong based company have initiated any legal proceedings against the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>To take the supplementary questions <i>seriatim</i>, first I would express my gratitude to the Deputy for his good wishes.  Táim buíoch duit.  I have no information as to the number of summonses but I can check that and let the Deputy know.  I understand there is something in the citation <Col N="1133" /> about the negligence of the then Government. The Hong Kong company to which the Deputy referred have been making noises but what specifically has been done in a legal sense, I do not know as of now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister confirm that as tomorrow is the sixth anniversary of the liquidation of Irish Shipping, the statute of limitations will come into effect tomorrow and that therefore, it will not be possible thereafter for further legal proceedings to be initiated against the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the proceedings that have already been initiated did not fall within the statute of limitations period.  Consequently, I do not see that that is highly relevant in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the aspect of my question which asked the Minister about the establishment of a sworn public inquiry, in view of the fact that there is now a large number of summonses issued against the Government and that these summonses, as he has confirmed relate to the performance of the then Government in their handling of Irish Shipping, will those legal proceedings in effect bring about a public sworn inquiry in a somewhat roundabout way?  As there are a number of outstanding questions, quite apart from the position of the former employees, relating to the inexplicable chartering decisions, the decision to build the <i>Irish Spruce</i> and the criticisms made by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies and in the liquidator's interim report, does the Minister consider there are major questions of public interest relating to the liquidation of a company which has, so far, cost the taxpayer almost £100 million?  Will the Minister agree that he should establish an inquiry&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

      <P>On 17 August last I announced that I had directed the fisheries boards to undertake immediately an urgent review of equipment, including personal safety equipment, personnel, training, procedures and vessels used in deep water patrols to ensure the highest possible safety levels.  I also indicated on that occasion that I had directed the marine surveyors of my Department to provide such technical assistance as the boards may require in the conduct of this review and in ensuring the application of the safest possible operational procedures. I await the results of that review.</P>

Will the Minister agree that the equipment which has been used by fishery officers up to now was inadequate, a fact that was highlighted by the evidence given at the in-quest? I am asking for adequate funding to be given immediately to the fisheries boards because it appears that they did not have adequate finance to provide that equipment.  Will the Minister agree that adequate funding should be given to the fisheries boards?

      <P>I join my colleagues in warmly congratulating the Minister on his appointment.  Will the Minister agree that the figures &mdash; particularly the last figure &mdash; are very poor given our island location?  They indicate a failure in policies for supply, distribution and marketing of fresh fish.  Will the Minister admit that there is a need to set up a separate structure to improve the availability of fresh fish through local fish markets, as exists in other countries?  Is he aware of the great difficulty people have in getting fish outside the main shopping areas?  Will he agree that many people would have to buy a fishing rod to ensure a supply of fresh fish regularly?</P>

      <P>I agree that we should be eating more fish.  The figures for Denmark, Portugal, Japan and Spain are 100 lbs., 87 lbs., 82 lbs and 56 lbs., respectively. Of course, tourists' consumption considerably boosts those figures. However, the graph in this country in relation to <i>per capita</i> consumption of fish is rising and I do not think that Bord Iascaigh Mhara are falling down in regard to marketing.  I do not like mentioning names &mdash; I might come under your stricture, a Cheann Comhairle &mdash; but Miss O'Boyle is a very good propagandist and a scientific officer of Bord Iascaigh Mhara doing trojan work to try to develop the <i>per capita</i> consumption of fish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps BIM need more money or a change of policy because they concentrate on fish exports.  I was in County Wexford during the summer and I had to travel miles to get fresh fish. Is the Minister aware of the difficulties experienced by people in that part of the country &mdash; and other parts near the coast &mdash; getting fresh fish?  Perhaps BIM could be given a new responsibility to examine the lack of availability of fish outside Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Deputy is saying.  However, BIM are conscious of this and have several methods for improving the situation in this regard. For example, I was asked to open a &ldquo;Focus on Fish&rdquo; week in O'Connell Street, Dublin recently and we had all sorts of primeval monsters from Galway parading in the street to advertise fish.  A very good calendar, one of the recipes from which I cooked, was also distributed. I should have waited for 1991, but there is not a ban on using it. The efforts of BIM to increase consumption in the home market are very good and a good deal of money has been allocated for that purpose.  As well as that the processing of fish is developing considerably to the extent that some species of our production have wiped out imports of certain species.</P>

Has the Minister had any-contact with the Minister for Education in relation to educating young people on the value of fish, thus encouraging its more frequent use?  I am sure the Minister will agree that our historical background in relation to fish is not conducive to its use.  We tend to associate fish with famine and historically distasteful events.

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier this year my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, introduced Regulations giving effect to the European Communities Directive on Environmental Impact Assessment.</P>
      <P>Under these Regulations, an environmental impact study (EIS) must be submitted with licence applications in respect of marine salmonid farms where proposed yearly output would exceed 100 tonnes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Environmental impact studies must contain, at minimum, certain specified information such as a description of the development proposed; data necessary to identify and assess likely effects on the environment; a description of the likely effects on the environment; a description of measures envisaged in order to avoid, <Col N="1139" /> reduce or remedy such effects; and a summary of the foregoing in non-technical language.</P>
    <P>The EIS must be advertised and made available for scrutiny by interested parties, who may submit comments thereon to my Department within 28 days of advertising.  Under the terms of supplementary regulations which I made, the EIS must also be referred for comment to eight prescribed bodies, as follows: An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, Údarás na Gaeltachta, if applicable, Bord Fáilte, the Central Fisheries Board, the relevant regional fisheries board, An Taisce, the Wildlife Service of the Office of Public Works and the relevant local authority.</P>
    <P>The EIS, together with the comments of interested parties, and the prescribed bodies, are thoroughly vetted by my Department before a recommendation on the licence application is presented to me for approval.</P>
    <P>The procedure for freshwater fish farms is essentially the same as for marine sites, with the crucial difference that the requirements of the directive are implemented through the planning process. Thus the promoters, when applying for planning permission for the project, must submit an EIS to the local authority. The regulations specify that the following freshwater projects require EIS:&mdash;</P>
    <P>all salmonid breeding installations consisting of cage rearing in lakes; all salmonid breeding installations upstream of drinking water intakes; other freshwater salmonid breeding installations which would exceed 1 million smolts and with less than 1 cubic metre per second per 1 million smolts low flow diluting water.</P>
    <P>In the case of projects whose tonnage would be less than the Environmental Impact Assessment Regulation's threshold &mdash; and this would have applied equally to fish farms being established before the regulations came into effect &mdash; my Department would require that a considerable body of scientific data be submitted in support of the licence application.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister say, since the EC Directive on environmental impact studies came into operation on 1 February, how many of the applications for licences exceeded the thresholds which are set down in the directive and for which an environmental impact study would be required?  How many applications did not exceed that directive and, therefore, did not require an environmental impact study to be carried out?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the problem with the directive is that a fish farm would nearly need to be a fish ranch in order to come under the scope of the directive and that he should, as a matter of policy, require that all fish farms submit an EIS prior to being granted a licence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has not visited many of those farms if he says that the limit threshold indicates a ranch.  It does not.  Ranching is technically a different matter with regard to the raising of fish.  The final paragraph in my reply covers the point made by the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>We would have to depend on the professionalism of the people who did the study.  The Deputy heard of all the people in front of whom it has to go.

    <P>
      <i>Note:</i>&ldquo;Approved&rdquo; denotes that written authorisation for the fish farms has issued on behalf of the Minister for the Marine.  The Government are committed, under the Environment Action Programme, to regularising the licence status of all such operations by the end of 1991, and efforts to meet this objective are will on target.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with my colleagues in congratulating the Minister on his appointment as Tánaiste.  I would make the point that I hope this additional appointment will not in any way take from his work in the Department of the Marine because it is an extremely important Department.  Not having seen the Minister's detailed reply I can only assume that he has answered it correctly. I quite agree it would be unreasonable to take up the time of the House as it was a very detailed question.  However, six months seems an inordinate length of time to answer a question like this.  One would have thought the Minister would have considered answering part of the question.  In answer to the question in the Dáil on 16 May he said that in so far as the information to hand he would make it available as soon as possible.  He has not done so.  Even part of the information would be very useful&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>My instinct would be to reply and to reply immediately but, as the Deputy will see, I have six full typed foolscap pages of a reply ready for him. This took considerable research coupled with the work we were doing in regularising the licensing system.  Let me take this opportunity to thank the Deputy and other Deputies who have wished me well.</P>

      <P>Licences are being issued at present only to those applicants who are replacing active tonnage on the current sea fishing boat register.  The person referred to by the Deputy did not indicate any replacement element in his application. My Department wrote to him on 6 June, 1990 inquiring whether a replacement element was associated with the application.  As no reply has been <Col N="1147" /> received from the applicant my Department are not in a position to process this application any further.</P>

      <P>Are we to take it that fishing has become a closed shop in this country and that no new entrants to the fishing industry will be entertained?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not a closed shop. Arising out of the Common Fisheries Policy, which was determined in 1983, the tonnage for each country of the European Community was assessed at that time and the Commission and the Council came to the conclusion that we were over-supplied with tonnage.  An obligation was laid on each member country to reduce the 1983-84 tonnage by 3 per cent per annum.  It is within that straitjacket that I have to operate.  I have issued licences to people on the register who are replacing tonnage.  A new exact register has been prepared for the first time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">

Would the Minister explain to the House what the position is in relation to those cases?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <P>I could help to clear the position for Deputies.  During the Seanad debate and on the Second Stage debate here, the Bill was warmly welcomed. However, there was one central point of disagreement and that was in relation to whether the term &ldquo;rape&rdquo; should apply to certain serious sexual assaults involving other than the traditional normal meaning of the word &ldquo;rape&rdquo;.  I have given deep consideration to this and have submitted a set of amendments the basis of which will meet the issues raised by Deputies.  I could have left it until Report Stage but I felt it was better, even at this late stage, to <Col N="1252" /> introduce the amendments in their present form.</P>
      <P>There is one core amendment, No. 7a, which seeks in page 4, before section 4, to insert a new section.  That will meet the concerns expressed on all sides of the House in relation to the interpretation of the word &ldquo;rape&rdquo;.  The other amendments are consequential.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), lines 11 and 12, to delete the definition of &ldquo;aggravated sexual assault&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;statutory rape&rsquo; has the meaning assigned to it by section 3;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1253" /> Having made the point that it is difficult for us to give an immediate welcome to amendments circulated without notice, we will examine the proposal in detail.  It looks as if the Minister has acceded to our point but we will not know until we have an opportunity to check.</P>
    <P>I tabled an amendment, together with my Fine Gael colleagues in relation to the definition of rape.  Everyone accepts that rape is an appalling crime.  It is different from other crimes that go before the courts.  It is also accepted that it is a crime which provokes intense emotion and controversy other crimes do not.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage we had a discussion about the fact that the law takes too little account of the traumatic experience which a rape trial represents for a woman who makes a complaint.  We also looked at the other side of the argument, which is that too emotional an approach might result in unfairness for the accused.  What emerged during the debate was that the approach adopted by the Minister in relation to the definition of rape gave rise to concern and controversy.  That was not surprising.</P>
    <P>If one examines the law reform consultation paper and the Law Reform Commission report it is clear that there was a huge controversy even among the members of the Commission.  There is a huge controversy in other countries as to nomenclature and the presentation of what should or should not be called rape. The recommendation in the consultation paper was what appeared in the Bill, that is, &ldquo;sexual assault&rdquo; and &ldquo;aggravated sexual assault&rdquo;.  In the final Law Reform Commission paper there was a majority decision against expanding the definition of rape to encompass any non-consensual sexual penetration of the vagina, anus or mouth of a person by the penis of another person or the vagina or anus of a person by an inanimate object held or manipulated by another person.  There was the unusual situation where there was a minority report from the president of the commission and one from its senior members which presented a different view.  I accept that there is no unanimity that the word &ldquo;rape&rdquo; should be extended <Col N="1254" /> to cover many awful types of sexual assault other than those traditionally referred to as rape.</P>
    <P>The matter has been discussed in other countries and they have come to a variety of conclusions.  In the United States there are differing views between the various States as to how the question is dealt with.  It was on that basis that I and my colleagues came up with what we thought was an approach which would solve the problem and ensure that the awful types of offences we are talking about would be referred to as &ldquo;rape&rdquo; but that we would keep a slight distinction between the traditional interpretation of the word &ldquo;rape&rdquo; and the statutory nomenclature that we would apply here.  That is why we tabled the proposal that certain types of offences would be called &ldquo;statutory rape&rdquo;.  We have put forward this proposal on the basis that it is not a perfect solution but after a lot of discussion it seems as if it could be a reasonable solution to the problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan has a different approach.  The Minister has tabled an amendment which seems to be yet another different approach.  It might be best to hear the views of different Members and a common view might then emerge, or at least we would have an opportunity of teasing out the different implications of the various amendments and arrive at a common view or, at least, one acceptable to most people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the most controversial issues to arise during the debate on this Bill has been whether the term &ldquo;rape&rdquo; should apply to certain serious sexual assaults involving sexual penetration other than natural sexual intercourse. We are all agreed that such assaults are as bad and in some cases may be even worse than rape as at present defined.  It was for that reason that the Government decided to create the new offence of &ldquo;aggravated sexual assault&rdquo; with the same penalties and procedures as rape.  However, the point has been made that prescribing the same penalty as for rape might not be sufficient.  A woman who is the victim of such assaults <Col N="1255" /> considers she has been raped and needs the offence to be termed &ldquo;rape&rdquo; if she is to feel properly vindicated.  It is an emotive issue which involves questions of feelings.  It is an issue in which I have taken a personal interest and I am aware of views expressed by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Affairs and of the conflicting views put forward by different members of the Law Reform Commission.  I have had a meeting with the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre to discuss the issue and I have talked to a number of individual women and groups on the issue.  Women clearly feel strongly about it and are very conscious of the trauma suffered by victims of sexual assault.  If this trauma can be reduced in any way by applying the term &ldquo;rape&rdquo; to such offences, then we have to give it serious consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have the strongest sympathy for the victims of these outrageous crimes and I should not like to omit from this Bill a proposal which might reduce the suffering endured by such victims.  On the other hand, strong arguments have been advanced for not interfering with the existing definition of rape.  I cannot ignore these arguments as I think there are valid reasons for maintaining the existing definition of rape.  I have given serious consideration to the problem and I think I have the solution to our dilemma.  I propose by my amendment to create a new offence which could be termed &ldquo;rape&rdquo; but which would be distinct from and not interfere with the existing common law offence of rape.  In this way it will be possible to provide the psychological reassurance sought for victims of rape without attracting any of the disadvantages of interfering with the existing definition.  The Government feel strongly that the existing definition of rape should not be interfered with. However, they view the type of sexual assault at issue here with the utmost disgust and share my view that such offences should attract the stigma and odium which is currently attached to the crime of rape.  For this reason they supported my proposal in favour of the term &ldquo;rape&rdquo;<Col N="1256" /> being applied to them as long as it does not interfere with the existing definition of rape.</P>
    <P>The new offence of rape under section 4 will be limited to serious sexual assaults involving penetration of or by a sexual organ.  It is intended to retain the offence of aggravated sexual assault to cover those serious sexual assaults not involving sexual penetration.  However the definition of aggravated sexual assault should be amended to delete the specific references which at present exist to sexual penetration.  The amendment to which I am referring is amendment No. 7a which states:</P>
    <P>In page 4, before section 4, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;4.&mdash;(1) In this Act &lsquo;rape under section 4&rsquo; means a sexual assault that includes&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  penetration (however slight) of the anus or mouth by the penis, or</P>
    <P>(b)  penetration (however slight) of the vagina by any object held or manipulated by another person.</P>
    <P>(2)  A person guilty of rape under section 4 shall be liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for life.</P>
    <P>(3)  Rape under section 4 shall be a felony.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are a number of consequential amendments.  I believe that the proposal in this amendment will meet the case that has been made in relation to the trauma felt by a victim of rape if there are acts of the type I have outlined.</P>
    <P>The amendment put down by Deputies O'Keeffe, Flanagan, Barnes and Fennell proposes that the term &ldquo;aggravated sexual assault&rdquo; should be changed to &ldquo;statutory rape&rdquo;.  I believe the intention of these Deputies is similar to my own in that such assaults would be referred to as rape but the existing definition of rape would not be interfered with in any way. There are, however, problems with the proposed amendment.  The term &ldquo;statutory rape&rdquo; is already used colloquially to <Col N="1257" /> describe offences involving sexual intercourse with under-age girls.  Intercourse with girls under 17 and 15 are offences under the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1935, and the use of the term &ldquo;statutory rape&rdquo; in this Bill would therefore cause confusion.  If we are to create a new rape offence it should be limited to specific acts involving sexual penetration. Furthermore, there is an element of tautology in describing an offence as a statutory offence in a statute which is creating it.  Because of these problems I would ask the Deputies concerned to withdraw their amendment in favour of the amendment which I am putting forward.</P>
    <P>I oppose the amendment being put forward by Deputy McCartan which purports to interfere with the existing definition of rape.  I have explained my position on this issue.  For technical reasons the amendment would be unacceptable. The amendment purports to give a new meaning to the term &ldquo;rape&rdquo;, but it is not clear if it is limited to this Bill or is intended to cover the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981, as well as the common law.  At a minimum it is in direct conflict with section 2 of the 1981 Act which deals with the existing meaning of rape.</P>
    <P>It is my view and that of the Government that a woman who has suffered this horrendous assault is entitled to the protection of the law and that is being provided.  When a woman suffers from that type of crime there is psychological as well as physical damage.  While a woman would not be raped in the sense of the word as we know it, she feels raped because she has been penetrated with an instrument or by the penis in the mouth or the anus.  It is important to give the maximum psychological protection as well as legal protection.  There will be the crime of rape as it is traditionally understood and there will be rape under section 4 and also aggravated sexual assault.  In bringing forward this amendment on behalf of the Government I believe I have met many very legitimate concerns which have been expressed inside and outside this House by groups, <Col N="1258" /> individuals and concerned citizens who feel strongly about this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise that the Minister has responded very well to the various issues raised on Second Stage.  I thank him for that.  This was a matter of concern, having looked at the report of the Law Reform Commission and having listened at the various conferences convened by that commission to the well reasoned, well argued and well founded views of people who were either victims of the crime of rape or were working in professions which had to deal with it. They were concerned that our law in this area should keep abreast of changing attitudes and views and should in time provide for a wider and more meaningful definition of the horrendous crime of rape.  I welcome the progress we have made here today.  It was a previous Minister who dealt with this in the Seanad. There did not appear to be any indication on the part of the then Minister of an appreciation of the issues and concerns involved.  Having said that, nonetheless some details remain to be thrashed out.</P>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that I have taken a different view from him on the amendments.  Very briefly I should like to advance my arguments for so doing. Indeed they are encapsulated in amendments Nos. 2 and 5 being taken in conjunction with amendment No. 1, amendments tabled in my name on behalf of The Workers' Party.</P>
      <P>In the present debate I hope it is recognised that we are talking about the offence of rape as being a non-gender offence &mdash; that whilst the understanding is clearly there that women are the primary victims of the crime, we are now bringing into the broader definition of rape the non-consensual defilement of young men, or men of any age, that they too are concerned and can be victims of this crime.  I acknowledge that the Minister takes the point for what it is worth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing that strikes me about amendment No. 7a, subparagraph (b) &mdash; when one comes to deal with penetration by an inanimate object &mdash; is that the anus <Col N="1259" /> is omitted.  I should like that omission to be explained.  It is contrary, the Rape Crisis Centre say, to what the Law Reform Commission argue.  When we talk about introducing a non-gender definition of the crime it is important that we treat all of the orifices of the body in a similar manner.  If I might put it this way &mdash; as I understand the horrendous depths of this &mdash; the male may be raped in one way only.  It is important that we consider penetration by an inanimate object of the male equally horrendous as that of the female.  It may be that in the typing of the amendments something has been lost.  I noticed that the amendments tabled by the then Senator Fennell adopted the Minister's formula.  I find it curious.  Perhaps we could have this corrected by Report Stage.</P>
    <P>The main issue that has to be addressed is whether the common law concept of rape and its definition should be preserved, what is the importance of preserving that concept or definition.  In responding perhaps the Minister could elaborate somewhat on the reasons that he and the Government are so committed to the common law definition of rape; if you like, what is in it that is so sacrosanct? Here, I take immediate correction from the Minister in so far as my definition of &ldquo;rape&rdquo;&mdash; included in amendment No. 2 &mdash; did intend to interfere with the common law definition, did intend to supplant section 2 of the 1981 Act.  In dealing with the amendments to the Schedule I did not include &mdash; in the sections to be repealed there &mdash; the necessity to repeal section 2 of the 1981 Act as a consequence of my extended or supplementary definition of &ldquo;rape&rdquo; as contained in the definitions section of the Bill now before us.  I do not believe there is any overbearing reason we should retain the age old definition of rape.</P>
    <P>The whole exercise of accepting the arguments of the Rape Crisis Centre and the reasonings of the Law Reform Commission was that, in a modern way, we should acknowledge the manner in which attitudes have changed, the manner in which we should change the definitions <Col N="1260" /> of crimes to reflect that change in attitudes. If I correctly understand contributors to this debate to date, they have been contending there is need for a new definition of rape, there is need to debunk the old, sexist, inadequate definition of &ldquo;rape&rdquo; that has existed &mdash; that definition which concentrated on penal penetration of the vagina only and, by definition and of necessity, involved only man assaulting woman.  The argument advanced all along has been to the effect: let us debunk that definition with all its inadequacies, recognise the change in attitudes that exists out there and bring in a new definition of rape.  That was the majority view of the Law Reform Commission.  They provided that definition in their final report.  I have merely borrowed it as a new definition of rape in the list of amendments tabled here.</P>
    <P>On the specific, how can one suggest that there is a respected and important definition of rape at common law that should not be interfered with when, in the 1981 Act that definition was totally interfered with to the extent that we introduced it into a statute; we took it out of the common law arena and then introduced it into a statute by way of a definition structured for the purposes of that statute.  Therefore in 1981 it will clearly be seen that the Houses of the Oireachtas had no difficulty in debunking the common law.  It can be argued that, as far as possible, the statutory definition inserted in the 1981 Act was an attempt to draw together all of the judicial pronouncements and impact on rape up to that point.  but there was no difficulty then in saying: let us leave common law aside now, put it into a statute and thereafter work on the statutory formula. Indeed, since 1981 the courts have experienced absolutely no difficulty in working on a statutory formula borrowing as appropriate, from all of the case law existing there.  As I understand it &mdash; at any of the seminars held by the Law Reform Commission, in any of the deliberations of the Joint Committee on Womens Rights or elsewhere &mdash; there has never been an argument advanced that the prosecution or agencies involved <Col N="1261" /> experienced difficulty with the statutory definition of rape, to put it more succinctly, experienced any difficulty in departing from and debunking the common law definition.</P>
    <P>Therefore I hope the Minister can explain why the Government have this profound commitment to the common law definition of rape.  It is a tired old, inappropriate, narrow definition.  I hope there will be a signal of a departure from it here today.  That is why I am not totally behind the notion of introducing a concept of a statutory rape.  I believe &mdash; as did the Law Reform Commission &mdash; it is very simple to devise a good definition of the offence of rape to reflect modern day attitudes.  For that reason the amendments in the name of the Workers' Party &mdash; being taken in conjunction with amendment No. 1 &mdash; provide the following definition which I will read into the record:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;rape&rsquo; means the non-consensual penetration of the major orifices of the body of any person, male or female, including the vagina, anus and mouth, by the penis of another person, or of a person's vagina or anus by an inanimate object held or manipulated by any other person;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is borrowed substantially, if not entirely, from the report and conclusions of the Law Reform Commission on rape we have all considered.  I am concerned because the report highlights that, in other jurisdictions, there has been experienced a problem about the question of bargaining, of prosecution authorities getting into difficulties, or problems <i>vis-á-vis</i> bargaining down, of a person coming before the courts and saying: look, I am prepared to plead to the statutory offence as opposed to the dirty, old common law one which is universally considered to be the most heinous of crimes in this area.  This graduation of crime from the common law definition of rape to the statutory definition of rape, to the aggravated sexual assault, and then to sexual assault; this four-tiered structuring of these offences will lead to unsatisfactory plea bargaining and negotiations <Col N="1262" /> that have emerged in other jurisdictions which have adopted this formula.  I recognise there is an element of that problem in the formula I am proposing of a single, all-embracing concept of rape, then aggravated sexual assault and sexual assault itself, but at least we are putting into one category all of those offences and acts that women and men universally consider to be rape and they will be dealt with on that one common ground.</P>
    <P>The Minister made one other point in response to the Fine Gael proposals which I would like to address briefly &mdash; they will probably do it far better and more comprehensively &mdash; and that was the problem of trespassing on the colloquial term &ldquo;statutory rape&rdquo; as it exists. The 1935 Act does not use the term &ldquo;statutory rape&rdquo;.  It is a term of art, if you could call it that, devised by lawyers in practice to differentiate between what was the common law rape of a woman's vagina and person as opposed to doing exactly the same thing to a young person. The Act of 1935 in the side column refers to the act of defilement of a girl under 15 years of age or a girl between the ages of 15 and 17.  The Oireachtas of the day used the word &ldquo;defilement&rdquo;.  It is a term of art that emerged for the convenience of lawyers in practice.  Therefore, while we might be trespassing, we are in no way trespassing on something written into a statute, we are trespassing into an area of male dominated convenience.  Lawyers over the years felt it was a convenient term or notion to suggest that raping a girl under a certain age was somehow a statutory offence and not known otherwise, whereas in fact it was, and was always, part of the overall concept of rape at common law.  There is really no practical difficulty.  There is probably the difficulty of getting lawyers in practice to recognise that from 1991 onwards, if we accept the Fine Gael code of amendments, statutory rape is as they introduced it.</P>
    <P>In any event, I believe their formula will inevitably come to be known as statutory rape.  It is inevitable from here on that we will have that old notion of rape which for some odd reason we want to <Col N="1263" /> keep, the very narrow man-assault-upon-woman definition and nothing more, defiling the vagina.  That will be known as rape forever more.  What comes after it, and what will be introduced by the proposed amendment 7a will inevitably come to be known as statutory rape. While we will get rid of the 1935 Act offence or use of the word we will find lawyers arguing for a concept which in legal language, if nothing more, will come to be considered as something less. Everything that is described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of the statutory definition is as much rape as anything else that was or could have been under the old common law definition.  Therefore, while I acknowledge fully the efforts to meet the arguments more consideration should be given to this.  Why not adopt the formula &mdash; I accept it must be tidied up in some ways &mdash; I am promoting on behalf of The Workers' Party, the one the Rape Crisis Centre argued for and the one recommended strongly by the Law Reform Commission.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge the considerable contribution the Minister has made to this debate.  Initially, when I saw the new list of amendments I thought we would need to adjourn to have a look at it because, not having seen the central amendment 7a or knowing what it was about I was not sure.  Really, when one achieves the objective one wants it does not matter through which circuit one achieves it.  The new amendment from the Minister is very much to be recommended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not make a very long contribution because my colleagues want to get in.  I am aware that this was central to all the debates we have had on the amending of rape legislation.  We always got bogged down on it because it seemed as if opinion outside the Department of Justice was that this definition of rape had to be amended, to be widened to take in those other areas.  It was defined by the Rape Crisis Centre first, the Law Reform Commission at their many seminars, in their consultation paper and report, by the <Col N="1264" /> Joint Committee on Women's Rights in their report, and by Deputies and Senators but it seemed as if no satisfactory formula could be found.</P>
    <P>On this side of the House we gave a great deal of time and attention to attempting to bring in an amendment that would meet the views of the Rape Crisis Centre and the Law Reform Commission. At any rate, I am pleased with the amendment and that we are starting off this important debate with a good measure by the Minister.  It is a classic recognition of the need for wide consultation and it makes one realise the great value and importance of an organisation a professional, well structured and determined as the rape Crisis Centre. I am sure the Minister will agree with me on that.  I am aware he had a very useful and lengthy meeting with the members of the Rape Crisis Centre within the last month and they were very impressed at his interest and concern.</P>
    <P>I intend listening to the legal debate. The last speaker posed questions about a new definition and referred to people being hung up, so to speak, on the common law definition of rape.  We have a new awareness of the feelings of women, and some men, who are raped. They see rape as a violation of themselves, of their person.  It matters very little whether it is a violation by a penis, a broom handle, a broken bottle or whatever. I hope the testimony made so clearly and so often by victims of rape will be accepted.  We must accept it.  It is nonsense for legislators in the wake of the evidence of the feelings of women to say, &ldquo;no, you do not feel that, you feel differently because it was a broom handle or broken bottle with which you were violated and not a penis&rdquo;.  We must look at the broader question posed by Deputy McCartan.</P>
    <P>We are progressing in a very useful way and I hope the amendments will be treated with equal understanding by the Minister.  Let me suggest to him that this new sense of awareness and co-operation might be infectious and his colleague in the Department of Health might see his way to recognise the very important work <Col N="1265" /> being done in rape counselling and rape treatment by the Rape Crisis Centre and give that organisation the kind of funding they need to continue this very important work.  I will give way to my other colleagues but I will come in again.</P>

      <P>I speak as a member of the Women's Rights Committee where this issue has been discussed at length.  I speak also as one who is anxious to see legislation in relation to this matter on the Statute Books.  I am happy today to see the progress that has been made and the amendments introduced by the Minister. The approach and the language being used now are correct.  The Minister pointed out the need to differentiate between the technical and bureaucratic language and the whole question of the trauma of rape and the feelings surrounding this debate.</P>
      <P>The approach of creating a new offence is the correct one.  The Minister has retained the common law definition of rape.  There are new definitions in relation to the specific acts and this is the sensible approach in updating the legislation. The balance of the law has been positively tilted in the direction of the victim, male and female, and that is the key element of what we are discussing today.  The Minister has retained legislation in relation to sexual assault not involving penetration.</P>
      <P>We must commend all of those in the Seanad and the Dáil who have been involved in this issue over the years.  Both sides are now very close.  The language used by Deputy McCartan and that used by the Minister are, frankly, very close. My main concern is to see the legislation on the Statute Book and I strongly welcome the amendments introduced by the Minister today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>On 5 December last during the Second Stage debate I pointed out certain flaws and weaknesses in the Bill.  On that occasion I asked the Minister to redefine a section of the old Bill by the introduction of what is now in section 3, that is, that the assault includes penetration, however slight, of the anus <Col N="1266" /> or mouth by the penis and the penetration, however slight, of the vagina by any object held or manipulated by another person.  I would like to thank the Minister for accepting the proposal I made then and for having included it in his major amendment which he is proposing to us today, with the consequent amendments which would change the remainder of the Bill because of that redefinition or rape under section 4.</P>
      <P>When we approach the Minister and he listens to us and makes the changes we request, that should be acknowledged. This was one of the main problems with the Bill.  On that occasion we welcomed the fact that the Minister, who had been introducing a great deal of reforming legislation in various areas, had brought back the Criminal Law (Rape) Bill so quickly after being re-elected to Government in 1989.  We all welcome the improvement in the Bill and the consequential improvements in the remainder of the Bill because of this.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCartan makes a reasonable point in his definition.  I will certainly listen to the Minister's reasons for accepting or even rejecting Deputy McCartan's amendment before we decide whether it deserves to be supported.  On that occasion last year I also asked the Minister to revise the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1935, dealing with indecent exposure and I am glad to see that he reacted to that too by increasing the fine from £2 to £500 and from one month to six months imprisonment.  I have to say that on this occasion I am reasonably satisfied that the Minister has responded to the cases we made on that occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly welcome the Minister's amendments this afternoon, but I have to say how disappointing it is, from the point of view of debate, that two minutes before the commencement of the debate the Minister introduced 32 amendments.  It is certainly somewhat inhibiting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My comments, therefore, will be on the main amendment, amendment No. 7a, introduced by the Minister in response to the various amendments that <Col N="1267" /> had been set down both by Fine Gael and Deputy McCartan.  The Minister obviously admits now that his statements on Second Stage and the statements of his predecessor on Second Stage were subject to amendment and to the discussions that have taken place since then. I welcome the Minister's <i>volte face</i> on that.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to meetings with certain interest groups that may have swung the balance in favour of the amendments.  That may be the case, but I am sure the Minister is aware of the reports of this House, particularly those of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Affairs that reported in 1986 on the matter and had such distinguished members as the present Taoiseach and other members of the present Government when that committee formulated the report and made strong recommendations as to the definition of rape. Indeed, it was extraordinary that both the present Minister and his predecessor during the last Dáil were prepared to ignore the strong recommendations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights on the question of the definition.  Experts have been stating for many years that it was important to widen the definition to move away from the old concept of the male aggressor versus the passive female victim.  That was one of the central issues behind the Law Reform Commission's reports and the pressure that was brought to bear for the introduction of this legislation.</P>
    <P>I recall stating on Second Stage that this is one of the few pieces of legislation to come before the House in the eighties that, by the expiry of the decade, we were reforming and renewing once again.  I felt that, if we were mature enough to state in 1988 that we got things somewhat wrong in 1981, that was an admission that we should at all stages be prepared to make.  Had we passed the legislation in its original form we would have passed legislation that was defective.  I certainly welcome the Minister's amendments. They are not altogether different from the Fine Gael amendments which <Col N="1268" /> attempted to broaden the definition of rape by widening the concept of statutory rape.  That, in effect, is what the Minister had done.  I fail to see how the Minister can say he is not interfering with statutory rape as we know it now &mdash; that is defilement of a girl under the age of 15 years. The Minister in his new section 4 has introduced a definition of &ldquo;statutory rape&rdquo;.  I fail to see how he can say he is preserving statutory rape in its own pigeon hole and yet come up with a new definition that is not going to take from &ldquo;statutory rape&rdquo; as we know it.  I welcome the fact that this, in effect, will be the new statutory rape.</P>
    <P>The major source of conflict between the Fine Gael Party and the Minister on Second Stage was on the newly created offence of aggravated sexual assault.  It is clear that the nomenclature involved is of very great importance to a victim if she feels she is not raped in the common law sense.  If somebody is subject to a horrific sexual assault it is extraordinary the degree of mental trauma and nightmare she suffers if she finds in court that the aggressor is not charged with rape. This is the point the Minister has eventually conceded.  The broadening of the definition of rape will certainly be a considerable source of help to these victims. It was a source of tremendous worry and added considerably to the trauma when the person, believing she was raped, realised that the charge proffered against the aggressor was a lesser charge not incorporating rape.  The Minister has certainly made an advance as far as that view is concerned.  The fact that the definition of aggravated sexual assault is being broadened is an advance.  The violation of bodily integrity of the victim will distinguish this form of violence from other forms of violence of a criminal nature.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that he is preserving the common law concept of rape and that is what we in Fine Gael also attempted to do.  Our amendment was geared towards broadening the statutory offence of rape so as to distinguish between the common law offence and the statutory offence. The Minister has gone down the same road, and that is also worthy of a note <Col N="1269" /> of welcome.  The advances made by the Minister are welcomed and will be universally acclaimed.  It is certainly a step in the right direction as far as the victim is concerned.</P>
    <P>We will be proceeding to other amendments later, but the central theme of the legislation has been reformed to meet the needs of the day and the views of the experts in this regard.  I am glad the Department of Justice have decided to take on the board expert opinion, and particularly the views of the women's group in this regard.  No matter how expert a male might become in this area, it is of paramount importance that the views of the women's group, who are the real experts, be taken on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared for a long, hard, time-consuming slog on this matter and the number of amendments tabled to broaden the definition signifies the depth of the debate.  This is a fundamental matter of principle.  Views have been expressed by women and by people who deal with the victims of rape.  I welcome the Minister's acceptance of the principle involved.  Hopefully we will be able to improve on what he has offered.</P>
      <P>We all recognise that there has been a shift from the view that only vaginal rape was rape and the only violation that deserved the stigma and the legal term of rape.</P>
      <P>Many of us in this House traced the history of the establishment of the crime of rape.  We all realised that the crime of rape was established more for the guardians of the victim and the victim of the crime of common law rape, as it was called, experienced a lack of value and worth.  There was a paternalistic and patriarchal concept built into the evolution of the crime of rape, that it was a loss of value.  Gladly we do not have to go into that any longer as women establish their own independence, autonomy and rights.  It is important to put in context that this was women's main argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As time went on, and as we discussed other Bills to which the Minister positively responded, there seemed to <Col N="1270" /> emerge, from reports from the Rape Crisis Centre and counsellors of victims, a broader, more perverted and more violent type of attack on women and victims.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister is considering the whole area of pornography and the link between pornography and this bodily violation and humiliation of victims.  In that context, it is of the utmost importance that in this Bill we recognise that the violation of a victim by anal or oral penetration, either of the penis or another object, constitutes humiliation, violence, hatred and sometimes greater physical injury.  It is established &mdash; it is important to say this because it is part of the principle being established now, particularly when we are concentrating on broadening the definition &mdash; that another misapprehension of centuries was finally and firmly put to one side, that it was of a sexual, seductive and titillating nature. The notion of victims as seducers put them into desperate situations in court cases.  Through this debate, and because of women speaking out as victims, it has been established that rape has nothing to do with sexual attraction or man not being able to contain his sexual urges.  It is an act of violence and hatred towards women, it must be squarely faced as such and tried and sentenced as such.  If we do not accept that in its entirety, as Deputy McCartan already pointed out, we will have different levels or tiers of seriousness of the crime.  Women &mdash; and men who have been sodomised and raped in the real sense of their internal feelings in prisons and elsewhere &mdash; can testify to the fact that there is no difference in their response to these acts of violence.</P>
    <P>In the report of the Law Reform Commission the broadening of the definition is based on the fact that &ldquo;it was the violation of the bodily integrity of the victim&rdquo;.  That also applies to the mental, emotional, personal integrity and privacy of the person.  It is merely splitting hairs to make differences such as rape under section 4, statutory rape or common law rape.  It still allows us not to fully accept that any form of violation penetration <Col N="1271" /> of any orifice is horrific and must be accepted in community, legal and the traditional stigma terms which have attached such seriousness to this crime of rape.</P>
    <P>I had a difficulty about statutory rape having its own particular legal definition but Deputy McCartan pointed out that the term statutory rape is almost conveniently accepted and used by the legal profession to describe the rape of a person under age.  However, if it has only been used in that convenient sense then there should be no difficulty in a statutory rape being seen or consigned to one category only.  Therefore, I join my colleagues on this side of the House in welcoming the principle which the Minister has introduced and which has been debated and discussed for so long.</P>
    <P>I know that the people who made representations to the Law Reform Commission, and to the Committee on Women's Rights, will join me in that regard.  The fact that the Minister has gone so far down the road means that we will have very good reformed legislation but let us not spoil it with a series of interpretations which take away from the broad fundamental principle about which I was talking and the seriousness of the violation of people, whether by object or penis.  As Deputy McCartan also said, I take it that the Minister has recognised that section 4 (b) which reads &ldquo;penetration (however slight) of the vagina by any object held or manipulated by another person&rdquo; will include the anus. We are determined that gender will not apply here and although women are the greatest victims of this horrific crime, it is important that where a man also suffers male rape it is recognised.  In fighting for our reform I do not want men to be excluded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Members on all sides of the House for the welcome they have given to the amendment I have proposed today.  I used the words &ldquo;central issue&rdquo; which were also used by Deputy Fennell and they are central to the whole debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1272" /> It is important to reflect on what exactly is being decided.  In the Bill we will have the common law definition of rape.  There will be a new crime of rape under the new section 4.  In the new section 4 (1) rape means a sexual assault that includes, (a) penetration (however slight) of the anus or mouth by the penis, or (b) penetration (however slight) of the vagina by an object held or manipulated by another person; (2) A person guilty of rape under section 4 shall be liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for life; (3) Rape under section 4 shall be a felony.  This means that there will be a common law definition of rape, rape under section 4 and aggravated sexual assault to cover serious sexual assaults not involving sexual penetration.</P>
    <P>The reason I brought forward the new amendment &mdash; as I have already outlined &mdash; is to cover the point made by Deputy Barnes in relation to the humiliation, sense of trauma and the psychological damage to the victim and the protection of the victim, male or female.  In relation to the question of gender, in response to Deputy Barnes and Deputy McCartan, the definition will cover the rape of a male by another male, that is penal penetration of a man, and is, therefore, gender neutral to that extent.  I want to emphasise that.  The whole basis of the new section is as a result of the discussions I had and the opportunity I had to reflect on the situation in the months since it was last debated here on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>Like a number of other speakers I want to pay tribute to the work of the Rape Crisis Centre.  I had the opportunity to meet the personnel of that centre and I was very much struck by the case they made.  I was also influenced by it and I should like to pay tribute to them for their work in this area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1273" /> Among other things Deputy McCartan wanted to know why we should stick with the common law definition of rape. During the debate in the Dáil and Seanad various speakers including me, set out the reasons for retaining the existing definition.  Briefly, rape has been known as a distinctive crime for centuries.  It is clearly distinguishable from all other forms of aggravated sexual assault.  It is the abuse of an act which in proper circumstances constitutes an expression of human love.  The essential ingredient of rape is the absence of consent to sexual intercourse.  That is rape in the common law sense as distinct from the new definition of rape in the new section 4.</P>
    <P>In many cases rape would be accompanied by violence.  The essence of the crime is the absence of consent which has to be proved.  In the case of aggravated sexual assault consent will not normally be an issue.  In the case of penetration by instruments, it is inconceivable that consent would be an issue. I would not go along with the suggestion that penetration by instrument should be included in the common law definition of rape.  I am meeting the legitimate concerns of women who suffer this terrible trauma of this type of sexual assault.  In the new section 4 what is described as a rape is not a rape in the sense of intercourse that could produce a child but it is the rape of a person, it does violence and the woman involved is rightly entitled to feel that legislators are protecting her by giving the definition laid down.</P>
    <P>The penetration of the anus by an object will not constitute rape under section 4 because in certain circumstances such an occurrence may not constitute a serious offence.  For example, one could have horseplay among school boys where an object, for example, a pencil could penetrate the anus and a person would not be charged with rape in such circumstances. However, if there was a serious indecent assault involving penetration of the anus by an object it would come within the broad definition of aggravated sexual assault under the Bill and an offender could then be charged with aggravated sexual assault.  The new <Col N="1274" /> offence of rape under section 4 is limited to sexual assault involving penetration of or by sexual organ.  The offence of aggravated sexual assault is being retained to cover serious sexual assault not involving penetration.  That is the situation in relation to that.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Kitt for his welcome of this amendment.  It will address the trauma and psychological damage that so many victims of this horrendous crime feel.  I would like to thank Deputy Kavanagh and others who spoke giving a welcome for this amendment.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to have had the opportunity &mdash; which proves the value of parliamentary debate &mdash; of meeting requirements of experts in the field with this amendment.  It is not a question of being dragged into changing the law.  It is a question of having an opportunity to consider points put forward by interested groups.  The new definition of rape under section 4 will meet the genuine and deeply felt views that the acts described in section 4 are worthy of the description &ldquo;rape&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I overlooked a few matters but perhaps it was better to let them stand so that we could assess the Minister's reaction to the points raised. The inclusion of &ldquo;anus&rdquo; in subparagraph (b) is regrettable because the Minister is departing from the principle of gender free definition.  He is now introducing two new definitions under the section 4 definition for the conditions of rape for a woman and the conditions of rape for a man.  That is a pity.  I would ask the Minister to think again about it before we complete this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings me to a far more worrying aspect.  I hope I have got it wrong but if I have not, then my worst fears are confirmed in respect of this section.  I refer to the element of consent.  The Minister talked about horseplay and pencils; if two schoolboys decide that they want to penetrate each other with their pencils, that cannot be constituted an offence. The Minister in his Second Stage speech dealt with this matter in a very startling <Col N="1275" /> way.  When I was looking at the amendment I wondered were we talking about penetration with an object in all circumstances or where this element of consent came in.  There are many circumstances in sexual intercourse and sexual contact between consenting adults where animate and inanimate objects can be brought into play.  I am thinking about a person who is completely impotent, incapable of an erection, who might use some form of object in place of the limp organ.  I am thinking of a vibrator, an object not unknown to the love play between consenting adults and about the finger itself.  In relation to the Minister's definition the Minister used the words &ldquo;any object held or manipulated by another person&rdquo;, whereas the Law Reform Commission talked about inanimate objects clearly intending to take the idea of the finger or digital penetration out of it.  Their view was that if there is penetration by the finger between consenting males there is no difficulty, but that does not arise because we are talking about inanimate objects that are nonconsensual which would come into one of the other categories of aggravated sexual assault.  I would like to have this matter cleared up.  I have fundamental problems about the Minister's definition if the element of consent is a non-issue.</P>
    <P>In the Second Stage speech delivered by the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, this issue was dealt with in an incredible way and the Minister repeated himself here this evening in the comments on the definition.  The Minister, Deputy Woods, speaking on the definition of rape said:</P>
    <P>That argument does not stand up to scrutiny.  Rape has been known as a distinctive crime for centuries, and is clearly distinguishable from all other forms of aggravated sexual assault. The essential ingredients of rape is the absence of consent to an act which in proper circumstances constitutes an expression of human love.  Although in many cases rape will be accompanied by violence the essence of the crime is <Col N="1276" /> absence of consent which has to be proved in every case.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, in the case of the aggravated sexual assaults we are talking about consent will not normally be an issue.  Indeed, in the case of penetration by instruments it is inconceivable that consent would ever be an issue and to suggest, as has been suggested by the majority of the Law Reform Commission, that the offence of rape should embrace non-consensual acts of this nature must be wrong in principle since to do so would give rise to the startling implication that such acts, if consensual, would be acceptable.</P>
    <P>I fundamentally disagree with that proposition, and have instanced many opportunities where the use of an object, for penetration purposes, is utterly and totally legitimate and acceptable between consenting adults in lovemaking.  For this reason I am concerned about the absence of the term &ldquo;non-consensual&rdquo; from the definition of what constitutes rape under section 4.</P>
    <P>In looking at this matter, in the context of this Bill, I examined the cross references to see if the concept of non-consensus will come in.  Under section 4 rape means a sexual assault.  According to the Bill as amended and passed by the Seanad sexual assault has the meaning assigned to it under section 2 which goes on to state that the offence of indecent assault upon any male person or upon any female person shall be known as sexual assault.  In other words, there is no argument that consent or non-consent is a necessary ingredient in this area of crime in the Bill as passed or the back references.</P>
    <P>As I said, I am fundamentally opposed to the universal or absolute prohibition of object penetration which seems to be strongly proposed by the Minister's amendment and supported by his views, as expressed by the Minister for Social Welfare Deputy Woods, on Second Stage, which were repeated earlier this evening.  I hope we can change that but if not, as with the idea of leaving out a <Col N="1277" /> reference to the anus in subparagraph (b), I will pursue these matters on Report Stage by way of specific amendment.  I hope we will not have to do that and that we can argue this thing out and get it right.</P>
    <P>I also believe that we should include the word &ldquo;inanimate&rdquo; in qualifying what constitutes an object.  To leave it as it stands is leaving it far too wide because, as I said, the finger presents a problem and will be included in the definition of &ldquo;object&rdquo;.  The Law Reform Commission were careful to use that word in qualifying the object involved.  Those specific points on the definition have to come into it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has proposed the old style common law definition of rape, statutory rape as suggested in the new section 4, aggravated sexual assault and sexual assault but a further definition has to be thrown in and that is the odd definition contained in the 1981 Act which stays intact.  The Minister's regime of the four gradations does not in any way attack the very male definition of rape under the 1981 Act.  Oddly, we are talking here about introducing a gender-free definition of rape whereas in fact we are not doing this absolutely or entirely under section 4 but even more so we are leaving intact the definition of rape under section 2 of the 1981 Act which states in section 2 (1) that a man commits rape if (a) he has unlawful sexual intercourse with a women who at the time of intercourse does not consent to it and (b) at the time he knows that she does not consent to the intercourse or he is reckless as to whether she does or does not consent to it.  That is being left on the Statute Book in all its sexist glory.  It is not gender free and, as I understand it, it represented an effort at the time by the Legislature to put on the Statute Book something that would closely approximate, if not cover, the old common law definition.  Therefore we find ourselves in a rather curious, if not a bit confused or convoluted position despite the Minister's best efforts and I hope we can move a bit closer to a tidier definition.</P>
    <P>That is the reason I believe the <Col N="1278" /> approach of the Law Reform Commission is the better one.  I attempted to address that approach in including an all-embracing definition of rape in the Bill this time around.  I should say if we can clarify the reasons we should leave out a reference to penetration of the anus by an object, deal with the question of consent satisfactorily and can take &ldquo;object&rdquo; to mean an inanimate object, then I would be very happy with the Minister's proposals and would think that we had improved matters substantially. However if we cannot do this I certainly would not agree to a very unsatisfactory formula which has more holes than good in it and would press my own amendments in this regard.  What I am saying to the Minister is that if we can make progress on the three points I have made in relation to the definition I will be prepared to meet him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister and welcome the extension of the definition of the awful crime of rape, the most heinous crime apart from murder. However I have to say to him that the introduction of three categories will only lead to legal argument with lawyers nitpicking the various technicalities.  This will in turn make it extremely difficult to convict a person charged with this offence.  The introduction of one specific definition of rape would make it easier to overcome the difficulties which will arise in the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The incidence of rape is increasing and has been accentuated by the violence we see on our screens each night.  It is a crime which has to be addressed head on and I welcome the Minister's proposal that the sentence to be handed down should be lifetime imprisonment.  However I have my doubts whether any person will be asked to serve a lifetime sentence in a country where in some ways murder is accepted as being the norm and where the life of a clergyman, asleep in his own bed, was taken in the early months of this year and the person who took his life was given a sentence of eight years, a derisory sentence.  The following day men charged with robbing a bank in <Col N="1279" /> Enniscorthy got 12 years.  Therefore it would appear the sentence for taking a life can be fixed at eight years.</P>
    <P>Despite all the moonshine and talk about abolishing the death penalty and imposing a life sentence I believe no one will ever see anyone being asked to spend a lifetime in prison.  It is ridiculous.  It is part of the charade we go on with here in the legal area.  I venture to say that this is yet another enactment of the charade that nobody, but nobody, will serve a lifetime for rape, no matter how foul because the bleeding hearts in society and the do-gooders will, after some time, come in and plead that so and so should get out without giving any thought to the crime of which that person was guilty. The crime of rape is an appalling one.  I would have my own way of dealing with it.  I would take a continual sex offender to a veterinary surgeon who would ensure that there would be no further such crime so far as that person was concerned.  It is the absence of deterrents that has allowed people to get away with rape. That view is not unique to me, it was expounded in the House of Commons some years ago by a lady baroness &mdash; I would say to Deputy Barnes that I am not a baron but that is my view.  People who commit that crime, and certainly second offenders, should be dealt with in that manner.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister if it is obligatory for a person who is a sex offender to receive treatment while he is in prison.  If that is not the case then it should be. Everybody who is convicted of rape or of any other sexual offence clearly has a mental disorder and should be given treatment while in prison.  I agree with the Minister in the matter of a life sentence but, while I do not doubt his intention, I question whether society will allow or will ask anybody to spend their life in jail for rape.</P>
    <P>The other point to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention is that the three categories he has itemised are very specific and will lead to all types of argument in court.  There should be one <Col N="1280" /> definition of rape and a very definite sentence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to a number of the points made rather than getting bogged down in detail, I would like to remind the House of what is the object of this amendment.  It is, I outlined at the start, that a woman who is the victim of the type of violation, as laid down in the new section 4 proposed by me, regards herself as having been raped and needs the offence involved to be termed &ldquo;rape&rdquo; if she is to feel properly vindicated.  I believe that the course of action we are taking in retaining the existing definition of rape is correct and should not be interfered with.  However, the type of sexual assault at issue under the provisions of section 4 is viewed with the utmost disgust. As I said earlier the offence should attract the stigma and odium which is attached to the original definition of the crime of rape.  That is what is being done by this amendment.  That is the central issue that was between us all in this House.  It was the central issue that was being debated by others outside the House.  Whatever else we decide on now or whatever other points are to be made, let us remember that that is exactly the central issue that is being catered for in the amendment I have brought forward. It is brought forward because of the consideration I have given the matter and because of the case made by groups such as the Rape Crisis Centre, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Womens Rights and by other groups and individuals with whom I have discussed this issue.  The definition is clearly intended to tackle a particular problem and I believe it does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McCartan asked about the element of consent in the new section 4. I would draw the Deputy's attention to the beginning of the section where there is a reference to sexual assault.  If there is consent, no sexual assault has been committed and the new offence does not apply.  I can assure the Deputy, therefore, that the consensual acts as outlined by him do not come within the scope of the new section.  The Deputy also raised <Col N="1281" /> the question of penetration by an inanimate object.  The term &ldquo;inanimate object&rdquo; was not used because of concern that it would lead to legal argument as to what exactly was or what was not an inanimate object.  The advice I received is that a finger could not be regarded as an object for the purposes of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to listen to points being put forward by Deputies.  I am prepared to go away and consider them for Report Stage and see if I can meet some of the points at issue.  The central core issue which is of such vital importance to women and to men, too, who are victims of these crimes, who have been degraded in a way which does not involve sexual intercourse but at the same time feel they have been raped, is that they should have the comforting blanket of the psychological protection of a definition of rape under the provisions of section 4 as I have outlined it and proposed it to the House. I strongly urge acceptance by Members of the House of the definition as I have outlined it to cover this core issue.  If there are points that individual Deputies want to make either in the House or to me privately I will be prepared to listen to them and to consider them in advance of Report Stage.  In debating this issue we should not get ourselves tied too much to what I would term &mdash; though they are important &mdash; side issues when the core issue, which we are trying to deal with, is dealt with in the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to respond to the points made by Deputy McCartan. The Minister is correct in ensuring that in this legislation we focus on the issue we all want to address and that is the victim &mdash; whether it be a woman or a man &mdash; of violation.  I for one, having listened to the Minister, would share his view that Deputy McCartan's fears are groundless. I appreciate the legitimate argument he makes.  He refers to the possible infringement of the rights of consenting adults in lovemaking and he refers to the use of objects, whether legitimate or not, between consenting adults.  While accepting that there is logic to his argument I would have to say that the definition of <Col N="1282" /> sexual assault is covered by the legislation. Section 2 (1) states:</P>
      <P>The offence of indecent assault upon any male person and the offence of indecent assault upon any female person shall be known as sexual assault.</P>
      <P>When we look at the Minister's amendment we see that rape under the provisions of this Act includes the various items listed at paragraphs (a) and (b). Once the reference to sexual assault is there the fears expressed by Deputy McCartan are covered in that the Minister, quite rightly, is focusing his attention on the act of violation and is not getting embroiled in any way in the lovemaking act of consenting adults. That is how I read it.  I welcome the fact that the Minister will respond as he has done in the past, to any legal points that are raised here today.  I repeat that there is a very serious issue to be addressed.  It has been described as one of the most serious violations we have to face.  The Minister is dealing with this correctly. The definitions on page 3, lines 24, 25 and 26 will cover Deputy McCartan's legitimate fears.  It does not in any way infringe on the rights of consenting adults but it deals with the act of violation.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge that the Minister is prepared to have regard to and listen to what we are saying and I will be happy to move on from this on the basis that serious consideration will be given to it on Report Stage.  I would welcome a reasonable opportunity between the completion of Committee Stage and the commencement of Report Stage, having got a copy of the amendments the Minister has set down today, to consider the matter.  I am not suggesting that we unduly delay the Bill which I hope will have passed through this House before the Christmas recess.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to <Col N="1283" /> impede that.  From remarks made on Second Stage I am worried that there is a difference between us on the idea of consent.  There is a view coming through that the notion of object penetration in whatever circumstances can in some way be unnatural and therefore could not be contemplated or facilitated in our legislation. It may not be a view that is strongly held.  Other views were expressed on Second Stage and the Minister argued very cogently about the defintion of rape generally.  I recognise that on reflection, mature and all that it was, and in consultation with those active in the field and those who met with him, he has taken a different view and I acknowledge that as a magnanimous gesture and a good response from him. Views can change and I hope in this area they will change.</P>
      <P>The issue of consent is a difficult one. It is not something that is either there or is not there.  If it is an assault consent could never arise and <i>vice versa.</i>  In section 8 we attempt to improve upon the definition of consent.  The Bill states that the failure of a person to resist cannot be taken as an indication of consent in trying to establish whether or not consent exists. There is a fundamental problem.  The Minister might like to reflect on this a little more.  I am not demanding that he do it today.  From what he says there should not be any difficulty about including in subsections (a) and (b) of section 4 the words &ldquo;non consensual&rdquo; penetration so that the section would read &ldquo;...rape under section 4 means a sexual assault that includes (a) non consensual penetration (however slight) and (b) non consensual penetration (however slight) ...&rdquo;.  That would get over the difficulty from my point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is evident to the Minister, and Deputy Kitt, in looking at the back reference to section 2 that it is covered let us firm up on it in the way we have sought to firm up on the whole concept of consent, for example in section 8.  I am not pursuing something that is a frivolous or academic issue particularly when we consider that we are introducing in the <Col N="1284" /> Bill the concept of rape within marriage. We are getting into the area of the consensual arrangement between two married people engaged in sexual activity and lovemaking.  This becomes more critical when we talk about and respect the privacy of the marriage and the marriage bedroom or whatever location in the house the couple would engage in sexual activity or making love.  We need to think about it.</P>
    <P>I am impressed that in the consultation paper the Law Reform Commission dealt at length with the concept of consent. They point out that in Western Australia, New Zealand, Canada and in many of the other common law jurisdictions where they had addressed this problem, statutorily they have come down to very firm definitions.  They have been careful to firm up on the idea of the need for consent or the absence of consent and what consent means if it is to be defined in clear terms.  In their final report the commission say we should introduce certain definitions with regard to consent and use the terms &ldquo;consent&rdquo; or &ldquo;non consent&rdquo; throughout the definition section. Their definition of rape as they advanced it was the non-consensual penetration. They were the words they used.  I urge the Minister, in the context of penetration under section 4, to use the word &ldquo;non-consensual&rdquo; penetration.</P>
    <P>If I am assured, and I have no doubt but that the Minister will seek to so assure me, that the definition of object does not involve something that is animate and has life in it, like a finger, then I would not be worried.  I am curious to know why the Law Reform Commission, who consulted a wide range of people and who researched this to the extent that they did, felt it was an important qualification of the word &ldquo;object&rdquo;.  They constantly referred to &ldquo;inanimate object&rdquo;.  I am curious to know why if there is no difficulty about it the Minister cannot accept it. Why not include in subsection (2) the word &ldquo;inanimate&rdquo; before &ldquo;object&rdquo;.  I invite the Minister to look at that matter before Report Stage.  Perhaps he will advance in further details the advice he has been given and the case laws or any <Col N="1285" /> text book references available to him that helped him decide that &ldquo;object&rdquo; defined means inanimate object entirely and would not refer to, for example, finger or any other prominent portion of the anatomy.  Those are my concerns.</P>
    <P>In the spirit of what the Minister is saying I hope the argument of another central principle of all the amending legislation we are trying to do now, that is to maintain the non-generic definition, will persuade the Minister in time to accept that he should include under subsection (b) the word &ldquo;anus&rdquo; as an orifice capable of being interfered with or raped by an inanimate or other object.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the teasing out of this issue.  My amendment goes to the core of the issue which separated both sides of this House and others who are deeply concerned.  I will refer Deputy McCartan to line 241 where it is stated that rape means a sexual assault.  There cannot be a consensual assault.  That is a contradiction in terms.  I have already answered the point about the inanimate object and the Deputy might have an opportunity before Report Stage to reflect on that answer.  I am concerned not to open a Pandora's Box of legal interpretations which would lead to difficulties in the courts.  On Second Stage we were talking about the interpretation of existing definitions.  I am determined to maintain the non-gender aspect of the legislation.  That is the core of my thinking.</P>
      <P>I have listened to the points made by Deputies.  Where they see that further improvements could be made on the improvements I have announced today, I am quite prepared to look at these issues between now and Report Stage.  I am not making a commitment to make alterations but I will give them deep consideration.</P>

By making sexual assault a felony it will attract that power of arrest without warrant. Although the most extreme form of sexual assault will constitute aggravated sexual assault, there will be circumstances where a serious sexual assault might not be charged as aggravated sexual assault.  This is clearly envisaged in the Bill and section 2 (2) provides for a penalty of five years' imprisonment for a sexual assault.  It is clearly appropriate that the Garda should have the power to arrest without warrant persons suspected of a serious sexual assault.

      <P>In page 4, lines 10 to 12, to delete subsection (2).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals with the old section 4 which will now become section 5 in view of our acceptance of amendment No. 7a.  In the original Bill as passed by the Seanad section 4 dealt with the abolition of marital exemption in relation to rape and laid down that henceforth rape could be committed between married couples and that there should be no prohibition based on the anachronistic and anarchic proposition that a man could not be guilty of the rape of his wife. It is proposed under subsection (2) that no proceedings can be instituted except by or with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  My amendment is to delete that qualification by removing subsection (2) in its entirety.  We propose it on the principle that we do not consider a married woman to be any different from any other women in any respect and in particular in her capacity to make a good complaint competently if ever she has the misfortune to be raped by her husband. Consequently we see no reason why there <Col N="1289" /> should be any differentiation in the procedures to be undertaken by a victim in those circumstances of rape within marriage and by a victim who is raped outside marriage.</P>
    <P>One of the central propositions advanced at all stages in the cause of amendment of the law with regard to rape and improvement of the conditions for dealing with rape victims &mdash; once they presented themselves to the prosecuting and investigating authorities &mdash; was that life would be made easier for them, they would be dealt with and responded to in a caring, meaningful way, with no unnecessary impediments put in their way once they had had the courage to come forward and tell their grisly tale to whoever they approached as a matter of course.</P>
    <P>Consequently we have now recognised that women are citizens of full right, and that they should never lose their rights in society simply because they are married. Heretofore, in the development of the law in regard to the sexual offence of rape, we have not treated women properly. We have had this notion, that originated in paternalism, in male sexual and social superiority, that a woman spurned would be a woman sore, that a woman's word needed to be corroborated in order that, at a trial, her testimony would have to be accompanied by a recent complaint made to an independent person by way of supporting, corroborative evidence.  I hope we have got rid of all that.</P>
    <P>We have amended the law.  We have improved on many of these unnecessary, anachronistic notions and rules.  That is why it is unfortunate that we would allow this feature remain in this Bill.  It is some what insulting to married women to suggest that they would be more prone to make unfounded allegations; I think that is the thinking behind this clause.  I acknowledge that the Law Reform Commission argued for this proviso but I think they are wrong.  Indeed, I think this House would be wrong to accept this amendment and put it on the Statute Book.  It is insulting to married women to suggest that they would be more prone <Col N="1290" /> to make unfounded allegations, that they would be inclined to abuse court procedures any more than any other women or citizen.</P>
    <P>It is important that we understand the current state of the law.  All of the offences with which we will now be dealing will be felonies, all of them capable of trial and indictment.  Consequently &mdash; if we take this amendment aside &mdash; a complainant will be able to initiate proceedings only by way of private summons or by lodging a complaint with an investigating officer, a member of the Garda Síochána who might then, on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions, institute proceedings.  Once the proceedings have been concluded before the District Court and a ruling that a <i>prima facie</i> case has been established, the case automatically reverts to or becomes the property and sole responsibility of the Director of Public Prosecutions before being brought to the Circuit Court for trial.</P>
    <P>What we are achieving by the deletion of this subsection is giving married women the right to initiate proceedings, to prosecute them through preliminary investigation in the District Court.  Then, in time if a married woman succeeds in establishing her case, it becomes the property, authority and responsibility of the Director of Public Prosecutions who will have absolute control over it.  Therefore, what we are suggesting by the deletion of this subsection is not something unduly radical or that would in any way lead to undue oppression of husbands or abuse of the courts and court procedures.  There are sufficient inbuilt safeguards to ensure against such practices.</P>
    <P>In any event I contend the better course to adopt in the first place, in the spirit of maintaining principles, would be to put married women in these circumstances on the same footing as all other women.  Then, if there developed a scenario in which there was undue abuse, an over-preponderence of married women going into the District Court, to the Garda Síochána or elsewhere, making false, unnecessary or vexatious <Col N="1291" /> allegations of rape within marriage against their spouses, at that stage, we might consider introducing an amending Bill.  I contend it is wrong to anticipate or suggest an ulterior or base motive simply because a person, or a woman, is married. That must be wrong in principle.</P>
    <P>I would request the Minister to allow the Bill go through without the proviso. Let us then ascertain how matters transpire in the implementation of the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Within a scenario in which we have given the Director of Public Prosecutions absolute discretion &mdash; in circumstances in which he is obliged and in fact never does give an explanation of his decisions &mdash; I contend it is wrong to include this proviso and give him authority in the circumstances of this crime.  I am visiting no criticism at all on his office.  I contend it was right in the first instance that he was given that absolute discretion which has been protected by the High Court and the Supreme Court to be inviolate; that it is correct that he should not be expected to enter into the public arena to explain his decision whenever he reaches them. Nonetheless this is a controversial, emotional area, essentially an emotional one.  It is one in which I have no doubt we will find women, complainants and organisations working in the field, very early on demanding to know why the Director of Public Prosecutions took a particular decision in given circumstances that would seem to be contrary to the interests of the married woman complainant and, certainly, contrary to the work some of the agencies are endeavouring to do in this field.</P>
    <P>In circumstances in which the Director of Public Prosecutions is unapproachable, his decisions not deemed to be subject to appeal, when in practice he never has or does explain his reasons in particular instances or cases, then I contend it is wrong to give him this authority or power to say no proceedings can be initiated without his consent.  I urge that the Minister accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>The section with which we <Col N="1292" /> are dealing, which was section 4, now section 5 as a result of the amendment we have accepted, is a major advance in the protection of married women by society.  It constitutes the abolition of marital exemption in relation to rape and reads:</P>
      <P>Any rule of law by virtue of which a husband cannot be guilty of the rape of his wife is hereby abolished.</P>
      <P>Rather than being unfair to married women, as has been suggested by Deputy McCartan, this section is a major advance in the cause of equality and protection of married women within our society.  So that we may deal in a caring way with the problems of married women the abolition of the marital exemption in relation to rape is now being eliminated.</P>
      <P>However, I oppose the amendment which would allow proceedings for marital rape to be instituted without the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Section 4 (2) was inserted in the Bill because of the evidential difficulties that would invariably arise in marital rape cases and in order to prevent the institution of spiteful or mischievous proceedings by a spouse or an interfering third party.  The present position is that under Article 30.3 of the Constitution a private person may not prosecute a criminal offence except in a court of summary jurisdiction, that is, the District Court.  In the case of a serious crime such as rape effectively that means that a private prosecution could reach the stage of preliminary hearing in the District Court only but could go no further.  By virtue of section 4 (2) even this preliminary stage could not be initiated without the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  This is a necessary safeguard. For that reason, and because of the evidential difficulties to which I have referred already, section 4 (2) is an important provision in the Bill while, at the same time, clearly stating that this is a major advance in the overall area of the protection of married women.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment for various reasons.  For many years <Col N="1293" /> I worked with Women's Aid which was a hostel for battered wives.  Again and again the cases that came up during that time were of women coming into the hostel who had been beaten by their husbands but would also have been raped. We are talking about that act in the context of all the definitions in this Bill, without consent, with violence, etc.  The dreadful frustration for those women and those helping them was that there was no way they could have their husbands convicted of what was straightforward rape in any context.  We have to keep in mind that in this country we do not have divorce, so people cannot become unmarried and for ever and ever two people, who would have separated through an agreement or because of a barring order or any of the other legal provisions that fall far short of allowing the marriage to be dissolved, are still married so they would be treated in a different way in the event of a violation of rape or any of the definitions of rape in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the fact that I agree with Deputy McCartan that it is unfair and discriminatory, that is going to cause great problems.  This constitutent group of separated married people is growing all the time.  Very often, particularly where there has been violence in the marriage, you have resentment and motivation on the part of some violent men to abuse their wives.  In that context when we talk about what we mean by marriage we have to look seriously at this amendment.  You are not necessarily going to have any more vexatious claims, in my opinion, than you will have anyway.  I am worried about the fact that the Director of Public Prosecutions will be the person to signal whether these cases should go ahead, for all the reasons the previous speaker has outlined.  Having grasped the nettle which was not grasped in 1981 when the original Bill was being debated, now we recognise that we do not need to apologise for taking action and being involved in what would be called the private area of marriage in cases like this.  We should go all the way and we should not have another separate definition in this matter. <Col N="1294" /> I support this amendment and I ask the Minister to consider his views on it again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if I was to agree to allow this situation to take place, the complaint would get only as far as the District Court.  What we are dealing with here, rape, goes to the Central Criminal Court, so the Director of Public Prosecutions has to come in.  Even if you allow a private prosecution without the involvement of the Director of Public Prosecutions it goes only to the District Court.  Because of the seriousness with which the Government view rape and with which this House always treats it, it is going to the Central Criminal Court and there we need the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Therefore, the involvement of the Director of Public Prosecutions is central.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that this issue was mentioned by the spokesmen on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy O'Keeffe.  I am not trying to score points.  For the benefit of the recollection of the House here I quote what he said as recorded in column 222, Volume 394 of the Official Report of 5 December 1989.</P>
      <P>While I can foresee evidential problems arising in marital rape cases, on balance I favour the Minister's proposal that the martial rape exemption should now be abolished.  I am to some degree affected in that positive view by the inclusion of a proposal that prosecutions of marital rape could only be initiated by the Director of Public Prosecutions. This would ensure that frivolous charges would not be made.  I tend to support the view of the Minister on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the view, but I suggest the key issue, of protection for women inside or outside of marriage &mdash; and we have a major step forward here in the abolition of marital exemption in relation to rape &mdash; is that we in this House view it so seriously that it will go to the Central Criminal Court, and to get to the Central Criminal Court it cannot be done on a private prosecution; it can be done only on the direction of the Director of Public <Col N="1295" /> Prosecutions.  I assure the House that, rather than in any way being uncaring in relation to this, I want to try to be totally caring, totally protective of the married woman and ensure that in the event of rape within marriage, which is a completely new concept in our law in this country, she will have the maximum protection and that it will be treated with the seriousness which it deserves and will go to the Central Criminal Court and not to the District Court, which would be the effect of this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Minister in his last remark indicated a complete misunderstanding of what is being proposed in the amendment.  To suggest that taking out subsection (2) would in any way force cases to be dealt with in the District Court that might otherwise be dealt with in the Central Criminal Court is utterly wrong. All indictable offences are capable of being tried in courts outside the District Court, either in the Circuit Court or the Central Criminal Court.  All individuals are entitled to initiate those proceedings in the District Court, where they have to be started only by summons because they cannot lay a charge sheet.  In this regard I invite the Minister to advise the House of the very few instances where the Director of Public Prosecutions must consent to the taking of a prosecution before it can be done.  There are very few.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are arguing here that a woman victim of rape who happens to be married should be in exactly the same position as any other women who happens to be raped, unfortunately, or any other victim of any crime be she or he male or female. In other words, we are arguing simply that a married victim of rape, a woman raped by her husband, should be entitled to initiate proceedings or to have a member of the Garda Síochána initiate the proceedings or bring the proceedings without the absolute pre-consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  That is all we are contending for.  It is accepted fully that if the proceedings are properly instituted and initiated and the defendant <Col N="1296" /> elects for trial on indictment or the case must go on indictment to the higher court &mdash; if we accept the Minister's proposition, to the Central Criminal Court &mdash; all the victim can do is prosecute the matter through preliminary investigation in the District Court, and the moment the district justice says there is a case to answer and sends him forward for trial it then ceases to be the property of the victim complainant.  That is the situation in all indictable offences, in all cases that go from the District Court to the Circuit Court or the Central Criminal Court. Nothing new or different is being argued for here.  We are certainly not arguing for a prohibition on these cases being dealt with in the Central Criminal Court or in the higher courts or insisting they be dealt with in the District Court, as the Minister suggested.</P>
    <P>The issue of the role of the director is a very real and worrying one, as Deputy Fennell has suggested.  If anyone was ever in doubt about it, there is a celebrated account of a horrendous case of multiple or gang rape on a Glaswegian girl some eight or nine year ago.  I am reminded of this because I have just returned from Glasgow and the last time I was there I bought the book which illustrates this.  I will give it to the Minister if he feels it might help him to understand the problem of the director's role.  The director's counterpart in Scotland, the Procurator Fiscal of the day, refused to take the complaint, act upon it and prosecute, and under a quirk of the law in Scotland relating to the taking of civil proceedings which can reactivate criminal proceedings, the victim was able to find a sympathetic lawyer who investigated the case and succeeded in getting the police to issue warrants to bring before the courts three young men the victim had always identified and had always accused of this horrendous crime.  She had been slashed brutally in the face and body and virtually left for dead.  It is one of the most celebrated examples of where, for whatever reason, no action was taken, and I have no doubt the Procurator Fiscal of the day and the Director of Public Prosecutions here might have very good <Col N="1297" /> reasons for not acting in certain circumstances. But that sense of grief and hurt that we are trying to assuage by improving the definition of rape will compel a woman raped within marriage to seek justice and to bring a prosecution. It is only right and proper that our law should allow her to initiate the proceedings and to have the same rights as any other complainant victim has in our law.</P>
    <P>My question then is, why do we suggest that married women are more spiteful than any other woman, or any other man for that matter?  Why do we anticipate that married women will be more difficult in co-operating with the police in the prosecution of cases than the victims or complainants in relation to any other offence, men or women?  I do not accept the proposition that there is a need for safeguard here at this stage.  I might be convinced in two year's time when we see how the law works, but until then we are making an unfair assumption and we are being less than fair and respectful to the married woman.  For that reason I am asking the Minister to think again about this proposition and to accept the amendment I am proposing, the simple deletion of subsection (2).  I would ask the Minister to do so, particularly if he got the wrong end of the stick in regard to what we were seeking to achieve here.</P>
    <P>I accept fully that all a complainant woman in this circumstances can do, as in all other indictable situations, is make the complaint, issue the summons herself as a complainant in her own name, as is the right of every citizen in all other circumstances of crimes, or go the Garda and have them initiate the investigation and/or proceedings before the court before they submit a file to the director. There are often good practical reasons that the Garda, once they have received a complaint of rape, should move quickly to apprehend the offender and have him lodged in a cell, faced with a charge, obliged to be released on bail.  That facility will not be there where the director must be consulted because the practice in these situations is that the director will insist upon a file being assembled and <Col N="1298" /> conveyed to him in Dublin where he will have the opportunity to review the facts and then make a decision, and what he will be looking for are facts that indicate whether there is spite or a vexatious prosecution.</P>
    <P>Where would the speed of action be more necessary than in the case of a married couple where the woman is raped?  Is she to return home while the Garda send the file up to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions so he can decide whether a prosecution can be brought?  What if the husband realises that there is substance in the woman's threats that she will make the complaint, and she has done so?  He escapes the jurisdiction, leaves the home that he has little or no respect for in view of the violence that he has shown to his wife and probably the children as well.  He skips.  He has got fair notice.  His wife has actually gone to the police station and the file is being prepared and being sent up.  All this is a worrying feature of this proposal.  The evidence is not there to support the necessity of it.  It is an undue worry on the Minister's part; it is an undue safeguard and it is discriminatory and unfair to the whole number of married women who unfortunately may become victims of the horrendous crime of rape by their husbands.  I take on board what Deputy Fennell has said with regard to the increasing trend of women in our community who are married in name only because of the absence of divorce and can never be free of their husband and the marital tie.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me restate the situation for Deputy McCartan.  Rather than being less than caring about married women within our society, we have made a major advance in Irish law by abolishing the marital exemption in relation to rape. Any rule of law by virtue of which a husband cannot be guilty of rape of his wife is abolished.  That is a major step forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share Deputy McCartan's concern for the woman raped within marriage who goes to a police station to complain.  The obvious step after that would appear to <Col N="1299" /> be to obtain a barring order against her husband rather than returning to live under the one roof with him when she has made this complaint and has a prosecution proceeding for rape within marriage. At present rape can, in certain circumstances, be dealt with summarily in the District Court.  When this Bill is enacted, however, this will no longer be possible.  There is, therefore, no point in allowing a private prosecution in the District Court because rather than giving extra protection to the married woman it would be diluting her protection.  If we allow a private prosecution in the District Court without the Director of Public Prosecutions being involved, unless he is going to proceed with the case, it will not go any further.  In this legislation I am merely ensuring that the Director of Public Prosecutions will be involved from the very beginning to give the maximum protection to the married woman.  What we want to see is a situation where rape will be treated in a serious way and will go to the Central Criminal Court.  Each complaint, whether inside or outside marriage, will be treated in a serious way and the Director of Public Prosecutions, on the basis of a file from the Garda, will be involved from an early stage.  Deputy McCartan's suggestion, rather than protecting married women would dilute the major protections we are including for the first time for a married woman whose husband can be found guilty of rape.  That is a very important protection for married women.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the major provisions, and one we have all welcomed, is section 4 which proposes to abolish the common law rule that a husband cannot generally be guilty of raping his wife.  This has been welcomed by all sides of the House and I compliment the Minister on it.  As I understand it, rape within marriage by a husband of his wife is to be treated differently in law to rape outside of marriage.  I agree with Deputy McCartan on this matter.  We all agree that whether rape is committed within <Col N="1300" /> the marriage or outside, it is a crime and should be dealt with accordingly.</P>
      <P>Section 9, which deals with the crime of rape, should apply to rape in every case.  The argument put forward, and repeated by the Minister, is that rape within marriage produces evidential difficulties and that the case may be brought forward because of spite or mischievous complaints by a wife.  That could happen either inside or outside marriage and why should it be treated differently?  It may happen more often in marriage but the same evidential difficulties will arise in rape cases whether within the marriage or outside it.  If the Minister proceeds with his argument it will result in this excellent Bill being somewhat flawed in one respect.  For that reason I support Deputy McCartan's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was vehement about making this change.  The abolition of the marital exemption is a most welcome advance that is universally supported but it is a pity there appears to be this element of clawback.  In introducing the major advance he stated that he was anxious to treat crimes of sexual violence, whether within marriage or outside it, in a most serious fashion but surely similar crimes should be treated in a similar fashion.  Not so long ago legal people, and legislators, were saying that it was impossible to legislate in this area, that it was undesirable, and well nigh impossible from an evidential point of view, to interfere with the marriage bond.  Now we can see there were no great evidential problems in cases where there was serious physical assault, perhaps not of a sexual nature.  I see no reason why the Minister should not treat a crime of a sexual nature within marriage in the same way that we treat a similar crime outside marriage. Obviously, there are difficulties from the point of view of proof but that should not be the ultimate barrier towards proceeding along the lines I have suggested. The office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is an independent office and because of its position there will be a serious fall out in so far as criticism of it is concerned.  That would not be welcome <Col N="1301" /> and would be undesirable but it will happen if subsection (b) is enacted.</P>
      <P>The full protection of the law must be given to people within and outside marriage.  While the abolition of the marriage exemption represents a major step forward, I am fearful of the clawback.  I hope the Minister will see the contradiction and will, perhaps, come back on Report Stage with a form of compromise. People assume that sexual violence within marriage is, perhaps, less serious or less violent than outside it but there is no way that can be deemed acceptable. The introduction of subsection (2) represents an element of clawback which is undesirable.  I realise there may be difficulties but the overriding principle has to be one of treating these horrendous offences in a similar way in so far as possible.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that private prosecution in the District Court is merely the key towards apprehending the offender and not the undesirable end in itself that he seems to suggest?  I wonder why there is such apprehension about District Court involvement when it would be the key towards justice being seen to be done in cases of sexual violence within marriage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcomed, as we all did, the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission, who acted on the many submissions they received, to give the same protection to women within marriage as to those outside it who are the subject of rape and violence.  In pushing for this reform we made the valid point that by marrying a woman gives up one of the most fundamental rights available to her, that of legal redress for what has been described as the second most serious crime, second only to murder.  That point was well taken and that is why the marriage exemption has been abolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty arises with subsection (2) in that there is still the lingering suspicion that a woman, devious as she is with all the traditions and myths of Eve hanging about her, would once again use rape within marriage as some way of getting back at her husband.  I have heard in the <Col N="1302" /> arguments opposing this provision that for frivolous or vexatious reasons a woman would use this, if such right was given to her within marriage, to get back at her husband.  I put it to the House that the trauma, humiliation and violation of a woman is so deep that sometimes she is not able to cope with admitting to being raped.  The argument offered that a woman in a bad marriage would somehow use this as a means of frivolously or vexatiously getting back at her husband is insulting, totally neglects and underestimates once again the level of humiliation this crime causes &mdash; and has caused &mdash; to women.  That is why it has the tinge and the colour of the kind of male thinking, if I may put it like that without being chauvinist, which has always coloured this crime, that in some way Eve, the serpent woman, the seductress, is really to blame.  It underpins this again in so far as we are not willing to allow an independent partner, a spouse within marriage, to have the same rights as she would have outside marriage.  Indeed, I would go so far as to say that perhaps a constitutional case might be able to be taken on it because we have very strong constitutional protection of the institution of marriage.  Supreme Court cases have been won on the protection of that section of the Constitution.  However, I should like to think that we would never enact legislation in this House which would be brought to those lengths and, in natural justice and having regard to the independence, autonomy and the individual human right of a wife, it would not lead us to believe &mdash; as some women today are led to believe &mdash; that they have fewer rights within marriage than a common law wife or cohabiting partner. We must take that seriously and it is part and parcel of discrimination against a wife.  I ask the Minister to give it great thought.</P>

      <P>I listened to the points made and I accept that they were made in good faith.  I ask the Deputies on the other side &mdash; and I assume they do &mdash; to accept that the points I made in relation to the extra protection being given to <Col N="1303" /> married women, right and proper protection, are also made in good faith.  Married women are entitled to this protection and it is now being provided in the Bill that a husband can be found guilty of rape in future, which is vitally important. The other aspect is to ensure that maximum protection is given to the Central Criminal Court to deal with persons facing a charge of rape.  I want to extend the absolute maximum protection possible to married women.</P>
      <P>I was taken with the point made on this Bill by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, the spokesman for Fine Gael, that he could foresee evidential problems arising in marital rape cases.  He said that, on balance, he favoured the Minister's proposal that marital rape exceptions should be abolished.  He went on to say that he was to some degree reinforced in that positive view by the inclusion of the proposal that prosecutions of marital rape could only be initiated by the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
      <P>I will oppose Deputy McCartan's amendment if he proceeds with it now but I will look at the matter for Report Stage to see if I can meet it.  However, it will dilute rather than extend the type of protections which I want to extend to married women.</P>

      <P>I am more than happy to withdraw the amendment in the knowledge that the Minister will reflect on the matter and come back to it on Report Stage.  I want to make one point in outlining some of the practical difficulties I could see emerging where prosecutions might be delayed for important, small periods of time during which the director is consulted as to whether a prosecution can be initiated or taken.  The Minister suggested he felt that the next step a person might take would be to look for a barring order.  In most cases that would probably be the practical next step but I have no doubt that a scenario would emerge where the only single act of which the woman could complain was the act of rape carried out after weeks or months <Col N="1304" /> of psychological warfare, silence or sullenness. Having been to the police she then goes to the District Court and asks the judge for a barring order because she has been raped by her husband.  The district justice is advised that the file has gone to the Director of Public Prosecutions. I have no doubt that the district justice would say that he had to wait to see what the director said because he was worried about the built-in proviso in the Bill that this complaint could be frivolous. He would have to consider the matter very carefully before he would put a man out of his home and he might well say that the matter would be brought to a higher court, the Central Criminal Court, and that he should wait for the outcome before he gave a barring order. That is a worrying feature and the proviso which the Minister thinks will give full protection could work against these people.  In any event, it is wrong to suggest that married women are frivolous or vexatious.  However, I am happy that the Minister intends to reflect on this before Report Stage when I hope we will come back to it.  In those circumstances, I will withdraw my amendment.</P>

      <P>This is a rather radical change which changes the rule of law under which a male person has to be over 14 to be deemed capable of committing an offence of sexual assault or rape.  I am concerned about this.  Because of the introduction of this section we will see more young boys coming before the courts.  Although it does not come directly under this Bill my concern would be about the treatment in detention of those boys and the care and rehabilitation that would be introduced to deal with this section.  What will happen to these young boys if we are now bringing a new young vulnerable violent group of people before the courts to be convicted?</P>

      <P>In relation to this legislation and the childcare legislation a problem was highlighted in that in attempting to set a higher age for criminal responsibility, there could be a conflict with regard to criminal charges brought by people under 14 years old.  Supposing we set a criminal age of 15 and yet other legislation going through the House says that a criminal offence arises where young boys of 14 or under are found guilty of rape?  This point was raised before on the debate on this Bill but it was also raised under the Child Care Act. <Col N="1306" /> We must come to some sort of agreement on this.</P>

      <P>The section as drafted is faulty.  I would like to hear the Minister on it.  In an effort to clarify matters I will read the section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is hereby declared that in relation to an offence that consists of or includes the doing of an act to a person <Col N="1308" /> without the consent of that person any failure or omission by that person to offer resistance to the act does not of itself constitute consent to the act.</P>
    <P>The failure or omission to offer resistance might by its nature constitute consent to the act, or it may not, each case depending on the facts.  I assume the section intends to state that any failure or omission by the victim to offer resistance does not necessarily constitute consent, but the section as drafted goes much further than that in so far as it is saying that any failure or omission to offer resistance cannot in any circumstances constitute consent.  That may mean that where a person deliberately offers no resistance because he or she was really consenting, that could not constitute consent although there was clear consent given. There is a difficulty there.  On reading the section I see a drafting difficulty that would be met by my amendment. Obviously the question of consent is vital, but consent must be freely given in each and every circumstance.  I hope the Minister will address the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be pleased to try to clarify the issue.  I am conscious that the issue was raised by Deputy O'Keeffe on the Second Stage debate and unfortunately there was little time to reply on Second Stage and it was not possible to give a considered reply to Deputy O'Keeffe's point.  The point being made by the Deputy is a subtle one which needs to be looked at carefully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 8 provides that lack of resistance of itself is never by itself sufficient to prove consent.  The amendment now being proposed might suggest that in certain circumstances lack of resistance of itself could be sufficient to prove consent. I have to oppose the amendment because the insertion of the word &ldquo;necessarily&rdquo;, if it would have an effect at all, would worsen the position of women by making it more difficult to convict people of rape. If the Deputies are concerned that this section might be unfair to the accused, I would point out that while the section does not allow lack of resistance of itself <Col N="1309" /> to show consent, it does not prevent it being used in conjunction with other circumstances to show consent.  It is a subtle point.  We do not want to reduce protections and the extensions of protection to women in this situation and I am afraid the amendment would do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied then that his proposal has to have the last word on this?

I am not saying I have the right answer but there is a difficulty in what the Minister is saying.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The position is that vocational education teachers are the only group of officers in the local authority service still appointed by politicians.  It seems that it is quite foolish that, for example, a county manager who makes major decisions of a public policy kind is not appointed by politicians because it is considered that he should be above and apart from politics while at the same time politicians are involved in appointing somebody to a post of responsibility in a vocational school where their suitability over that of another candidate has no public policy elements; it is simply a matter of personnel quality judgment.  I believe the job of politicians, be it at European, national or local level, is to decide issues of policy and with regard to very important appointments at the very top of a service to sanction appointments which have been properly prepared by others. For example, the appointment of a secretary of a Department is no longer the sole prerogative of a Minister; the secretary of a Department is appointed by the Government having been interviewed by an independent interview body and the Government always appoint the person recommended.  That is the proper distinction between policy and personnel decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very unhealthy that teachers in vocational schools who wish to be promoted either to the principalship or vice-principalship or even a post of responsibility should feel in the final analysis that the decision whether or not they are appointed rests with politicians. I should say that in the vast majority of cases &mdash; and I mean the vast majority, 99.99 per cent of appointments &mdash; the appointments made are the correct ones and are made without any influence being brought to bear which ought not be <Col N="1311" /> brought to bear on an educational appointment but, notwithstanding all those considerations, the very fact that politicians make the final decision does lead to suggestions, perhaps on the part of disappointed candidates, that there were some influences in the background which ought not to have been there.  Most of the time these inferences would be completely inaccurate but if people are disappointed with regard to any appointment they are seeking they tend to look around for explanations.  As long as politicians are involved in appointments perhaps people will have a tendency to look for political explanations even though they may be entirely incorrect in this. There will always be a tendency to look for political explanations for a failure to be appointed as long as politicians continue to be involved.</P>
    <P>It is also the case in respect of most appointments, for instance in Aer Lingus and other places, that canvassing will disqualify but this is not the case with regard to these appointments.  I have heard suggestions from the teachers' unions, where interview boards involving politicians discuss the characteristics of candidates, that information comes out about how particular people did at interview and how they comported themselves and so on, because naturally politicians, being in public life, come under pressure to explain their decisions more so than those who are not in public life.  They may well explain particular decisions inadvertently and with the best intentions in the world, by making reference to how people performed at interview and so on but this can prove to be very hurtful and unnecessarily hurtful.  This does not happen in the overwhelming majority of cases but the very fact that there is a possibility of it happening is a reason why it should be eliminated.</P>
    <P>I also believe that those in the vocational education system who may have particular political views which are not popular or are of a minority kind might feel that proclaiming those views publicly and getting involved in politics in a way which brings their political views <Col N="1312" /> to public notice could harm their educational career.  Again, I accept that in the overwhelming majority of cases there is no danger of this happening but because there is even a possibility that people might think it would happen it is something which should be eliminated.</P>
    <P>I propose, a Cheann Comhairle, to share my time, if I may, with Deputy Deenihan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I did refer to the fact that 99.99 per cent of appointments are made perfectly properly but there were two examples, the 0.01 per cent, where the appointments were not properly made.  I am not going to give the details or the names and so forth but I have them and if the Minister or any other Deputy wants me to show them to them I will.  In 1987 a particular person was nominated for appointment by the selection board, which is an independent body, but the vocational education committee in question at a subsequent meeting sought to overturn the recommendation of the selection board and appoint instead a person who was in fact a member of the vocational education committee itself in place of the person recommended by the selection board.  It was only prevented from going into full effect by vigorous action on the part of the trade union representing the teachers concerned.  To my mind teachers should not have to take industrial action to prevent something of that kind happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was another example in 1979-80 and I should say that the cases I am citing did not involve the same political party. Different parties were involved on the two occasions concerned so I am not seeking to suggest in any way that one party are more prone to do this than the other.  During 1979-80 a person was interviewed and recommended for appointment as vice-principal in a particular school.  The interview board was composed of four people and the person recommended was in fact a member of the vocational education committee as <Col N="1313" /> was his mother-in-law but neither of them declared their interest in the appointment in or after the interview.  He was appointed and I do not see anything wrong with that but it is unfortunate a situation was created where somebody like that found himself in that position. As long as a person is a politician and a member of a vocational education committee they should not find themselves in a position where they could be faced with a conflict of interest if seeking a promotion within the vocational education committee.  One way of avoiding such a conflict of interest would be to remove from the vocational education committee any say in the appointment so that if a member of a vocational education committee, who happens also to be a teacher within the vocational education committee system, wants to seek appointment there will be no conflict of interest, there will be no invidious comparisons, there will be no suggestion that if there was an interest it should have been declared.  For the sake of politicians this invidious choice should be removed from their hands.  I know there are some who will say this represents in some sense a diminution of the proper responsibilities of local government.  I do not believe that is the case.  I believe that those involved in local government whether in a vocational education committee or in any other place in local government should feel that they have sufficient to do to decide issues of education policy within their own vocational education committee, to decide about the policies to be pursued by the schools under their care.  I do not believe that serving politicians necessarily know which is the best individual to fill a particular teaching post within a particular school.  Our training as politicians at national or local level, does not give us any confidence to make decisions about whether a person is a good teacher. That is not what we are trained for.  Those who should make decisions about who is a good teacher or who is a good person to exercise responsibility in a school are people who are actually involved and have practical experience in education and are involved in the selection process <Col N="1314" /> because of that experience.  I know some members of the vocational education committee happen to have practical educational experience but that is simply an accident of their appointment.  There may be many vocational education committees where there are few, if any, people who have any immediate and direct practical experience of making educational judgments.</P>
    <P>I should like to stress again that appointing a teacher to a particular position in a vocational school is an educational, and not a political matter.  I do not believe that, therefore, this system should continue.  Arguments may be made, perhaps by the Minister &mdash; at least such arguments were made on a previous occasion &mdash; that, to involve the Local Appointments Commission in this process would be rather cumbersome.  It might be said, for example, that while the Local Appointments Commission could deal with the number of applications that would come forward for, say, appointment to principalships in schools, to involve the commission &mdash; a national body &mdash; in appointments to lower positions of vice-principals or posts of responsibility would involve too much referring up to Dublin, so to speak, of decisions that should be taken at local level.  That can be easily met if the Local Appointments Commission were to set up, under agreed criteria as to their conduct, local appointment panels in each region who would be there to make the appointments at local or regional level on behalf of the commission.  The important thing is that they would be operating under rules, procedures and criteria laid down by an independent non-political body, such as the Local Appointments Commission, and not operating under a body like a vocational education committee who are necessarily a body in which politics plays its part.  Politics should be involved in education policy making.  I defend the continued involvement of politicians in decisions in vocational education committees where they are concerned with policy but not with personnel within individual schools.</P>
    <P>The argument that this Bill would <Col N="1315" /> create a cumbersome process for decisions because so many decisions would have to be referred to Dublin can be refuted because it is possible to find a practical solution by establishing local panels.  In any event the number of teachers to be appointed is not all that great and I am sure that practical solutions can be found to these problems.</P>
    <P>I would stress that this Bill was introduced in 1989 in the last Dáil.  On that occasion Second Stage was concluded and agreed unanimously with an undertaking by the Minister that she would, in due course, bring it forward for discussion on Committee Stage.  She has not done so.  I understand that she has come under some pressure to change what was an initially favourable position towards this legislation because it is suggested that some of the Fianna Fáil county councillors were among those who were most concerned at the fact that Fianna Fáil had entered into a Coalition with the Progressive Democrats and that in order to assuage their injured pride the Minister, among other concessions, would withdraw her tacit support for this legislation and continue to maintain the existing system whereby councillors would be involved in appointments of this kind. The Minister has not to my knowledge confirmed this to be the case.  I hope it is not the case.  Indeed, I hope that when the Minister does speak she will find it possible to accept this Bill.  I make no claims that the drafting of this Bill is beyond all improvement. I am sure the Minister has available to her information about many practical problems that may arise in regard to having a system of appointment by a Local Appointments Commission, which is an independent non-political body, rather than by politicians. There may be many practical problems, only some of which I have adverted to and dealt with so far.  If that is the case the sensible process for us to adopt here in this debate is to accept the Bill in principle on Second Stage and to deal with those practical problems by means of amendment on Committee Stage. <Col N="1316" /> All that I and the Teachers' Union of Ireland &mdash; they have publicly endorsed this Bill &mdash; are seeking is agreement from the Minister in principle to this legislation. We are confident that if she accepts it in principle he will, of course, make such amendments to it on Committee Stage as will make it entirely workable and remove any problems &mdash; I cannot anticipate any &mdash; she may have. If there are problems she has the ability to overcome them by means of Committee Stage amendments.  On that basis I hope I will have convinced my colleagues in the House, the progressive Democrats who supported this legislation on the last occasion and who now form part of the Government and also, indeed, the Minister who accepted it on the last occasion as well as other parties and Members to go ahead and deal with this issue once and for all.  The political appointment of teachers is not an issue that should be left undecided.  We should deal with it and get it off the agenda and not go on agonising about it.  I hope this occasion, Private Members' Time, will allow us do that.</P>

      <P>In March 1989 Fine Gael proposed to Dáil Éireann that it adopt a Bill aimed at removing the appointment of vocational teachers from the political arena.  Dáil Éireann adopted the Bill on Second Stage and in so doing endorsed the idea that the appointment of vocational teachers should be undertaken by an impartial body, such as the Local Appointments Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill was supported by the Labour Party, The Workers' Party, the Progressive Democrats and a number of Independent Deputies.  If it was right to have the Local Appointments Commission appoint vocational teachers in March 1989 it is surely right now.  I and my party would expect that those parties and Deputies who supported the Bill last year would again support it on this occasion.  The only reason the matter was not progressed and the only reason my <Col N="1317" /> party have again found it necessary to propose this measure to Dáil Éireann is that the former Bill lapsed with the dissolution of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposed here this evening seeks the right to right a wrong.  It seeks to remove the suspicion of political interference from the appointment of vocational teachers.  The Bill seeks to guarantee and endorse the profession of vocational teaching by ensuring that these teachers are appointed by a professional, competent and respected body such as the Local Appointments Commission. Vocational teachers are local authority officers.  Every other category of local authority officer is appointed by the Local Appointments Commission. Why not vocational teachers?</P>
    <P>The Local Appointments Commission was set up in 1926 by a Cumann na nGael Government to remove appointments of local authority officers from the political arena.  It has worked well.  I see no reason that it should not now be extended to the teaching area.  It is anomalous that chief executive officers of vocational education committees are appointed by the commission but teachers are not.</P>

      <P>In many instances principals of colleges and schools have salaries equal to and comparable with CEOs, yet CEOs are appointed by the commission but not teachers.  We must remove once and for all the taint or suspicion of political appointment from the appointment of teachers and we will do that by passing this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that removing the appointment of teachers from vocational education committees will weaken local democracy.  The standing of vocational education committees and of teachers will be enhanced when their appointments are above suspicion as they would be if they were appointed by the Local Appointments Commission.  This Government and all Governments over the past ten to 15 years, have sought to rationalise the provision of post-primary <Col N="1318" /> education.  This is to be achieved by amalgamating vocational education committees and secondary schools in towns around the country by providing one school as opposed to two or three as at present.  This is commendable.  However, one of the major stumbling blocks to the rationalisation of schools is the appointment system in the vocational area. There is a reluctance on the part of secondary teachers to consider assimilation into the vocational education committees because they distrust and are suspicious of political interference with appointments.</P>
    <P>I can give chapter and verse of appointments that were wrong but I do not intend to do so unless challenged to produce evidence.  Then I would be compelled to justify my position by giving examples. I instance the necessity for this Bill by pointing to the fact that the Teachers' Union of Ireland, which represents teachers in vocational schools and colleges, have campaigned vigorously for the past 20 years to achieve reform of the appointment system along the lines Deputy Bruton proposes.  What is a teacher who is politically active to do when he or she goes for promotion and finds a selection board composed of persons from an opposing political party? There will always be the suspicion in their mind if they do not get the job that politics entered into it.  It is high time that we removed such suspicions from teachers' appointments.</P>
    <P>All my party want is to remove the suspicion of political interference from appointments.  We also want to ensure that interviews are conducted by persons with expertise and a knowledge of teaching so that the best appointments are made.  We would like to restore the morale and standing of vocational education committees and teachers both of which have been affected by the present unfortunate system of appointment.  It is our intention to accede to the views of the teachers as expressed through their union for a fair and impartial system of appointment by bringing forward this Bill. Should the House pass this Bill we will be prepared to sit down with all interested <Col N="1319" /> groups to determine the best alternative system of appointment under the auspices of the Local Appointments Commission. We will talk to the Teachers' Union of Ireland, school managements and parents and take into account their views concerning a new mode of appointment. We are even prepared to talk to the Minister.</P>
    <P>What we are seeking is the first step on the road towards a new and better system of appointment the precise mechanics of which will be determined through consultation on Committee Stage.  I appeal to all parties to join with us in taking this first essential step.</P>

      <P>Thank you.  I thank all Members who have contributed to the debate.  The House will be aware that a similar Bill was discussed in the House in February 1989, during the currency of the previous Dáil.  At that time I set down the appointment procedures at present in operation for teachers in vocational education.  I also pointed out that the particular regulations governing these appointments were drawn up in 1967 and amended in 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish briefly to set out here what the appointment procedures are.  All full-time posts are to be advertised.  For appointment in second level schools eligible candidates are interviewed by a selection board consisting of five members &mdash; three nominees of the <Col N="1320" /> vocational education committee, one of the Irish Vocational Education Association and one nominee of the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>In Deputy Bruton's and Deputy Deenihan's submission great play was made of the fact that these boards were composed of politicians.  I set out the regulations which, by law, must be obeyed.  In second level schools the selection board consists of five people, three nominees of the vocational education committee, one of the IVEA &mdash; a very respectable organisation &mdash; and one nominee of the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>In the case of the regional technical colleges, the selection board consist of the chief executive officer, three other members of the board of management &mdash; at least one of whom is a vocational education committee member &mdash; and a nominee of the Minister.  There is provision for short listing by the selection board where the number of applicants is excessive.  It is clearly stated in the case of second level appointments that proposals by vocational education committees for appointments should be made in accordance with the recommendations of the selection board.</P>
    <P>In the case of appointments to RTCs the same arrangements, though not explicit, are understood to apply also. I will refer in more detail later in my contribution to the regional technical colleges.</P>
    <P>When this matter was before the House in February 1989, former Deputy George Birmingham was the main Opposition spokesperson on Education and the question of amending the Vocational Education Act, 1930, was raised.  It was indicated from the Government side that the amending of the Vocational Education Act, 1930, was under consideration, particularly the rationalisation of the vocational education committee service through the amalgamation of some of the existing committees.  It was my intention to consider the question of teacher appointments by the vocational education committees in the context of amending the 1930 Act.  It is important to recognise <Col N="1321" /> that the Bill would be, in effect, an amendment of the Vocational Education Act, 1930.</P>
    <P>A number of developments affect the operation of vocational education committees which lead me, and the Government, to the conclusion that the time is not opportune to proceed with the legislative amendments to amalgamate VECs.</P>
    <P>I would refer the House to the amazing diversity and growth in the scope and nature of the work carried out by the vocational education committees.  I note that in the contributions by the Deputy Leader of Fine Gael, and by Deputy Deenihan, there was no reference to the enormous work being carried out by vocational education committees.  There was no recognition of their clarity of purpose, their long historical tradition and their magnificent and thorough response to emerging educational needs, far beyond the chalk and talk of regular classes conducted by teachers.</P>
    <P>The vocational education committees have followed the remit given to them in 1930.  I freely acknowledge that the people who framed that Act were the most sagacious people ever to be in an educational service here or anywhere in the world.  The Act was framed in such a flexible and open way that it allowed for developments that could not have been foreseen.  The system as then envisaged was based on the teaching of manual trades, technical subjects, husbandry and subjects of a prescribed technical nature, yet the framers of the Act saw to it that the necessary flexibility was there to enable a vocational education committee take on all sorts of other activities.  The men and women who have occupied administrative and elective positions since have honoured to the letter the remit they got.  Members of the committees, who served voluntarily, set out in 1930 in bad circumstances, in little huts and halls, and followed on from Horace Plunkett and the Technical Instruction Act.  They adopted the developmental ideas which were abroad in an emerging nation.  Members of these committees still opt to serve voluntarily.  They are <Col N="1322" /> people who in the main put themselves up through the democratic process.</P>
    <P>I have no wish to alter what I said on the last occasion a Bill of this type was proposed and I quote from what I said then:</P>
    <P>I have always thought that anyone who goes for election, be it to a local urban council right up to the highest office in the land, is exercising a very noble option.  When teaching young people and at political meetings I have often said that it is very easy to decry the democratic process.  As we all know various pressures combine to denigrate the work of elected persons.  At the same time a person who goes forward for election puts himself or herself in front of the population at large.  They knock on doors and invite responses. They go to the ballot box and are vulnerable. Therefore I think we should espouse and guard the democratic process in all of our doings.</P>
    <P>I said that nearly two years ago and I stand over it.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to imply that Deputy Bruton was snide; he spoke in a very friendly and open fashion, as did Deputy Deenihan.  It is not correct to seek in any way to pull down the elective process or the actions of elected people.  We speak in a legislative Assembly to which we were elected by the same process as those elected to vocational education committees. I have to make that very plain in the cause of democracy.</P>
    <P>Even in the last two years the operations of vocational education committees have diversified and expanded in line with their remit in the Vocational Education Act, 1930.</P>
    <P>I want to pay fulsome and sincere tribute to the people, elected and administrative, who operate our vocational education committees.  The Youthreach programme is operated jointly by my Department and the Department of Labour.  This programme is targeted at people aged from 15 to 18 years who are at least six months in the labour market and who left school without any formal education or training.  The programme is <Col N="1323" /> intended to provide participants with the knowledge, skills and attitudes required to make the transition to work and adult life.  The programme was started in 1989 through 11 vocational education committees and provided 600 places.  A further 500 places are being provided in 1990.  Further expansion of the scheme is envisaged for 1991.  There has been very welcome co-operation between Departments who, previously, were suspicious of each other.  They have come together with the vocational education committees in this very fine development.</P>
    <P>An amazing example of vocational education committee activity is the implementation in 1989 of the vocational training opportunities scheme.  This scheme is aimed at giving unemployed persons over 21 years of age the opportunity to follow full-time education and training.  There are now, in its second year of operation, 33 groups of 20 people involved in the scheme spread over 24 vocational education committees.  Again, it is the intention to expand the scheme in coming years.</P>
    <P>There are vocational preparation and training programmes in which the vocational education committees play the major role.  These have continued to increase and diversify and we are in the process of devising a system of recognition of VPTs.  All the vocational education committees are operating the vocational preparation and training programmes, either VPT 1 or VPT 2, and in some instances both.  There is need for a coherent approach to a system of recognition and accreditation for those schemes.  We hope to have a consultative process completed by Christmas and we will then draw up a national scheme to recognise the work of VPTs on a regional basis.</P>
    <P>Vocational education committees will come together, with a local input, with modules suited to the environment, then get national recognition of their work study and what has been achieved thereby.  It is a great advance, again carried out joyfully by the vocational education committees in the full knowledge <Col N="1324" /> that, is so doing, they were expanding the range of options of young people.</P>
    <P>In 1990 the allocation for adult literacy and community education targeted at disadvantaged areas was greatly increased. Virtually all of this allocation was given to the vocational education committees who were informed that literacy was a top priority.  They have responded magnificently. Before Christmas I am arranging the coming together of all the vocational education committees to undertake an audit of what they have done and to plan for the future.</P>
    <P>Another area in which the VECs have responded is that of providing greater scope for and range of activities in the demand for all-Irish education.  As a natural follow-up to developments at primary level, second level all-Irish schools are now being provided at an increasing rate, in the main under the aegis of the vocational education committees.  For example, they have been provided this year in Carlow, next year in Kilkenny and Bray, with Meath and so on to follow but, wherever they are established, they come under the aegis of the vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>In the light of these recent developments &mdash; which add to the already diverse role played by VECs in the education and training system &mdash; the Government have decided to postpone for the present the question of the rationalisation of the VECs so that the question of bringing forward amending legislation to this end does not arise at present.</P>
    <P>In the meantime I have been giving detailed consideration to the Private Members Bill before the House this evening.  There are a number of points I might make in regard thereto.</P>
    <P>First I should say that appointments to vocational schools are very much in the minority given that such schools comprise approximately 6 per cent only of the total number of all schools, that is to say that there are some 3,200 national schools, 500 secondary schools in the voluntary sector, 60 or so community and comprehensive schools and 250 second level vocational schools.  In the case of all of <Col N="1325" /> these schools the appointment of teachers is a matter for their management authorities.  In those circumstances I am not at all certain that it is reasonable to target VECs for special treatment.</P>
    <P>Surely in an era in which we seek to have devolution, to have participatory local democracy, to have people take control of their lives, to have people take decisions by way of elected structures at local level &mdash; as do the boards of management of primary schools, and the boards of management of voluntary secondary schools while the numbers of religious involved in education decrease &mdash; more and more boards of management and, in some instances, lay principalships come into play as community and comprehensive schools have their boards of management, all with full professionalism taking their decisions at local management level and undertaking their deployment procedures and recruiting their teachers, it would be extraordinary that we would seek to pick out 6 per cent of the schools of Ireland and say to them: you must take another route; you cannot be depended on by way of local democracy; you cannot be depended on to be employed by local management groups; you are something different; you have to go to Dublin to the Local Appointments Commission.</P>
    <P>While appointments to VECs technically are made to the committee's scheme as a whole generally they arise out of the needs of individual schools. Accordingly, the requirements of a particular locality are of the utmost importance. This is particularly true in the case of some of the programmes I have already outlined.  For that reason those making the selection should be fully aware of the needs of a particular school or locality.</P>
    <P>The selection/appointment process nowadays is seen more as an interactive one where the selection board, in addition to assessing the suitability of a candidate for the job, are involved in supplying the candidate with information regarding the post and its demands.  It is not a begging position.  Rather it amounts to circumstances in which a young adult <Col N="1326" /> presents herself or himself to an interview board when a strong interactive process then follows.  The question of &ldquo;mutual suitability&rdquo;&mdash;that is candidate to job and job to candidate &mdash; is frequently in question. Selection of this nature requires detailed knowledge of the post, its duties and the environment in which they are performed.  The further removed is the selection from the operation of the system the more difficult it is to carry it out on the above basis.</P>
    <P>In line with Government policy generally my Department are anxious to devolve as much responsibility as possible for the educational process to local management. The centralisation of functions is at variance with the idea of local bodies having responsibility for matters affecting their everyday lives.  The proposal that the appointment of teachers in vocational schools, and to those schools alone, should be determined centrally runs counter to this policy and argues against local democracy.</P>
    <P>One must look also at the nature of teacher appointments before deciding to remove this function from the local arena.  In the case of vocational schools, in common with other schools, the bulk of appointments arises at a particular time of the year; generally they must be made in time for the opening of the school year.  Quite often a VEC will not be fully aware of their requirements for a particular year until quite close to the time schools reopen after the summer vaccation. Indeed, even after the commencement of a school year, if for example there was an unexpected increase in enrolments, if the VPTPs &mdash; which are now widely advertised in vocational schools &mdash; resulted in extra numbers as they often do because young people now have various options of training, third level education and so on &mdash; it takes time for all of that to settle down and assume a shape which often does not happen until the end of September. Repeat leaving certificate courses are becoming a popular option &mdash; all the schools are advertising such courses.  If, for many reasons, there is an unexpected increase in enrolments then the staffing <Col N="1327" /> plans of a school may be subject to alteration. Of course, this is true also where unexpected vacancies arise in the course of the year.</P>
    <P>Teaching posts differ from administrative ones in that they can rarely be &ldquo;carried&rdquo; for any length of time; the classes and students are there and the teachers must be provided.  In such circumstances any appointments procedures must be one which can react quickly to particular needs.  The current system has that merit.  The fact that appointments are spread over a number of committees means also that no one body is faced with making as many as up to 200 appointments within a relatively short space of time.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware also that the demographic trends affecting second level education indicate that enrolments are set to fall fairly dramatically in the mid-nineties.  In the case of individual areas this trend has become evident already.  Added to that is the fact that funding for vocational preparation and training courses is dependent on moneys emanating mainly from the European Social Fund.  In such circumstances it is reasonable that, for a time, a number of teaching posts, although whole-time, in the initial stages must be regarded as temporary whole-time.  Of course the Local Appointments Commission do not deal with such.  Furthermore, in order to allow greater flexibility in the use of teacher allocation a significant portion of teaching strength sometimes is in part-time provision.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us also includes appointments to posts of responsibility. Deputies should be aware that the first &ldquo;A&rdquo; post and all &ldquo;B&rdquo; posts in any school are confined to teachers in that school. Other &ldquo;A&rdquo; posts are confined to teachers within the VEC scheme overall.  Again, given the relatively confined field of candidates involved I suggest it would be inappropriate to have such appointments made through the Local Appointments Commission.</P>
    <P>I might refer now to the position of the VEC colleges.  I hope to be in a position <Col N="1328" /> shortly to introduce legislation in regard to the future status and structure of these colleges.  Indeed, the matter has been cleared and the legislation has gone to the parliamentary draftsman for preparation. It is my intention that each college would have its governing body responsible for the selection of its staff. While that governing body would be under the aegis of the appropriate VEC, I would envisage them having much more autonomy than is currently the case.  Of course this will apply to the selection of teachers and lecturers.  I do not believe that when these new structures are put in place they will give rise to any demand for appointments to be based on recommendations of the Local Appointments Commission.</P>
    <P>Here I come to an anomaly.  Deputy Bruton and Deputy Deenihan referred to the fact that this was a longstanding viewpoint of the TUI, for 20 years.  I acknowledge freely that they came to see me on this matter and they put it to me, but in other talks and negotiations the TUI put forward the point of view very strongly that they wished the colleges &mdash; and I will be bringing in Bills shortly for the regional colleges and all VEC colleges &mdash; to remain under the aegis of the VECs. Therefore, there are two points of view put forward here by the TUI, one that in the selection process 6 per cent of the total primary and second level should somehow mysteriously be taken out of local democracy and plonked at the Local Appointments Commission, yet the strong wish expressed by them in writing and in negotiations and to which I gave assent was that the third level colleges should remain under the VECs.  In that regard the Government of 1983-87 before they went out of office had published a Bill providing for the colleges to be removed from the VEC sector.  That was strongly resisted by the TUI.  I put those facts forward for the record.</P>
    <P>The Government will not be supporting this Private Members' Bill as I have no immediate plans to bring in amending legislation to the Vocational Education Act, 1930.  I will undertake, however, to give consideration to this <Col N="1329" /> question should there be a need in the future to amend the Vocational Education Act.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I should say that in any proposal to change existing procedures, the question must first be asked whether the system as at present constitutes works satisfactorily, and I put forward that it does, eminently.  It should be pointed out that when the question was put to the Local Appointments Commission in 1976 the view expressed by the commission at that time, when there would be huge growth in teacher numbers because the numbers of pupils were going up and up, was that the system &ldquo;is well designed and operates satisfactorily&rdquo;. This view was confirmed again two years later in discussions with the Local Appointments Commission.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan said the reluctance of secondary teachers to amalgamate was due to the appointment system of VEC. That is a bit rich because all sorts of difficulties arise with regard to amalgamations but I have never heard that put forward.  The appointment of voluntary secondary teachers is certainly not in the hands or lap of the Local Appointments Commission.  I would imagine the appointment of vocational teachers is very open, very democratic and fully answerable for by the people who have been elected in the first place.  We talk of power and the people.  Let the people decide and make their choice.  If you elect people on to the county council or borough authority from which the VEC is then formed, how can you on the one hand say, &ldquo;We believe in the democratic process; we put our faith and trust in these people&rdquo; and then say, &ldquo;Yes, but you are not to do that; we do not believe in what you are doing&rdquo;?  It is a very false premise and the whole Bill for that reason is flawed.  It is flawed because it is referring to only 6 per cent of the educative process.  It is flawed if you believe in devolution, in local management structures and people taking responsibility for their own lives and their own decisions, if you believe in the professionalism of people, the voluntary nature of the VECs <Col N="1330" /> and the long tradition of vocational teaching. Let me say I have yet to meet a teacher who was appointed through a VEC who has not proved herself or himself to be truly professional and committed to the course of education and to carry out his or her job in a very fine, dedicated way.  Point me out a teacher who has come through the VEC selection procedures and who is not to the best of his or her ability doing a fine job for the young people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Even though this is a very short Bill it raises fundamental and wide-ranging issues, some of which were dealt with at some length by the Minister.  I was pleased to hear her talk about the many areas in the community in education that the VEC sector serves.  Adult education and literacy are two areas that are quite easily forgotten but are the sole preserve of the VEC sector in most areas. Vocational education committees are the most democratic education authorities we have in this State and, as has been pointed out by other speakers, at present principalships, vice-principalships, and posts of responsibility are the concern of the appointments sub-committees of VECs.</P>
      <P>A survey was carried out recently by the TUI regarding equality of opportunity in education.  Some of the findings there, particularly in so far as they relate to women, are somewhat disturbing. They are that attitudes within the teaching profession reflect the attitudes of society in general; that women still carry the main responsibility for children and, moving into the appointments area, that women are more likely than men to be asked questions at interviews about their child minding arrangements; that men and women alike believe it to be a strong disadvantage to be a married woman seeking promotion; that there is strong dissatisfaction with the appointments and promotions procedure, and that the predominantly male selection boards are a source of complaint by many women.</P>
      <P>Let me refer to section 2 of the survey which was carried out by Irish Marketing Surveys regarding equality in education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1331" /> It relates to the appointments procedures and shows that half the teachers in the sector are not satisfied with the appointments system that is there at present.  I quote:</P>
    <P>2.  Appointment Procedures</P>
    <P>The respondents were asked to rate procedures for appointment on a scale of 0 (not at all satisfactory) to 10 (extremely satisfactory).  The average rating was just over the half way point (5.1).  Women (at 4.8) gave a markedly less favourable rating than men (5.3) with married women at (4.6) recording the lowest levels of satisfaction.  Overall, younger applicants (4.7) and those in the second level VEC sector (4.9) recorded lower than average levels of satisfaction.  Not surprisingly, a higher proportion of unsuccessful applicants recorded below-average scores.  With unsuccessful married women (3.8) scoring the lowest satisfaction rates of all sex/status categories.</P>
    <P>The two main criticisms made by teachers giving a below-average rating of the procedures for appointment related to perceptions of political bias or influence, and Boards lacking the relevant qualifications or competence for interviewing in specific subject or job areas.  While men were more likely to be critical of political bias, rather more women than men criticized canvassing or the use of &ldquo;pull&rdquo;.  Women were also more likely to criticize predominantly male Boards, and their sexist or male bias.</P>
    <P>The findings of that survey are worrying, and the Labour Party are fully committed to a fair and equitable appointments and promotions procedure.  It is obvious from that survey that, on average, half of the teachers surveyed are not happy with the procedure.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with a small Bill which raises fundamental and wide ranging issues.  The Labour Party have some reservations as to whether a local appointments commission would necessarily prove to be a fairer or more effective <Col N="1332" /> method of making appointments at VEC level.  Appointments to teaching posts, and the whole area of teaching, relates to an ethos which is a separate thing in various schools.  Certainly, the input of the VEC or, indeed, of the board of management on appointments is something that the Labour Party feel cannot lightly be pushed aside.  As we know, the chief executive officers of vocational education committees are appointed by the Local Appointments Commission. There is a question as to whether the making of all appointments, and promotions, in a similar manner would not be cumbersome and unwieldy.  Indeed, the Minister dealt with this in her submission.</P>
    <P>A further question arises as to whether there would be sufficient local knowledge, and the knowledge of local educational needs, available to the commissioners.  In recent times there has been considerable discussion about local education authorities, decentralising from the Department of Education in Marlborough Street and giving more powers to education establishments in local areas.  The Labour Party are very much in tune with that.  The idea of local education authorities is not alone finding support in the vocational sector, where the Teachers Union of Ireland have published a booklet on this concept, but in the private secondary sector also.  The concept of local education authorities which seems to be meeting with most favour, is one where there would be considerable devolution of powers and that, as I said earlier, is something we would welcome.</P>
    <P>If, however, we are devolving powers to local areas we should consider the point very relevantly made by the Minister that vocational schools only make up 6 per cent of the total educational sector.  The appointment of national and secondary teachers, is done very much at local level and not, as I would put it, in the much more democratic vocational education system.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister has informed the House that she soon hopes to be presenting the colleges Bill.  It was <Col N="1333" /> a disappointment to us that it is not in the legislation listed for this session.  Indeed, the Minister has told us that the amalgamation of VECs, which was on the agenda when the Bill was last discussed, is something we will not be likely to see in the foreseeable future.  Indeed, one of the worrying aspects in terms of the Minister's presentation is that there is no real commitment to introducing any legislation in the area of education in the near future other than the colleges Bill.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party would be concerned, for instance, with an Education Act.  We would see that as very broadly based, including all the sectors of education.  The primary sector, as is known by all sides of the House, has no basic legislation. There is no legislation to back up what is happening in the primary education scene.  Indeed, the vocational education sector is the only one that has solid legislation operating throughout its system.</P>
    <P>We are not going to get an Education Act.  There is something else happening out there, however, that is as relevant and as deeply important.  I am referring to the demographic changes that are happening. For the past couple of years 10,000 fewer children have entered our primary schools.  It will not be so long until that trend is reflected in our secondary schools, in our vocational schools and in our community schools and colleges. We should take cognisance of the Barbour report published in the past couple of years.  One of the findings of that report was that by the year 2006 there will be only one second level institution in each town in the country. Obviously, this will involve a great deal of amalgamation.  An amount of this is happening but the fear of the Labour Party is that it is very much on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  There is a great need for effective research and analysis to define exactly what is happening, then develop policies which will make the best use of resources and provide the best possible education institutions for our children.  What is happening now is that we are allowing this to drift but <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements seldom give the best value for money for the <Col N="1334" /> taxpayer or the best possible school environment, range of subjects or educational aids for the children involved.</P>
    <P>The Bill addresses an issue which is very fundamental to teachers in the vocational sector.  Arising from the survey from which I quoted, there is a genuine and deep concern among teachers. The Labour Party are very concerned about that because not alone must the selection and promotion process in our schools be fair, impartial and professional, but it must be demonstrably so.</P>
    <P>I have been a member of two VECs since 1985.  I have never been a member of an appointments sub-committee but I have to say that in all that time, to my knowledge, there was never an appointment made or promotional posts filled that could be criticised in any way. Deputy Bruton said earlier that in 99.9 per cent of cases everything was above board and appointments were made on a very fair and equitable basis.  I agree with him.  At base, however, we get back to the point that teachers are not satisfied. They feel that the present system has the shadow of the possibility of political bias hanging over it, that pull or patronage or whatever we want to call it can be exercised.  That is regrettable and is certainly not in the interest of teachers.  Nor is it in the interest of the educational system that teachers should feel this way.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party believe that there is a problem in this area.  A number of cases have been alluded to already where questionable practices took place. We must respond to the situation as it faces us.  Half the teachers are not happy. The Labour Party through their public representatives have played a major role in vocational education committees throughout the country.  The Labour Party members, as with other persuasions, brought vision and commitment to those committees.  What vocational education committees and teaching staff have achieved, as the Minister rightly said, is nothing short of miraculous considering the resources that are available.  I would say to the Minister, Deputy Fahey, that in the area of adult literacy &mdash; this is the international year of literacy and <Col N="1335" /> extra money has been made available for literacy programmes &mdash; it is vital that this level of funding is maintained in the coming year.  This is something to which the Government should address themselves as a matter of urgency when preparing the Estimates.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party will be supporting this Bill on Second Stage but we want to make it absolutely clear that in doing so we are recognising the great work that vocational education committees have done and are continuing to do.  I was heartened by the open and generous fashion in which Deputy Bruton presented the Bill.  He said it would be open to the Government, if they so wished, to amend the Bill.  We in the Labour Party will also seek to amend the Bill on Committee Stage, following the widest possible discussions.  The principle of appointments and promotions being fair, impartial and professional, and demonstrably so, is one to which we have to respond.</P>
    <P>Not enough discussion has taken place regarding the nature of vocational education committees.  While they are set up by local authorities at their first meeting after the local elections, the vocational education committees do not consist solely of public representatives.  Indeed they include representatives of councils of trade unions, chambers of commerce, churches, teachers' unions and notable citizens who have particular expertise or interest in education.  It should be stated that the non-political representatives on vocational education committees have, to my knowledge, served on appointments sub-committees.  I am talking from experience when I say I have never come across anything untoward in this regard. Even where appointments are made by vocational education committees, not all the committee members are politicians.</P>
    <P>We will seek to amend the Bill in ways that would retain some element of a local input.  We see this in the context of our desire for a changing scene in education. That changing scene, which I have already refered to, would relate to the devolution of powers to local education <Col N="1336" /> authorities.  There is not a great deal of agreement on this as yet but I believe this is a developing discussion and it is a matter that the educational establishment as well as the Department of Education will have to respond to.  We in the Labour Party see the local education authorities as being involved with first, second and third level education although from what the Minister has said regarding the colleges Bill, if I understood her correctly, the third level element is something that will be removed from the vocational sector in the near future.</P>
    <P>The range of subjects in vocational schools is of great concern to us in the Labour Party.  A lot of the small vocational schools which have played such an important role in rural Ireland are finding it more and more difficult if not impossible to provide a proper range of subjects.  It was very heartening for me on Friday night last when I attended the opening of the Engineering and Technology Teachers Association annual conference in Waterford to see the extent of the engineering area.  It included robotics, pneumatics, electronics and technology. It was certainly a great eye-opener for me.  This is special to the vocational sector.  Indeed the Engineering and Technology Teachers Association put forward their own young engineer prize which coincides to some extent with the practical side of the leaving certificate.  Not alone are the children given a very extensive and important grounding in the various areas related to engineering but also in projects such as starting off a business or selling something to make a profit.  A criticism that is all too often made in this country is that the educational system does not produce entrepreneurs.  This type of approach in vocational schools is something which is very much to be welcomed.  It is just one part of a very wide-ranging service which the schools provide.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to innovations like Youthreach and the fact that people over 21 years are given the wherewithal to work towards a degree.  Perhaps there is a slight contradiction in the position I am taking here.  Generally speaking the <Col N="1337" /> Labour Party would be totally in favour of retaining and increasing the democratic power at local level.  At present teachers are very much under stress in the sense that classes are too large and they work very long hours.  Something that is not given sufficient recognition is the number of hours spent by teachers above and beyond the call of duty on curricular or extra-curricular activities. To some extent, maybe more so at first level but to an increasing extent at second level, discipline becomes an ongoing and extremely taxing problem.  If teachers are not satisfied with their appointment system, if they feel they are tainted in any way &mdash; there have been some noted cases but they are a tiny part of all the appointments made &mdash; they would, by and large, recognise this.</P>
    <P>Another point was made regarding a lack of professionalism on the part of interviewers.  As part of the appointments subcommittee of local authorities or VECs, the Department's inspector and the chief executive officer sit on the interview board as advisers so that the assessment of candidates in terms of their professional qualifications and related matters can be dealt with by the two professionals present.  I believe &mdash; and the Minister touched on this in her speech &mdash; that the public representatives, because they deal with the public on such a large base, particularly in regard to public representatives and others involved in vocational education committes, are very impressive because of their knowledge not alone of the vocational education system but because of the detailed knowledge they have of their schools.</P>
    <P>Those on boards of management in particular are aware of the problems with enrolment, growing problems at the moment in relation to subject range and the limits caused by cutbacks in this area. The various public representatives who have served on the VEC and boards of management in schools in the vocational sector have a very definitite knowledge of the type of teacher required.  In relation to quite a number of positions advertised in the vocational sector, the <Col N="1338" /> job description limits the number of candidates who can apply for a particular job in the sense that a school has a need to provide an amount of extra tuition in relation to a number of sections.  Let me, for the final time, stress that I am a great believer in the vocational education system and in the integrity of the vast majority of people involved in it.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party, in supporting this Bill on Second Stage, do so on the basis that teachers are not happy.  We will certainly have extensive further discussions in expectation of Committee Stage of the Bill when we will seek to amend the Bill to clear the doubts of the teachers concerned and at the same time in the very special way that a school is part of a locality and community, to ensure that the local element is not lost and that it remains part of the appointments process.

      <P>My stand on this Bill may be unusual in that I have been a member of a VEC since 1985.  I was a teacher in the VEC and secondary school systems so I profess to have some knowledge of both levels of second level education.</P>
      <P>It is very regrettable that the Bill is before us for two reasons.  The first is because it casts a slur on every member of a VEC, the locally elected public representatives who make up VECs and on the people to whom Deputy O'Shea referred, the many fine people other than public representatives who serve on VECs and on appointments committees of VECs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we have heard so far &mdash; and I will refer to this later &mdash; are hints and innuendoes of possible allegations of a whole lot of unsubstantiated political skulduggery.  It has not been said &mdash; but it has been implied &mdash; that there is something there but nobody has said anything concrete.  What is probably even more regrettable is that a slur has been cast on every teacher appointed and serving on any of the VEC schemes.  The allegation is that somehow or other they got their <Col N="1339" /> position because they had pull, political influence or because something was not quite right.  The implication is that this Bill will rectify it and stamp out allegations &mdash; unsubstantiated &mdash; which are being merely hinted at by Members opposite.</P>
    <P>In the VEC system there are very professional and dedicated people who are doing an excellent job and have been doing it since vocational education started in the thirties.  I totally reject an attempt by any Member of this House to hint or allege anything other than that. They are a professional body and, despite what has been said, many of them will be very disappointed at this allegation, or attempted slur, by Members of the Opposition.</P>
    <P>It is notable in all the contributions made here that, so far &mdash; and I have no doubt it will continue until the debate is finished &mdash; everybody said, or will say, that to their knowledge they do not know of any appointment made in their VEC through pull, political skulduggery or anything else.  However, they will say that somewhere teachers have been appointed because they had political pull, that they are incompetent and the only reason they were selected by some VEC is that they had political influence.  I utterly reject that allegation.</P>
    <P>I regret the Bill for another reason &mdash; it proposes to take from the management of the vocational schools the right to appoint their own employees.  Can anyone here imagine any company or organisation that would hand&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Deenihan has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the question of the difficulty of young drivers and the matter of spiralling insurance charges. Deputy Deenihan has five minutes and the Minister will have five minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1340" /> Rather than interrupt the Deputy I will ring the bell when the Deputy's five minutes are up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Motorists, in particular young motorists, are facing unacceptably high motor insurance premiums in this country.  On average the cost of motor insurance is three times greater than in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>Young motorists are particularly affected by the high cost of insurance premiums with some companies reluctant to even quote them.  The high cost of insurance is borne out by the following examples which I discovered today.  One young motorist in Portlaoise was quoted £1,746, whereas an 18 year old from County Wicklow was quoted £1,226. Indeed I heard on the radio today of a case where a young motorist was quoted £1,500, which was a rise of £700 on his previous premium.  Insurance companies will tell us that the increases have been in the region of 20 per cent to 30 per cent. However, this shows conclusively that the rise is more like 70 per cent to 90 per cent and it is totally unacceptable.  It deprives a large number of young people of the right to drive and in some cases deprives them of employment opportunities.</P>
      <P>It is clear that continued increases will further push motor insurance out of the reach of greater numbers of young people.  To seek to reduce the cost of motor insurance here we must first identify the reasons for the high cost and examine the means to reduce these costs.</P>
      <P>It is clear that the high cost of insurance is directly as a result of the losses made by insurance companies.  Underwriting losses on motor insurance have increased from £18 million in 1986 to £90 million to a £100 million in 1989 and will increase further this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is estimated by the Garda that uninsured drivers make up 8 per cent to 10 per cent of the total number of drivers at an estimated cost to the industry of £30 million per year.  This adds approximately £30 to the cost of insurance for each <Col N="1341" /> motorist.  The Garda estimate that somewhere in the region of 80,000 to 100,000 cars are driven around each day without insurance.  There is a low conviction rate in this area.</P>
    <P>The accident rate in Ireland is the highest in Europe at present.  About 8,500 people were injured in motor accidents in 1989.  The number of injuries arising from road accidents in 1989 increased by 5 per cent over 1988.  The numbers which are not available for this year are likely to be greater, I understand. Action must be taken to tackle this problem.</P>
    <P>The means by which we test the quality of our drivers is the driving test.  I have in the past expressed concern over the unacceptable length of waiting lists for tests.  I welcome the increase in the number of testers by the Department but I dispute the claim that this will clear the backlog within one year.  It is estimated that, prior to the increase in the number of testers, it would take up to eight years to clear the existing backlog without any new applications.</P>
    <P>The average third party injury claim in Ireland is six times higher than the equivalent figure in the United Kingdom. Despite the Courts Bill and the subsequent abolition of the jury system, awards have increased instead of decreasing. The number of claims has also increased by over 5 per cent in the past year.</P>
    <P>Another factor is the number of provisional licence holders.  There are about 230,000 people on provisional licences in this country at present.  There is no control in this country on the granting of provisional licences.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the cost of the insurance premiums for young people is higher than that for other drivers because of the higher number of claims in this sector.  The Irish Insurance Federation claim that the relative claim cost for policy holders in 1988 under 25 years was 79 per cent above average.</P>
    <P>We must do something about this scenario.  I have a number of proposals which I will briefly outline.  We should introduce a personal insurance disc which <Col N="1342" /> would make detection of uninsured drivers easier.  For provisional licence holders we should have a module in our schools on road safety and rules.  Little reference is made in schools to road safety and rules, and most youngsters do not know the rules of the road.  There should be a written or oral test prior to the granting of provisional licences. There should also be a compulsory course which would provide credits towards the final test.  A similar system operates in parts of the United States very successfully.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of his speech Deputy Deenihan identified what we are all aware of as a problem.  In fairness the Deputy identified many of the causes.  I would lay more emphasis on some causes than others because they contribute more than others.  The root cause is a figure the Deputy quoted, from which it appears, incredibly, that the average cost of the personal accident claim in this country is six times higher than that in other jurisdictions.  We must ask ourselves why.  Why have we a court system that allows that all the time and, one might almost say, encourages it? Why can there be such an enormous divergence between what happens let us say on this side of the Border and on the other side?  One sees the differences reflected in the premiums.  The premiums in this part of the island are often three and four times higher than they are in the other part in what many people would regard as a perhaps more dangerous place.  The simple reason is that, if we <Col N="1343" /> perpetuate the claims system we have, we will perpetuate higher premiums.  It is very regrettable.  That cannot be said often enough, and I have tried to say it a number of times over the past several years, but one immediately runs into difficulty with the vested interests who are involved in retaining the present system and who will almost go to the stake to preserve and protect it.  It is wrong, because it is very costly to the whole of our society, and among the principal sufferers are the young people about whom Deputy Deenihan is talking.  Our whole economy and social fabric suffers. There is not a European country and there are perhaps few countries in the world where there is compulsory insurance and where 10 per cent or 12 per cent of the cars on the streets are uninsured, and openly uninsured, and as a result contributing greatly to the already exorbitant costs.</P>
      <P>In 1987 insurers here sustained underwriting losses of £32 million on their motor portfolios.  These losses increased to £48 million in 1988 and although I have not yet the final figures they expect a £120 million loss on motor insurance alone in 1989.  Confronted with losses of that magnitude, and in order to maintain their viability, some insurers have considered it necessary to increase their premiums in line with their claims experience and/or to exercise more selectivity in the type of risk undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that insurance for young drivers is at present available under four headings.  This makes it very difficult for those who cannot get themselves in under one of the headings.  The first heading is, renewal with the present insurer and the second is, motor insurers generally where such drivers have been named on their parents' policy and subsequently seek their own insurance.  The third heading is, the PMPA who, apparently, are open for business from young drivers and, the fourth is, through the declined cases agreement.  I do not have time to go into the declined cases agreement here but it works quite well.  If a person who has not been able to get insurance submits to the <Col N="1344" /> committee, or the appropriate section of my Department, five refusals in writing there is an almost 100 per cent success rate in getting cover offered to them but, of course, this cover may be at a very high level.  Many of them may not feel they are in a position, unfortunately, to take it up but it does mean that people are not refused outright.</P>
    <P>I am aware that when an insurance company quotes in respect of risks for young people the premiums are frequently regarded by those concerned as excessive.  The cost of motor insurance for young drivers, however, tends to reflect the claims experience of motor insurers.  While I sympathise with young drivers, statistical evidence has shown that they are much more likely to be involved in accidents and, therefore, cause more claims.  Tragically, that is the case.  The record of younger drivers generally is much worse than that of older drivers.</P>
    <P>The cost of these claims can only be met by insurers if a realistic premium is forthcoming to cover the risk involved and one cannot expect the cost of insurance to come down when the number of accidents and claims and the cost of these claims are going in the opposite direction.  I have figures to show that even up to the present year that is still the case.  The fundamental cause of high motor insurance premiums for all motorists in Ireland is the high claims rate which, regrettably, is on the increase allied to the high cost of individual claims which is also rising.  These factors bear on the level of insurance premia quoted to young drivers as well as to those quoted to more mature motorists.</P>
    <P>I should like to give in conclusion some up-to-date figures.  Last year the number of claims increased by 6.5 per cent while the claims rate increased by 2 per cent and the average cost of claims increased last year by 12 per cent over the already extraordinarily high level they were at in 1988.  The number of people killed and injured last year increased.  Indeed the total number killed and injured on the road in the first six months of this year has also gone up.  While the Government <Col N="1345" /> are doing what they can people will have to realise that we are faced with a very serious problem and all drivers, and would be drivers, will have to do what they can to contribute to a better situation than the one in which we find ourselves.</P>

      <P>Deputy Rabbitte has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the question of the purchase by the Independent Group of a stake of almost 30 per cent in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> newspaper, the desirability of one group achieving such a dominant position and the steps the Minister intends to take to ensure that no one group or individual will achieve a monopoly in the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I thank you for permitting me to raise this important matter of public interest.  The unexpected purchase by the Independent Group of newspapers of a stake of almost 30 per cent in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> group of newspapers raises very serious questions about the desirability of allowing one group, or individual, acquire such a dominant position in the newspaper market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The media in modern society is an immensely powerful and influential force.  Despite the growth in the popularity of radio and television the print media remains a powerful force in moulding public opinion.  Its power was demonstrated graphically once again during the recent Presidential election.  It is fair to say that matters raised in the newspapers during the course of that campaign had a significant influence on the outcome of that election.  I do not believe that it is in the interests of democracy that a Government should monopolise or control the press.  Neither do I believe that it is in the interests of democracy that any one commercial group or individual should be able to use its wealth to control or monopolise so much of the press that <Col N="1346" /> gives that group or individual a disproportionate power over public opinion. Certainly, the experience in the United Kingdom where individuals like Rupert Murdoch has managed to gobble up whole sections of the media, has not been a positive one.  All one has to do, for example, is to look at the headlines in today's national newspapers to see how differently the other titles covered the current internal difficulties at Abbey Street as compared with the treatment of these issues by the Irish Independent.</P>
    <P>The Independent Group is already immensely powerful and controls the biggest selling national daily newspaper, the <i>Irish Independent</i>, and has a substantial share in another, <i>The Star.</i>  It controls two of the biggest selling Sunday newspapers, the <i>Sunday Independent</i> and the <i>Sunday World</i> and in the evening market it has the <i>Evening Herald.</i>  I understand that it controls almost one third of the provincial press and in the electronic area it is also bidding to buy into the MMDS system.</P>
    <P>It has now acquired a stake of just under 30 per cent in an independent newspaper, the <i>Sunday Tribune.</i>  Many media observers believe this may be a preliminary step to a full takeover bid. This acquisition will mean that the Independent Group will now control, or have a controlling interest in 75 per cent of the entire Irish Sunday newspaper market. It is now getting dangerously close to a monopoly and the Minister should carefully consider if there is any basis on which he could intervene.  The independent Group is immensely powerful and makes no secret about its political views and attitudes.  It is a right of centre newspaper group which is generally economically conservative, pro-business and anti-trade union in its editorial line.  The group is headed by an immensely wealthy individual who has himself expressed strong political opinions and who has on occasion been rumoured to have political ambitions.</P>
    <P>Whatever one thinks about the <i>Sunday Tribune</i>, and it is no secret there is little love lost between The Workers' Party and its editor, Mr. Vincent Browne, it <Col N="1347" /> has to be acknowledged it has generally pursued&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to history I was very balanced but if the Chair thinks I offended I withdraw.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding that it has to be acknowledged that the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> has generally pursued a fairly independent line in its editorial position even if this has sometimes been unpredictable and occasionally eccentric.  It would be unfortunate, and not in the interests of the press or society in general, if it were to fall under the control of the entirely predictable Mr. Tony O'Reilly.  It is also mildly surprising that at a time when the Independent Group is stressing the need to cut its costs and seeking 300 redundancies it should consider it appropriate to invest £800,000 in the <i>Sunday Tribune.</i>  I acknowledge that because the Independent Group's acquisition falls below 30 per cent that the Minister's powers to intervene may be somewhat restricted.  However, I would ask him to keep these developments under close scrutiny.  There may also be a need to look again at our monopolies legislation to see if it needs to be updated and take account of recent developments to deal with this sort of situation where one group will now control or have controlling interest in 75 per cent of the Sunday newspaper market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to demonstrate the power that can be held in situations like this.  In the recent political <Col N="1348" /> crisis it was claimed in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 3 November that following a telephone call &mdash; I do not want to raise the question of telephone calls again &mdash; put through to Pittsburg by the Taoiseach he was successful in causing the <i>Irish Independent</i> to change its attitude to that political crisis.  It specifically exhorted the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, to stick by the Republic, pointed out that Ireland Incorporated was doing very well and said, &ldquo;we should make every effort to see that it stays that way.&rdquo;  I am not implying that the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, was influenced in the slightest by the exhortations but, nonetheless if a phone call can achieve that can you imagine in a situation where the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Independent Group are taking a stake of just less than 30 per cent of the Tribune Newspapers plc.  A stake at that level does not constitute control under the terms of the Mergers, Take-Overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978.  The proposal, therefore, does not come within the scope of the Act.  If the Independent stake were to be increased above 30 per cent it would require notification to me under the Act. In that event the options which the Act provides would be open to me.  These options are either to allow the proposal to proceed or to refer it to the Fair Trade Commission for examination.  After examination by the commission the Act allows the Minister for Industry and Commerce to prohibit a transaction either absolutely or subject to conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1349" /> In the absence of a notifiable proposal I would not prejudge the particular course that would be taken by me.  What I have to say from now on is on the basis that I am not prejudging any particular course. I might mention at this stage, for the information of the House, that in the new competition Bill which I expect to be in a position to publish within, hopefully, the next couple of weeks &mdash; when I get it from the draftsman &mdash; I will be proposing to the Dáil to reduce the control percentage cut-of point from 30 per cent to 25 per cent because that is the percentage at which a special resolution can be blocked under the Companies Act.  I might add that that decision was made many months ago and has nothing to do with this present proposal.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of dominant position, since at this stage we are not talking about a change in control of the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> the question of whether a dominant position is being strengthened does not arise.</P>
    <P>In the notice the Deputy gave when raising this matter he referred to the share of the Sunday newspaper market which the Independent Group might have which he indicated would be 75 per cent.  This is not the complete picture. Newspapers from the United Kingdom also compete on this market, not least on Sundays.  This factor must be borne in mind.  At the moment these points are somewhat academic since control of the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> is not changing.  I share with the Deputy the view that society needs outlets for diverse views and that the public needs access to as many different kinds of opinion as possible.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas has given to the Minister for Industry and Commerce a role to ensure that this will be the case.  It is a role of importance but it is a burden I am glad to bear.  As I indicated earlier the Mergers, Take-Overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978, requires that changes in control of newspapers along with other enterprises must be notified to me.  This role is strengthened by an order which I made under that Act in January 1979.  Under that order all changes in control of newspapers, even if they fall <Col N="1350" /> below the standard asset and turnover thresholds of the Act which are £5 million and £10 million respectively, must be notified to me.  I then have the powers which I outlined earlier.</P>
    <P>A change in market share can come about other than by takeover or acquisition; competition can produce increased market share, closures or other withdrawals from the market give the same effect.  The 1978 Act does give the Minister for Industry and Commerce power to control monopolies.  The Act provides that the Minister can order the investigation by the Fair Trade Commission of an apparent monopoly.  Once he has the report the Minister then has the power to prohibit the continuance of the monopoly except in conditions he specifies or to require the division of the monopoly by a sale of assets or otherwise.  At present, I see no need to utilise these extensive powers in the area of newspapers. However, if events were to occur which might require that, I would remind the House that these powers exist and that they certainly will be applied should the need arise.</P>

      <P>I wish to express my concern at the very serious anomalies that have arisen in most counties under the review of disadvantaged areas following information that has emerged from Brussels.  In County Kerry a perch of land was reclassified despite the fact that large tracts of land, which are bordering existing severely handicapped areas and are totally unproductive, were not included.

      <P>The results of the 1989 survey constitute both the largest extension and reclassification of our disadvantaged areas ever proposed <Col N="1351" /> to the EC.  Almost 2 million acres are being proposed for extension compared to the previous largest extension of only 415,000 acres.  The proposed reclassification of 1.5 million acres approximately is almost twice the previous largest proposal for reclassification of 869,000 acres.</P>
      <P>Despite this, farmers in individual areas are complaining because they are excluded from extension or reclassification. This may happen, even though their land is poor, because their farms are in the middle of tracts of good land which rules them out of consideration or because the sample of farmers we surveyed in some areas, however high, may not have been fully representative of those areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are asking the EC Commission to <Col N="1352" /> allow us an appeals procedure to deal with genuine anomalies and are seeking EC approval to be allowed to add up to 1.5 per cent of the country, 255,000 acres, to our disadvantaged areas by Commission procedure without having to go to the EC Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>This approach is in line with the commitment given in the Programme for Government in September 1989.  Until our submission is approved, however, it would not be possible to set up an effective appeals system or decide its terms of reference.  Deputies can rest assured that we will continue to press our case with the EC to set up an appeals procedure as soon as approval is obtained.</P>

      <P>I have agreed to meet the Howth Fishermen's Association in the near future to discuss the agenda submitted by the association.  The issues on the agenda include auction hall facilities, public toilets, shore development, security on the pier, licensing and the development of fishing in general.</P>
      <P>I have already visited Howth on a number of occasions and have inspected the fishing facilities there.  I will of course visit the harbour again should this be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has, as the Deputy is aware, already been substantial State investment <Col N="1150" /> in the Howth fishery harbour centre.  Up to December 1989 just under £12 million has been spent on the development of the port &mdash; a substantial productive investment.</P>
    <P>Direct responsibility for Howth Harbour has been assumed by the Department of the Marine on 1 January, 1990 when it was declared a fishery harbour centre.</P>
    <P>I announced recently the adoption of a comprehensive national fishery harbour development programme.  This includes the provision of auction hall facilities, gear storage compound and the resurfacing of areas of the harbour.  I look forward to discussing these and other issues with the association.</P>
    <P>Howth is, of course, the second largest fishing port in the country in terms of the quantity and value of seafish landed there.  I am satisfied that the plans I have mentioned for the further development of the infrastructure at Howth will provide valuable assistance to the further development of the fishing industry in Howth.</P>

      <P>In reply to this question I would refer the Deputy to the comprehensive statement on the framework for sea-fishing boat licensing policy which I made to the House on 30 May last.</P>
      <P>In that statement, I explained in detail the parameters and constraints governing the entry of new boats to the Irish register. I explained in particular the major constraints on capacity arising from European Community fishing fleet policy.  That policy is designed to address the problem of the serious overcapacity which exists in the Community as a whole.  All member states are required to reduce their fleet capacities by 3 per cent below the end-1984 level.  There are linkages between these restrictions and the availability of significant financial assistance for the fishing sector generally. Specifically, continuing financial assistance may not be made available to modernise and refurbish in non-complying member states.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I have had to apply tough licensing policies over the last year or so as well as to establish a new fishing boat register.  I am glad to be able to inform the House that the targets set by the European community for both 1989 and 1990 have been achieved, mainly as a result of these measures.  I am, in addition, pleased to be able to inform the House that, on foot of these achievements, the EC Commission has this year approved a substantial aid programme for vessel construction (five grants to a total of £1 million) and modernisation (38 grants to a total of £1.48 million).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1154" /> These developments do not, however, allow for any relaxation in licensing policy as a further substantial reduction in the fleet will be required in 1991.</P>
    <P>I believe there is a clear need to introduce to the fleet a number of deepsea all-weather whitefish boats.  I am exploring all possibilities of doing this including having ongoing discussions with the Commission. My objective is to enable such boats to enter the fleet without running foul of the constraints which have been placed on us.</P>

      <P>Quotas for 1990 were set at the Council of Fisheries Ministers in December 1989. It is generally acknowledged that the overall outcome was highly satisfactory from the Irish point of view.</P>
      <P>At the June 1990 Council, I succeeded in negotiating a significant increase in the quota for sole for Ireland, as well as a major favourable change in the rules governing fishing for horse mackerel.</P>
      <P>The quotas for 1991 will, assuming the normal schedule applies, be set at the December 1990 Council.  I will be aiming, in those negotiations, to ensure that the quotas set for Ireland will be the highest possible consistent with the scientific evidence available on the state of the stocks.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it is vitally important in the long term interests of fishermen to ensure that fisheries are not damaged or disrupted by over exploitation.</P>
      <P>We are now in the lead-in period to the December discussions, and I can assure the Deputy that in those discussions I will be pursuing vigorously the best interests of Irish fishermen.</P>

      <P>The Government decided on 2 August 1990 to implement the main recommendations of the report of the review group on air/sea rescue services, including: (i) the establishment under a director directly answerable to the Minister for the Marine of a new division in the Department of the Marine to assume responsibility for maritime safety, shipwreck and sea and coastal pollution; (ii) the transfer from the Department of Tourism and Transport to the Department of the Marine of the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre (MRCC), the coast radio service, marine radio-engineers and marine radio surveyors and their incorporation in the new division; (iii) the appointment of a director of the new division; (iv) the supply on contract of a medium range helicopter service to be located at Shannon and to be placed under the control of the new division; (v) the relocation of the Dauphin helicopter service currently provided by the Air Corps at Shannon to Finner, County Donegal on a 24 hour basis throughout the year once the contract helicopter service has been put in place at Shannon; <Col N="1158" /> and (vi) the deployment of a second Dauphin helicopter at Cork as soon as practicable primarily for operation with the <i>LE Eithne</i> but to be located at Cork when not embarked on the ship.</P>
      <P>My Department invited tenders for the supply of a search and rescue helicopter service to be based at Shannon Airport. The closing date for the receipt of tenders was 23 October 1990.  The contract specification required that the helicopter service be in place by 1 January 1991.  I have established a helicopter contract group chaired by the Secretary of my Department to examine the tenders received and to advise me on the placing of the contract.</P>
      <P>I expect the group to report on these complex tenders soon.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the new division is primarily an integration and reorganisation of existing services.  The co-ordination of local marine emergencies will be devolved to rescue sub-centres at the coast radio stations at Valentia and Malin Head coast radio stations and at a new sub-centre to be established in Dublin.  This new regional structure will enable more local knowledge to be brought to bear on emergencies, the integration of marine communications and co-ordination facilities and the devotion of much larger personnel resources to emergency response.</P>
      <P>My Department have also identified the equipment requirements for the new structure.</P>

      <P>There have been three attempts to locate the vessel using the best available equipment. The first search of the area took <Col N="1159" /> place between 10 July and 14 July 1990. In August, following the discovery of monofilament netting, the Naval Service and later Celtic Diving and Salvage of Cork searched the area of the find.  More recently a length of netting, a buoy, boathook and fire extinguisher were discovered near Ballycotton.  Having established that these articles may have come from the missing fisheries patrol launch the assistance of the Naval Service was again requested to search the area, which they did without success.</P>
      <P>There are no plans to resume the search at this time.</P>

      <P>The lifeboat service in Ireland is provided by voluntary bodies, principally by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution.  No lifeboats are provided directly by my Department.</P>
      <P>The Royal National Lifeboat Institution provides an efficient and effective lifeboat service around our coast.  On the northern coast they have lifeboat stations at Arranmore, Lough Swilly and Portrush. The adequacy of the lifeboat service is kept under continuous review by the RNLI.  A grant of £100,000 is paid every year by my Department to the RNLI to defray their general expenses.  This annual grant is in lieu of grants for specific projects.  I have no funds at my disposal for lifeboats other than those operated by the RNLI.</P>
      <P>Should a voluntary organisation wish to establish a lifeboat service at Malin or anywhere else around the coast, I understand that funds may be provided by certain local authorities.</P>

    <P>My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, informs me that sanitary authorities have powers under section 40 <Col N="1160" /> of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1948, with his consent, to contribute to the funds of a society having as or among its objects the saving of persons from drowning.  The Minister for the Environment assures me that he would give favourable consideration to any application made to him pursuant to that section.</P>
    <P>Moreover, the Minister for the Environment informs me that inshore lifeboat projects recommended to him by local authorities may be considered for funding under the amenities/recreational facilities grants scheme operated by his Department and financed from national lottery surplus funds.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that my Department operates a cliff rescue unit off the coast and cliff rescue service at Greencastle near Malin.  This unit will soon be equipped with an inflatable boat to support cliff rescue and shore search operations.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully share the Deputy's abhorrence at the crimes and misery inflicted upon the Cambodian people by the Pol Pot Khmer Rouge.  I have also great sympathy with those who believe that the perpetrators of these heinous acts should be brought before an appropriate tribunal to answer for their crimes. However, as I outlined in detail in response to a similar question on 9 May, the necessary international co-operation <Col N="1164" /> required to bring exiled Khmer Rouge leaders to trial in Cambodia is unlikely to be forthcoming in the absence of an internationally recognised government in Cambodia.</P>
    <P>I would also refer the Deputy to the comprehensive statement which I made on Cambodia in the Dáil on 31 October in response to a number of parliamentary questions on various aspects of this important issue.  In this statement I clearly detailed the situation in relation to Cambodia at the UN and reiterated the core elements of Government policy on Cambodia.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ministe for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are fully aware of Cambodia's need for long term international development aid of which it has been deprived since the Vietnamese invasion in 1979.  This was a sign of the international community's disapproval of a regime which was installed by a foreign invading force, in defiance of the United Nations Charter.</P>
      <P>This need must be addresed in the context of the comprehensive peace settlement at present being negotiated.  I have already addressed this matter in some detail in the statement I made on Cambodia in the Dáil on 31 October and I would refer the Deputy to this.  I am confident, should a democratically elected government result, that the international community will be generous in assisting such a government in the major task of reconstructing Cambodia.  I can assure the Deputy that the Government will fully support the provision of such aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, international humanitarian and emergency assistance continues to be made available to the people of Cambodia through the non-Governmental organisations.  The Government have made two allocations within the last year from their disaster relief funds.  On 26 September 1990 they allocated IR£25,000 to Oxfam, (Ireland) <Col N="1165" /> to provide shelter kits for displaced families and 13 November 1989, they allocated IR£50,000 to Concern for emergency aid supplies.</P>
    <P>The European Community is supplying almost 1.67 Mecu (£1.28 million) in 1990 for relief purposes including food aid for the Cambodian people as well as 9.3 Mecu (£7.15 million) in food aid for refugees on the Thai-Cambodian border to which Ireland has contributed through its payments to the Community budget.  I should add that the Government have also contributed IR£100,000 to the Trust Fund which was established by the U.N. Secretary General to finance the start up costs of the major UN operation, the United National Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC).  This fund will assist with the cost of preparatory missions to Cambodia being undertaken by the UN Secretariat.</P>

Broadly speaking, a nephew or niece is treated as a child of an uncle or aunt in any case where the nephew or niece has worked substantially on a full-time basis for the uncle or aunt for the relevant five year period.  In normal cases, at least 24 hours work per week is required of the nephew or niece. Where, however, the business, including the business of farming, is small and run solely by the uncle or aunt, by any spouse <Col N="1168" /> of the uncle or aunt and by the nephew or niece of the uncle or aunt, then the requirement of 24 hours work per week is reduced to 15 hours.

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, in the absence of details of the taxpayer's previous employment, a certificate of tax free allowances on a week-one basis (i.e. effective from date of issue) was issued to him on 26 September, 1990.  A cumulative tax free allowance certificate was issued to him on 2 November 1990.  This certificate is effective from 6 April 1990 and any tax over-deducted will be refunded to him by his employer on the operation therof.</P>

      <P>The wildlife service of the Office of Public Works administer applications for permissions to hunt over foreshore, inland waters and accretions belonging to the State.  Approximately 320 applications have been received this year.  To date 287 permissions, under section 30 of the Wildlife Act, 1976, have been issued this year.  Approximately 30 applications are with local management staff for examination.  This examination would cover, for example, suitability of applicant, whether the lake in question is a State lake or is a wildfowl sanctuary or nature reserve.  The average period for processing each application is three to four weeks.  One application has been refused this year.  I am satisfied that the existing arrangement for processing these applications is working satisfactorily and I have no plans to consider alternative arrangements.</P>

      <P>The average farm income figures officially notified to, and accepted by the EC are those shown in the farm accountancy data network (FADN) returns made each year by Teagasc at the request of the Central Statistics Office as the FADN Liaison Agency for Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time the 1989 survey commenced, the latest year for which FADN figures had been notified to the EC was 1985-86.  Because 1985-86 was not a very good year for farm incomes, however, and because it is fairer when considering farm incomes to allow for variations from year to year arising from poor weather and other factors it was decided that it would be more equitable to aggregate the <Col N="1181" /> average incomes shown in FADN over the three years 1983-84, 1984-85 and 1985-86 to obtain an average national farm income figure for use in the survey.</P>
    <P>The national average farm income per farm worker established in this way came to £5,620 and 80 per cent of that amount, of course, came to £4,496.  In checking during the course of the 1989 survey whether or not the average farm income per farm worker in an area exceeded this £4,496 level officers of my Department obtained from the farmers surveyed full details of their stock numbers, crop acreages, etc., and applied to these the average of the net margins for the three years 1983, 1984 and 1985 that had been notified officially to the EC as part of the FADN procedure so that they were comparing like with like &mdash; i.e. income calculated by reference to the average net margins used for those three years compared to the average farm income figure per farm worker for the same period.</P>
    <P>Since we were obliged to present our case for extension and reclassification of our disadvantaged areas to the EC Commission in a manner that would leave us open to as little challenge as possible, I am satisfied that this use of income figures and net margins already officially notified to, and accepted by, the EC was the most appropriate mechanism for presenting a strong and credible case and for ensuring fair play to all farmers surveyed.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the condition relating to the off-farm income in the forest premium for farmers scheme which I launched last February.  Under this scheme, which was drawn up under <Col N="1187" /> Council Regulation (EEC) No. 1609/89, a farmer who afforests agricultural land thus changing its use from farming to forestry will be eligible for a premium. Ireland was the first country to introduce such a scheme under this regulation and when drawing up the terms of the scheme I gave careful consideration to the term &ldquo;farmer&rdquo; in order not to be too restrictive in its definition.  I decided to include not only farmers who are engaged full time in farming but also those who may have an off-farm income.  After careful deliberation regarding this matter I decided that a farmer whose off-farm income, combined with that of an applicant's spouse, did not exceed £11,000 in any of the three income tax years prior to afforestation could be considered for a premium.  I regard this off-farm income level to be generous and accordingly I have no plans to increase it.</P>

      <P>I have recently renewed, for a period of two years from 12 October 1990 the prospecting licence in the Mount Leinster area held by the company to which the Deputy refers.  In reaching my decision I took into account all relevant matters pertaining to the licence including both an assessment of the work carried out and proposed to be carried out by the company and careful consideration of local objections.</P>
      <P>I would stress that this licence is solely for the purpose of prospecting.  It does not entitle the company to mine.  Prospecting work by its nature has only a minimal effect on the environment.</P>
      <P>Should the company's prospecting give rise to the possibility of a commercial mining development the granting of a mining lease involves an entirely separate procedure.  A lease application will only be considered by me if and when full local authority planning permission has been granted.  This process provides an opportunity for local individuals and groups to have their views considered.</P>
      <P>I have stated publicly on a number of occasions that in considering any application for a State mining lease a detailed environmental impact study must be carried out by an independent expert acceptable to my Department and that the results of this assessment must be such as to ensure that the most rigorous environmental standards can be met by the proposed mining activity.  I must also have guarantees that the mine site will be satisfactorily rehabilitated and restored on cessation of mining operations.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that in the event of an application for a mining lease in respect of this area I will pay particular attention to the specific environmental concerns of local people.</P>

      <P>Under these regulations a child who is resident with only one of his parents shall be regarded as normally resident with that parent and with no other person.</P>
      <P>Entitlement to child dependant increases under the unemployment assistance scheme is dealt with under separate regulations and these provide that a child who is living with one parent only shall be regarded as normally residing with that parent and with no other person.

      <P>A minority of low paid workers may be faced with a situation whereby the payments to which they would be entitled, if they became unemployed, would exceed their wages.  This arises particularly for persons with dependent children, who are entitled to child dependant allowances in respect of unemployment payments.  The family <Col N="1192" /> income supplement scheme (FIS) is intended to offset this disincentive by providing cash supplements, which vary with family size, to low paid workers with families.</P>
      <P>As an unemployed person on unemployment benefit or short term unemployment assistance is not entitled to a child dependant payment for children over 18 years who are attending third level education, the question of extending a FIS payment in respect of such children does not arise in this context. Accordingly, the application form for FIS does not seek details of children over 18 years and attending third level education.</P>

In my reply of 1 November 1990 I assured the residents that there are no plans for such a downgrading and that the Garda authorities intend to maintain the current strength of two gardaí at the station.</P>

      <P>The normal sources of State road grant assistance towards the cost of works on these roads are the discretionary grants allocated annually to county councils for the improvement and maintenance of regional and county roads.  In 1990, these grants amount to £66.885 million.</P>
      <P>Limited amounts of special grants to improve forest access roads have been provided in recent years.  These grants are allocated on the basis of needs identified following consultation with Coillte Teoranta.  While a number of local authorities have written to the Department about the condition of forest access roads in their areas, it is not the practice to seek applications from local authorties for special grants for such roads.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 140 and 142 together.</P>
      <P>I intend to write to the known bicycle distributors in this country about the manufacture and importation of bicycles which are not fitted with front and rear lamps, (or lampholders), as standard equipment.  I would hope that the distributors would agree to supply the equipment necessary to enable cyclists to comply with the requirements of the Road Traffic Regulations on the lighting of bicycles.</P>
      <P>If the problem cannot be resolved on a voluntary basis, I will consider the making of regulations to require bicycles &mdash; particularly those for older children and adults &mdash; to be supplied fitted with lamps.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, I would urge the general public to purchase only new bicycles, intended for older children and adults, which are fitted, or can be fitted, with lamps.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 145 to 153, inclusive, together.  These questions relate <Col N="1208" /> principally to matters within the competence of the local authorities concerned, which are responsible for waste management and planning in their areas.</P>
      <P>A landfill site has operated at Kinsale Road for many years.  Originally situated in Cork county, it became part of Cork city as a result of a boundary extension in 1965.  Since 1985, and with the assistance of grants from my Department totalling £325,000, this site has been developed as a co-disposal facility to cater for both domestic and industrial wastes on a regional catchment basis.  The site is an important element in the waste plans adopted by Cork Corporation and its continued use is envisaged for many years.</P>
      <P>Cork Corporation are now responsible for the management of the Kinsale Road site and for the range of wastes accepted for disposal in it.  The management/ monitoring regime for the site takes account of leachate effects, landfill gas and rodent and pest control requirements.</P>
      <P>Cork Corporation have engaged consultants to recommend a long term strategy for the improved management of the Kinsale Road site.  An interim report has identified the first phase of this strategy and as a result certain new measures, including a landfill gas migration control system, have already been implemented.  The final consultants' report will identify other management and engineering measures necessary to improve the protection of air, water, soil, biota and visual amenities.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of proposals for the extension, as such, of the Kinsale Road site.  Any substantial modification of the present facility would be likely to require environmental impact assessment.</P>
      <P>Both major Cork local authorities are involved in supporting recycling/ alternative waste disposal activities.</P>

      <P>Primary responsibility for the detailed planning and execution of a scheme for the improvement of the road in question rests with the local authority concerned, in this case Dún Laoghaire Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Church Road scheme forms part of a proposed road improvement from Loughlinstown to Glenageary Road Upper, 3.8 km in length, to be carried out in three stages.  Approval in principle to the overall scheme was issued to the corporation in 1966.  Stage 1, from Loughlinstown Big Tree, to Killiney Avenue was constructed in 1978.  In December 1987, I approved, with modifications, the corporation's compulsory purchase order for the acquisition of <Col N="1211" /> property for stage 2 of the scheme, between Killiney Avenue and the roundabout at the junction of Rochestown Avenue and the Church Road.</P>
    <P>In June 1989 my Department approved the brief prepared by the corporation for the consulting engineers for the scheme which provided for an examination of the various forms of possible road construction and widths consistent with the approved land acquisition and the preparation of contract documents for the scheme.  On 15 August 1990, the corporation submitted for consideration proposals received from the Church Road Residents's Association for the provision of a 10 metre wide two-lane carriageway with hard shoulders, grass verges and footpaths having a total width of 21.8 metres.  The borough council supported the residents' proposals and referred to their strong conviction that the entire scheme &mdash; including stage 3 should be completed in one phase as a wide two-lane carriageway with cycle-lanes.</P>
    <P>Following technical examination of the proposals, it was considered that the four lane scheme designed by the corporation's engineering staff was the optimum solution available in terms of road safety and this view was conveyed to the corporation on 4 September last.  Moreover, the residents' proposals would involve the acquisition of land in excess of that provided for in the compulsory purchase order.</P>
    <P>While the Department's preferred solution is a four-lane scheme, it is now a matter for the corporation to decide on the optimum road design, finalise contract documents and submit their detailed proposals.</P>

      <P>On 26 January 1990 Comhairle na <Col N="1214" /> nOspidéal adopted the report of the committee on neurosurgical services in Dublin.  This report recommended that all neurosurgical activity currently taking place at Beaumont Hospital and St.  Vincent's Hospital should be centralised at Beaumont Hospital where one of the most modern neurosurgical facilities in Europe is available.  I accepted the recommendations in the report and arrangements were made for the transfer of the neurosurgical service, including two consultant neurosurgeon posts, from St. Vincent's Hospital to Beaumont Hospital. Such a transfer of course involved a certain amount of planning and expenditure and I am now happy to say that all arrangements for the transfer of services have been agreed.</P>
      <P>In line with these arrangements I have recently invited Beaumont Hospital to submit their proposals for a sixth neurosurgeon post to replace the remaining post formerly held at St. Vincent's Hospital. It is also the intention of Beaumont Hospital to seek applications for the vacant post with a special interest in paediatric neurosurgery.</P>
      <P>These steps should have the effect of further improving the excellent neurosurgical service already provided at the hospital.</P>
      <P>Letters have been written to those patients who were on the St. Vincent's neurosurgical waiting list to inform them that the service has transferred to Beaumont Hospital and advising them to contact the hospital in order to be rescheduled on the revised Beaumont waiting list.</P>
      <P>The consultant concerned is in the process of drawing up priorities for treatment based on medical need and taking into account such matters as: (a) whether the patient still requires the service and/or (b) up to date information on the patient's condition which has been provided by the patient's doctor.</P>

      <P>In 1989 the Health Research Board submitted their corporate plan, setting out their research strategy for 1989 to 1991 and in tandem undertook a comprehensive review of their funding arrangements.  As a result, while no new research grant applications were sought in 1989 a number of new projects were approved for funding.  This year new grant applications were sought under the corporate plan and further projects approved for funding.</P>
      <P>With regard to the board's 1991 allocation, no decisions have been made yet concerning the level of funding for the health services next year.</P>

An application form and income verification form were sent to the family in question, by the board, in April 1989 for completion in response to an inquiry.  However, these forms were not returned and there is no application to hand or under consideration since that time.  The board are now arranging to send appropriate application form etc. to the family and the matter will be considered fully when these forms are returned.</P>

      <P>The Commission of the European Communities <Col N="1218" /> has sent to the Council and to the European Parliament a proposal for a Council directive on the advertising of medicinal products for human use (COM (90) 212 final of 12 June 1990).  This proposal was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities No. C 163 on 4 July 1990.</P>
      <P>In addition to controls over the advertising of medicinal products and the distribution of free promotional samples, the draft directive proposes that, in the course of promoting medicinal products to persons qualified to prescribe them, it shall be prohibited to give, proffer or promise to such persons, directly or indirectly, any gifts, pecuniary advantages or benefits in kind, with the exception of objects of an insignificant intrinsic value.  It is also proposed that persons qualified to prescribe or supply medicinal products be prohibited from soliciting or accepting any such inducements and that the term &ldquo;advertising&rdquo; include any incitement to prescribe or supply medicinal products by the gift, offer or promise of any benefit or bonus, whether in money or in kind, including invitations to travel or to congresses.</P>
      <P>In view of the potential wide implications, particularly for post graduate medical education and for the price at which medicinal products are delivered to the health services and to the public, I have entered into wide consultations on these proposals with the various professional and other organisations.  One of the bodies which have responded in the course of these consultations is the Irish Medical Organisation.</P>
      <P>The current position is that responses have not yet been received from all the organisations consulted.  When these are received the proposals will be considered in the light of their implications.  The proposals will be further elaborated in the context of the deliberations in the EC Council with the benefit of the opinion of the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee.</P>

Inquiries have been made of the board in relation to the points raised by the Deputy and the position is as follows: (a) most of the hospital waste from the Cork area is incinerated at the Regional Hospital and St. Finbarr's Hospital, the division between the two hospitals being approximately equal; (b) and (d) complaints have been received in the past by the Southern Health Board and steps have been taken to improve the situation; (c) the stack from the incinerator buckled in September this year due to the high temperature of the flue gases and the stack was replaced; (e) a small quantity of drugs, largely vegetable matter, is incinerated at St. Finbarr's Hospital on behalf of the Garda authorities once or twice per year and this is not considered to represent a hazard; (f) low level radioactive waste is buried in sealed concrete manholes in the grounds of St. Finbarr's Hospital.  It is monitored by the Nuclear Energy Board which is satisfied with the safety of the storage arrangements; and (g) waste disposal policy is kept under constant review by the Southern Health Board and any improvements which are identified in these reviews are carried out as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the question relates to payment of higher education grants to students by Kilkenny County Council.</P>
      <P>The general position regarding payments to students is that Clause 7 of the higher education grants scheme provides that grants payable by local authorities shall be issued to students as early as possible in each term of the academic year.  Prompt payment of higher education grants to eligible students is, therefore, a matter for local authorities who are statutorily entrusted with administration of the scheme.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 184, 195, 196, 200, 205, 207 and 214 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will be aware, an agreement is in existence between the Government and the INTO regarding the staffing of national schools.</P>
      <P>As agreed with the Central Review Committee under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> my Department has implemented a reduction of 1 unit in the enrolment/staffing schedule for national schools from 1 September 1990.  This agreement has led to an improvement in the pupil-teacher ratio in all national schools for the 1990-91 school year.</P>
      <P>Under existing arrangements negotiated under the auspices of the Central Review Committee, school authorities, in particular the principal teacher, are responsible for arranging the organisation of the school so as to ensure that no class group exceeds the following guidelines set down by my Department: 39 (in the case of a single-grade class-group); 38 (in the case of a class-group with two consecutive grades); and 35 (in the case of a multi-grade class-group).</P>
      <P>If a school is unable to organise its total enrolment to remain within these guidelines my Department is prepared to examine the question of sanctioning the appointment of an additional teacher to enable it to do so.</P>
      <P>The issue of class sizes in national schools will be reviewed in the context of ongoing discussions under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>

      <P>As agreed with the Central Review Committee under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> my Department has implemented a reduction of one unit in the enrolment/staffing schedule for national schools from 1 September 1990.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 221 and 223 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed by CIE that, arising from a request from Northern Ireland Railways to return a number of railcars which had been on loan from that company, it will be necessary to reduce on a temporary basis the level of rail services between Bray and Greystones <Col N="1244" /> with effect from 26 November 1990. Plans however, have been made for the provision of a substitute shuttle bus service between the two stations to cater for rail passengers.  Rail services between Arklow and Dublin via Greystones will, of course, continue to operate on a normal basis.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to confirm that I recently gave approval for investment by CIE of £18 million in new railcars.  This investment will enable Iarnród Éireann to improve the range of its suburban commuter rail services in the Dublin and Cork areas and will also facilitate improvements in due course in the Bray/Greystones service.</P>

      <P>The Government decided in 1987 that no further consideration should be given to extending the DART system because of the high costs of such development and the state of the public finances.  That situation has not changed.  However, I am pleased to confirm that I recently gave approval to CIE for investment of £18 million in new railcars, which will be used to enhance suburban rail services, including the Bray/Greystones service.</P>
