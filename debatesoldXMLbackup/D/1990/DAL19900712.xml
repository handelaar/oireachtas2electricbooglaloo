      <P>I understand that the Government at about this time will decide on the date of the resumption, and I would ask the Taoiseach and the Government if they would agree to an earlier than usual resumption of the Dáil after the summer recess this year, in view of the fact that a large part of the Government's legislative programme for this session has not been completed at this point, for example, the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, the Turf Development Bill, the Pensions Bill, the Land Commission Bill, the Criminal Law (Rape) Bill, the Radiological Protection Bill, and the Criminal Justice (Evidence) Bill.  None of those Bills has passed through this House although it was planned to have them processed by the end of this session.  Will the Government consider, in the interests of their legislative programme and the business of the House, having an early resumption, perhaps in early September this year?</P>

I would like to see this committee on crime established before the end of the session.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £158,127,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of <Col N="1549" /> payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December 1990, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, including certain services administered by that Office, and of the Irish Land Commission, and for payment of certain grants, subsidies and sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
    <P>As Ireland's largest industry, the performance of agriculture is a key component of our overall economic growth strategy.  I am, therefore, pleased to be able to report that the success of the Government's agriculture and food policies were clearly evident in the very strong performance of agriculture in 1989.</P>
    <P>While there have been significant price reductions in 1990 compared with 1989 for the main sectors, the overall effect will be offset, to some extent, by an increase in the volume of production of beef, sheep and pigs.  However, taking all the factors together some drop in aggregate farm income this year appears likely.  This drop must viewed against an increase of 52 per cent in farm income since 1986, compared with inflation of 10 per cent over the same period.  It must also be stressed that the drop is due to changed market circumstances.  I have used every opportunity to press the Commission to maximise Community supports to counterbalance the effects of the market downturn.  This pressure is already bearing considerable fruit.  Furthermore I am seeking to ensure that grants and premium payments which are important for farm income are paid with the least delay possible.</P>
    <P>This year's Estimate is for a gross amount of over £313 million.  This does not represent anything like the total of my Department's overall spending as some £1,000 million funded by the European Community is being paid by my Department to farmers and agri-business in 1990 and a further £500 million funded from borrowings will be spent on the purchase of products into intervention. In 1990, between domestic and EC funds, my Department will disburse over £1,800 <Col N="1550" /> million.  This underlines the strong national and Community commitment to Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>As President of the Council of Agriculture Ministers for the first half of 1990, my primary responsibility has been to ensure the adoption of the EC Commission's price proposals for 1990-91. This was achieved on 27 April last following prolonged negotiations with the value of the final package, as adopted, worth in excess of £90 million annually to Irish producers.  The principal benefits result from green £ adjustments and improved intervention arrangements &mdash; involving significantly reduced payment delays for milk, beef and cereals. However, the element which gives me greatest satisfaction from a personal point of view is undoubtedly the rural world element which formed an integral part of the overall package.  That the agreement on this year's farm prices was achieved so comparatively early and against a background of Communitywide difficulty in a number of product sectors, is, I believe, a tribute both to Ireland's Presidency and to the Farm Council as a whole.  However, this early agreement itself entails tangible benefits for farmers in as much as it will engender increased confidence throughout the industry and facilitate improved management and planning for the year ahead.</P>
    <P>The ongoing, steady progress towards completion of the Internal Market has itself had an important bearing upon the shape and content of our Presidency.  In view of this I identified progress on harmonisation of Community legislation in the animal and plant health areas as meriting the highest priority, whether viewed from an EC or a national perspective.  I, therefore, devoted considerable effort to advancing proposals for the adoption of a non-vaccination policy throughout the Community for the control of foot and mouth disease and for the establishment of an EC veterinary fund as a contingency against the propagation of major animal disease outbreaks.  I am particularly pleased, therefore, to report that the June Council agreed a major veterinary package which included both these <Col N="1551" /> elements in addition to a proposal for the abolition of border checks on live animals.</P>
    <P>Community-wide measures were also agreed in respect of trade in live horses, live poultry and pig semen while rules which will facilitate Ireland's very valuable live export trade in cattle through the establishment of a leukosis free position, were also agreed.  Of major importance to consumers too is the Council's adoption of marketing controls in relation to veterinary products as well as specific tolerance levels for these products in foodstuffs.  The Agriculture Council adopted more Internal Market proposals during our Presidency than it did in any previous six month period and in all 134 legislative proposals were adopted, far in excess of any previous Presidency.</P>
    <P>BSE was also a focus of attention at EC level.  Unilateral actions against imports of UK beef led to an unprecedented situation within the European Community, which posed a real danger to Community cohesion and harmony in matters of trade.  I immediately called an emergency meeting of the Agriculture Council which met on 6 June to deal with the problem and after long and difficult negotiations, we managed to achieve a solution which was acceptable all round and which enabled the unilateral actions to be immediately ended.  This result headed off what would have been a trade crisis in Europe the effect of which would have extended way beyond agriculture.</P>
    <P>In so far as the present round of GATT multilateral trade negotiations are concerned, as I have already indicated in this House, the Community approach is to provide that overall supports for agriculture are subject to more clear cut rules and are fixed at levels whereby more balanced markets and a more market oriented trading system obtain.  During my period as President of the Council I ensured that the Agriculture Council was fully involved in developing and maintaining the Community's negotiating position.  I was very pleased that the Council unanimously confirmed the <Col N="1552" /> Community's global approach at its meetings in April and June, declared that the basic principles of the Common Agricultural Policy were not negotiable and stressed that full credit should be obtained for past reform measures.  The Council also decided that Agriculture Ministers will continue to be involved to the greatest possible extent in the negotiations. The European solidarity which we were able to bring about through unanimous decisions &mdash; never an easy achievement at the Council of Ministers &mdash; was a major factor in resisting the American demands for elimination of agriculture supports in the EC and the fact is that for the first time ever at the Houston meeting the Americans have dropped their demand for elimination of support and have recognised the need for a balanced and global approach which has always been the EC position.  The negotiations can now continue and the contribution of our Presidency will have been seen to have been very significant.</P>
    <P>Much has been made of various comments on the GATT over the last few days.  Perhaps too much attention has been devoted to what was not, of course, a negotiating session and, even in that context, to what were off-stage remarks. The real negotiations have yet to take place.  It is important to remember that in these negotiations, the Community has a clear and unambiguous position.  We are prepared to negotiate to achieve a more sensible and coherent world trading order for agriculture.  This would benefit all GATT members.  We are not prepared to negotiate away the principles or mechanisms of the CAP.</P>
    <P>Let me stress that there is no case for a Special Summit arising from the Houston conclusions.  Quite the contrary, as even a request for such a meeting would mistakenly convey the notion that these conclusions reflected the American demand for the elimination of supports which they certainly do not.</P>
    <P>I am entirely satisfied that the Irish Presidency of the Agriculture Council has identified, in a realistic and balanced manner, those priorities which are in the best interest of the Community as a whole <Col N="1553" /> and in our own best interest as committed participants in the new Europe which is emerging.  Following our stewardship of the Community's agricultural affairs, we will be seen to have bequeathed to our successors a record of solid achievement and not least as regards realisation of Single Market objectives.  I am gratified that, as a consequence of my Presidency, the lot of the Community's citizens &mdash; farmers and non-farmers alike &mdash; will have been substantially improved arising from the completion of a comprehensive range of rural development, environmental and consumer oriented measures.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department were required to chair over 40 different committees and their success in this mammoth task has been praised by officials and Ministers alike.  For my own part I am, of course, gratified by the tributes we have received from the President of the Commission, the incoming President of the Council and the Secretary General of the Council Secretariat.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt in broad outline with the outturn for agriculture and food in 1989, the outlook for this year and with the broad scope of the Estimates.  In the restricted time available there is not much opportunity to deal with these issues much further but there are two specific subheads &mdash; D5 Organic Farming and L1 Farm Investment &mdash; to which I would like to refer because of particular developments in those areas.  In the light of Deputies' remarks I will respond on other subheads and other agricultural issues as necessary.</P>
    <P>Environmental concern has also been a major theme of my Presidency and accordingly, I have given a ready welcome to proposals in this regard which have emerged from the Commission.  An example of such is a measure which aims to establish a uniform European framework for the production, inspection and labelling of foodstuffs produced organically without the use of synthetic materials.  During the Presidency, very substantial progress was achieved in respect of this difficult and complex proposal and, in fact, at the Council on 25 <Col N="1554" /> and 26 June it was agreed in principle, subject to the opinion of the European Parliament and the clearance of some outstanding technical points.</P>
    <P>Ireland, of course, is in a particularly advantageous position to benefit from the growing, contemporary interest in alternative farming practices.  Accordingly, my Department's organic unit is now actively exploring how best to exploit this development and to capitalise on our image as a reliable source of sound, wholesome and natural food, in particular, as the completion of the Single Market comes even nearer.  On this we are working closely with the Organic Growers Association which is being supported financially from the subhead.  We are also developing programmes for research, education, advice and demonstration projects in the organic sector.</P>
    <P>At the outset of my Presidency of the Agriculture Council, I emphasised my personal interest in achieving improved economic, social and environmental living conditions for the Community's rural society.  I have briefly referred already to the rural world measures which formed part of this year's prices agreement. At national level, we have consistently taken the view that the CAP must be informed by social considerations and obviously this attitude is all the more important having regard to the various output restraints and market stabilisers which have been put in place over recent years.  As a Presidency we have maintained our historic commitment to developing rural society and keeping farming families on the land.</P>
    <P>Farming will, or course, continue to be the mainstay of the rural economy. However, we must recognise that, especially with the introduction of stabilisers and the reorientation of the Common Agricultural Policy, we must look increasingly to non-traditional activities and to the non-agricultural sector to provide the income and job opportunities required to maintain a stable rural community. All elements of the Community Support Framework, including the nonagriculture measures i.e. the tourism, industry and peripherality programmes <Col N="1555" /> will have a major impact on rural areas. In addition, however, it will be necessary to encourage initiatives not covered by other programmes and these are provided for in the operational programme for rural development.  I am proposing to the Commission that the programme will cover such areas as alternative enterprises and a national agri-tourism scheme and increased funding for marketing by CBF.  It will also cover rural infrastructural items such as fishery harbours and rural roads and will provide also the mechanism for the development of human resources through the funding of the training and educational activities carried out by Teagasc.  I hope to have European Community approval to introduce the various measures within the next few months.</P>
    <P>As the House knows, the Government in October 1988 launched a pilot programme for integrated rural development in twelve selected areas.  The programme is based on the principle of involving local communities in selecting their own development priorities and then in undertaking the responsibility to work towards achieving those aspirations. At the end of the two-year pilot period in October 1990, an assessment will be made that will enable us to decide on the design of a nationwide programme for the development of all rural areas. The results of the pilot scheme so far are very encouraging, and indeed, in order to ensure that the momentum which has been generated is not lost while the programme is being assessed after October, I have decided to extend the operation of the programme until the end of the year in order to ensure that there is no lacuna between the ending of the pilot programme and the putting in place of follow-up arrangements.  The elaboration of such arrangements should be greatly helped by the recently signalled Community initiative on rural development.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I am confident that the Government's current economic strategy, coupled with a practical and businesslike response from those involved in the industry, will prove the <Col N="1556" /> right recipe for our future success.  I am sorry that the time allowed, permitted me to give a very brief summary of all the activities in the Department.  I will listen carefully to the debate and take up some other points that may arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the very short time at my disposal also &mdash; which I understand is ten minutes &mdash; I want to say I oppose the Estimates on this occasion for a variety of reasons.  I note that the Minister claimed credit for the manner in which the Presidency was carried out.  I will not refer to that as such as it is the benefits of the Presidency I am worried about.  Whether by accident or design Irish agriculture never had it so bad as during the six months of the Irish Presidency. Obviously we cannot suggest that because we had the Presidency that was the reason things went wrong.  There can be no doubt that Irish farmers are centainly much worse off as a result of some of the things which have happened to which I will refer very briefly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true to say we are now witnessing in agriculture 1974 proportions all over again.  I have noticed that the Minister has said several times in the House, during the last few months, that as far as he can see there is no real disaster in Irish agriculture.  In the Department's own outlook for agriculture and food industry &mdash; whenever it was written, possibly at the end of last year &mdash; the predictions are totally wrong.  Farm incomes will be away lower than what is predicted here. I admit it is difficult to look at those matters even a year in advance, but surely the pointers and the trends were at the Department's disposal.  If we cannot get it right for our own Irish environment it is very difficult to understand the problems and the complications that will set in as a result of the Houston Summit meeting yesterday.  I should like to make it clear that we lost in Houston yesterday.  It can be covered up in any shape or form but whoever will be here in the next two or three years will find that what I have said is absolutely correct.  Whether or not it was coming is another story but it certainly arrived on our doorstep at Houston <Col N="1557" /> yesterday.  There are two reasons for this, one has to do with the composition of the G7 &mdash; the seven most industrialised countries in the world.  It is very significant that four of those countries are the main paymasters to the EC fund.  I wonder what communication took place between the Commission the Council of Ministers, the President and so on on what actually happened in Houston this week.  Who was told exactly what was going to happen?  There are many ways of brushing over problems of this type as can be seen from the communique which came from Houston; actually they are all contradictory.  There is one important factory in it.  So far as we are concerned the price support mechanisms that we are used to in Irish agriculture and, indeed, in European agriculture will never be the same.  I make this statement boldly having studied this subject for years.</P>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy as we know it has taken a turn for the worst following the Summit at Houston yesterday. I defy contradiction and I will argue it on any platform anywhere because of what I have seen.  Let us consider some of the participants.  Britain always has a cheap food policy and have been the cause of many or our economic troubles over the years because we were tied to their market.  For obvious reasons they appear to have won.  More important, in West Germany the whole price policy concept of the Common Agricultural Policy is more expensive on them than anybody else; everybody is aware of that and I do not have time to go through the detailed figures.</P>
    <P>Because of what has happened in all the Eastern European countries and especially in East Germany it is only reasonable to believe that, so far as Germany was concerned, they would have to take great note of their financial commitments in the future.  A recent study which was carried out &mdash; which I am sure the Minister fully understands and has examined &mdash; showed that if world prices prevailed in Germany at present, obviously their Exchequer would have a huge saving, but their unemployment rate would fall, they would lose some <Col N="1558" /> farmers but they would create many more jobs outside of that.  Against that background there are the Italians and the French to a lesser degree and the Americans are on the other side.</P>
    <P>All I will say in the very limited time at my disposal is simply this: it appears to me that whoever pays the piper is beginning to call the tune.  There were eight countries who were entitled to be at that meeting for that decision.  So far as industrial development is concerned we would not be in that league.  When the Minister is replying I want him to give me some indication of the communication there was between the EC and that G7 group.  I believe this was an initiative taken by that G7 group themselves. It is against that background I genuinely believe that their decisions constitute a bad day for all Irish farmers, large or small, and that they will live to regret it.</P>
    <P>At one stage or another 325 million people voted to join what was then regarded as the European Community, the EC.  Many joined for a variety of reasons I have not time to go into now. But nine million farmers voted for a particular reason, in order to gain a reasonable return for their labours, something to which they had never been able to aspire over the years, in order to get away from the peaks and valleys, the slump periods.  That was their genuine reason for joining.  Large and small farmers alike were attracted to the system.  People may contend that it suited only the large farmers; that is not correct; many small farmers would have been wiped off the face of the earth were it not for what has happened, admittedly at a much slower rate than would have been desired. However, what they voted for was this club, as they perceived it which would enable them to produce a quality product to which the consumers of Europe would have access, the best food available, not cheap food, but food.</P>
    <P>No matter how we change the system, the principles of the Treaty of Rome in so far as the Common Agricultural Policy is concerned, form the major part of it. <Col N="1559" /> It constituted a safety mechanism, providing a limit below which prices would not fall.  I am sufficiently long in the tooth to know that, no matter how it is organised, there will be peaks and valleys in agriculture.  But the knowledge of there being a safeguard, knowing that prices would not fall below a certain level, meant there was some hope of a reasonable living to be had for farmers.</P>
    <P>I contend that, as a result of decisions taken in Houston yesterday over the next ten years there will be a reduction effected in such a way that, were we looking at the Common Agricultural Policy as it performs now in, say, five or six years' time, one might well think one was looking at two different concepts.  I note from the Minister's remarks that as far as he is concerned, he has decided that everything was all right in Houston yesterday.  Unfortunately time will prove the Minister to have been wrong.</P>

      <P>I am sorry I have not a chance to expand somewhat on my views on this matter.  I asked the Taoiseach and the Minister to allow us time in this House to discuss at greater length &mdash; I believe it would warrant a full day's debate &mdash; the overall GATT negotiations.  We were absolutely entitled to seek such a debate and be given it.  Nonetheless we were not given that opportunity, perhaps for reasons best known to the Minister himself.  Irish agriculture never had it so bad.  Even at this late stage the Minister should acknowledge that we are encountering huge problems in many areas.  The Minister has lost control.  Every Irish farmer accepts what I am saying.  The Minister has lost control.  Every Irish farmer accepts what I am saying and the Minister must know that as well as I do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The attitude of the Government and perhaps that also of the Minister to agriculture, our primary industry, is reflected in the fact that we have a mere one hour in this House devoted to what should be a primary debate.  Everything else in our economy and society is affected by agriculture and the way in which that industry is managed.  We have ten minutes allocated to each spokesperson, within that one hour, to debate this issue, reflecting the attitude of the Government, if not that of the Minister, to his portfolio.</P>
      <P>On a personal basis &mdash; and I regret to say so &mdash; probably the Minister is the worst Minister for Agriculture we have had in modern times.  Under his stewardship there has been no policy, no position taken on agriculture as an industry. We have had a series of <i>ad hoc</i> decisions, a stumbling from crisis to crisis.  There is a disastrous position obtaining within the industry, the beef industry having practically collapsed.  In the sheep area, lambs fetching £75 per head last year are being sold now for £30, that is if they can be sold at all.  In addition, the wool of the same sheep cannot be sold and is stored in farmers' sheds.  There is a milk quota system that discriminates directly in favour of the large farmer despite lip service having been given to small farmers on the part of the Minister.  In addition there are further threatened cuts in that quota system.  When replying the Minister should at least assure us that, if such further cuts take place in the milk quota system, farmers with under 30,000 gallons production will be exempt from any such qouta reduction.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the House that the Minister is unable to cope with his brief, as has been proved by the disasters in his wake. Indeed in a recent soft interview in a newspaper article he admitted that, during the term of the Irish Presidency, certain areas had been neglected, an amazing admission on the part of a Minister. He appears not alone to be unable to cope with his brief but, in addition, to be unaware of the disastrous conditions obtaining within Irish agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1561" /> I wish to refer now to Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, or BSE, as it is commonly known.  When this condition was brought to the attention of the public, having been known to scientists and policymakers for some time, the Minister acted in desperation.  He defended British beef interests.  He opposed the first import ban on British products back in February and dismissed any scientific evidence suggesting that the disease might have some effect on consumer health. The Minister has whitewashed the mad cow disease issue, politically tying jobs and exports to British beef interests.  He has claimed there is no evidence that BSE is transmissible to humans.  In reply to a parliamentary question I had tabled on 27 June last the Minister stated that it had been confirmed, at the highest scientific level, that BSE was not considered to be a risk to public health.  The Minister knows that that answer was totally misleading. Since BSE has a 15 to 20 years incubation period, no one can say, not the Minister, scientists or anybody else, whether the disease is transmissible to humans.  To say otherwise is grossly misleading and dangerous.  Indeed even within the past few days, in a leading medical journal, it is reported that not only is BSE transmissible to humans, but that there are many other diseases which may be considered to be related thereto. This increases the possibility that BSE may be transmissible to humans.  The Minister's actions and attitudes to this issue have been irresponsible and dangerous.</P>
    <P>The Minister appears to be totally unaware of the widespread rural poverty obtaining.  In the course of his introductory remarks he has said that it is the policy to retain as many family farmers as possible.  Since we joined the EC &mdash; supposed to be the Mecca for farmers &mdash; 150,000 farmers have been driven off our land, as a direct result of the operation of the Common Agricultural Policy and the total reliance of this Government and past Governments, on this price support mechanism for farm incomes.  That system has guaranteed that 80 per cent of all of the subsidies emanating from the <Col N="1562" /> Common Agricultural Policy has gone to 20 per cent of top level farmers, those not in need.  There is sufficient money available from these sources to ensure that every farmer has a proper income. It must be directed away from those who do not need it to those who do.</P>
    <P>A new organisation for low income farmers has now been formed, spawned out of desperation, by way of a last ditch stand for survival, a determination on the part of these low income farmers to remain within the rural economy, securing a decent living for themselves and their families.  I refer to the United Farmers' Association, comprised of former members of the IFA and the ICMSA, former members of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, all four organisations having failed to tackle the problems facing these farmers.  The proof of that failure is that 150,000 families in that category have been driven off the land during the last number of years.</P>
    <P>I welcome and support the arrival on the farming scene of this organisation and the policies they are putting forward. These low income farmers need an alternative agricultural policy if they are to survive, and present policies, or lack of policy, will ensure they will be driven from the land in ever increasing numbers. Such an alternative would include a transitional two tier pricing mechanism to benefit low income farmers; land structure and milk quota reforms through a new land agency; subsidies for alternative farming, for conversion to organic farming and for rural conservation; development of alternative rural industrialisation policies and provision of a basic incomes policy for full time farmers. In regard to this I would ask the Minister to examine specifically the possibility of introducing a family income supplement type payment to farmers who do not have an economic income from their holdings to ensure that they can be kept on the land.</P>
    <P>These policies would directly subsidise people working full time in agriculture and would increase low incomes without distorting the price mechanisms which penalise consumers, especially low <Col N="1563" /> income consumers, and will ensure that the maximum number of families are retained in the rural economy.  It might be too much to ask the Minister to use the Supplementary Estimates to move in some way towards mechanisms that would have the effect of shifting emphasis from price supports.  However, the failure of the Minister to do so will continue the cycle of poverty, emigration and rural depletion which are the realities.  The Pontius Pilate type washing of his hands by the Minister and a seeming unawareness of the crisis that exist, of the desperation of large numbers of people in the rural economy who are being driven out, and lip service being paid in their direction for a long number of years, have forced these people into forming a breakaway organisation from the main structures of agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that it is not his job to intervene directly but to put in place the necessary structures and create the correct climate.  He has done neither and the outcome is that agriculture is now in an absolutely desperate situation, with large numbers of people in the rural areas in dire poverty with nothing facing them but the emigrant boat.</P>
    <P>For these reasons the Labour Party will be opposing the Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Agriculture should make the maximum contribution to the Irish economy in the form of optimum productivity at farm level, allied to well developed linkages with the rest of the economy, involving both support industries and services and downstream processing and marketing.  The present situation in Irish agriculture leaves much to be desired in these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An effective land policy, allied to effective employment and welfare policies outside agriculture, is required in order to encourage those with sufficient land resources to make their land available through sale or leasing to others who can make better use of it.  In the interests of maximum efficiency Irish agricultural producers should be adequately trained and should have at their disposal <Col N="1564" /> adequate resources, including land, to allow them to generate an adequate income from farming.</P>
    <P>The primary function of the agricultural sector should be to provide food of adequate quality in sufficient and regular supply to consumers at reasonable cost.  Agricultural producers should, of course, receive a reasonable income for their produce.  It is desirable that farmers should control to the maximum extent possible the downstream processing and marketing of their produce both in their own interests and in order to secure Irish control of this sector of vital importance. State policy in relation to agriculture should vigorously promote this objective.</P>
    <P>I want to call on the Minister again to publish the report of the interdepartmental committee on the future of the Irish Sugar Company and to allow a full debate on it.  The report has been finalised and is with the Government, who are withholding publication until the Dáil rises for the summer recess, so Deputies will not have an opportunity to discuss it until October.  It is now virtually certain that, despite all the progress made by the company in recent years, it has joined the long list of Fianna Fáil targets for privatisation.  It is of particular concern to the workforce that, having made considerable sacrifices in recent years to get the economy back into efficient and profitable order, they are now about to be sold off to private interests without consultation with or consideration of the needs of the workers.  In recent years the workers have agreed to a major redundancy programme, including the closure of the Tuam and Thurles factories.  It seems, however, that their reward for the co-operative approach is to be sold off to the highest bidder.  I find it extraordinary that as soon as a company starts to make a profit the Government starts talking about selling it off.</P>
    <P>The failure to properly develop our agricultural sector and food industry must be considered to be one of the greatest failures of national policy since the foundation of the State.  Given our favourable climatic conditions and the quality of our soil and environment, we should have a <Col N="1565" /> viable and developing agricultural sector, and our food industry should be making a major contribution to feeding the people of Europe.  Instead the numbers on the land continue to decline, and we are importing more and more food. There is a need for a complete overhaul and reappraisal of our national approach to agricultural development.  Rationalisation and co-ordination of existing agencies and schemes in the context of the formulation of an overall long-term plan involving the establishment of a farm and food development authority, is an urgent necessity if the country's greatest national resource is to begin to make a contribution to tackling the problems of poverty and unemployment which it is capable of doing.</P>
    <P>Change is coming whether we like it or not.  The immediate elimination of the farm subsidy along the lines being advocated by the United States would, of course, be disastrous for Irish farmers. Indeed it is quite hypocritical for the United States to be demanding the elimination of EC farm subsidies when they are so extensively subsidising their own farmers.  However, it simply does not make sense to continue to subsidise the production of large quantities of foodstuffs that people do not want and that cannot be sold.</P>
    <P>We have mentioned previously the transfer through Structural Funds of which this country receives a greater amount under the Common Agricultural Policy.  It is estimated, and it was previously stated, that as much as 80 per cent of all price support spent on farming goes to those in the top 20 per cent income bracket.  This is clearly not justifiable and the introduction of a two tier price system would ensure that public money would go to those who need it most.  The aim should be to subsidise the producer rather than the project, in other words, provide financial assistance, if necessary, for small and medium size farmers to continue to operate, but stop the wasteful practice of paying large farmers to produce products that are not needed. The Minister should subsidise the producer, not the product.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>Go raibh maith agat. Having studied a submission made to me by the United Farmers Group, I see that the very important and relevant point is made that a new land authority in place of the abolished Land Commission should be instituted to ensure that land does not change hands purely on market prices, and to assist the development of farmers.  There is no control over the sale of land here, and it is going into the hands of people who are not using it for agricultural or productive purposes.  A farm advisory system should be available to people on low incomes.</P>
      <P>They also want a review of the inheritance tax and a revision of the milk quota system where 30,000 gallons would now be the minimum for viability.  They refer also to the grants for disadvantaged areas.  Such grants should be paid to disadvantaged farmers.  As was mentioned previously, the sheep subsidy should have a cut-off point at 200 sheep.  In recent years this subsidy has been exploited by the large farmers who changed to sheep farming simply to obtain EC cash.  We have no wool marketing policy, no wool marketing board, and all these matters need to be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will conclude this morning by appealing to the Minister not to proceed with the policy that is now being put into effect by the Department of Agriculture and Food, that is, the restriction on farm visits and inspections in the matter of considering applications under the various schemes and premiums.  That would be disastrous for this country.  Successive surveys by the Department of Agriculture and Food have shown that these inspections would save the taxpayers millions of pounds.  The present proposals could lead to fraud.  The EC are at present examining this matter.  This <Col N="1567" /> could also lead to the non-payment of grants, which would not be acceptable.</P>
    <P>I will give a very brief outline of the savings that would accrue to the state as a result of on-farm inspections.  If an application is made for a premium under any of the headings, who is to establish the bona fide of that application if no investigation is carried out?  In the area of calf premiums, where there have been 109,000 applications and expenditure of £11.2 million, the saving would have been 5.3 per cent or £593,600; in the case of suckler cow grants where there were 66,915 applications and the cost was £18.3 million, the saving would have been 7.5 per cent; in the beef cow area where the number of applications was 12,155 and the expenditure £5.4 million there would have been a saving of 8.3 per cent. For the special beef premium where there were 92,403 applications at a cost of £13.3 million, the saving would have been 31 per cent.  In the cattle headage area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The saving in that regard would have been 5.9 per cent.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this matter.  His very shortsighted policy could lead to a denial of grants.  It would be no fault of the people involved if they made mistakes in completing their application forms.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> I am very pleased the Minister has increased from 3 per cent to 31 per cent the areas with disadvantaged status in Wexford.</P>
      <P>I would ask him to take into account the problems in the sheep industry at present.  The farming organisations, including the new organisation, the United Farmers Group, have requested the Minister to introduce a number of changes to alleviate the problems for sheep farmers.  There are many reasons for the problems in the sheepmeat sector, one of which is the fact that many large dairy farmers went into the sheep industry and there is now a surplus of sheep in the country.  On the other hand, the sheep farmer could not get into milk production because of the quota system that applies.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on increasing the milk quota by 11 million gallons this year, eight million gallons of which were distributed to the farmers with very small quotas.  I hope that position will continue for the next number of years so that these family farmers and their sons will be able to eke out an income on the land.  The whole milk quota system needs to be considered.  There is a lot of skulduggery in this area, particularly among the larger farmers.  The farm organisations and the co-operatives are aware of what is happening in this regard.  The Minister should ensure that the surplus quotas that are not used by the larger farmers are given to the smaller farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has been doing a good <Col N="1569" /> job since he became Minister for Agriculture. In Brussels he has fought the cause of the farmer, particularly the small farmer.  In his speech today he said the mainstay of the rural economy is the farmer.  He mentioned integrated rural development and said that pilot schemes are in operation in the different areas, including County Wexford.  This is a very good system whereby farmers can select and develop their own projects and get into agri-tourism and other spin-off industries which add to their income.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider in particular the crisis in the sheepmeat sector at present &mdash; I hope it is only a short-term crisis.  Europe is only 85 per cent self sufficient.  Lamb is being imported from New Zealand and, at a time of crisis, there should be some system whereby these imports would be banned.  Once again, I compliment the Minister on the job he is doing.  It is unfortunate we have so little time to debate this whole matter.</P>

      <P>It is regrettable that we have been given only one hour in a whole year to discuss the biggest industry in the country.  It is disgraceful and shows the people, especially the farmers, what the Government think of agriculture.  I am Fine Gael spokesman on horticulture. We discussed a Bill dealing with this matter before Christmas when the Minister said he would be appointing a new Bord Glas, but we have not heard anything about is since.  I would like to know why that is the case.  Is there a row in the Government about who should be on the board?  The passing of that Bill has done nothing to improve the industry and I feel very bad about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous speaker mentioned the crisis in the sheep industry.  The Minister should accept there is a crisis in agriculture. Farmers are getting a very small price for their sheep, heifers cannot be sold, beef cows cannot be sold and beef is making only £1.06 per lb.  When one <Col N="1570" /> considers the costs involved and the overall position of incomes in 1990, the Minister should stop talking about the real increase in farm incomes, which he has been doing for the last three years.  He should remember that in two of those years the weather was so bad that farm incomes decreased substantially, and today they are decreasing even further. Farmers who had to borrow money to improve their premises and their farm structures are not able to make their repayments.  Unfortunately, we were only given one hour to discuss the Estimate for this very important industry but I ask the Minister to do something about farm incomes before he comes back in October.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sherlock also asked about the level of farm inspections and we are moving towards an 80 per cent.  level of inspection which compares very favourably with the 20 per cent level on average in the European Community. I am sure the House will be anxious to know that simultaneously, we are introducing a computerised programme which will give us a very much better data base and will enable us to have a data bank for the purpose of ensuring quicker examination and inspection and speedier payments.</P>

    <P>Deputy Browne among others raised the question of the collapse of sheep prices.  I acknowledge that prices have dropped back in that sector as in others but it has to be recognised that I was able to negotiate earlier this year, when we <Col N="1573" /> had indications of a collapse, that the ewe premium would be paid on the double for 1989 and 1990 and this is the first time that has been done.  The resultant windfall should at least cushion the adverse market trends.  Let me remind Deputies that this problem results from the access to the market of New Zealand lamb, and are Deputies not aware that this concession was negotiated and concluded by Deputy Garret FitzGerald when he was President of the European Council?</P>

      <P>Cúis áthais í dom-sa Meastacháin na Roinne Turasóireachta agus Iompair a mholadh ag an bpointe seo in am dul chun cinn eacnamaíocht na tíre seo.  Is cinnte go leanfaidh an eacnamaíocht sa treo seo de bharr an stiúrú smachtúil eacnamaíochta atá tugtha ag an Rialtas go dtí seo.</P>
      <P>I am glad to introduce this Estimate at a time when the Irish economy continues to progress at an impressive rate.  Our disciplined approach to management of the economy, and particularly the public finances, has helped to set the scene for the maintenance of this trend.</P>
      <P>The two sectors of the economy with which we are dealing in this Estimate, namely tourism and transport, have played a vital part in the process.  Since 1986 the number of people employed in the tourism industry has increased by about 18,000 or 32 per cent and tourism now contributes over 6 per cent of GNP. The licensed road haulage industry has expanded by almost a quarter over the same period and employment in air transport is up 20 per cent, primarily as a result of liberalisation measures in both sectors.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on transport however still accounts for 15 per cent of our GNP.  <i>The National Development Plan 1989 to 1993</i> pointed out that transport costs represent between 9 to 10 per cent of export sales values to Europe, arising to a large degree from our island location off the coast of mainland Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's access transport difficulties have been recognised by the EC who are making almost half a billion pounds aid available for road, rail, port and airport investments, to ease the effects of our peripheral location.  An investment programme has been prepared in consultation with the Commission and I am hopeful of a decision in September on specific projects to be assisted.  Liberalisation has introduced a sharp competitive <Col N="1575" /> element to road haulage and air services and transport costs here have begun to fall as a result.</P>
    <P>The Transport Council agreed last March, under the Irish Presidency, to increase the quota for international carriage of goods within the Community, by 40 per cent this year.  In addition, Irish hauliers are being allowed since 1 July to carry goods from point to point within another member state, subject in the short term to a licensing system known as &ldquo;cabotage licensing&rdquo;.  These are essential steps towards complete freedom of carriage by 1992.  They broaden the market for the services of our international hauliers, providing them with lucrative new business opportunities and a mechanism for introducing economies in the services they provide to Irish exporters.</P>
    <P>At the more recent Transport Council in Luxembourg, the Irish Presidency and delegation again succeeded in securing the adoption of a liberalisation package, this time for air services.  The new measures include an open route schedule, sixth freedom rights, a significant expansion of fifth freedom rights, more liberal capacity sharing arrangements, a more flexible, simpler and more efficient system of fares approval, and the implementation of the first steps towards achieving a system of double disapproval for fares by 1993.</P>
    <P>Greater market freedoms and growth in air traffic have provided new challenges for Aer Lingus, the national carrier. The airline have had to face increasing competition on established routes, to open new routes and to contend with problems such as air traffic control delays, increases in fuel costs and landing charges.  Furthermore, the airline have to fund fleet renewal and expansion through a combination of own resources and borrowing, but without recourse to the Exchequer.  It is imperative that the company succeed in reducing unit costs relative to other airlines and, achieve a steady rise in earnings if they are to continue to compete successfully and provide the necessary expanded services to facilitate economic growth.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1576" /> Aer Lingus have been seeking to exploit their already established reputation for quality, quick turnaround and price competitiveness in aircraft maintenance. The company are planning a major increase in this area of their business with a new £35 million investment in a twin-bay B747 hangar which will be completed in spring 1991.  When this project is operating to capacity, aircraft maintenance for foreign airlines will account for about 75 per cent of the total business.  By 1997, the new hangar development is expected to create 560 new jobs mainly for skilled people.  I might mention in passing that in the financial year just ended the average number of people in employment in Ireland by Aer Lingus and their subsidiaries was 6,556, an increase of over 17 per cent in just three years.</P>
    <P>Our air navigation services have been gearing up to meet the demands of increased traffic.  The re-equipment programme will be completed by 1992 and within budget.  New control facilities, coupled with current recruitment of additional staff, will substantially expand capacity to cater for increasing traffic and further enhance safety within Irish controlled airspace.</P>
    <P>The three State airports are also expanding to cater for increased traffic demand.  The new runway at Dublin is fully operational, the main runway at Cork has been extended while improved passenger facilities are being provided at all three airports.  The regional airports have also formulated plans to accommodate forecast demand.</P>
    <P>The most direct benefits in the context of today's Estimate of all this expanded activity can be seen in the provision for a surplus surrender this year from Aer Rianta which is likely to be about £18 million while en-route facilities charges, which are collected on behalf of the State by Eurocontrol, will also realise £18 million.</P>
    <P>Turning to sea transport, the House already had the opportunity last March, during the debate on the B &amp; I Line Bill, to discuss the recent performance of the company.  The focus for the company is <Col N="1577" /> now fixed firmly on the future.  As the House is aware, the Minister recently asked the board of the B &amp; I to submit proposals for the future of the company which would end the need for Exchequer support as quickly as possible and would take account of Ireland's need for adequate and competitive transport services. These proposals have now been received and are being assessed.</P>
    <P>The Government are providing in this Estimate for grant assistance of £500,000 and a repayable loan for the same amount to Swansea Cork Ferries Limited&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to help meet the cost of financing a ferry service between the two cities in 1990.  The Government have made no commitment to funding the service beyond that date.  It must prove itself this year.  I understand that the company are currently satisfied with their financial and, after some initial difficulties, operational performance.  These are crucial times for the service and I once again urge the people of Cork-Kerry to give it their strongest support.</P>
      <P>Domestic passenger services are also high on our agenda.  This Estimate provides for grant payments of £110.8 million to CIE in 1990.  The major portion of this, £96.8 million, is a subvention towards the cost of the companies' transport services and is in line with the Government's target to reduce the subvention by 3.5 per cent in real terms each year between 1988 and 1991.</P>
      <P>In recent years, CIE have shown that they are both willing and able to rise to the challenges of providing new and innovative public transport services.  This is both refreshing and encouraging.  New services such as Iarnród Éireann's rail breaks programme, Dublin Bus's local link, city speed and peripheral route services and Bus Éireann's expanded network of services linking major centres of population are particularly welcome developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public transport services must continue to be more consumer oriented and delivered at the lowest possible cost to the <Col N="1578" /> Exchequer.  This can be achieved by a unique and progressive partnership between the public and private sectors. The current review of the Road Transport Act, 1932, will be a critical ingredient in this development.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would now like to turn to the tourism sector.  The last three years have seen tremendous growth in tourist traffic. In 1989 overseas visitor numbers topped the 2.8 million mark and foreign tourism earnings were close to £1 billion.  Since the beginning of 1987, visitor numbers to Ireland have grown by a massive 50 per cent and expenditure by foreign visitors by even more.  The Government do not believe that this represents anything near the height of our tourism potential.  It is our aim, working closely with the industry, to increase visitor numbers to over 4.5 million by 1993, boost foreign tourism revenue, and thus create 25,000 new jobs in the economy.  The operational programme agreed last December with the EC Commission to cover the period up to 1993 provides for a total investment of well over £300 million by the private and public sectors in Irish tourism, including a £147 million capital injection by the European Community.</P>
    <P>Details of over £33 million ERDF assistance for some 90 home tourism projects, involving total investment of £55 million, have already been announced. Meanwhile, the agencies responsible for the administration of the programme, namely Bord Fáilte and SFADCo, continue to process the large number of applications seeking grant aid.  The investments will be complemented by a range of other EC assisted works in the area of access transport, roads and environmental services, all of which are crucial to overall tourism development.  I am particularly happy to acknowledge the overwhelming response by state, semi-State and private interests to the operational programme for tourism and I look forward to major improvements in the tourism product over the next three years.</P>
    <P>With both the Government and industry pulling together, the future for Irish tourism is bright.  Current indications are <Col N="1579" /> that tourist numbers continue to rise and that the sector will be more or less on target again this year.  This level of growth, combined with last year's increase of 16 per cent, puts the industry very much on course for achieving the five year targets up to 1993.</P>
    <P>All in all, I am pleased to say that the tourism and transport sectors are in good shape.  We know where we want to go. We also know that existing policies, and future plans based on them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There has rarely been a more lethargic team in the Department of Tourism and Transport than the political heads who are there at present. There is no innovation coming from the Department.  More has to be done to boost our tourism and transport industry than any other industry.  Fine Gael will be opposing these Estimates.</P>
      <P>Dublin is one of the few capital cities which does not have a conference centre. This is an enormous strategic error and one which the Minister must address immediately.  A conference visitor to Ireland will spend £500, five times more than the average foreign tourist.  Seventyone thousand conference visitors spend £56 million per year and this could be multiplied many times if a proper conference centre was available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Conference business is the flagship of high value tourism.  Not only do conference visitors spend much more but they spend it at the most valuable time of the year &mdash; mainly in the five months, April&mdash;June and September and October.  This is the very time capacity is available and taking up this available capacity would have a dramatic effect on the year round profitability of tourism. <Col N="1580" /> This would greatly help to address the major financial problem of Irish tourism seasonality, and think what it would do for unemployment.  It would reduce unemployment significantly and contribute to reducing it in regions which are badly in need of assistance.</P>
    <P>Ireland is ideally placed to increase its market share in world conference business. However, instead of taking this opportunity we are in danger of letting such conference business as we have disappear because other countries have been improving their facilities, which are already way ahead of anything we can offer here.  This means that badly needed jobs are being thrown away because of the lethargy of the Government, most of the Ministers of which have been in Government for three and a half years.</P>
    <P>The feasibility of a conference centre has already been well researched.  In the medium term a conference centre is viable when its contribution to the national economy is taken into account. The best return on investment would come from a 2,000 seat centre with syndicate rooms, banqueting facilities and exhibition space.  A single purpose conference centre is essential; multi-purpose centres must, of their nature, be lower in quality and are, therefore, unacceptably weaker in competitive terms for this sophisticated market.  This means that a successful national conference centre could not be combined with, for instance, a sports centre.  The estimated time for the initiation of a conference centre to completion is three years if fast track construction techniques are combined with a strong political impetus.</P>
    <P>The only feasible location for the centre is Dublin city where the necessary hotel, transport and other infrastructures are already in place but, since there is a spin-off with people coming to conferences touring the country, it would benefit the country as a whole.  The most important and immediate issue is to arrive at the most suitable way of financing a national conference centre.  The estimated capital cost is £40 million and <Col N="1581" /> the funding mix should include contributions from the Government, civic sources, the European Community and the private sector.  Let us agree today that the project has the blessing of this House and urge the Minister to get it under way. It is a project which, in the long-term, will pay for itself many times over.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made much of the increase in tourism traffic but that is a load of nonsense.  I am sure that the Irish team and their entourage who came back last week after participating in the World Cup are classified as visitors every time they enter the country.  Jack Charlton probably represents ten or 20 visitors.  The same applies to all Irish people working in England who come back here several times a year to visit their families and relatives.  There is an urgent need for the Central Statistics Office to properly calculate the level of tourism in this country.  Obviously, people visiting friends and relatives spend a certain amount of money, but they do not take up hotel bedrooms, hire cars or eat out in restaurants to the same extent. It is wrong for the Minister to say that the Government, over the last three years, have invested to a great extent in tourism and have seen growth in that area.</P>
    <P>A joint ITIC and Bord Fáilte document was published recently which stated that in 1979 Bord Fáilte received £32.5 million; in 1980 they received £29 million but in 1990 they received only £21 million. Yet the Minister said that the Government are committed to developing tourism.  It has been made clear to Bord Fáilte that, while they got supplementary estimates in previous years, the sum of £21 million is all they will get this year, mark this, £1 million of that has been allocated for the promotion of a Japanese garden.  The amount allocated to them has been more than halved, in real terms, compared with what they received in 1979.  What sort of a commitment to tourism is that?  It is a load of nonsense, a plume of smoke.</P>
    <P>I now wish to refer to transport.  The Minister seems determined to screw CIE and their subsidiaries, in particular Bus <Col N="1582" /> Éireann and Bus Átha Cliath, by his constant mutterings outside this House, yet, when I question him about it in the House, he says the reports are inaccurate. However, the papers are strewn with suggestions that he intends to award lucrative bus routes to the private sector. I am all for competition &mdash; there should be competition between the private sector and CIE &mdash; but there should be a level playing field.  They should be prepared to take on a share of the loss leaders as well as a share of the profit leaders.  It should be done openly and properly and the licences should be awarded in an independent manner.</P>
    <P>I very much regret that the CIE works in Inchicore &mdash; an enormous engineering works which could be the Harland and Wolff of the Republic &mdash; is practically unused; the morale of the workforce is probably the lowest in the country.  They could build tanks or buses and many other things in that works.  I again urge the Minister to bring CIE and the IDA together to find a suitable project for the premises.  Why are we not building the rolling stock for British Rail?  They looked for outside countries to tender in this regard; why did we not submit a tender?  Why is that works not being used?  CIE and the IDA should be promoting the works, they could attract a Japanese company or at least get the British Rail contract.  It is regrettable that the Minister has not done anything about it.</P>
    <P>The question of monitoring some of the companies which the Minister has under his wing and what has euphemistically been called &ldquo;£10 million in unreported losses&rdquo; by an Aer Lingus subsidiary will require the attention of this House sooner or later.  The Minister may send the reports to the Garda for a second time to keep it beyond the reach of this House and direct the board of Aer Lingus to deal with it in a disciplinary manner, even though it is the Minister's responsibility, but I will not forget this issue.  This House has a right to know what happened to that £10 million.  The matter stinks to high heaven and I will not rest until the House receives an <Col N="1583" /> explanation as to what happened in Aer Lingus and their subsidiary.  No matter how long it is with the Garda and put beyond the remit of this House, I will return to the issue until we get an explanation.</P>
    <P>Our road haulage industry has been devastated; 125,000 containers are exported through Larne, Warrenpoint and Belfast Docks for delivery as far south as London, more cheaply than we can do it because the road haulage industry are being put out of business because of levies, taxes and insurance.  There is nothing going through Dublin port.  What is the Minister doing about it?  Nothing. There has been no innovation in tourism or transport and the Minister has nothing to say to the House in relation to camouflaged accounts.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael will oppose this Estimate and I am sorry that I do not have enough time to give the reasons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to speak on the Tourism and Transport Estimate.  It does not give me any comfort to point out that there has been a serious drop in tourist numbers in the family hotels, guesthouses and approved accommodation throughout the country.  It is so serious that owners are gravely concerned; it has been described in some quarters as a disaster. What is the cause?  A variety of reasons can be advanced such as bad weather, the World Cup, expensive petrol and car hire.  This demonstrates the necessity for an ongoing, aggressive marketing strategy for the tourism industry.  Coach tour business is improving but this factor does not impact on the incomes of the smaller sections in the industry as it is mainly confined to the larger hotels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The target for growth which is expected to double in four years is readily attainable provided we put the necessary money into the sale of the wonderful product we have.  Let us look at the tourist figures.  In 1988 1.5 million came from Britain, 385,000 from the USA, 34,000 from Canada, 111,000 from France, 113,000 from Germany and 38,000 from <Col N="1584" /> the Netherlands.  When one realises the magnitude of the population of these countries and the colossal interest in our country revealed by the high percentage who come here on holiday we recognise the wonderful opportunity presented by the new and developing airlines and competitive air fares which serve to eliminate distance.  The extending air facilities and sea services now reach millions in distant communities and provide opportunities for tourism, provided marketing remains a top priority to stimulate a rising interest in the good product we have to offer and to persuade these people to buy.</P>
    <P>What are the appealing factors of Irish tourism?  The title &ldquo;the green isle&rdquo; has an enchantment for many.  We have a clean environment, open roads, friendly, courteous people, excellent standards of accommodation and food, our rich heritage of music, song and dance and the opportunity for activitity holidays coveing horseriding, water sports, mountaineering and fishing.  Fishing is probably the greatest attraction for foreign tourists. I am sure the Minister agrees the rod licence dispute did serious damage to the tourism industry.  It was senseless legislation and its retention on the Statute Book is a continuing embarrassment to those promoting Irish tourism overseas. They cannot say there is free fishing in Ireland while this law remains.  I appeal to the Minister here today in the brief Dáil time remaining this term to secure the co-operation of his colleague, the Minister for the Marine, to bring forward the simple amending legislation required, for which approval from all parties will be readily forthcoming, so that free fishing in Irish lakes and rivers can be really exploited.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to comment on the standard of tourist information offices throughout the country which are vital to a growing tourism industry.  In most cases they are inadequate to meet the challenge. They have not enough room for tourists at peak periods.  The display space for tourism literature, maps etc, is inadequate.  They are in need for a major upgrading.  A professionally produced <Col N="1585" /> video showing features of special attraction, heritage centres, activity holidays, golf courses etc. would enhance greatly the contribution of the tourist office to the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>I have pleasure in supporting the development of the regional airports. Erstwhile they had a domestic and commercial interest but they are now oriented mainly towards the expansion of tourism.  I have learned, from a reply to a recent parliamentary question, of a State investment of £3,877,626 in the four regional airports at Galway, Farranfore, Waterford and Sligo, up to the end of June this year.  In view of the capacity of these four airports to bring increased numbers of tourists to their respective areas I feel a Bord Fáilte tourist information office is a vital necessity at each of them.  The Minister should arrange for the provision of a site at each airport free of charge for the operation of a State tourist information service.  Ireland during the World Cup competition got huge international publicity through the team, the manager and the supporters. To capitalise on that favourable publicity it is highly desirable that there be a follow-up in marketing and promotion in the autumn in Italy, Germany and the Netherlands.  Let me also draw attention to the necessity for the continuing expansion and development of conference and congress facilities which can prove very beneficial.</P>
    <P>The factors which must be kept constantly in mind are increasing marketing and promotion in the widest possible way, securing further extended competitive air and sea fares to Ireland and, most important, ensuring that visitors coming to Ireland get value for money and, on leaving our shores as satisfied customers, are anxious to return in future.</P>
    <P>The conditions governing the expenditure of the Structural Funds tourism moneys in Ireland are disappointing in that they exclude any aid for improvement in the accommodation sector.  Much of our accommodation is in need of refurbishment and the industry itself has not the resources to meet the cost of this <Col N="1586" /> refurbishment.  I feel an opportunity has been lost here to have a major uplifting of the standards of accommodation.</P>
    <P>In regard to agri-tourism, if my information is correct only some 26 applications have been approved.  That would represent only one in respect of each county.  This is a disappointment, having regard to the fact that the scheme is practically 12 months in operation.  I suggest to the Minister that it might be necessary to take this scheme back to the drawing board and that he consult with the Minister for Agriculture and Bord Fáilte with a view to bringing forward a more attractive package, as there is scope in this scheme for substantial aid from the Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>The Cork-Swansea ferry is a vital link for the success of Irish tourism, especially in the premier centre in Ireland, the south-west, and its operation without some State guarantee would be put in jeopardy and the loss to the industry and the national finances would be drasticInvestment in tourism will bring at least eight times the return of similar investment in other sectors of this economy. The continuing &ldquo;stop-go&rdquo; in the Cork-Swansea ferry service has not helped its marketing.  I urge the Minister to ensure that for a period of three years it is given the opportunity to build itself up into a continuing, permanent, beneficial service to tourism.  The Channel Tunnel between France and Britain will bring an increased volume of tourist families in cars seeking transport to the last island outpost of the continent.  Surely the Cork-Swansea ferry is a &ldquo;must&rdquo; in this regard.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing that no additional moneys are being provided beyond the £21 million.  Previous speakers have pointed out that there has been a reduction from £32 million.  The amount should be increasing massively because of the potential there to improve the economy and the viability of the industry to create full-time employment in tourism. Unless we market and promote it it is futile&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It contradicts the concept of democracy whereby one expects full and thorough debate particularly on issues as important as the Estimates for these sectors.  However, we must be grateful for the opportunity to speak at all, given the situation here in the last week with successive guillotines on motions and so on and the Government's determination to clear the decks by providing the minimum semblance of democracy in action so that they can enjoy their three months' summer holidays. How many rural TDs will spend their holidays in Dublin this year?  I presume that not a single one will spend their holidays in Dublin.  If I asked the 120 TDs living outside of Dublin if they would spend one week of their 3 months' holidays in Dublin and 20 said yes, we would be doing well.  Should we be surprised that so few people want to come to Dublin?  Of course not.  Dublin is being passed over as a holiday location.  It is used mainly by tourists in transit to other areas.  Dublin is getting a raw deal in relation to tourism.  Dublin is not properly marketed for tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Tourism and Transport must get involved with what is happening in our capital city.  Our city is being destroyed.  The Minister for Tourism and Transport must confront his cabinet colleagues, particularly the Minister for the Environment and demand that in 1991 when Dublin becomes the Cultural Capital of Europe the destruction of our historical and architectural heritage, that <Col N="1588" /> is the destruction of listed buildings, will be stopped.  The Minister should be concerned about the state of the city.  It is no wonder that tourists only pass through when they see Mountjoy Square, for example, in a state of decay and dereliction or when they see the quays and the bombed out appearance of these areas.  It is no wonder tourists are not interested when they see the remaining portion of our old city wall at Cornmarket in the Liberties, standing in a car park without even a plaque to identify it.  It is a damning condemnation of city tourist committees and the Minister that prime historical areas that in Europe would be show pieces, are discarded and used as an obstruction in car parks in the heart of mediaeval Dublin.</P>
    <P>Dublin is not getting the jobs it should get from tourism.  A concerted effort by the Minister could reverse this.  He should be concerned about the destruction of our once beautiful capital city and he must convey that concern to the cabinet. He could demand that the recently discovered sections of the old city walls and the location of the base of Isolde's Tower near Lord Edward Street be preserved and exposed to public view.  Let the tourists see them and understand how ancient the city is.  The Minister should guarantee that these monuments will not be cemented over to allow speculative property development to proceed.</P>
    <P>The Minister should try to halt the continuing destruction of the fine Georgian, Edwardian and Victorian buildings for which Dublin was once famous by initiating conservation grants to be used as an incentive to maintain these buildings, many of which are very expensive to maintain as homes without assistance. Special conservation grants and home improvement grants for listed buildings would help to preserve the best of our beautiful streets and squares of architectural and cultural interest.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not only failed Dublin with regard to tourism but he has failed to bring in a transportation policy.  Already, Dublin with its comparatively low percentage of private car ownership, is unable to cope with its traffic.  Does the <Col N="1589" /> Minister not realise that the millions of pounds being thrown into road building within the Dublin city metropolitan area cannot provide the answer to our problems? He is following out-dated policies in implementing a road based policy aimed at catering for the private motor car.  The provision of massive highways throughout the city is not a solution.  It is not what the public are demanding. These expansive roads are destroying communities and the character of the city.  The Minister should close his ears to the lobbying of the motor and construction industry and adopt a progressive, cheaper more environmentally friendly alternative by providing a good public transport system.</P>
    <P>The Government's priorities were clearly identified in the National Development Plan which allocated £212 million for roads in Dublin over the next five years, with just £36 million for public transport.  A sum of £200 million is casually mentioned by road planners as being the cost of the eastern by-pass.  This would work out at about £36 million a mile.  The Minister has not recognised the essential truth borne out by the experience in cities throughout the world, that the more road space is created, the more cars will be used.  The only way to relieve urban traffic congestion is to provide a fast efficient reliable and attractive public transport system which will persuade commuters to leave their cars at home.</P>
    <P>There is a problem with Dublin port because heavy vehicles come from the port through the city to join the main road network on the outskirts.  There is potential for the greater use of rail in this regard.  Why should not containers which arrive in port by ship be transported by rail to a central depot outside of the city from where they can be collected by heavy goods vehicles?  The rail network is there.  The Minister I am sure is aware of how large containers are moved throughout Europe and the same system of transport should operate from Dublin port.</P>
    <P>The huge success of the DART is an <Col N="1590" /> example of what a well managed punctual, clean, cheap, public transport service can provide.  In order for the commercial inner city to survive modern, efficient, consumer friendly and environmentally friendly public transport must be put in place.  This would encourage people to leave their cars at home and it would bring shoppers from the towns of Tallaght, Clondalkin and Blanchardstown into the city.  An extended DART line to these areas can provide a solution as could a commitment from Iarnród Éireann to develop a modern light rail transport system complemented by bus ways and proper traffic management controls.</P>
    <P>If we can get £32 million from the EC to reopen the Ballyconnell/Ballinamore Canal, it is outrageous that the Minister has failed to tap EC Development Funds for our public transport needs and has effectively ignored the case for up-grading the Belfast/Dublin railway line.  There has been a disgraceful abandonment of this line to the Provos by the Government. It is outrageous to allow the burden for the running of that line to fall on Northern Ireland Railways, who spent £1 million on this line last year because of Provo bombings.  They wish not only to keep the line open but to upgrade it.  I appeal to the Minister not to abandon this line, to up-grade it as a matter of urgency, and to pursue the EC for the money for this project.</P>

      <P>One of the successes of this Government relates to tourism. There has been great progress in the Dublin region with regard to its development as a tourist area.  Because Dublin is the capital city people come to visit.  I do not agree that Dublin does not have many attractions.  We have many attractions and I am very pleased with developments particularly in the south inner city.  If one visits the Christchurch district one will see the tremendous improvements that have taken place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stafford</NameTxt>
      <P>That district attracts many visitors.  People have noted the influx of tourists in the early part of the year.  One of the problems faced by Dublin Tourism is that the tourist season in the capital city is confined to July and August.  They have made efforts to extend that by a further month by arranging a variety of events.  We must try to extend our tourist season to at least six months and arrange our tourist calendar so that we do not have to depend on the sun.  The Government are moving in that direction.  People are turning away from the sun spots of Spain and looking to countries like Ireland for holidays.  They are seeking facilities for families and appropriate entertainment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard we should concentrate on improving our rivers and lakes.  I am pleased at the progress that is taking place on the Royal and Grand canals in Dublin. I walked along the banks of the Royal Canal yesterday and I was pleased with the improvements that have taken place. I was told that by the end of 1991 the work on that canal will be completed.  I hear many complaints about the condition of our roads and this prompts people to question the amount of money spent on roads.  I accept that the provision of roads will not solve our transport problems but we must face the fact that they are not adequate.  I hear complaints that new roads create problems for the environment but people forget that if we do not construct new roads residents in districts like East Wall, Marino, Fairview and Drumcondra will have to suffer the problems associated with constant traffic passing their houses.  We must construct a road in that district to take all the heavy traffic.  Dublin Port is partly land-locked and only 10 per cent of the traffic using the road in that district use the port.  I do not agree with the argument that if we build more roads more cars will be purchased. In a small State like ours we will only have a certain number of cars irrespective of the number of roads we <Col N="1592" /> construct.  The problem is that we are not making provision for commuter traffic, those driving from one part of Dublin to another.  We cannot continue to block proposals to construct an essential road from Whitehall to the port.  The people of East Wall, Marino and Fairview will stop all traffic if that road is not allowed to proceed.  In a modern city like Dublin we should have a proper road network.</P>

      <P>Some officials of the ESB, whom I would describe as lunatics, put forward a ridiculous proposal to move the port to the north of the county.  They did not consult the port authority or others about this proposal.  It was their view that if the port was moved north the traffic problem would be solved.  That was a ludicrous suggestion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the speech by the Minister of State and I was surprised to hear the same old Government propaganda that tourism will get rid of all our ills that many jobs can be created in the tourist industry and that it was unfortunate it was not being promoted fully.  The Minister told us that when the industry was properly promoted we would have a phenomenal influx of tourists and money. His speech amounted to no more than Government propaganda and many of the matters referred to in it were untrue.  I accept that there is tremendous potential for the industry but we lack a cohesive and imaginative plan.  The Minister of State, and the Minister for Tourism and Transport, have failed miserably in their efforts to promote tourism in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a number of occasions I have drawn attention to the discrimination in tourist grant schemes.  There is no grant available for small family run businesses to help them provide additional bedrooms or improve facilities in their small hotels or guesthouses.  That is an indication of the Government's attitude to tourism. The owner of a hotel with 14 or more <Col N="1593" /> bedrooms is entitled to grant aid but a hotel with fewer bedrooms is not entitled to any assistance.  If we are to promote tourism we must assist the owners of small hotels.</P>
    <P>The promotion of tourism is essential. On numerous occasions the Minister said that the Government were prepared to allocate more money for the marketing and promotion of Ireland abroad if the industry were prepared to match that investment.  At least 80 per cent of the money spent on promotion work was put up by the industry and the Government provided the other 20 per cent.  That speaks volumes for the Government's attitude to the promotion of Ireland abroad.  The industry have invested heavily in promotion work but they have not received any backing from the Government.</P>
    <P>The overall budget for Bord Fáilte in the last 12 years has declined, expressed in 1990 terms.  In real terms this year's budget is only 66 per cent of the 1979 level.  I take it from that that the Government are not prepared to do anything to promote Ireland abroad.  To illustrate my point I should like to quote a letter to the Editor of the <i>Irish Independent</i> published in the issue of that newspaper of 11 June 1990.  It stated:</P>
    <P>Sir&mdash;Having spent a holiday here in Ireland we feel that there are certain things your Tourist Board should do in order to bring Canadian tourists to your wonderfully beautiful country.</P>
    <P>We wonder why your board does not promote Canadian tourists to visit Ireland?  Very little information is available outside of Toronto and other major cities and even there it appears limited, or lumped in with Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The general impression among Canadians is that civil war is raging.  Those who mention Ireland for holidays are greeted by the comment &ldquo;you must be crazy, you'll be shot&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Having enjoyed our holiday in Ireland, I know that there are thousands more like me who would like to come here if you would only promote <Col N="1594" /> your country and tell visitors that they will not be in a war zone.</P>
    <P>That letter highlights the problems Bord Fáilte and others have of selling Ireland abroad.  After Pan Am pulled out of Shannon I suggested that the Government should do what they could to encourage an international carrier to stop over in Ireland.  Pan Am promoted Ireland in all their US offices and Air Canada, if given permission to use Ireland, could do the same throughout Canada.  I have no doubt that that airline would use Ireland if they were encouraged to do so by the Government.  The company have many offices throughout Canada and I have no doubt that they would promote Ireland through them.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Government sit idly by while the industry spend a lot of money promoting the country abroad.  Last week the House debated a motion which expressed concern about the loss of 300 jobs in Arigna, County Roscommon and during it the Minister for Energy said that those jobs could be replaced by jobs in the tourist industry. However, he did not announce that the Government would pay grants to owners of small hotels or guesthouses.  It is unfortunate that the Government do not have a plan for the tourist industry.  If they continue along the road they are travelling we will lose a great industry.  I appeal to the Minister to devote more money to the promotion of Ireland abroad.  There is no doubt that the industry has great potential.  I ask the Minister of State to bear in mind that Bord Fáilte have spent their 1990 allocation for promotion work and do not have any finances for the remaining six months.  It is essential that they are given additional finance to continue their marketing programme.</P>

      <P>I am utterly appalled at the lack of commitment to public transport, in particular CIE.  I welcome the opening <Col N="1595" /> of the new stations but, having said this, we have to provide the necessary rolling stock to enable services be provided to towns on the western and northern sides of the city.  The rolling stock currently in use is in poor condition as well as being old.  We should establish an industry in Inchicore.  At present we are waiting for the Minister to give the go ahead for such an industry to be established.  This would enable Irish people, with a proven record, build these carriages and ensure that those using the railways will travel in safety.  It is a scandal that he has not yet given the go ahead.</P>
      <P>I regret that sufficient time has not been allocated for the taking of this Estimate but let me refer, in conclusion, to the ongoing dispute at St. Margaret's in north County Dublin.  The Minister has not given the go ahead to Aer Rianta to enter into realistic negotiations with the people of St. Margaret's who are affected by the extension of the runway.  Because of this they have not been able to find a realistic solution to the problem.  I demand that the Minister and the Government examine this problem and reach an agreement with these people. There is nothing in the Estimate which would give any hope that the problems I have referred to will be dealt with.</P>

Deputies expressed the view in the course of the debate that they had insufficient time to deal with the issues.  I would share this view.  However, I was saddened by the way in which time was misused to filibuster debate on an issue not as important as the creation of jobs in the tourism industry.

Deputies also questioned the way in which the CSO compile figures.  We try to estimate visitors, friends and relatives figures which are taken into account in drawing up programmes and plans.  This is done in accordance with international practice.</P>
      <P>Reference was also made to both public and private sector transport.  I forgot to mention earlier that the 1932 Transport Act is currently being reviewed.  The new arrangements must take full account of the legitimate aspirations of the private sector for more open access to the provision of services to the public and also provide the general public with the prospect of improved and more cost effective transport services.</P>

I liked the comment about our architecture and heritage but I must say it is quite clear that the Deputy concerned, who is a member of Dublin Corporation, is passing the buck and wants me to preserve their heritage and buildings.  I should also say that there are none so blind as those who do not wish to see.  It should be borne in mind that hotels up and down the country have been extended and refurbished.</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £36,159,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1990, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of <Col N="1598" /> the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and of certain services administered by that Office, including grants-in-aid.</P>
    <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take the Estimates for Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation together.</P>
    <P>The sum proposed for the Vote for Foreign Affairs is £36,159,000.  Most of this provision is required for the salaries of staff at headquarters and at missions and offices abroad.  Provision is also made for travelling expenses and communications and post office services, for repatriation and maintenance of Irish citizens who find themselves in difficulties abroad, for cultural and information services and for North-South and Anglo-Irish Co-operation.</P>
    <P>We are currently living through a period of enormous change.  Ireland, through our recently completed Presidency of the Council of the European Communities, has been privileged to play a prominent role in the evolution of these events.  Now, in the aftermath of the Presidency, we are faced, as a sovereign nation, as a member state of the European Community, and as a participant in other international bodies with a number of challenges which will be crucial to our future and to the lives of future generations.</P>
    <P>On a global level, there is a need to continue the process of disarmament, to promote the settlement of regional disputes, to counter the afflictions of famine and poverty, to guarantee the freedom of international trade, and to eliminate the threat to the environment.  Ireland has sought to act at this level primarily through our full support for the United Nations system, for instance, in respect of its initiative on global disarmament and peacekeeping, and through the action of the European Community in areas such as the environment, the ongoing GATT negotiations, as well as in Twelve co-ordination on most foreign policy issues of general concern.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of European Political Co-operation, the Twelve, under the Irish Presidency, set out the framework <Col N="1599" /> for their approach to the Arab-Israeli conflict in the Middle East and to developments in Southern Africa, as well as being active on a whole series of international issues from Cambodia to Central America.</P>
    <P>Our concern for the developing world is manifested in our development assistance which is provided through both bilateral and multilateral channels, particularly in the later case through the European Community.  We have, through our Presidency of the EC Council, been able to make a special contribution to the Community's efforts over the past six months.</P>
    <P>Our Presidency priority, successfully fulfilled, was to ensure a smooth and rapid transition to the fourth Lomé Convention, signed last December, while strengthening the Community's relations with other developing countries in Asia and Latin America.  Relations with the countries of Central America were also reinforced at the San Jose VI Ministerial Conference in Dublin last April, where an agreement was signed providing Community funding for a Regional Payments System project in Central America.</P>
    <P>As the House will know our Bilateral Aid Programme for developing countries is a highly valued, high quality and effective mode of assistance.  The allocation of £9.3 million, net, for 1990 represents a slight increase on the 1989 level of £9.0 million, net.  Despite budgetary difficulties a basic programme of assistance to our priority and partner countries is being maintained and commitments are being met.</P>
    <P>We are also providing £2.5 million for the Agency for Personal Service Overseas &mdash; APSO &mdash; an increase of 9 per cent over the 1989 provision.</P>
    <P>The bilateral aid subhead has been widened to include a new element &mdash; £0.65 million for a programme of assistance to Poland and Hungary.</P>
    <P>At a European level we are faced with the challenge of the internal integration of the European Community and the construction of an entirely new framework of relations covering the whole of Europe.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1600" /> As regards the internal development of the Community, there are four areas in which the significant progress achieved during our period of office will need to be carried forward.</P>
    <P>The Irish Presidency proved outstandingly successful in overseeing the adoption of Community legislation establishing the Single Market.  Much work remains to be done, however, both in processing outstanding legislation at Community level and translating Community rules into national law.</P>
    <P>Stage I of Economic and Monetary Union came into force on 1 July.  The Intergovernmental Conference which will draw up Treaty changes necessary for the completion of the subsequent stages will open on 13 December.  EMU holds out great opportunities for Ireland to share in the benefits of economic progress and monetary stability as part of one of the most powerful economic units in the world.  There will, of course, have to be special consideration for the circumstances of peripheral and less prosperous regions in adapting to the demands of the new system.  As you know, the recent European Council decided to convene an Intergovernmental Conference on Political Union to work alongside that on EMU. This Conference will examine means of strengthening democratic accountability, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the Community and its Institutions and achieving unity and coherence in the Community's international action.  Ireland will, of course, be making a full contribution to the deliberations.</P>
    <P>The Community has responded rapidly and coherently to the prospect of German unification and the consequent enlargement of the Community. However, the possibility that political unification could take place before the end of the year will call for even greater efforts to ensure that the simultaneous absorption into the Community of what is now the GDR can take place with the minimum of disruption.</P>
    <P>The Irish Presidency of the EC Council was marked by the development of a <Col N="1601" /> coherent response to the new situation in Europe as a whole.  Particularly important in the Community context was the commencement of negotiations with the EFTA countries on the creation of a European Economic Space, and the implementation of a range of initiatives to develop relations with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, both bilaterally and within the framework of the Group of 24.</P>
    <P>Over the coming months, the Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe will have a fundamental role to play as a framework for reform and stability. The CSCE has the notable advantage that it covers the full range of co-operation between peoples and Governments, and that it involves the United States, Canada, and all the States of Europe &mdash; except Albania.  The Twelve have signalled their determination to play a leading role in the CSCE process.  The Summit to be held in Paris, later this year, will mark the starting point for a new, more advanced stage of the CSCE process and will enable German unification to become deeply rooted in an all-European context.</P>
    <P>At a national level, the dramatically changing climate in Europe as a whole is an inspiration to all of us on this island to redouble our efforts to break down barriers which have divided us for far too long.</P>
    <P>For our part, the Government fully support, and have been as helpful as possible to, the efforts of the British Secretary of State's efforts to explore new ways forward on a basis which does not undermine the progress already achieved.  We are encouraged by the acceptance on the part of all involved that lasting progress can only be brought about by a process which addresses the three crucial sets of relationships &mdash; within Northern Ireland, between North and South and between the two islands &mdash; and it is our hope that the talks can successfully go forward on this basis.  It is of course the case that, unless and until a transcending arrangement is in place, the Anglo-Irish Agreement will continue to govern our approach.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1602" /> The mechanisms established by the Agreement have been crucial to efforts to enhance the confidence of the nationalist community in the security forces and the administration of justice generally.  We have worked continually with the British authorities, through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat in Belfast, to ensure that matters of concern to us is this area are dealt with speedily and effectively.  In this regard, the Government will be discussing the recommendations contained in the report of the Stevens Inquiry with the British Government at the next Anglo-Irish Conference where we will be anxious to hear what steps they intend to take to implement them.</P>
    <P>Issues affecting Anglo-Irish relationships, of course, also arise in Britain, notably in connection with certain cases there dating from the 1970s.  Deputies will have shared my relief and satisfaction at the positive developments in respect of the Guildford Four and the Maguire family and their friends.  There still remains, however, the case of the Birmingham Six, who have now spent almost 16 years in prison.  Deputies will be aware of the Government's strongly held view that there are urgent and compelling reasons for reopening it.  We will continue to avail of all appropriate opportunities to pursue our efforts on the issue, both bilaterally and otherwise.</P>
    <P>The last few months have seen an increase in IRA atrocities on the Continent of Europe and in Britain.  The Government have condemned these actions in the strongest possible terms and will continue their present full international co-operation to ensure maximum effectiveness in counteracting the terrorist threat.</P>
    <P>With the advent of the Single Market in 1992, enhanced economic co-operation between North and South will become increasingly necessary and advantageous. Such co-operation is already in train in respect of preparations for the European Community's cross-Border Structural Fund programme, the North-West Study of the Donegal-Derry-Strabane area, and the administration of the International Fund in Ireland.  The <Col N="1603" /> Government are also involved in discussions with the British authorities, within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Conference, on means for counteracting the massively high levels of unemployment and social deprivation in West Belfast.</P>
    <P>A Cheann Comhairle, while some aspects of today's celebration of the 300th anniversary of the Battle of the Boyne are testimony to the obduracy of the divisions which afflict us, they surely represent a challenge to all Irish people to rid ourselves of lingering suspicions and mistrust so that we might live together peacefully on this island as part of the new Europe. The causes which led our forefathers to do battle on the Boyne were to a significant extent rooted in a European conflict which has long since been consigned to the history books.  The time is surely right to us to once again involve ourselves in the events of our Continent, in the spirit of reconciliation and co-operation which determines the mood of today and gives us hope for the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the House I would like to share my time with Deputy Owen.  This debate shows the unsatisfactory nature of a debate on foreign affairs in this House and again underlines the necessity for a foreign affairs committee of this House.  I have written to the Taoiseach a couple of times &mdash; and he has not replied to me yet &mdash; making certain suggestions in that regard.  I would be grateful if the Minister would prompt him to take up my suggestions and to consider the points I have put to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister appreciates that in the last six months &mdash; I do not mean to be patronising by this &mdash; we have been co-operative with him because we recognise the heavy burden which his office had during Ireland's Presidency. As a result, matters relating to European affairs, foreign affairs, overseas development aid and Northern Ireland have not arisen as frequently in this House as I would have wished.  I would hope that that co-operation on my part &mdash; and <Col N="1604" /> which I believe holds good in the case of other parties as well &mdash; over the last six months will be appeciated and the balance redressed in the autumn.</P>
    <P>With regard to Mr. Brian Keenan it would be my hope as I am sure it would be of everybody in this country &mdash; that he would be released today or in the very near future from the captivity in which he should never have been placed.  He is an Irishman travelling on an Irish passport. The only connection Ireland has with that region has been by way of education or the part we play in the United Nations Peacekeeping Force.  Kidnapping or hostage-taking can never be an acceptable part of a civilised society.  Disputes can be settled in other ways without holding innocent people up to ransom in what might be described as &ldquo;mega&rdquo; disputes not involving the individuals concerned, whose only interest was to do good.  I hope that today will see the release of Mr. Brian Keenan.  Even then we should not relax our efforts to ensure that the other hostages held &mdash; who, as far as I know, in most cases are innocent of any crime &mdash; are reunited with their families.</P>
    <P>I want to voice one word of criticism in that regard.  It is entirely commendable that the Iranian Government, with whom we have diplomatic relations, should be a conduit for conveying to those holding hostages our concerns about the safety of Mr. Brian Keenan and the others held. The friendship between this country and Iran is something which we can use to help that process of the release of hostages. However, that friendship should be extended beyond diplomatic relations. Visits on the part of parliamentarians from this country to Iran can help to bring home to the Iranians our desire for that sense of friendship.  In that regard the MEP, Deputy and Senator who went out to Iran did commendable work.  I commend them and the Government for having arranged their visit.  Nonetheless it would have been more beneficial &mdash; the nuances of political life in this country being recognised by the Iranian Ambassador here &mdash; had that delegation been an all-party one, rather than having <Col N="1605" /> been comprised of Members of one party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Barry for sharing his time with me.  Indeed, the very necessity for sharing time highlights the fact that this debate is so short.  I know this is not something the Minister himself would have desired.  Perhaps when the Estimate for this Department is next debated in the House he will ensure we have more time.</P>
      <P>In the short time available to me I shall concentrate on Overseas Development Aid, our relations with the Third World, countries experiencing such extreme difficulties. Our Overseas Development Aid must be viewed against the background of over one billion people, one-fifth of all mankind, lacking adequate food, clean water, basic education and health care.  Let me emphasise what I am talking about: every day a simple disease such as measles kills 8,000 children; even as I speak here hundreds of children are dying; every day diarrhoea kills 7,000 children and pneumonia kills 6,000 or more children.  Those are the startling facts of life for one-fifth of the world's population.  It is against that background that this Government have chosen to reduce further our Overseas Development Aid budget to developing countries, despite the enormous personal generosity of the Irish people, who were the highest contributors to Band Aid and all the other demands on their generosity by the various agencies involved in this task. Against that background the Government continue to pay hollow lip service to our moral responsibility to those developing countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of his introductory remarks today the Minister spoke yet again about the obtaining budgetary constraints, and so on.  I do not agree that pleading for an annual increase in our Overseas Development Aid budget, until we reach the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP, constitutes special pleading.  I might add that other countries did not consider it to be special pleading.  For example, in France, while their overall fiscal deficit was being reduced in the <Col N="1606" /> years 1984 and 1985, they managed to increase their Overseas Development Aid budget from 0.48 per cent in 1983 &mdash; way above ours &mdash; to 0.54 per cent in 1985.  In Canada it was the same &mdash; increasing from 0.43 per cent in 1982-83 to 0.5 in 1985 when their overall Government expenditure was being held static. In the Netherlands, despite severe cutbacks on Government expenditure since 1982, their percentage increased from 0.75 per cent in 1981 to 0.83 per cent in 1985 and is now in excess of that in 1990. In Denmark, despite a rapid reduction in their fiscal deficit, they managed to increase their Overseas Development Aid.</P>
    <P>I might remind the Minister that in 1975, in volume 278 of the Official Report, column 1372, the spokesperson on Foreign Affairs, who subsequently became Minister for Foreign Affairs and signed at least one of the Lomé Conventions, said, and I quote:</P>
    <P>So far as this side of the House is concerned we commit ourselves to ensuring that, irrespective of our budgetary or balance of payments problems, we shall set aside year after year the appropriate sum to ensure that we reach at least the target set by the Minister &mdash; 0.35 per cent of our GNP within five years.</P>
    <P>That was Deputy Michael O'Kennedy, then Fianna Fáil spokesman on Foreign Affairs speaking in this House.</P>
    <P>I am not contending that everything other Governments have done has brought us to the point at which we can hold our heads high or contend that we have reached the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP; nonetheless there had been a steady, slow annual increase in that aid until 1987 when this Government assumed office.  Now we have reverted to the point at which we were in 1973.  I do not think that is anything to boast about. I say that particularly when one considers that what we give by way of Overseas Development Aid now represents a mere 2.5p per person daily.  The fact that Irish people spend at least 16 times more on tobacco products daily clearly highlights <Col N="1607" /> our lack of commitment to the Third World.  For every £100 of EC aid we receive we give £4 only to assist the poorest countries of the world.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the net effect of some of these cutbacks.  In 1986 an office was opened in Sudan &mdash; one of our bilateral aid countries &mdash; which was closed again in 1988.  The budget for Sudan decreased from £900,000 in 1986 to £322,000 in 1989.  Therefore, this Minister stands indicted for having engaged in false promises overall in this context.</P>
    <P>The Minister must recognise that we are facing into a new post-apartheid phase in South Africa, in the general southern African region, and plan for that transition.</P>
    <P>When replying, can he inform me, whether he has made any progress with regard to the Cambodian position at the UN.  On 9 May in this House he informed me that at present the Irish delegation to the United Nations General Assembly would work with like-minded countries to bring about a change in the present seating at the United Nations.  I hope that he will be able to give some indication today that those discussions have progressed somewhat, that we are reaching circumstances in which the untenable seats of the democratic representatives of Kampuchea &mdash; which are nothing of the sort &mdash; will no longer be taken to represent the people of Cambodia at the United Nations.  I hope that he will be able to inform me that things have changed in that respect.</P>

      <P>I join other speakers in paying tribute to the achievements of those who have worked in the foreign affairs field over the period of the Irish Presidency of the EC.  Their achievements deserve commendation and recognition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support Deputy Peter Barry very much in his reference to the inadequacy of the time allocated for discussion of foreign affairs and foreign policy.  My view is now well known.  When I was a Member of another House back in 1986 <Col N="1608" /> I tried to establish a foreign affairs committee and have continued the effort in this House.  Might I say this; it is an insult to the intelligence of elected Members to be asked to stand up and speak for 10 minutes on even the issues that are listed in this speech.</P>
    <P>The case for a foreign affairs committee I cannot make now because I am confined to 10 minutes.  I want, however, to say this.  This speech that I have heard from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Collins, makes reference to a great number of areas, ranging from disarmament and global peace and harmony to overseas development aid.  The fact of the matter is that in every other parliamentary assembly in Europe, of which we are a part there are institutional arrangements for discussing foreign policy.  This speech invites us to be enthusiastic Europeans at one point, and one way we could be Europeans was by having an equivalence of institutional arrangements for discussing foreign policy.  We are uniquely deprived in that regard, set apart by deep suspicion of elected people, to the point of depriving such people of a foreign affairs committee.</P>
    <P>Let us not go through it all again, but a foreign affairs committee, for example, was to provide transparency, it was to provide an accountability to the public in terms of the great issues on which the public have expressed concern, for example, that they are far ahead of the Minister and his party and his colleagues in Government on the issue of overseas development aid.  All the surveys show that there is a mandate in this country for attempting to get back on course for the achievement of the United Nations target figure.  Yet this is not happening.</P>
    <P>Quite honestly, when one strips away all the Gothic paint and colour from these kind of speeches, what one is left with is not something very substantial.  The truth is, if we want to be doing something courageous, the most courageous and responsible thing we could do would be, first of all, internally, facilitating mechanisms for the discussion of foreign affairs and foreign policy and then, in relation <Col N="1609" /> to that policy itself, beginning at the humanitarian end of it, putting ourselves back on course for at some stage, attempting to achieve the United Nations target.</P>
    <P>There is another sense as well of course, not only for the rights of Parliamentarians and not only to involve the public in dialogue but in terms of public education and in terms of a number of other things, in which it is very important to link public sentiment with parliamentary expression and policy.</P>
    <P>I will summarise what I have to say in this regard by saying that what we have continuing is a high level of unaccountable diplomatic professionalism instead of accountable foreign policy.  I continue to pay tribute to the professionals who work in our diplomatic service.  They are dedicated people.  With the greatest respect in the world, however, it is the whole history of foreign relations, and in the theory and practice of it, that diplomatic professionalism can never be a substitute for accountable foreign policy &mdash; and what we have had is unaccountable diplomatic professionalism standing in as a block to publicly accountable foreign policy, and inadequate debate about that foreign policy.  We are regarded regularly as lesser people.  We are excluded from the debate and I, as a foreign affairs spokesperson for one of the parties in this House, object against that and will continue to do so.  A foreign affairs committee could have assisted us in this regard.</P>
    <P>There are interesting omissions in the Minister's speech.  I did not find any reference to Africa and I find this extraordinary.  Some of the most exciting events that will take place in the next 12 months will be undoubtedly changes in Africa at a general level, certainly in relation to southern Africa.  It is to the credit of the Government that they have had a strong line in relation to sanctions, but perhaps the most significant policy event of this last period was the visit of Nelson Mandela to this House and his gratitude to the Irish Government for <Col N="1610" /> maintaining the case for keeping sanctions in place.</P>
    <P>Of those matters which are mentioned in the speech itself, I am afraid I find the reference to the Single Market entirely unsatisfactory.  As Chairman of the Social Environmental Miscellaneous Matters Sub-committee of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on a Secondary Legislation, which is a kind of an Irish mouthful&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Barry has made the case for a more felicitious title to this body.  I might say that on the one occasion that I have been in Brussels I was seriously embarrassed by the views which, for example, our sub-committee put forward and which were accepted by all parties in this House in relation to the co-terminus nature of the social dimension to the Community, very particularly, the Social Action Programme and the Social Charter and the completion of the Internal Market.  In fact, the debate at European and Irish level has been interesting because it has been on the dimensions of time and space with the Federation of Irish Employers arguing that, for example, to use a really dreadful phrase, the playing pitch had to be levelled first in relation to European competition, and then after that that one could consider matters in relation to the social charter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say to the Minister very directly that the dialogue with the Irish people that gave a mandate for the new integrated Europe put the social charter and the completion of the internal market as co-terminus events.  There was no suggestion that the Social Charter or the Social Action Programme could be consigned to the level of residual social policy, if economic moves and economic integration had not taken place.  It is actually a breach of that mandate with the people if there is any erosion of the Social Charter.  I have to say as well that the Irish Government's position in relation to the Social Charter was perceived by the Commissioner in charge as <Col N="1611" /> being a half step back from the position that was taken by Mrs. Thatcher.</P>
    <P>There is reference here to the whole question of European political co-operation. In relation to that, many people in this country are very worried about the unaccountable way in which negotiations for the next phase of European union are now being conducted without adequate debate in this House.  I have to say this, that at my age, I simply cannot accept statements from the Taoiseach, more or less descriptions of his latest phase of feeling Presidential, in this House, as a substitute for debate.  Statements are not an adequate substitute for debate, and there has been no debate of an adequate kind on European political union.  There are many issues raised by it.  I would go much further and say that the implications of German unification have never being adequately debated in this House. They have been referred to.  There are very serious matters involved there, not only in relation to the whole question of a united Germany within NATO but also in relation to the whole economic structure of Europe.  There was, in addition to that, the question of Germany's decision to go ahead with unification virtually excluding discussion by the European Community with Chancellor Kohl rather arrogantly telling the Irish Presidency that they would be informed of developments, more or less saying he will write them a letter to tell them how it is getting on.  That is the involvement we have had.  We have not discussed these things.</P>
    <P>I might say that I agree with other people as well in relation to some of the other points that are raised.  I do not know what this rather exotic reference to the Battle of the Boyne is at the end of the speech.  I certainly would have welcomed a few other things.  I would have liked to see some references to the Irish foreign policy attitude in relation to the great issues of aid, trade and debt. There is a reference at the beginning of the speech to that, but where does Ireland stand in relation to the continuing and deepening indebtedness of the countries <Col N="1612" /> to the south of the world?  Where does Ireland stand in relation to the re-negotiation of market shares?  What has happened the legacy of the Brandt report? Then in relation to the other question of international debt institutions, what is our policy on that?</P>
    <P>I am sorry to say &mdash; and I say it with no disrespect to the Minister whom I praise for what he has done; I join with Deputy Barry in hoping that Brian Keenan will be released, and there are a number of practical things for which I can congratulate the Minister &mdash; but I have to conclude by saying, that I think we are drifting along in an atmosphere in which there are no opportunities, no institutional arrangements and very little evidence of real thinking on the fundamentals of foreign policy and even aid.  That fills me with deep regret.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Estimates before us, it is clear that Ireland's commitment to Third World development is a disgrace. The allocation for bilateral and other aid of just £10.25 million is the equivalent of offering a half penny to each of the estimated two billion people living in dire poverty in the developing world.  The Minister may claim that the allocation is 13 per cent up on last years figure.  That is true, but last year's allocation of £9.1 million represented a shameful low, compared with a figure of £14.5 million in 1987.  Furthermore, within this year's allocation there is a new category of aid for eastern Europe, with a total of £650,000 allocated for Hungary and Poland.  When this is deducted and inflation is taken into account, there is effectively no real increase on last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is totally dishonest for the Government to attempt to pass off moneys allocated for the situation which has arisen in Eastern Europe as part of their contribution to tackling the endemic and chronic problems of poverty, starvation and under-development in the Third World.  The facts are that Ireland's contribution to overseas development is currently down to the level of around 0.18 per cent of our gross national product, or just one-quarter of the modest target <Col N="1613" /> figure set by the UN.  This figure has shown a steady overall decline under both the current Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Coalition and the previous Fianna Fáil administration.  This situation is particularly reprehensible when one considers that Ireland is benefiting financially from its contacts with developing countries.  Statistics available for 1987 show that Irish semi-State companies alone earned consultancy fees and technical assistance contracts worth £86 million. Figures for the private sector are not available, but are probably of the same order.  In other words Ireland is a net beneficiary of its contacts with some of the world's poorest countries, a reprehensible situation which this year's Estimates does nothing to rectify.  The consistent support shown by the Irish public for the plight of people in the Third World, whether through events like &ldquo;Live Aid&rdquo; or the regular collections and activities by agencies such as Trócaire, Concern, Goal and Oxfam, is not being matched by the Government.</P>
    <P>Last May a survey published by the Advisory Council on Development Co-Operation showed 91 per cent of respondents saying Ireland has a responsibility to the people of the Third World.  The Government should alter their pennypinching policies and move progressively towards the modest UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP for development aid over the next five years.</P>
    <P>Turning to foreign policy, it is particularly disappointing that the Government sought to downplay Ireland's neutrality to such an unprecedented extent during the recent Irish Presidency of the European Council.  Implications by the Taoiseach that neutrality is somehow redundant miss the point that it is military blocs and the dizzying array of nuclear weaponry which are redundant in the new Europe.  The Government should push for a demilitarised Europe, and take up the proposal of new Czechoslovak President, Vaclav Havel, in his call for a single European security system to replace the Warsaw Pact and NATO.  We should actively seek to have Austria's application for Community membership taken <Col N="1614" /> off the shelf.  The Austrian application has been pending for over one year now. It seems that Ireland should be anxious to obtain Austrian entry to the Community as quickly as possible to strengthen those forces which are committed to a non-militarist policy for Europe.</P>
    <P>Indeed Ireland should promote greater co-operation between all the neutral and non-aligned states on the Continent.  That could best be done through a strengthening and expansion of the CSCE process, as an alternative to the &ldquo;political&rdquo; role which is now being promoted for NATO.  The CSCE is already an all-European structure and is committed to the process of easing tension and promoting co-operation.  In addition it provides the framework for bringing the United States and Canada into the debate on how European security should develop in future.</P>
    <P>It is also regrettable that the tradition that either the Prime Minister or Foreign Minister of the country holding the EC Presidency should arrange a formal visit to the Soviet Union, which has been in place since President Gorbachev came to power there, was broken for the first time under the Irish Presidency.  Our foreign policy must be more clearly committed to ensuring we play a full and meaningful role at European and international level.</P>
    <P>To develop on the Taoiseach's recent comment &ldquo;who have we to be neutral against&rdquo; I would ask the question &ldquo;who have we to be armed against?&rdquo; Whether we adopt Mikhail Gorbachev's call for a &ldquo;common European home&rdquo; or George Bush's slogan of a &ldquo;Europe whole and free&rdquo;.  Ireland as a neutral country must grasp the unique opportunity to lead the battle to, once and for all, rid the Continent of the military bloc mentality.</P>
    <P>I was very surprised, therefore, to read reports in this morning's papers, attributed to the Taoiseach in his address to the European Parliament on Wednesday, that NATO would remain the &ldquo;proper framework&rdquo; for defence questions. While he may have been in part referring to the old issue of whether military matters should be discussed at EC level, there is a need now to urgently look beyond <Col N="1615" /> the old ground rules and promote discussion on security in an all-European context.</P>
    <P>While the Government's efforts to ensure maintenance of economic sanctions against South Africa, at least in the short term, is to be welcomed, the low level of initiatives on other areas of international concern, such as the Palestine and Middle East issue, is to be regretted. Indeed the situation pertaining to the possible release of Irish hostage, Brian Keenan &mdash; I would like to join with colleagues in hoping Mr. Keenan will soon be released &mdash; draws particular attention to Israeli policy in the area.  Israeli raids into south Lebanon, resulting in the deaths of a large number of people, seem to have been deliberately designed to frustrate efforts to win release of both Keenan and the other hostages.  It is very interesting indeed that the last such Israeli raids, in April, occurred just a fews days before US hostage, Robert Polhill, was released by his captors.  It would appear that Israel is unhappy to see progress towards a resolution of the hostages crisis.  Every release of a hostage by the Hezbollah or other group in Lebanon draws increased attention to the Israeli policy of holding hundreds of Palestinians without trial in south Lebanon.  The conditions and treatment of prisoners in the notorious Khiyan prison in Israeli-controlled Lebanon should be raised more forcibly by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  To all intents and purposes these prisoners &mdash; many held for years without trial &mdash; are no different from the hostages in Beirut.</P>
    <P>I would be interested to hear a response from the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the proposal by Deputy Proinsias de Rossa for monitoring by EC states of human rights violations in the Israeli occupied territories.  The European Parliament last month also proposed an international commission to investigate the situation in the occupied territories and raised the question of UN peace-keeping troops in the region. These are among the specific issues which <Col N="1616" /> should be taken up urgently by the Government.</P>

      <P>I share with the Deputy a sense of frustration that no opportunity has been provided by the Whips to have a longer debate on this matter.  I hope an offer I made in this House some time ago when these questions were being discussed will be taken up &mdash; and I would repeat that offer now &mdash; that the Minister of State or I will be prepared to come into this House whenever arrangements can be made by the Whips for discussions on any issue relating to foreign policy matters.  I think that would be more than adequate to meet any situation that would be envisaged.</P>
      <P>Briefly I want to thank the Members for their comments.  In particular I appreciate what Deputy Barry said with regard to the hostage, Brian Keenan.  I have been very deliberately silent, and very wisely and sensibly so, on this matter in recent days.  I do not propose to go into detail on this issue except to say that we all hope that he and all the other hostages will be released safely and speedily.  I would also say to Deputy Barry that I too have a very strong commitment to work as best I can for the release of all hostages.  There will be a sadness and a happiness with regard to any release that might take place &mdash; happiness for one or two families at the most and sadness for others whose near and dear ones are still in captivity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1617" /> With regard to Cambodia, I have stated in this House on a number of occasions that we find the present position with regard to the seating of the Cambodian delegation in the Untied Nations highly unsatisfactory, and that continues to be my position.  Negotiations on a settlement of this tragic conflict are still under way with a view to obtaining a comprehensive, peaceful and just settlement of the problem.  As the House knows, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council are involved in the process and I do not want to anticipate the results.  I hope, as I said in this Chamber on 9 May, a supreme national council, representative of the Cambodian people as a whole, can nominate a delegation to the United Nations. If this is not possible before the General Assembly meets in September, I will support a position whereby the Cambodian seat is left temporarily vacant.  I have said that not only in this House but in other fora dealing with European political co-operation, and I have convinced quite a number of my colleagues in the Twelve in this regard.  I will form part of a troika to meet the ASEAN group, who, as Deputies know, are very active in this area, at the end of July or in the first few days of August in Jakarta where we will have further discussions, together with the Australians and the Japanese who are also very much involved.  I will use whatever influence I have there to try to gain support for that position.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry referred to the parliamentary delegation that went to Iran, but neither I nor my office was involved in this in any way.  I understand that one Member from this House, one Member from the Seanad and one Member from the European Parliament were invited by the Iranian authorities to go there.  As I said I was not involved, but if delegations from the parliament were to go to Iran my wish would be that it should comprise an all-party delegation. I think we would all agree on that.  That is as much as I know about that visit at this time.</P>
    <P>On the question of German unification, members of this House and <Col N="1618" /> everybody else recognise that German unity is a matter for the German people within the framework of the two plus four arrangements.  The integration of the former GDR territory into the European Communtiy is the subject of full negotiations within the Community.  Very shortly &mdash; I think it will be at our meeting of the General Affairs Council on Monday and Tuesday of next week &mdash; we will have a report from the Commission on the effects of German unification on the Community.  That will be the start of the first public discussion on the subject. There will be a great deal of discussion on it within Europe as a whole because it is not going to be an easy matter to resolve.  Deputy Barry said, and rightly so, that German unification will have a cost&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Everybody recognises that there has to be a cost, it would be unwise to think otherwise, but then one asks the next question: what cost do you put on the principle of unification? Are we to run from the unification concept, to which we aspire so strongly ourselves, because it involves a cost?  There is a cost in everything.</P>

We will have plenty of time to have a debate on it because, as the Deputy knows the intergovernmental <Col N="1619" /> conference, that has been agreed, to discuss this issue will not get under way until December, and it is then that discussion on what people mean with regard to Europe takes place.  That is when it will start, not when it will conclude.  There is plenty of time for a debate.  I would ask the Deputy to be a little patient because he will have plenty of time to be heard, and I have no doubt we will all welcome the Deputy's contribution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 11 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>A study of the means assessment criteria for eligibility for higher education grants was carried out by an inter-departmental group and a number of recommendations were made about changes in the present system.  As the issue of means testing is very complex and affects a number of Government Departments and agencies I have asked the review group to examine the question further in the context of its relevance to other Departments/agencies and with regard to the desirability of seeking to standardise means testing arrangements across the public service generally.</P>
      <P>Quite apart from this work my Department review the higher education grants scheme on an annual basis in the light of their experience of its operation and problems that emerge.  I am aware of the difficulties facing some parents with more than one child at third level education and this is a matter which is under consideration at present.</P>
      <P>I wish to point out that despite the past few years of severe financial constraints I have increased the income eligibility limits and rates of maintenance grant payable in line with the increase in the CPI.  I have also increased the fee grant in line with increases in tuition fee charges. Moreover, I would also point out that the percentage of students receiving grant assistance in the 1989-90 academic year was over 50 per cent compared with under 47 per cent in 1986-87.</P>
      <P>In addition to these improvements I can assure the Deputies that it has been my objective to ensure that the higher education grants scheme is as equitable as possible and that decisions about grant eligibility are based on objective criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that as long ago as November 1989 she <Col N="1622" /> told this House that she had under consideration proposals for an inter-departmental group?  However, almost eight months later she has taken no decision on that proposal.  May I ask the Minister if the Departments to which she has now referred this report back for further consideration were already represented on the group who drew up the initial recommendations? Does she not agree that referring the report back to the people who prepared it is simply a delaying tactic?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will tell the Deputy why the report was referred back to them.  While the conclusions were reached by a professional body of people who carried out the work to the best of their ability it emerged from a study of the report that there would be different ways of looking at the eligibility of people under various public sector activities, for example, the Department of Social Welfare, the Department of Education in relation to the higher education grants scheme and the Revenue Commissioners for other reasons.</P>
      <P>It emerged that there were going to be across-the-board disparities on how eligibility for various entitlements would be deduced.  These anomalies could give rise to very many complex issues and perhaps to cases of litigation.  On this basis I asked the group to consider their original proposals in more depth as a matter of urgency.  There is much proper questioning and debate about who gets what grant &mdash; particularly as £27.2 million of public money will go into the scheme this year &mdash; and many people have expressed reservations about various sectors who appear to get more than anybody else.  The PAYE sector, in particular, seem to be discriminated against because their income is naked, so to speak, and very apparent.  I receive representations in my Department every day about the strict criteria the county councils, who act on our instructions, apply to the lifestyles and means of applicants for schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not <Col N="1623" /> agree it is unfair that those in the PAYE sector who are being denied higher education now because this system is unfair to them will have to wait, as it now appears they will, until the Government sort out the means tests everywhere in the public service before that unfairness will be remedied?  Surely the Minister for Education should concern herself with rectifying this wrong in education and not await the solving of every other means testing problem everywhere else in the State sector.</P>

Some people believe the PAYE sector are being discriminated against while at the same time they demand grants for A, B, C and D because they have produced self-assessment tax returns, or chartered accountants' certified returns.  If we do not accept the chartered accountant's return because the life style, make up, etc. of the family is at variance with the eligibility requirement, we will be calling into question matters which have been referred to the Ombudsman&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The problem of early school leaving has been of major concern to my Department for some time.</P>
      <P>In 1987 an inter-departmental committee composed of representatives from my Department and the Department of Labour considered the problems of early school leavers in great detail, and received representations and submissions from a number of groups concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1625" /> The report of the committee was published in January 1988.  The committee recommended a number of measures which were aimed, firstly, at identifying potential unqualified early school leavers with a view to taking preventative action within the school system and, secondly, at the provision of vocational training programmes for young persons who have left the system.  The recommendations of the committee have been implemented by my Department including the provison of the Youthreach programme which is specifically targeted at young people alienated from the normal school system. Progress on the various measures is being closely monitored at both local level and within my Department.</P>
    <P>A recent questionaire sent to all post-primary schools, in the context of provision for disadvantaged pupils, sought information on pupils likely to leave school without any formal educational qualification.  This data will be taken into account in considering the granting of additional resources to disadvantaged schools.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the level of monitoring at present in place will ensure that these measures are targeted properly, and that they are receiving adequate financial support.</P>

In-service courses for teachers have already been held and more will take place shortly.

      <P>The Council of Education Ministers holds one formal meeting during each Presidency.  I chaired the meeting of the Council held on 31 May 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Council adopted (1) a Resolution regarding the integration of children and <Col N="1628" /> young people with disabilities into ordinary systems of education.  Member states in the resolution agreed to intensify, where necessary, their efforts to integrate or encourage integration of pupils and students with disabilities, in all appropriate cases into the ordinary education system within the framework of their respective education policies and taking due account of their respective education systems.  (2) Conclusions on the enhanced treatment of equality of educational opportunity for girls and boys in the initial and in-service training of teachers.  The conclusions reaffirm the commitment of member states to the objective of achieving equality of opportunity for girls and boys in education, recognise the fundamental role which teachers have to play in achieving that objective as well as the importance of the nature and quality of their initial and in-service training.  Actions to be taken at the level of both the member states and the Community are set out in the conclusions. (3)  Conclusions on regular meetings of senior officials in the education sector aimed at improving mutual understanding of the various educational systems in the Community as well as the discussion of policy issues and problems which are of common concern to member states with a view to improving the quality of educational systems in the Community. (4) Conclusions which will allow work to commence on the preparation of the draft of a new convention relating to the operation of the European schools. The new convention should be finalised by an intergovernmental conference at ministerial level to be held before the end of 1991 and opened for signature, with subsequent ratification by member states in conformity with their respective constitutional rules.</P>
    <P>In addition, Ministers had a wide ranging exchange of views on distance education and training and education for enterprise on the basis of papers on these topics prepared by the Presidency.  On distance education and training, the Council and the Ministers expressed the wish that their comments be taken into <Col N="1629" /> account by the Commission when preparing the communication which it intends to submit to the Council at the end of the year.  On education for enterprise, the Commission was requested to take account of the suggestions made as regards any possible action in this area at Community level.</P>
    <P>In the lead up to the formal meeting of Education Ministers I had a series of bilateral meetings with a number of my EC colleagues and my Eastern European colleagues.  On 21 March 1990 I addressed the Parliament Commission on Education in Brussels.</P>

    <P>I am also pleased to say that my Italian colleague, Professor Mattarella, will be in Dublin next week to continue the very successful series of bilateral meetings and to develop the initiatives taken during the Irish Presidency.</P>

      <P>The immediacy of the six months was that it hastened the regard and importance of the role of education within European affairs.  As the Deputy knows, under the Treaty of Rome there is no specific competency and, perhaps in the discussions which will start next December, that measure will be looked at.  In time the conclusions regarding integration and equality will benefit students at first and second level.</P>
      <P>The Lingua programme which I did not mention in my reply but which we also discussed, has now been set up and will start in January.  Other measures, such as COMET, ERASMUS, FORCE and TEMPUS &mdash; the Eastern European programme &mdash; will also benefit third level students.  I am satisfied that we advanced the cause of education during our six months' Presidency.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that any formal co-operation arrangments of the type mentioned in the question are in operation.</P>
      <P>The Lingua Programme was adopted by European Education Ministers in May 1989 and it is designed to promote foreign language competence in the European Community.  The language covered by the programme are the nine official languages of the Community as well as Irish and Luxembourgish.  The latter two languages were included on the basis that they are national languages of the two member states concerned.  Financial aid is not available under the Lingua Programme for the promotion of languages which have the status of regional languages in a European Community context and, accordingly, funding would not be available for joint projects involving areas outside the European Community nor, it appears, for any such projects involving Scots Gaelic.</P>
      <P>Financial aid could be available under the Lingua Programme for teachers, students and pupils who could be deemed to be teaching or learning Irish as a foreign language to enable them to spend a period of time in this country on in-service training, study or exchange as appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

Will she agree that, in the light of the increasing internationalisation of society in Ireland, if we wish to make Irish relevant in the eyes of students, one way of doing it would be to show that it is a key to other cultures apart from our own, and in this case the culture of Scotland and the culture of Nova Scotia?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said to Deputy Bruton and Deputy Browne, there is merit in looking at it.  With regard to the status of Irish and the Deputy's concern that students are taking Irish because they are compelled to do so, the primary curriculum review just issued made very relevant points about how Irish should be much more attractively taught.  The junior certificate courses for Irish now are broader, more open and not as tied to text and poems which might seem difficult and complex to young people. <Col N="1636" /> Strides are being made within the curriculum. That is the way forward.  The point of the seven questions here is one I will ask the Lingua Committee to look at.</P>

      <P>I have recently received a request from the inner-city teachers' group to meet me to discuss the survey.  The letter was dated 26 June and I received it within the last two weeks.  I have indicated in reply that I will be happy to meet them and have asked my office to make arrangements for the meeting.</P>
      <P>The Government's programme of special schemes for national schools serving disadvantaged areas has enabled assistance to be given to many schools in the Dublin inner city.  These measures include the appointment of additional teachers and the provision of financial assistance for the purchase of books and equipment, the promotion of homeschool liaison, special in-service training for teachers, the relief of school debts, the printing and issuing of materials, purchase of computers for certain schools and the provision of finance for equipment for pre-school facilities for travellers' children.</P>
      <P>This year the fund available for the scheme of financial assistance for disadvantaged schools in general has been trebled to £1.5 million.  I will shortly be in a position to announce a comprehensive package of initiatives for schools serving disadvantaged areas which will come into operation in September.</P>

The comments the Deputy is giving are from some newspaper and I know nothing about the children referred to, but children of their very nature will always feel a little like that about school.  The teachers are very professional and do a very good job in these inner city schools.  For many young people education is the channel through <Col N="1638" /> which they are hoping to better themselves and have a better life.  Often the ills of society in general are brought into the classroom, and the teacher must cope with that as well as everything else.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 10, 66, 70, 72, 75, 92 and 97 together.</P>
      <P>In-service training of teachers at second level has always been a permanent and integral part of my Department's educational provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am fully aware of the importance of in-service training for the quality of the education service we provide in our schools.  It was for this reason that I have <Col N="1641" /> in recent years, despite severe resource constraints, devoted substantially increased resources to inservice training. For example, the provision for post-primary inservice training in 1987 was of the order of £250,000 compared with a provision of £750,000 this year.  That represents an increase of 200 per cent.</P>
    <P>In this context, substantial resources have been devoted to in-service training relating to the introduction of the new junior certificate.  I have indicated that I am setting aside two to three days in each school year over a three year period to enable all teachers of the new syllabuses to avail themselves of in-service training related to the teaching of the new programme. Three in-service days have already been held at regional locations.</P>
    <P>In tandem with the special provision for junior certificate syllabuses, it has been possible to continue the ongoing regular programme of inservice courses.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from all this, I am at present giving consideration to future in-service needs.  At my request, officials of my Department have had discussions with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment about the scope and form of a major review of in-service training. I would expect that concrete proposals for such a review will be submitted for my approval in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for a comprehensive reply.  Rapid changes have taken place.  Many teachers do not avail of the training course that is available. It should be compulsory at junior cycle as we have a lot of older teachers who are not abreast of the changes that have taken place and thus the children are not getting a fair opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important subject.  We should ensure that there are not teachers in employment who are incapable of doing the job.  Would the Minister consider making this course compulsory?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that the Deputy's question is well intentioned but in fact these courses are compulsory at junior certificate level.  They are run during the term and days are given from school days.  All the teachers participate in them.  The Deputy's wish is already being met in relation to those courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that by international standards, notwithstanding this one off measure with regard to the junior certificate, our financial commitment to in-service education for teachers is and has been one of the lowest in Europe, under successive Governments?  Will the Minister accept in this context that we might consider looking for European Community aid for in-service training for teachers, establishing an in-service educational council so that the different types of in-service course that are being provided by different bodies are properly co-ordinated and time tabled, and making provision for in-service training for principals including the newly appointed lay principles to many secondary schools who need training in management as distinct from training in education?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>At the European meeting about which I spoke in the reply, I suggested that a portion of the European Social Fund should be given to in-service courses for teachers.  That suggestion was agreeably received by the Council of Ministers.  It has now gone to Commissioner Papandreu for her consideration and implementation.  I asked the NCCA to carry out a major review last April because I was not happy that the content and the range of course which we were providing would fit the bill in <Col N="1643" /> today's terms and I wanted to ensure that we got value for our money.  The proposals they come up with could well embody an inservice council.  I will have a report from them.  With regard to the question relating to principals I asked my colleague, Deputy Bertie Ahern, to consider having the IMI and the Department of Education jointly run a course for principals.  I was thinking particularly about principals on boards of management of primary schools because the boards of management fall due to be reappointed in October.  I have suggested that he and I should consider jointly running management courses, as distinct from in-service teaching courses.  I should like to tell the Deputy that the amount of money has been increased by 200 per cent but I accept that it is not at the level of other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the amount of money the Minister suggested was spent in the last financial year, how much of it was for the payment of substitutes for the teachers who were absent?  Will the Minister agree that the very heavy restrictions on management in the day-to-day running of schools as a result of the cutbacks are due an overhaul?  Will the Minister agree that vice-principals should be given the opportunity to spend the same amount of time as they formerly spent in management rather than in teaching?  Will the Minister agree that career guidance teachers should be restored to the positions they held when they were not counted within the quota as teachers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that this has reduced the effectiveness and efficiency of schools and that in-service training will not be effective unless the structures within the schools can function?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 16, 23, 29, 30, 42 and 68 together.</P>
      <P>As agreed already with the Central Review Committee under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> the Government are implementing a reduction of 1 unit in the enrolmentstaffing schedule for national schools to be effective from 1 September, 1990.  This reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio will result in an increase of approximately 500 in the number of authorised teaching posts over the number that would have been warranted had the reduction not been approved.</P>
      <P>Under existing arrangements negotiated under the auspices of the Central Review Committee, school authorities, in particular the principal teacher, are responsible for arranging the organisation of the day.</P>
      <P>Under the same arrangement the number of teachers is compiled from 30 September the previous year.  I have recently doubled the total allocation of concessionary teachers to schools serving disadvantaged areas.  During the 1989-90 school year I allocated an additional 30 remedial posts to schools which brings the total number of remedial teaching posts in primary schools to 887.</P>
      <P>A continuing review of the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level is taking place in consultation with the Central Review Committee with regard to the feasiblity of a further reduction under a new <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> The Primary Education Review Body who are due to submit their report shortly have also been examining this issue and their recommendations in the matter will be considered as soon as they are available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Will the 500 jobs be created in the future? They are due on 1 September 1990 and may I take it that in September there will be 500 new jobs waiting for teachers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>No, there are 250 new teaching jobs and there are 250 which the decreased ratio will allow in the schools and together they add up to 500.  I regret that there was a misinterpretation of what I said &mdash; not in my script but in the way it was taken up &mdash; in the course of the Seanad debate.  That may have given rise to the Deputy's question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> In view of the fact that we have exported £60 million worth of teachers, if one is to take the cost of their training into consideration, and that they are being encouraged to go to England, will the Minister consider putting weight into the negotiations on a new national agreement and seeking a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio.  Thankfully, the Department have moved on from the stage of thinking that there were only retarded teachers.  At one time the Department felt that every child in a class was of the same standard and, thankfully, that attitude has changed.  For the sake of the children the sooner the Minister can use the teachers who have been trained at great expense here for the benefit of our children the better.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that the further improvement to which she referred will bring the pupil-teacher ratio back to the level that obtained when she took office, despite all she said in her four years in Opposition about the need for improvements on that level?  Will the Minister agree that there are many children &mdash; I speak from almost personal experience &mdash; being taught in classes of 40, 41 and 42 children?  I am referring to junior classes where it is literally impossible for a teacher, without risk of a nervous breakdown, to communicated with all the children in such a class and fulfil the requirements of the curriculum.  Will the Minister agree that there is a need to <Col N="1647" /> deal with this matter in time for the next academic year and that it should not become an issue that will be given as a concession at the last minute to but union support for a new programme for national recovery?  We cannot wait for that to happen; we need the improvements implemented in the next academic year.</P>

Bearing in mind that there will be an increase in the number of teachers, will the Minister accept that that will not help the rural schools who do not have the services of remedial teachers?  Does the Minister <Col N="1648" /> propose to take any action which will alleviate the position of the small number of students who are attending rural schools where no remedial service is available?  Those children are at a serious disadvantage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>We are seeking, where there is an arrangement for new appointments, to give some to rural schools and to join rural schools together for the purposes of the services of a remedial teacher.  The idea is that three or four schools in one location should be joined together for the services of such a teacher and that the teacher be paid accordingly.  While, correctly, there is great emphasis on the deprivation in cities and towns people tend to forget that there is deprivation of a different type, but equally searing, in small rural communities who do not have access to such facilities as libraries and so on which town children have.</P>

      <P>The reduction to be implemented in September, although welcome, will not lead to the provision of remedial teachers in the 2,000 schools which do not have them.  Furthermore, it has been predicted that the number of pupils entering primary school will fall by 10,000 each year in the foreseeable future. This should result in the release of resources which would enable the Minister to improve the position far more.</P>

      <P>My Department, in conjunction with the Irish National Teachers Organisation, management bodies and the National Parents Council are involved in discussions which it is hoped will lead to agreed procedural guidelines, that will be of assistance to teachers for dealing with allegations or suspicions of child abuse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Either the incidence of child abuse is on the increase or more cases are being reported, but I find it horrifying that there will be no extension of the pilot schemes for three years.  Children who have been sexually abused end up scarred and in need of ongoing psychological care.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to reconsider her decision to review the schools psychological service after three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The question relates to child abuse.  It also asks if all Bachelor of Education and special education courses will include a module dealing with the issues involved in child abuse and if I would make a statement on the matter.  Deputy Ryan has asked if, in conjunction with the Irish National Teachers Organisation and management bodies, I will draw up guidelines.  The Deputy has extended the scope of the question in asking about the schools, psychological service.  I have already explained that the professionals have agreed that the scheme should be run on a pilot basis for three years.  In relation to the guidelines, I have examined the background and it seems a number of legal issues are involved which have been raised by the various parties to the discussions, the management, teachers and <Col N="1651" /> parents.  Given the need to maintain professional credibility, ethics and confidentiality it is not as easy as it may appear to issue guidelines to be followed in dealing with suspected cases of child abuse.  This is a very serious issue and society demands that schools take care of it.  Many children will only find salvation in schools.  I hope these discussions will lead to the issuing of proper guidelines but we have to be careful in dealing with this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree with me when I say it must be very difficult for teachers to identify the signs in a class of 40 or 41 children.  Would she not agree that if guidelines are to be issued it is crucially important that teachers are provided with inservice training to enable them deal with this issue?  Teachers will not take the serious decision to report a case of suspected child abuse, given that they may be open to legal action, unless they are satisfied they have full legal backing and have received very competent training to enable them to make the necessary judgments. Would the Minister not agree that it would be far better if the schools took no action than did the job badly and if they are to take any responsibility in the matter they should do so on the basis of adequate inservice training and logistical and legal back-up for the teacher concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  This is a serious issue, in particular for the child.  Therefore there is a need to protect everybody's rights.  We are finding it very difficult to clear everyone's legal rights in the guidelines to be issued.  Last year, the teaching centres agreed in principle to run courses but decided not to pursue this matter until the procedures had been agreed.  The presidents of the colleges of education requested that they be given copies of the guidelines and procedures once they had been agreed, to be included as a module in teacher training courses.  We have to work out a proper <Col N="1652" /> basis for the guidelines and I hope we can reach agreement on them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mrs. O'Shea Mrs. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The schools psychological service should have a major input in any guidelines on child sexual abuse. Unfortunately, this is not the case at present.  We are not fully aware of the extent of the problem and there is an obvious need therefore to issue guidelines. The schools psychological service should be involved.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Deputy is correct but that is not the answer, which is the issuing of clear guidelines.  All parties need to be protected.  Happily, the question of child sexual abuse is now being brought into the open.  I am quite sure that there has always been child sexual abuse but, unhappily for the child, this issue was not brought out into the open.  We need to address the issue but, as has been said, we need to address it in the correct way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The present arrangements for the payment of substitute teachers were introduced in 1984 following discussions with the teachers' organisation and the managerial authorities and with the agreement of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare.  Under these arrangements the chairperson of a board of management, who employ a substitute teacher, claims a grant from the Department in respect of the pay of the substitute. Payment of the grant is made by the Department immediately the claim form is received, provided the claim is in order.  I am satisfied that my Department are not responsible for any delays that <Col N="1653" /> may occur in the operation of the present system.</P>
      <P>In consultation with the various interests involved, my Department have been examining the question of improving the existing system for the payment of qualified substitute teachers.  Currently detailed discussions are in progress with a view to introducing revised payment arrangements for the next school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister telling us that her Department are not responsible for the long delays in the payment of substitute teachers and that the responsible bodies in this case are the boards of management and, if so, would she issue a circular letter to them as many people have had to endure a great deal of hardship for some time because of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied my Department are not responsible for the delays.  This was admitted in the Seanad by teachers' leaders when it discussed a motion on substitute teachers.  My colleague, Deputy Fahey, took part in that debate.  The teachers' leaders were quite fair and admitted that responsibility for the delays did not rest with the Department of Education and that payment was made within two to five days of an application being made to the Department which by any standards is a very quick response.</P>
      <P>Clearly, the delays lies with management. When the cheque or substitute payment arrives if the chairperson is away it is not delivered to the teachers.  I will not issue circulars to schools to tell them to pay the cheque they got three months ago because we are going to alter the system and pay the substitute teacher direct.  It will require all the names to be put in a computer, but that is all mechanical work, and it will be done for the next school year.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I accept that the Minister is saying the blame is not with her Department. Speaking from experience, I am doubtful where the blame lays.  Delays do occur. <Col N="1654" /> Of all the people in the teaching profession the teachers who substitute work at present, the modern spailpín fánach, deserve to get their money because they have to travel from one place to another. Perhaps the Minister can simplify a form that would ensure that the chairman of any board of management will have no difficulty sending it in.  That would be a major help if there is some delay on the management side.  From my own experience, I am not prepared to accept that it was always the chairman of the board who was at fault when there was a delay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite prepared to say it, because I have the records to prove it.  If the claim is in order the longest delay in the Department is between two and five days; that is remarkably swift by any standards.  I am not saying that the chairperson deliberately would not pay the substitute teacher, what I am saying is that he may not be there when the cheque arrives.  In the next school year we will pay them directly.  Should there be any mechanical reason the system is not in operation in September, I would consider saying something to chairpersons.</P>
      <P>Perhaps there was a delay in submitting the claims.  The substitutes have to compile the claim and submit it.  Our time span is two to five days between the time we get the claim and the cheque is posted. Then it has to be delivered.  I think the way we are going to handle it, by direct payment is the best way.  Should there be any delay in the direct payment system, we would consider issuing very strong guidelines to chairpersons.</P>

Has the Minister authority to do this in view of the fact that the current system of operating national schools recognise these as independent entities who pay their own teachers in accordance with the law and the Department simply act as an agent for the school?  May I ask of the Minister if she has the legal authority necessary to pay <Col N="1655" /> substitute teachers directly which, is the sensible thing to do?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>May I finish?  I did not interrupt Deputy Barry.  When it was found that it was not possible &mdash; and I will give the evidence to the Deputies if they require it &mdash; to remove completely VAT from hurleys, the Government decided to give a grant in lieu of the amount of money which the GAA said was being paid to the Exchequer for hurleys of approximately £100,000.  On top of the normal grant given to the GAA, which is the largest grant given to any governing body of sport, the Government gave £100,000 last year, and the same amount this year, in order to implement a very successful scheme, which has been applied to helmets as well as to hurleys. I am glad to tell the House that this has had a major impact on lowering the price of hurleys, beginning once more to put hurleys into the hands of young girls and boys at a very reasonable price in comparison with what had obtained.</P>
      <P>I might add that I am aware of and concerned about the factory to which Deputy Peter Barry referred and the difficulties they are experiencing.  We are prepared to make every effort, together with the GAA, to ensure the manufacture of hurleys in this factory, if that is what the GAA wish.</P>

Would the Minister agree that, in fairness, the campaign launched when he was in Opposition &mdash; when his party supported that campaign vehemently &mdash; was for the removal of VAT from all hurleys; the removal of VAT from hurleys for juveniles would be of no significance?  The campaign was for the removal of VAT from all hurleys, just like VAT on motor cars.  I spoke in the Seanad in favour of the removal of VAT on hurleys.  After all it is our national game and we should take a stand on the matter.  We should not pretend that clubs paying up to £6,000 annually on hurleys&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The throughput of persons on the vocational training and opportunities scheme since its inception has been 397.  The participants have availed of a programme which has a predominantly vocational content and which also includes appropriate related academic subjects.  The scheme operates under the aegis of the vocational educaton committees who promote the programme locally in various ways.</P>
      <P>Following discussions with the ICTU, I have decided that a local co-ordinating group should be established at each centre with a promotion/advisory/ evaluation role in relation to the scheme.  The group will contain representation from the VECs, local employment exchanges, the local ICTU unemployed centres and local FÁS offices.</P>
      <P>I intend to expand the scheme significantly from September 1990, by increasing the number of places from the current level of 260 to in excess of 600 places.  There are 13 centres where the scheme is currently in operation and an additional 20-25 centres will be announced in time for September next.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply is encouraging to a certain extent because, as she said, the numbers involved in this widely promoted scheme &mdash; which we were led to believe would <Col N="1663" /> lead to thousands of unemployed people availing of second level education &mdash; have been pitiful &mdash; 397 only.</P>

      <P>I note the Minister proposes to increase that number to 600, which is encouraging.  Nonetheless that is still a pitiful number bearing in mind the 230,000 people unemployed.  It would appear the Minister does not envisage this scheme reaching the unemployed in any meaningful way which we understood to be the intention.  Could the promotional scheme be expanded somewhat &mdash; I think she mentioned something in the region of 60 centres &mdash; to all areas in which people sign on for unemployment benefit?  Could she ensure that there was some promotional outlet at such centres explaining what is available and encouraging people to participate?  I understand that to be the intention of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Bearing in mind that the scheme began in 1986 with two centres and, from September next hopefully there will be 20 to 25 centres, taking into account the extra 13 this means there will be up to 40 centres, representing a very large increase.  I was concerned that publicity about and promotion of the scheme were not being sufficiently highlighted. Mr. Peter Cassells and ICTU wrote to me and came in to talk to me presenting very common sense ideas about how it could be better promoted to reach more people.  We are implementing those ideas.  Heretofore such information was available at unemployment exchanges only but we are now having it made available in public libraries and all sorts of places.  In other words, we are undertaking an active selling job &mdash; which is what the Deputy was recommending &mdash; with regard to the scheme.  That is the purpose of establishing local groups. Quite rightly the union executive pointed out to me that they are the people who know best where are the people who want to participate in the centres and a avail of further education.  The 20 to 25 centres <Col N="1664" /> operative from September next will be backed up by an aggressive selling drive with regard to the opportunities available.</P>

      <P>That thought has occurred to me.  It will be considered within the context of the aggressive drive we intend undertaking, at least to let people know about it and then to avail of the opportunities.  Certainly the committee could examine that; I suppose its cost would be another matter, but it can be examined.</P>

      <P>I would not have time to read it in ten minutes.  I am very sorry, but I am no Joe Foyle.</P>
      <P>The overall education provision represents an increase of 5.5 per cent and it is now 19 per cent of the total Exchequer provision as compared to 16 per cent in 1986.  Capital expenditure is £65.675 million.  There are some future Vote transfers between Environment and ourselves, which are explained. They are purely procedural.  There is also a revised total sum from the national lottery, which is an increase of over £7 million on the 1989 outturn.  My colleague, Deputy Frank Fahey, will speak about that.</P>
      <P>Vote No. 26 is for the salaries and expenses of departmental staff and for various educational and cultural activities. Again, there is a difference here from the abridged Estimates because the Minister for Finance announced that national lottery funding would be provided for in separate Votes of Departments. There is a breakdown of that £28.513 million under the headings of grants to youth and sports organisations, grants for provision of recreational facilities, grants for major sports facilities, cultural activities and the Irish language. The recreational facilities area is no longer in the Department of Education but are the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Pádraic Flynn.  Deputy Frank Fahey, the Minister for Sport, will speak in more detail about sports facilities.</P>
      <P>Computerisation was brought in in 1989, with stage two in 1990; and there will be a further stage of computerisation in 1991.  When this is completed it will result in computerised office information systems being developed and implemented on a wide scale throughout the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to international activities, we <Col N="1759" /> are involved in the committees for COMMETT, PETRA and LINGUA. The LINGUA programme will be starting next January and was the subject of questions here today which I will put to the committee.</P>
    <P>We have made advances in the Department under the heading of gender equity. We have provided £96,000 to provide continued support for a number of different projects.</P>
    <P>The NCCA was set up in 1987 as an advisory body to the Minister for Education. This year it got an increase of 23 per cent because of the important work they are doing in regard to the Junior Certificate on sample examination papers, the developmental stage of Phase II, the development of overall policy in regard to the senior cycle and the first phase of syllabus revision.</P>
    <P>There are various increases for first level education which we will be able to implement next September and right through the next <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> The disadvantaged fund has been increased from £0.5 million to £1.5 million in 1990.  The distribution of that fund will be announced soon in the schools.</P>
    <P>Capitation grants for primary school pupils have been increased by 5.7 per cent this year on top of an increase of 10.4 per cent last year.  The grants for free books at primary level were increased this year by 20 per cent.  It was 17 per cent last year.  Again, it is not enough; but it is making great strides in the face of a very difficult economic situation that we have been able to give increases of this nature.  The pilot psychological services have been started and will be monitored in the national schools.</P>
    <P>The 1990 allocation for the national school programme will be applied in the first instance to the completion of some 45 building projects which are in the course of construction.  The balance will be applied to school buildings in rural areas which need replacement.</P>
    <P>There are two educational reviews, one by Moya Quinlan and another by Tom Murphy.  There is also the OECD <Col N="1760" /> review.  Already, in anticipation of having the three on board and disseminating them, I have set up a strategic policy planning unit in the Department. We will be outlining our strategies and ordering our priorities when the three reviews come to hand and this will be a major signpost for the years ahead in primary education.</P>
    <P>In regard to the allocation for second level education, nearly 84 per cent of this will be spent on pay and pensions this year.  This is quite right because the system is built on the quality of our teachers.</P>
    <P>Capitation grants for secondary pupils have been increased by £10 per pupil.  I freely admit it is not enough and we hope to again look at that very carefully next year to see what we can do.  The allocation for free books at second level has increased by 23 per cent on top of an increase of 20 per cent last year.  Every year as we approach autumn there is the hype about school books.  Every year, however, since I came into office there has been an increase of 20 per cent on average for both primary and post-primary school books and this in the face of appalling economic circumstances.  I do not, however, want to see it increased to increase profits for booksellers and book companies.  That is not its purpose.  It should be administered carefully and correctly.</P>
    <P>The allocation for adult literacy and community education has been doubled. That is not to count the £2.6 million which is spent on it in other areas.  I refer to the budgetary allocation, which is increased from £0.5 million to £1 million.  The VECs have received extensive guidelines as to how they are to use it.  We will be monitoring that and meeting with them again in September.</P>
    <P>I will be making announcements in regard to the junior certificate programme fairly soon.  Technology was introduced in 62 schools last year in the junior cycle and will be introduced in another 60 schools this year.  I hope to phase the subject into all second level schools on a gradual basis until it is on offer to all schools.</P>

      <Col N="1761" /> The junior certificate programme marks the first phase of curricular reform at second level.  Already the NCCA are tackling the senior cycle curriculum.  I would like to thank that body and all who serve on it, teachers, non-teachers and so on.  They are doing amazing work for Irish education and I am very appreciative of it.  The developments of senior cycle include VPT1 and VPT2.  There is also the leaving certificate vocational training programme which was introduced last year.  So many schools have expressed enthusiasm this year and want to take it up.</P>
    <P>Youthreach, too, was the subject of a question here today.  There is a need to tackle the root of problems and I will certainly take note of what was said on that matter.</P>
    <P>With regard to the post primary school building programme, we are concentrating moneys in three areas: where the relevant school authorities have agreed to the rationalisation; schools in need of accommodation which are the sole providers of educational facilities in their areas; and centres where schools need replacement-extensions to meet long-term projections.</P>
    <P>There has been an 11 per cent increase in the Vote for third level and further education over last year's outturn.  Legislation in relation to the VEC colleges will be introduced in the autumn.  All of the regional colleges and VEC colleges are success stories with so many students seeking to get into them.  Over 85 to 90 per cent of students now in those colleges have their fees completely paid and are in receipt of the new European Social Fund grant.</P>
    <P>There is £116 million in grants to the Higher Education Authority.  We have just appointed the new Authority, which met for the first time on Tuesday last. They have a very good board who will seek to give the best value to the young people who enter that sector.  For the first time EC approval was given for some courses in the HEA sector this year.  As regards the third level programme, funds are being provided from the Structural Fund and from Government funding.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1762" /> Under that programme the regional technical college in Tallaght is well under way.  New buildings are being erected and improvements made to older ones.  In particular we are introducing special programmes which will also allow extra students enter the HEA sector.</P>
    <P>Of all the matters we have been able to put in place last year, the one that gives me the greatest encouragement relates to the admission requirements for third level education.  A phased programme will be initiated this year with the computerisation of the leaving certificate results.  Under this programme the process for young people wishing to enter VEC colleges and higher education colleges will be simplified.  A uniform policy regarding a common points entry system for degree level programmes is currently under consideration by university authorities and VEC colleges.  The National University of Ireland has decided to abolish the matriculation examination from 1993 onwards.  From 1992 onwards, pupils can repeat the leaving certificate as many times as they like, but only one result will be taken into account for entry to third level education.  All of those measures are widely welcomed.  I got great co-operation from VECs, universities and all the officials concerned who realise the need for these changes. As regards the measures which were implemented under the Irish Presidency, I was able to expand on that matter in answer to a question here earlier.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will open my remarks by a quotation which is as follows: &ldquo;Many decisions will have to be taken before long that will have lasting implications for the quality of education in Ireland well into the next century&rdquo;.  That quote is from the present Minister for Education in the Dáil this time last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be judged on her ability to make those decisions.  Over the past year she has not <Col N="1763" /> lived up to her own statement of purpose. For example, no decision has been made on the Colleges Bill, on the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill or on the long-established review of the higher education grants system.  There are still grave injustices, whereby some people are accepted and others are not, on the basis of anomalous interpretations of means.  Despite expressed goodwill on the Minister's part, no decision has been made on the introduction of a comprehensive Education Bill to put what is a 19th century educational system into the 21st century setting.  Indeed, no decisions have been made on any initiatives in the area of the curriculum, with the exception of the introduction of a junior certificate and as is well known, that is an initiative the Minister inherited from her predecessor. Neither has a decision been made on the Primary Curriculum Review Body.</P>
      <P>Indeed, the Minister could well be described as the Minister for reviews.  She referred this year, as she did last year and perhaps the previous year, to the three reviews that are taking place; and now she has announced the setting up of a special unit in her Department to review the reviews.  Any Minister's purpose is not to preside over reviews but to make decisions and to accept the unpopularity, or popularity as the case may be, that comes from making decisions.  I expect the Minister will not be Minister for Education when the decisions have to be made on the various reviews to which she has referred.  She hopes somebody else will have to do the work and that she will have had the opportunity of spending the time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is disappointing, and it represents a disappointment for the Minister in terms of her statement of purpose last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will move to the next part of my speech with another quotation: &ldquo;We cannot contend that we have a good educational system when it continues to <Col N="1764" /> allow out of the primary school system alienated, emotionally disturbed ... or pupils who cannot read or write&rdquo;.  That quotation of 13 June 1986 comes from the then Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Education, Deputy Mary O'Rourke.  On that occasion she said she favoured &ldquo;a more formalised structure of primary schooling at fifth and sixth year&rdquo;.  She said she favoured to some degree a return to the three Rs.  I would be very interested to know the exact progress that has been made in that regard in the three years since the Minister came to office.  I am not talking about asking people to review the matter, talk about it or produce papers on it.  I want to know what has been done in the last three years to reduce the number of pupils leaving our primary schools who are unable to read or write, for whatever reason.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in the same speech: &ldquo;I have been bitterly disappointed at the progress of the transition year&rdquo;.  What further progress has been made in the last three years in regard to the transition year?  None.  The Minister further said she strongly favoured school-based assessments in place of written examinations. I know the Minister will tell me a report has been produced on that matter &mdash; another one of these famous reports &mdash; but has any decision been made or have any changes take place in the schools on foot of the Minister's clearly expressed preference in 1986? Absolutely nothing has been done to implement that measure.</P>
    <P>In the same speech the Minister condemned most strongly the cutbacks in capital at post-primary education level for school building.  She was condemning most vigorously the then Minister for Education, Deputy Cooney, for the fact that he succeeded in spending only £43 million on post-primary school building in 1985.  The Minister is spending only £18 million in 1990 as against the paltry sum, as she saw it at the time, of £43 million in 1986.  The Minister has said that the figure in the Estimates for 1986 for publications in Irish shows a definite lack of commitment but the sum provided <Col N="1765" /> in this year's Estimates for publications in Irish is virtually the same.</P>
    <P>We see here a legacy of disappointment. I will quote from another statement from the Minister in this House on 24 April 1985.  She said: &ldquo;I want to make a very special case here this evening for the replacement of caretakers at primary schools&rdquo;&mdash; in other words, that caretakers should be appointed.  She spoke about vandalism in schools and so on.  The problem remains substantially the same in so far as caretakers are concerned. Admittedly, the decision not to replace them had been taken earlier but the Minister who was then in Opposition led everybody to believe she was going to reverse that decision.</P>

      <P>The position in terms of caretaking in schools is indeed worse than it was at that time.  The Minister said at that time it was almost impossible to contact the principal of a secondary school because of a lack of secretaries. Since the Minister came to office, how much progress has been made in appointing secretaries?  By her own standards &mdash; I have been quoting carefully from what the Minister has said &mdash; in terms of making decisions and commitment to various improvements in education, I would give her a mark of two out of ten.</P>

      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to refer to a number of other <Col N="1766" /> matters.  I am particularly disappointed that the Minister has made no decision on the review on higher education grants. It is quite obvious that people from modest income backgrounds are unable to go to college at present.  If you happen to be from the PAYE sector, you have a very poor chance of going to college.  If you come from the farming sector, you will get a college grant in some countries but not in others, depending on the policy the county manager adopts to your accounts.  The county manager may make a decision that one person is a crook, another is not and on the basis of that decision he decides whether the person is entitled to a grant.  We do not have clearly understood objective criteria for assessing means to determine eligibility for higher education grants.  As a result there is great unfairness and a grave sense of injustice.</P>
      <P>The Minister has had a review on higher education grants on her desk for the past year and, today, a year later, she has announced that she is not going to make a decision on this matter but that she will circulate the report to all the Government Departments so that they can look at it and see whether they can change the criteria and thus somehow get her out of her difficulties.  To my mind, the job of the Minister for Education, in the first place, is education and if there is an injustice in education it is the Minister's job to deal with it.  It is not her job to refer the problem to the Department of Social Welfare, the Department of Health, the Department of Finance and ask them to sort out their problems and then advise her on solving her's.  I think that is not the job of a Minister.  The Minister has had a report and she should have made her decision on the basis of that report, but she has failed to make a decision.  Those failing to get places on higher education courses will regard that as a serious deficiency on her part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, when Minister in a previous administration, accepted the Second Stage of a Bill introduced by a former Deputy, Mr. George Birmingham, to remove the appointment of vocational teachers from the political <Col N="1767" /> arena.

An fáth is mó go bhfuilimid ag vótáil ina choinne ná go gceapaimid nach bhfuil an Meastachán seo agus na seirbhísí atá á gcur ar fáil ag an Roinn Oideachais ag freastal ar an dream a bhfuil bá againn leo, is iad sin na daoine bochta, na daoine atá ar phá íseal, agus mar sin de.</P>
      <P>The total Estimate for the Department of Education is £1,367 million, which is a very considerable amount of money. Rather than deal with the detail of the Estimate, I would like to take an overall view of it in the ten minutes available to me.</P>
      <P>We must ask what this money achieves in terms of educational objectives?  A fundamental objective of Labour Party policy would be equality of access to education that is relevant and proper to the needs of people at all stages in their lives, because we see education as an ongoing process throughout life.  Indeed, the provision for adult education has been in decline over a number of years, particularly in rural areas because the travelling expenses for teachers would not encourage them to go to rural areas where classes had been held previously. This is a matter of grave concern to us because people in rural Ireland are losing out on adult education and, indeed, on second chance education.  Second chance education is very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some weeks ago I raised in the House the fact that the Open University will become available in Ireland from next February and the distance education centre will be accepting applications for four degree courses up to 14 September 1990.  It is anticipated that the first modules will commence in February of next year.  In the United Kingdom, grants are available for unemployed people and others to take part in Open University courses.  When I raised this matter with her, the Minister said that she could not provide anything this year but she would look at the possibility of doing so next year.  Second chance education can help people to escape from the poverty trap <Col N="1770" /> and can help them towards achieving their full potential as individuals, which we in the Labour Party are very concerned about developing.</P>
    <P>If we start at first level education and look at the statistics of the numbers retiring from national school teaching we see that since 1979 the number of teachers who retire at the compulsory age, 65, has decreased from 65 per cent of all those retiring to 28 per cent last year.  At the same time the number of teachers who have retired on the grounds of disability has increased from 5.8 per cent in 1979 to 20.3 per cent of all teachers retiring last year.  I believe those statistics give a clear indication of what is happening in our schools.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton referred earlier to review bodies.  The report of the Review Body on the Primary Curriculum has surfaced since the Revised Estimates were produced after the budget.  The document has a lot to recommend it.  I am concerned that there is no provision recommended for a European language at national schools.  These documents are fine but they are aspirational.  My major criticism of these Estimates is that they make very little provision for any real improvements.  I believe it is necessary to produce such documents, talking shops, but if the political resolve is not there and no resources are provided to bring about the improvements recommended in them they are just an exercise in nonsense and will be left to gather dust.  On the basis of present trends, I am afraid that that is what will happen to this document.</P>
    <P>The statistics I quoted earlier underline the problem of burnout among teachers.</P>
    <P>The fact that there can be still up to 40 children in a classroom, after the publication of that document shows once again the nonsense of producing these documents when there is no political will on the part of the Government to impliment the changes needed.</P>
    <P>When the pupil-teacher ratio is too high those children who need to escape the poverty trap are not given the opportunity to do so.  The number of emotionally disturbed school children is definitely increasing.  In reply to a parliamentary <Col N="1771" /> question today the Minister said that the three very welcome pilot projects which are up and running at present would be monitored over a three-year period but no further action would be taken during that time.</P>
    <P>When one considers that teachers are increasingly coming under more and more stress in the classroom it is not good enough for the Minister to say that there will be no improvement in this fundamental area for three years.</P>
    <P>There are a number of children who in their own interests and the interests of their fellow pupils and teachers, need to be put into a new environment.  Many of them need a one-to-one relationship in the short-term.  These children can relate to adults in a one-to-one situation but they cannot do so when they are put into groups.  These children suffer from psychological problems and a poor selfimage due to their deprived backgrounds. In many cases they come from emotionally deprived backgrounds rather than materially deprived backgrounds.  I believe many parents who have good incomes do not put enough into their children.  As a teacher, I can recognise very quickly those children who are not spoken to at home by their parents.  For example, their language ability is not developed and they are not able to articulate properly.</P>
    <P>Both at Question Time today and in his contribution this evening Deputy Bruton spoke at some length about access to third level education.  I agree with much of what the Deputy has said about this issue.  With regard to eligibility for third level grants both in the VEC and university sectors, I submit that the income limit rigidly applied to PAYE workers and those in the self-employed sector do not always come in for the same scrutiny. I wonder how some tax inspectors can come up with such a low income in certain circumstances.</P>

      <P>We often lose sight of the problems faced by parents who have a number of children in third level education and whose income is marginally over the grant eligibility limit.  It is very important for some provision to be made urgently for those parents so that their children will be able to attend third level education.  Many children cannot attend university because of socio-economic reasons but there can also be geographical factors involved.  The Minister has told us that we will see the colleges Bill in the autumn.  I urge her to extend the provision in relation to university degree courses at regional colleges so that many disadvantaged children can attend such courses.  Because there is no university in Waterford a child from there has half the chance of a child from Cork, where there is a university, of getting a university degree.  This is also the case in many other areas.</P>

      <P>As I have said previously, education is an issue of immense importance to everybody in politics.  If the health issue had not brought down the Government last year they would have been brought down on the education issue.  Anyone who looks at the number of questions put down to the Minister for Education today must realise the importance of education and the pressure being placed on politicians due to the lack of facilities in education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the sixties and seventies progress was made in education but the eighties can be regarded largely as a lost decade and a period of retrenchment and cutbacks.  Progress was made in the areas of counselling, psychological services and remedial teaching but as Deputy O'Shea said there was a reduction in the number of remedial teachers and the counselling and psychological services were dropped completely.  Many school buildings are scruffy looking because principals have been left with the responsibilities for maintaining and cleaning them.  Unfortunately there does not seem to be any planning for further developments in the <Col N="1773" /> nineties.  The Minister seems to be winding-down the eighties rather than moving ahead with new developments.</P>
    <P>We have the worst funded schools in the EC and there is no point in the Minister talking about the extra millions of pounds which will be put into education this year.  We also have the largest classes in the EC with 26,000 pupils in classes of 40 and over.  That is a concept from the thirties, forties or fifties.  There are remedial teachers in only one-third of our primary schools.  The appointment of 95 new teachers does not seem to indicate that some 2,000 schools will have remedial teachers in the next decade.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the reduction of the six-year cycle to five years.  There are about 58 private fee paying schools in the country.  Yet three out of four of those schools maintain a six-year cycle while only one out of every five of the so-called free education schools have a six-year cycle.  A five-year cycle is being imposed on State schools.  Because the taxpayer funds these private, fee paying schools to the extent of £22 million a year it makes this inequity all the more inexcusable and increases the inequality which has been moving into the education area over the past decade.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party have continually drawn attention to the lack of funding available for schools and to the so-called free education area.  Our Constitution states that the State shall provide free primary education or, as it states in Irish, &ldquo;Ní foláir don Stát ...&rdquo; However, this is not the case at present and, as the Minister has pointed out the public, the community and parents have to pay 25 per cent of the costs involved.  The State pay the rest so there is no free primary education. Parents are required to make a voluntary contribution, which varies enormously.  I heard of one school which looked for a £20 contribution per family this year.  This was sent out at the beginning of the school year.  You may think that was bad but the next one &mdash; admittedly in a much higher income area &mdash; said that the agreed level of local contribution this year is £60 for one child, £90 for two <Col N="1774" /> children and £120 for three or more children. Of course the school in an area which can charge £60, £90 or £120 is in far better condition and has more up-todate equipment than the school which charged £20.  Indeed, the sum of £20 is more than can be charged in some areas, where they find it very difficult to get £5 per family.  Their schools are run-down and badly equipped.</P>
    <P>There are still very large classes at a time of very high teacher unemployment. People have said that there are too many teachers; that is not true, there are too few teachers in classes.  If we were to reach the same pupil-teacher ratio as Northern Ireland we would need an extra 3,000 teachers.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago, on an Adjournment debate, I drew attention to the lack of ancillary staff in schools and the loss of posts of caretakers, secretaries and child care assistants.  There are 3,400 primary schools in the country and only 278 are served by a caretaker.  In the past eight years 180 caretaker posts were lost in primary schools, a false economy, because schools are becoming dilapidated due to lack of maintenance. Large campuses are expected to be maintained by principals, teachers or parents. However, teachers should teach and principals should be doing administrative work.  I call for the immediate reinstatement of the 180 caretaker posts lost over the years and for a plan for the provision of caretakers and secretaries in all schools.</P>
    <P>Some of the cruellest cuts have been in special schools where classroom assistance and child care staff have been cut back.  A relatively small number of posts are required to help children with special needs.</P>

      <P>An allocation of £8.9 million &mdash; compared to £8 million last year &mdash; was made to youth funding this year.  The emphasis in the allocation of this money was towards disadvantaged young people with approximately £3.7 million going to projects specifically targeted at the disadvantaged.  In addition, there is a youth service grant scheme of £3.5 million where again this year we have made every effort to ensure that, as far as possible, the money is targeted at working class areas and others where young people are underprivileged in various ways.  We have also established a network of youth information centres throughout the country for which we provided £5.5 million.  There has also been major progress in regard to the whole area of youth exchange and work with the youth exchange bureau and we have continued the development of youth services at local level throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Under the Presidency, we made major progress in the European youth card which will increase mobility for young people from this country travelling throughout Europe.  We will be taking further initiatives in regard to this programme throughout the summer to give practical implementation to the European youth card.</P>
      <P>Very significant progress is being made in relation to the development of sport. We have appointed a considerable number of administrators and coaches to the various governing bodies of sport.  A couple of months ago the House of Sport was opened which is an office development used by the smaller sporting organisations. With the appointment of full time development personnel, plus the &ldquo;sport for all&rdquo; organisations, a major initiative is now being taken in that respect following the very successful &ldquo;be active, be alive&rdquo; campaign this year.  The institute of leisure and recreational development are also making progress to professionalise the management and maintenance of sports facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the capital side, I am very pleased that we have now short-listed the four <Col N="1776" /> consortia who will make the final submissions on the national sports centre. We have received from those consortia very exciting proposals for an indoor national sports centre up to international level, one which will match the best in the country.  In regard to the regional centres, by the same method of procurement we now have a considerable number of proposals for Cork and Sligo and the closing date for the Athlone centre is in about two weeks time.  We are at present finalising discussions in regard to the Galway centres.  All the 18 local sports centres are now in progress.</P>

The Government consider that it is not feasible to construct an outdoor sports stadium on a green field site.  Consequently, the development of the national outdoor stadium will be in one of the existing stadia.  In that respect, we have been having discussions for quite some time with the various governing bodies for sport on the question of rationalisation and on the development of an existing stadium.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to announce to the House that we have now completed planning on the development of Santry Stadium as the national athletics stadium.

      <P>I wish to thank you, the House and the Minister of State for allowing me to speak for two minutes on the Estimates for the Department of Education.  I wish to congratulate the Minister on her stewardship over the last three years.  It has been a very difficult period economically and, because Education is a high spending budget, it <Col N="1777" /> was expected it would suffer.  However, thanks to the Minister, to her commitment to education and her interest in all aspects of her portfolio, education has done well in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>Our system of education, although we may criticise it now and again, was &mdash; and still is &mdash; the best in Europe.  During the term of the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition the then Minister, the former Deputy Hussey, abolished the post of career guidance counsellor in schools with fewer than 500 pupils.  This was a retrograde step and the effects are still being felt as there is a higher drop-out rate in schools and many young people are leaving school without any qualification or idea of what they want to do.</P>

The Minister is aware of this and she has met several deputations about it from the constituency. This school was built over 25 years ago; it has 700 students and is in a deplorable condition.  The parents' committee, the teaching staff and the students would like me to remind the Minister about his project.

I appeal to the Minister that whatever resources are available be targeted towards alleviating disadvantage within our education system.  I ask too that she stop the exploitation of our young teachers by employing them on a part-time and temporary basis where permanent jobs are available.  This is ridiculous.  In some schools the position has become so farcical that the majority of staff are part-time. Surely no school can operate properly on this basis.  Even in areas where the school's population merits whole-time appointments, jobs are still being filled with part-time and temporary staff.</P>

      <P>The adoption by the European Council of a substantial Declaration on the Environment, proposed by the Presidency, was a historical event; it was the first time that the Council had addressed environmental issues in a comprehensive way and agreed a framework and guidelines for future action.  This in itself demonstrates the importance the Irish Presidency attached to the environment, but the significance of the declaration was enhanced by the fact it was backed up by specific action on a broad front at home and at international level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last January, I launched the Government's environment action programme. This is an ambitious IR£1 billion environmental investment plan with the object of improving still further Ireland's already high quality natural environment.  The plan, for example, means that by the year 2000, all municipal sewerage discharging to inland or coastal waters will be fully <Col N="1781" /> treated; all dumping at sea will be stopped by 1998; air quality will be dramatically improved; and good forestry, agricultural and industrial processes will be promoted.</P>
    <P>The Government have backed up these proposals on the environment by committing additional financial resources to implement them.  Measures costing £20 million in 1990 were provided for in the budget and built into the relevant departmental estimates.  In the case of my own Department, an additional £8.55 million was included.  Over and above the extra funds for water and sewerage schemes, the funds allocated in 1990 for environmental and related services have increased by 144 per cent over the 1989 expenditure.  Details are set out in subhead G in Part III of the estimate.</P>
    <P>On the international level, it became clear to me that Community environment policy needed to be orientated to a much greater degree to what was happening outside the boundaries of the Community. At the same time, greater progress was desirable on the backlog of environmental legislation required to face environmental challenges within the Community after 1992.</P>
    <P>At an early stage in my Presidency, I decided, following consultation with the Environment Commissioner, that political contact should be made with the emerging democracies of Eastern and Central Europe &mdash; countries beset by grave environmental problems which can affect the Community through transboundary water and air pollution. My initiative culminated in a special meeting of EC Environment Ministers and their counterparts from the USSR and Eastern and Central Europe in Dublin on 16 June.  At this meeting, the EC Ministers were able to hear first-hand descriptions of the problems involved and to set in place a series of steps to help resolve these problems.</P>
    <P>A major challenge which faced the Presidency was to ensure that Community member states acted together on matters of global interest and I am happy to say that some success was achieved in this area.  A strong unified Community <Col N="1782" /> position was achieved at the Bergen Conference on Sustainable Development, at the White House Conference on Global Change and at the recent London meeting on ozone depletion.</P>
    <P>During the Presidency, progress was made on a number of important measures at Community level.  At the March Council, there was agreement on the Regulation setting up the European Environment Agency; an important directive on access to information on the environment; two directives on biotechnology; a resolution prepared by the Presidency setting out future Community strategy on waste; and a decision to extend the CORINE programme for gathering information on the environment.</P>
    <P>The June Council built on the impressive record achieved in March and agreement on three new directives was secured.  These were: a directive banning the sale of commonly used batteries with a high mercury content; promoting recycling; and requiring separate disposal of used batteries; an important new directive governing all aspects of waste planning and management; and a directive establishing strict controls on discharges into water courses of four dangerous substances generally used as solvents in the dry cleaning and other sections.</P>
    <P>By any standards, the Green Presidency was a considerable success.  I intend to maintain the momentum in the period immediately ahead.</P>
    <P>Last year was a great year for the construction industry.  The fall in output and employment which had persisted in the industry since 1981, was completely reversed and overall output increased by about 10 per cent over 1988.  The total value of construction output in 1989 exceeded £2.1 billion and direct employment in the industry increased by 4,000 to 74,000.  The projections for output and employment in the industry remain more promising than they have been for many years.  Adequate mortgage finance continues to be available from a wide variety of sources and the recent reductions in interest rates are another welcome development.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1783" /> The upturn in the industry is underpinned principally by the recovery in the residential market and by strong growth in new commercial and retail construction since 1987.  The buoyancy of the residential market resulted in over 18,000 new dwellings being built in 1989, an increase of over 2,400 dwellings on the 1988 figure.  I expect about 20,000 new dwellings to be built in 1990.</P>
    <P>The value of new commercial and retail construction output increased by 115 per cent over the three years 1987 to 1989. This trend in private investment is an indicator of the high level of business confidence and of the favourable economic climate which Government policy has fostered.</P>
    <P>As regards public investment, the upturn in our economy and the improvement in our public finances enabled the Government to significantly increase the 1990 Public Capital Programme provisions affecting the construction industry. An additional £131 million of public investment is being provided for construction work.  This is almost 16 per cent more than the 1989 provision.  It will add about 6 per cent to overall output volume growth for the industry this year and will create over 2,000 new jobs.</P>
    <P>The 1990 allocation of £33 million for the local authority housing construction programme represents an increase of over 50 per cent on the 1989 outturn. This marks a significant departure from the pattern of recent years.  To date in 1990, approximately 1,150 new local authority houses have either commenced or been brought to tender stage.  It is clear, therefore, that good progress is being made towards achieving our targets for the year.</P>
    <P>We are now well into the National Development Plan covering the period 1989 to 1993.  As required by the Community Support Framework, an operational programme dealing with roads and other transport was submitted to the European Commission on 25 May. Already, the Commission have agreed to provide £451 million in grants for roads in the period up to 1993 and work is going <Col N="1784" /> ahead on that basis.  There is no question of implementation being held up pending the EC Commission's approval of the operational programme.</P>
    <P>This year, a record £219.7 million is being provided by the State for improvement and maintenance works on public roads, an increase of 13 per cent on 1989. Within this overall allocation, £188.5 million is being provided for road improvements, including works for storm damage which arose in February last, and £31.2 million for maintenance work.</P>
    <P>I have allocated £72.5 million this year to local authorities for improvements and maintenance works on non-national roads.  Of this provision, nearly £67 million has been allocated to county councils in discretionary grants for works on regional and county roads.  This compares very favourably with £47.4 million last year and £33.4 million in 1988.  This large allocation for regional and county roads should ensure a major improvement in these roads which are very important for local communities and for tourism development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should be congratulated for a virtuoso performance. The Minister is clearly demonstrating once again that he is a product of the Bunny Carr school of self-congratulations. The Minister works on the premise that if one praises oneself often enough someone who does not know any better might start repeating the praise to one's benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the short time we have available it is very difficult to deal with the various <Col N="1785" /> issues that arise under the terms of this Estimate.  I will deal briefly with a number of diverse issues that require attention.  It is something of a farce for the Minister to suggest that in housing his record is worthy of support.  In a Private Members' motion brought by my party, and supported by all the Opposition parties, we clearly demonstrated that we have a major housing crisis that there will be 25,000 applicants on the waiting list by the end of this year and that the Government have failed to meet the need for adequate funding for local authority housing.  There is a major problem also in relation to the need to refurbish some of the local authority housing stock, both flats and houses.  There is need for a far greater injection of funding in this area. There is a major problem in Dublin city where many local authority developments lack adequate bathroom and toilet facilities, the very basic facilities that we nowadays take for granted.</P>
    <P>Also in the city and county area there are flat complexes which badly require refurbishment.  Indeed, a report of 6 June 1990, published by Dublin County Council, sets out major works required in the flat complexes within the Dublin County Council area, Rosemount Court, St. Nathy's House and Hillview Court.  A sum of approximately £3.5 million is required to undertake urgent work on the fabric of those flat complexes.  Urgent work is also required to upgrade the electrical fuse boards and guarantee fire safety according to the county architect. I would ask the Minister to provide the funds necessary to ensure that families living in the flat areas in the city and county of Dublin are not at risk.</P>
    <P>We have heard much about the Green Presidency.  The phrase used in a press release published by the Minister's able press relations officer on his behalf was &ldquo;ozone &mdash; less talk more action urges Flynn&rdquo;.  In the context of the Green Presidency the most basic comment that could be made is that less talk and more action would be a lot more impressive.  The foundations for some of the things for which the Minister has claimed credit were laid by earlier presidencies.  It is <Col N="1786" /> somewhat ironic to see the Minister claiming credit for the directive relating to the establishment of the European Environmental Agency the basis of which was agreed during the course of the previous presidency.  In January 1990 the Minister told the European Parliament that it was his aim during the Green Presidency to have the seat of the agency and its location agreed as soon as possible. The Minister lamentably failed in that and the European environmental agency has not been set up nor has the country in which it should be established been agreed.  Indeed, the Minister ducked responsibility to this House to give the explanation for that in a Dáil question tabled this week when he had the question transferred to another Minister.</P>
    <P>Even more noteworthy is the major omission from the Minister's speech. There is no mention of the environmental protection agency which was promised by this Government.  In November 1989 Fine Gael published a comprehensive Bill supported by all Opposition parties, to establish an environmental protection agency.  All environment groups in the country, and all major industrialists, acknowledge that there is an urgent need for such an agency.  What has happened? The Government during the Green Presidency on the first vote on an environment issue voted down the legislation to establish an environmental protection agency. They voted against establishing an Oireachtas environment committee.  The Progressive Democrats wing of the Department of the Environment, which is supposed to be committed to Oireachtas reform, voted against the establishment of that committee.</P>
    <P>Where are we today in regard to the agency?  In December I warned the Government that if they opposed the enactment of the Fine Gael Bill there was no possibility that the Government would publish their own legislation this side of the summer recess and that there was no possibility that our environmental protection agency would be established and up and running before the end of the year.  Those predictions are reaching fulfilment.  What we have now is an <Col N="1787" /> unseemly squabble in the national media between the Minister of State, Deputy Harney, and the senior Minister, Deputy Flynn, with each of them trying to wash their differences in public and claim that the other is responsible for the delay in publishing the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Harney has not been slow to wander around the corridors of the House telling any journalists she meets that the difficulties she is encountering lie at the door of Deputy Flynn.  The reality is that if the PDs had any more commitment to the concept of an environmental protection agency than had the Fianna Fáil Party there was nothing to prevent their wing of the Government supporting the Bill published by Fine Gael and allow it progress to committee Stage.  There was nothing to prevent Deputy Harney taking up the offer I made to her, inside and outside the House, in November to put forward constructive amendments on Committee Stage.  We were prepared to take such amendments on board and we felt sure that they would be supported by all sides of the House so as to ensure that the agency was put in place.  So much for her wandering around the corridors of power telling everybody that the fault lies at the door of the senior Minister.  His lack of enthusiasm for an independent environmental protection agency is clearly evident by his failure to give himself a congratulatory pat on the back in his speech for referring to the concept in about 20 Speeches delivered by him in the last six months.  It is a scandal that the Government have failed to established that badly needed agency, that they have reneged on their promises to the House and failed to fulfil what was supposed to be a central commitment of the so-called Green Presidency.</P>
    <P>It is most disturbing that the Government are silent on the investigation into allegations of planning corruption in the planning process, in particular in Dublin. For almost 18 months we have been told than an investigation was being conducted into allegations of bribes being <Col N="1788" /> received in return for planning permissions granted.  Members on this side of the House have called for clarification from the Minister as to what is happening in regard to this.  Will the Minister say if the investigation is taking place?  Is it being obstructed by people in high places, or is all the co-operation required in the investigation being made available to the Garda?  How many gardaí are still involved in the investigation?  When can we anticipate more papers going to the Director of Public Prosecutions which may result in the issuing of court proceedings to bring to book people whom it is alleged have committed serious offences?  For how long will the Minister leave this scandal hanging in the air, hanging over the integrity of the planning process and undermining the credibility of the hard working officials in Dublin city and county?  They work with integrity and wish to have this matter cleared up once and for all.  The Minister has chosen to ignore this issue.</P>
    <P>In the context of the Green Presidency, it is notable that the Minister omitted any reference to the worries caused to Members, and the population, by Sellafield. The Sellafield issue is used on a regular basis by members of the Government to get a cheap headline of their concern about the nuclear reprocessing plants in Britain.  Not one meaningful initiative was taken during the course of our EC Presidency to tackle the problems caused by Sellafield or to bring other member states on our side.  Last week the Minister for Energy had the gall to tell me that he had not raised with the Japanese Government our concerns about the trans-shipment of nuclear waste to Sellafield through the Irish Sea. For those reasons, and others I would document if I had the time to do so, our party will be strenuously opposing the Government in the vote on this Estimate.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Chair, I should like to share my time with Deputy Ryan.  I welcome the fact that the Minister is using recycled paper.  If it was not for that I would not be able to say anything complimentary about his <Col N="1789" /> speech, which is more noteworthy for what he did not say than for what is in the short script prepared by the Department. The Minister has failed on a number of fronts in relation to his responsibilities in the Department.  The Minister is a brave man to stand in the House and attempt to take credit for doubling the allocation for local authority housing, to £33 million. He told us that that represented an increase of more than 50 per cent on the 1989 outturn, but I wonder if the Minister is taking cognisance of what is being said at every local authority meeting about growing housing lists.  I hope the Minister has taken heed of what has been said in the House in recent months in relation to the housing crisis that will confront him and his officials within a short time.</P>
      <P>The Minister must be aware of the number involved.  I understand that about 30,000 qualified applicants are on local authority housing waiting lists. Those applicants will have to wait four or five years for rehousing.  On that basis we will be facing a housing crisis within a short time.  The Minister, in this year's Estimate is failing in his responsibility to house the weaker sections of our community and he should address that problem in the coming months.  If he does not, we will return to the problems we had in regard to housing 15 or 16 years ago.</P>
      <P>The Minister boasted about the location for roads but he did not mention his roads authority, the great idea that Fianna Fáil came up with some years ago.  I wonder why that has not been developed.  As the Minister did not mention that body in his speech, are we to assume that the authority have been and are gone.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister say where the authority are three years later? The Minister has been responsible for the Department of the Environment for three years and he has had plenty of time to set up that authority I wonder why the authority have not appeared.  On national primary roads, I should like to point out to the Minister that not one yard of <Col N="1790" /> national primary road in County Kerry has been improved since 1986.  I appeal to the Minister to attend to this.  The Minister refused to meet a deputation from the local authority and I suggest that he travel to Kerry to see for himself that money is not being spent there on national primary roads.</P>
      <P>The Minister concentrated to some extent on the so-called Green Presidency, but from the evidence available to us the Presidency has not been the success the Minister said it would be or told the European Parliament it would be.  Two glaring instances of the failure of the Green Presidency were mentioned by Deputy Shatter.  The first was the failure of the Minister to ensure that the environmental protection agency was set up during the Presidency.  The fact that there was no agreement on the location for or on the setting up of the agency was a fundamental failure by the Minister in the last six months.  The Government failed to publish a Bill on this issue.  Most of the work on it had been completed but it appears that there is an inter-party dispute between the Minister for the Environment and his Minister of State, Deputy Harney, on the publication of it. One cannot help wondering if the Minister and the Department are backing away from the idea of having a strong and independent agency.  There is no escaping the fact that the failure to establish the agency is a major flaw in the Minister's armoury.  The Minister has failed to carry out his responsibilities to the House and to the nation in the last six months.  I am surprised that the Bill has not been published in an attempt to claim some success during the Green Presidency.</P>
      <P>I was surprised that there was no mention in the Minister's speech of the recycling programme.  It is my understanding that the local authorities were asked to submit programmes to the Department of the Environment before the end of June.  I therefore ask the Minister to indicate if these have been submitted and what the Department now intend doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems the Minister, the Minister for Energy and the Government have accepted that Sellafield is a fact of life <Col N="1791" /> and will continue to pose a serious threat to the Irish Sea.  When Fianna Fáil were in Opposition one could not do enough on the questions of Sellafield, a nuclear inspectorate and legal action against the British Government.  All of this now seems to have passed by the wayside.  The Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Energy have missed numerous opportunities to raise the constant threat, which is well documented, posed by Sellafield, not only to the Irish Sea but to the country.  In the context of our Presidency of the European Community, they failed to keep the issue on the European agenda.  The Labour Party oppose this Estimate because it displays a lack of imagination, energy and effort on the part of the Minister for the Environment and his Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer to the question of housing.  I fail to understand how the Minister can stand up and make such a statement while keeping a straight face, given that he is fully aware of the position.  On a number of occasions in the past, and I do so again now, I invited him to visit any of the constituencies in the city to see the conditions under which ordinary people have to live and try to bring up families.  However, the Minister has failed to respond to this request. While he is not prepared to listen to us, I hope for the sake of these people he will listen to his backbenchers, who deal with this issue each week in their clinics, if they try to get him to tackle the problem in a realistic way.</P>
      <P>I would now like to deal with the question of planning.  In relation to section 4 motions and material contraventions, the Minister's colleagues on Dublin County Council have acted in a scandalous way. One would have thought the Minister would have asked those same councillors to come to listen to him, pay heed to the need for proper planning and development in one of the fastest growing areas not only in this country but in Europe and to ensure that it is developed in an orderly manner in accordance with the development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1792" /> I welcome the legislation on planning compensation which was introduced following pressure from both the Opposition and the public who regarded the original Bill introduced as both defective and flawed.  Apart from the need to introduce a Bill on planning compensation, we also need to deal with the question of planning permission.  I would like to refer here to two cases in my own constituency &mdash; one involving Grange Developments at Swords and the other an 85 house development at Portrane.  One may well ask what these have in common and the answer is that they are both the subject of compensation claims in excess of £2 million.  I urge the Minister to set up a public inquiry to examine the way in which permission for these developments was granted by An Bord Pleanála.  We must get the system right.  There is no point in having legislation in place if An Bord Pleanála will not adhere to it.  This is a scandal and I ask the Minister to take on board this suggestion and take note of what the Opposition parties are saying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment has become the master of the exaggerated statement.  There is a clear example of this today when he made greatly exaggerated claims relating to the performance of the Government on the environment side.  The Minister has misused the statistics and tried to give us the impression that expenditure on the environment side will be greatly increased.  Indeed, there may well be modest increases in 1990 over 1989; but the Minister forgot to tell us that between 1986 and 1989 there were serious cutbacks in expenditure in the Department of the Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his contribution the Minister stated that the funds allocated in 1990 for environmental and related services have increased by 144 per cent over the 1989 expenditure.  Let me examine that statement for a few moments to show how empty that claim is.  It should be borne in mind that the figure has been increased from £4.5 million to slightly over £11 million, which represents approximately <Col N="1793" /> 2 per cent of the budget of the Department of the Environment.  When we examine the expenditure under that heading we find that most of the extra funding amounting to £6.5 million will be spent on once-off payments.</P>
    <P>For example, money is being provided for the carrying out of environmental surveys, environmental promotion and Radio DOE, through which the Minister has promoted his Department, while £4 million will be allocated by way of conversion grants.  As announced in the environmental action programme, the Minister has abolished these grants and this item will not appear in the Estimates again, as from 1990 onwards no one outside the specified area will be able to apply for conversion grants for the installation of low smoke heating systems.  It is quite clear therefore that the Minister is being dishonest when he claims there has been a 144 per cent increase in the funds allocated for environmental and related services.</P>
    <P>The same is true when we come to examine the question of housing.  The Minister has made the grandiose claim that the allocation for local authority housing has been increased by 50 per cent.  It is very easy to increase the allocation for local authority housing by 50 per cent when one considers that the allocation in 1989 was inadequate in the first place.  The amount being allocated in 1990 for the construction of local authority housing at £33 million represents only one-seventh of the amount allocated for the construction of local authority housing in the mid-eighties.  Furtheremore, the number of houses to be constructed in 1990 represents only one-fifth of the number of houses built in the mid-eighties.  Therefore, it is clear the Minister is being dishonest and is trying to disguise the fact that he is presiding over the worst housing crisis for over a decade.</P>
    <P>Many fine comments have been made during the past year, in particular during the Green Presidency, on the environment, comments with which most of us would agree.  However, let us take the example of a family who have to <Col N="1794" /> live in an overcrowded three-bedroomed local authority house, or the young family living in cramped conditions in a boxroom. This is what the environment is like for many of the 20,000 on house waiting lists, who have little or no prospect of being housed, given the shortage of funds for local authority housing.  I asked the Minister a straight question in this House last Tuesday.  I asked him how many of the 1,200 houses which he promised would be built this year have been built and how many of the 50 houses due to be purchased by local authorities this year have been bought.  I did not get an answer, but he anticipated that I would ask the same question again today.</P>
    <P>The Minister now comes in and tells us that 1,150 houses have either been started or have been brought to tender. How many of these houses have actually been started and how many have been brought to tender?  Can the Minister break down those figures?  It is my belief that few, if any, of the houses that the Minister for the Environment has promised have actually begun construction. As happened last year when this country was promised 900 house starts in the end it transpired that only 300 houses or so were built.  By the end of this year we will find that very few of the limited number of houses that have been promised will actually be built.</P>
    <P>At present there are over 20,000 applicants on local authority waiting lists, many of whom have been waiting for years, many are living in grossly overcrowded conditions with increasing family pressures and emotional strains, many are being exploited by sub-standard over-priced flats.  In addition there are several thousand transfer applicants in the major urban centres.  Some of these are young families in top storeys of high rise flat complexes and people living in local authority accommodation without proper sanitary facilities.  There are 2,500 local authority houses in Ireland without a toilet, there are 8,000 local authority houses without a bathroom; as we approach the 21st century that is the scandal. In fairness it is a scandal that is shared not only by the present Minister <Col N="1795" /> for the Environment but by his predecessors who down through the years failed to tackle this problem.</P>
    <P>We are facing the worst housing crisis for over a decade.  The allocation for housing is inadequate.  At the present rate it would take 20 years to clear the housing list.  The allocation that has been made is simply not enough.  I do not believe the housing crisis we are now experiencing will remain quiescent for ever.  Young families will not remain for ever couped up in cramped box rooms in the overcrowded homes of their in-laws nor will they tolerate indefinitely the damp, dingy basement flats to which many are condemned.  Before long the 20,000 applicants on the housing lists will be taking to the streets as they did before and bringing their plight to the doors of town halls and to the gates of Leinster House.  I am now calling on the Minister in the face of this crisis to declare a housing emergency, to face up to the problem that for so long he has been prepared to ignore.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to know the attitude of the Minister to the housing crisis because a couple of years ago a Government Minister was telling us there was no emigration problem when all the evidence was to the contrary.  Just as we told Governments a couple of years ago that people were emigrating in large numbers it is time the Government now listened to us when we say that there are large numbers of people living in impossible housing conditions that can only be rectified if the Government put additional resources into the housing area.  If the Minister were to double the number of houses that are to be constructed this year it would relieve the problem for some of the worst affected cases.</P>
    <P>It has to be pointed out that far from increasing the allocation on housing this year the Government are actually saving money.  They are not allocating extra money for houses but rerouting the money that is coming in from the sale of local authority houses to housing construction.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the Estimates one will <Col N="1796" /> find that under every single housing heading there are reductions; one subhead is down 84 per cent, another 38 per cent, another 5 per cent, another 48 per cent and so on.  Even in the staffing columns in these Estimates one finds that the housing section of the Department of the Environment has the biggest reduction in staff.  This Government are abandoning their commitment to house people, people who are now caught, on the one hand, between rising housing prices, rising mortgage interest rates and on the other hand a Government who do not care for how long people have to live in these overcrowded conditions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> Briefly, in the few minutes available to me I compliment the Minister of State for the amount of good work they have carried out during the past year particularly in relation to the new developments in my own constituency of Wexford.  I will not waste time on a long winded speech but I will put a few points to the Minister, particularly in regard to urban renewal which has been very successful in Wexford town. While the Minister has extended the urban renewal scheme this year to other centres, I would ask that it be extended further in 1991 to include the town of Enniscorthy where there is a large number of derelict sites.  We have a new bridge, a new sewerage scheme and a new road development into the town and we have many people who are prepared to invest and develop the old buildings if they get the incentives involved in urban renewal.  I would ask the Minister to consider extending the scheme to smaller towns such as Enniscorthy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The county roads were a major problem over the last few years.  In 1987 when the last Government left office there was an allocation of the order of £6 million for county roads, this year it is in the region of £70 million.  This has gone a long way to restoring the bad situation that had arisen.  The Minister is to be complimented on recognising the problem that existed and taking corrective action.  I would hope that next year we will see further allocations of money by <Col N="1797" /> the Minister into county roads to ensure that the people who live in rural areas have adequate roads and that they are up to the required standard.</P>
    <P>The 1988 tenant purchase scheme which was introduced by the Minister was an outstanding success.  Over 50 per cent of people in housing estates in various parts of the country availed of this scheme.  It is now time for the Minister to have a look at the possibility of either reintroducing this scheme or introducing a new tenant purchase scheme to enable people who now want to purchase their houses to do so.  Indeed, there is a large number of representations from people throughout the country requesting that they be allowed to buy their houses. Because there was such a large take up of the scheme there was a problem clearing them all through there councils.  That is probably one of the reasons for the delays.  I would ask the Minister to consider seriously the introduction of a new scheme.</P>
    <P>Housing has been mentioned by Deputy Gilmore.  We would all agree that there is need for a substantial number of local authority houses to be built to resolve the existing problem. There has been a substantial increase in the allocation this year to the different counties.</P>
    <P>The time has come for the Minister to look at other ways of providing houses for our people.  If there is a scarcity of funds in the Department &mdash; which appears to be the case &mdash; we have a duty, as Members of this House to put forward ideas on how we could possibly help to solve this problem.  The Minister should consider the area of shared equity which was introduced in the UK in the early seventies and which has been an outstanding success.  As the name implies the equity, or ownership of the house, is shared jointly by the tenant purchaser and the local authority.  I suggest that the scheme would be funded from a capital grant from the Department of the Environment with a loan element being processed in the normal way through the county council, bank or building society.  Purchasers as they would have <Col N="1798" /> the finance would be entitled to purchase the remaining equity in units of 5 per cent over a period.  I believe there are many people out there whose income does not exceed £10,000 or the loan entitlement who would be interested in this type of housing provision if it was made available to them.  I would ask the Minister to consider such a scheme and to have his officials look at it to see if it is possible to operate it in this country.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that the problem in housing will not be solved overnight by the Department of the Environment. Therefore we must investigate other methods of resolving it.  The scheme of grants which obtained under the previous Government, enabling people to surrender the ownership of their local authority houses and buy in the private sector, should be re-examined.  I always thought it was a good scheme which should not have been terminated.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to take all of this into account when examining housing allocations in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>In the few minutes remaining I should like to get across to the Minister the housing crisis that exists. As Deputy Gilmore said, if the Government and the Minister do not realise there is a crisis in housing it may be that they will have to discover the fact for themselves, as was the case with regard to the crisis in health and education.  Not alone has the cutback on housing given rise to a denial of housing for families living in over-crowded conditions but it has also led to serious emotional and psychological problems in the case of such people.  Indeed the State would guarantee the basic right of these people to secure, spacious accommodation.  Some families, most susceptible to such problems, are living in the most cramped, uncivilised type of accommodation.  In so saying, I am not making a party political point.  Those are the circumstances with which we are confronted daily in our constituencies. If we really care about the health and future of our society, and our children in particular, we cannot but recognise that crisis and take some action <Col N="1799" /> to alleviate it.  A huge investment is needed.  Indeed the type of housing programme prevailing to date has been totally inadequate for these purposes.</P>
      <P>Another area in dire need of attention is housing for the elderly, those most vulnerable and at risk in our society.  I would ask the Minister to seriously consider giving State support to people endeavouring to provide secure units for the elderly in communal settings.  For example, in my constituency there is the Altadore project under which a huge amount of proceeds by way of fund-raising is eaten up by tax and VAT.  Not only should we be helping such people but certainly they should not be taxed on their efforts.  This project is being undertaken by a group of people who, denominationally, represent 0.5 per of our population.  We should not have to rely on individuals, or committed small denominational groups in society to fulfil our responsibility to certain groups within society.  Those most at risk in our society at present are children and the elderly, the two groups most in need of investment and any resources available.  The Minister might well investigate making available tax incentives or rewards to people endeavouring to cope with the problem.</P>
      <P>I might draw the Minister's attention to another crisis with which we will be confronted once the weather gets colder in that we have now imposed a ban on the distribution and sale of bituminous coal.  This was the only fuel within the means of the poor or elderly to date, although at times even that was beyond their reach.  There is no point in our introducing a ban on coal without considering some subsidisation for those people who will be hardest hit.  It is not alone unjust and immoral to demand that poor families and the elderly do not burn the cheapest fuel available to them at present, forcing them, in turn, to raise funds for more expensive types of clean fuel without the State, simultaneously, subsidising their additional expenditure in some manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Serious consideration must be given to our greatest resource &mdash; in which we all <Col N="1800" /> rejoice &mdash; that is natural gas.  Some type of subsidy, even if means-tested, should be given to families who avail of its installation for cooking and heating purposes. Very often it is not so much a question of considering investment, but of diversion or distribution of available resources, the bottom line always being: who will be the hardest hit?</P>
    <P>If I may revert to the housing crisis again, we should take into consideration not only people on public housing waiting lists &mdash; who face a bleak future in relation to any prospect of being rehoused within years &mdash; but also, something of which the Minister must be aware, the slowing down generally in the construction industry caused by increased interest rates on mortgages.  Many couples are at present subjected to grave stress because they are unable to maintain high mortgage repayments.  I would ask the Minister to make representations to the building societies and other lending institutions to reduce their interest rates simultaneously with Central Banks reductions.</P>
    <P>The Minister would appear to have £6.5 million or so national lottery moneys hidden somewhere in his Department which has not been distributed for community needs to date.  When replying, I hope he will be able to assure us that that money will be allocated directly to the communities most in need, perhaps not based on geographical or political considerations.</P>

      <P>When speaking on the Estimates two years ago I asked the Minister to continue his good work on county roads, particularly those in the counties surrounding Dublin.  It would be remiss of me if I did not acknowledge the fantastic increase in allocation to county roads that there has been over the past year, something for which the Minister should be commended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1801" /> There has been much talk on this Estimate about the provision of housing and, indeed, housing in general, a matter of concern to all of us.  There is an acknowledged shortage of residential housing, with a consequent demand on the Government to provide more and more public housing.  I should like to propose an option which might be considered, encouraging the private sector to provide good quality, rented residential accommodation by way of a tax incentive scheme similar to that applicable at present to manufacturing industry under the provisions of the business expansion scheme.  We are all aware that the incidence of home ownership here is much higher than in other European countries. It is not difficult to envisage, in the coming years, difficulties in maintaining that level of home ownership with escalating land values and an ever-increasing urban population.  Therefore it may become impossible in the future for many young couples, first, to accumulate the requisite deposit on a house and then repay the mortgage finance required for the purchase of their homes.  If such a scheme could be devised, along the lines of the BES one currently applicable to manufacturing industry, we would have a ready supply of good rented, residential accommodation, much to be desired.  In this way we would be encouraging developers to participate more actively in that sphere.  In order to ensure that appropriate type housing is provided for people at the lower end of the market statutory limits could be imposed on the type of housing to be funded, utilising BES-type relief.</P>
    <P>The Minister could also take power to fix rents for specified periods for that type of accommodation, and the length of time an owner would have to hold on to the house could also be stipulated and penalties imposed if it was sold before that.  That scheme would have the benefit of providing increased accommodation and would also lead to an increase in employment in the construction industry.</P>

      <P>I would like to join in the tributes paid to the Minister this afternoon. The last three years represent a major change in environmental policy. We have made tremendous strides and that should be acknowledged irrespective of party.  There is a far greater level of consciousness now concerning the environment.</P>
      <P>I welcome the content of the environmental plan announced this year which allowed for the elimination of the discharge of raw sewage into waterways and harbours.  It is particularly welcome in my own constituency of Cork where Cork Harbour has suffered unduly from untreated sewage entering into the harbour. The Minister has taken the bull by the horns and has directed the local authority to construct a sewage treatment plant and prepare design plans for that purpose.  That represents a watershed for the development of Cork Harbour as an amenity for the people of Cork, particularly the yachting and bathing fraternity.</P>
      <P>In relation to housing, what we have seen in the debate so far has been a major reaction to the Minister's policy on housing.  We need a far more analytical approach to housing in the future.  It is far too easy to say we should build more local authority houses and throw more money into these projects.  Things are far more complex than that.  The demographic situation is different to what it was in the sixties and seventies.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the House.  I am grateful to the Deputies who contributed to the debate.  I would like to deal with at least a few of the points raised, if the time allows.  One expects some Deputies to be always negative while others try to base their remarks on facts.  The facts can be stated in a few minutes.  I would like to put before the Deputies what they are.  I agree with many Deputies that there is need for a major remedial works programme.  That is why the refurbishment programme has taken off with such a big commitment of money for the past few years.  It should <Col N="1803" /> be recognised that the £15 million this year is a sizeable advance on the situation a few years ago when it was less than £3 million.  It has, therefore, increased fivefold in a few short years.  I would like to be able to give more money to that area because, as Deputy Gilmore says, there are a number of very serious cases so far as sanitation is concerned that should be addressed.  That is the reason I have transferred quite a lot of money into that area and it has to come from some place else.</P>
      <P>Deputy Spring spoke about the NRA legislation.  That will happen.  There is no doubt about that.  I gave my commitment to it and that legislation will be discussed, if we can get a bit of co-operation in the House, during the next session.</P>
      <P>I would also like to say that there was quite a bit of talk about the location of the European Environmental Agency.  If any of the Deputies were paying any little attention at all to what was going on during the Presidency, they would know that the location of the European Environmental Agency was not a matter for my Presidency at all.</P>

      <P>On the contrary, it was not my responsibility.  There was also a fair bit of talk about the environmental protection agency here and Deputy Shatter, as usual, had something to say about that. I did not realise until today that he is one of the guys who listens to corridor chat around Leinster House, but I would like to tell Deputy Shatter that he has got it all wrong.  There is no conflict at all between me and the Minister of State.</P>

      <P>I get five minutes, I presume. The true figures have been given in the House often enough and the net need, as assessed by the 1988 act of assessment is 20,000, not the 30,000 suggested by Deputy Spring.</P>
      <P>It is also well to bear in mind the recycling programme that Deputy Spring raised.  I have to say that I agree with him.  I was very disappointed with the result from the local authorities.  Only two recycling programmes have come to hand at the moment, from Dublin Corporation and Cork Corporation.  I will be pursuing that as vigorously as I can.</P>
      <P>Last month saw two reductions of one half of one per cent each in interest rates generally and the building societies have already announced cuts in their rates in response to the first reduction.

    <P>Deputy Gilmore raised a question at Question Time during the week.  I did not have the figures for him then but I did check them and that is the reason they were put into my contribution today.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The net Energy Estimate for 1990 amounts to just over £7.2 million.  While the amount is small in the context of overall Exchequer expenditure, nobody could dispute the fundamental role which energy must play in securing the economic and social wellbeing of this country.  In a speech such as this, it is appropriate that I should immediately outline to the House, on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Energy, the overriding policy objective of this Government in relation to energy. Put simply, it is to facilitate the provision of energy at competitive cost with every possible regard and attention being paid to the security of supply, environmental and safety issues that go hand-in-hand with the whole energy business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the beginning of Ireland's Presidency of the EC, the Minister for Energy indicated that, as incoming President of the Energy Council, he would strive to achieve substantial progress on those measures proposed for completion of the single energy market.  He also wished to move the debate on the energy-environment relationship to the top of the agenda.  I know that he has been very encouraged by the positive and constructive way in which the Council of Energy Ministers have progressed this vital debate in the past few months.  Conclusions were agreed which set the stage <Col N="1808" /> for the main objectives to be pursued in the energy area.</P>
    <P>He was also pleased that the Energy Ministers' Council, at its meeting in May, took decisions which made very significant progress towards the development of the single energy market. Agreement was reached on a directive on Transparency of Gas and Electricity Prices and on a directive on Electricity Transit.  Both of these proposals had been under discussion for some time and it is always a welcome development to bring the talking to an end and put agreements in their place.</P>
    <P>An EC energy technology programme &mdash; THERMIE &mdash; was also agreed.  This will provide financial assistance for the promotion of energy technology in the rational use of energy, renewable energy sources, solid fuels and in the hydrocarbons sector.  It will play a key role in contributing towards the ecological challenge during its five year duration.  Furthermore, for the first time a Council of Energy Ministers has agreed to a discussion on nuclear issues.  The discussion will cover all aspects of nuclear safety, transport and waste, including waste from the decommissioning process. Overall the Presidency has been a successful one; a lot of progress was achieved.</P>
    <P>At this point I would like to dwell a little further on the energy-environmental relationship and focus on the domestic measures which the Government have taken.  It is of course a subject in which I have a particular interest myself.  In recognition of the importance of the environmental dimension in energy matters, the Department of Energy will ensure that energy policy will be kept in line with the Government's environmental policy which is stated in the document <i>An Environment Action Programme</i> published last January.</P>
    <P>Getting the fuel mix right from an environmental point of view will carry a price tag.  There can be no element of luxury about paying this price.  It will have to be paid.</P>
    <P>The Government's announcement of a <Col N="1809" /> ban on the sale and distribution of bituminous coal in the Dublin area from the coming autumn will have direct repercussions for the energy sector.  Given that the Minister for Energy has responsibility for energy supplies, I am aware that he is endeavouring to ensure that there will be adequate supplies of smokeless and low smoke fuels in Dublin this winter to meet demand.  To this end he has invited the main coal importing companies to discuss their plans with him for supplying the market.</P>
    <P>The ban has also provided Bord na Móna with the opportunity to expand their briquette sales in the Dublin area. The board succeeded in increasing their market share significantly last winter and, with the improved marketing surveying now being employed, further increases in market share in coming years can reasonably be anticipated.</P>
    <P>Natural gas has been recognised as the least harmful of all the fossil fuels and will play a major role, domestically and internationally, in efforts to combat atmospheric pollution and to reduce the greenhouse effect.  Bord Gáis will no doubt capitalise on this in their efforts to develop the natural gas industry in Ireland, as this decade progresses.</P>
    <P>Energy conservation is acknowledged as a potentially significant contributor to redressing environmental damage as well as reducing costs to energy users.  As part of the National Environment Action Programme, an additional £500,000 has been allocated to the Energy Vote in 1990 to launch new initiatives in the energy conservation area.  In May an announcement was made on the projects to be funded from these extra resources.  These include the installation of energy management systems in the Children's Hospital in Crumlin and in University College Hospital, Galway, a contribution to Energy Action, a charitable group engaged in draught-proofing the houses of the needy and elderly, the establishment of a conservation advisory group to make recommendations on energy conservation matters and a number of other miscellaneous projects.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1810" /> Energy conservation helps the environment and it saves money too.  It is a very simple message.  Opportunities exist right throughout the economy to save energy and to save money, and our programmes are geared towards getting that message across.</P>
    <P>I will turn now to the specific energy suppliers.  The ESB are unlikely to require new generating capacity until after the middle of the nineties.  This respite from large-scale investment affords the ESB an opportunity to improve their financial position.  Comparisons with electricity prices in other EC countries have shown that both Irish domestic and industrial prices are now below the EC average.  Since 1985 prices to industrial customers have dropped on average by nearly 19 per cent, commercial prices by 15 per cent and domestic electricity prices by 12 per cent.  Furthermore, the ESB intend to hold prices at their present level until 1992 at least.</P>
    <P>Too high a growth rate in electricity sales could, if sustained, have the undesirable effect of drawing closer the time when extra generating capacity will be required and also exacerbate the environmental problems that go with it.  A major factor in curtailing this will be to maintain an electricity demand growth rate of 3 per cent per annum on average over the coming decade while at the same time not constraining national economic growth.  It is the ESB's intention, as indicated in their latest strategic plan, to place demand management at the centre of their operational strategies.</P>
    <P>Deputies may also be aware that on Friday last the Minister for Energy announced that the Government have taken steps to ensure that the western package electrification grants would be replaced despite the fact that the EC funds available for this scheme have now been fully taken up.  This scheme, which provides 80 per cent grants, has proved its worth since its commencement back in 1981, and I have no doubt but that the new replacement scheme announced by the Minister, Deputy Molloy, will continue to improve the quality of living in rural communities.  In 1990, a sum of over <Col N="1811" /> £2 million is being made available for these grants, an increase of nearly £1 million over last year's outturn.  This increase takes account of the impact of increased demand for grants arising from a broadening of eligibility in 1988.</P>
    <P>The discovery of natural gas off the coast of Kinsale in 1971 has necessitated extensive planning and investment by successive Governments to maximise its economic benefit to Ireland.  Over 500 km of pipelines have been constructed since gas was first brought onshore in 1978, thereby extending the availability of this valuable natural resource to most major population centres and many industries throughout Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Government are, however, conscious that our own natural gas reserves, though ample for our current needs, are finite.  Since coming into office the Minister for Energy has given top priority to securing long-term supplies of natural gas.  Such a high priority rating lead to his decision to investigate the possibility of strengthening our security of supply by interconnection.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided that now would be the most opportune time to undertake the extensive planning which must precede a project of such a scale. A considerable amount of research and fact-finding has already been undertaken by the Department of Energy and Bord Gais Éireann.  Meetings have taken place with British and continental interests and it is intended that we will shortly be in a position to enter into negotiations for supply and construction contracts with a view to having imported gas on stream during the winter of 1993-94.</P>
    <P>The European Commission recently announced its decision to set aside a special allocation of 300 million ECU for specific energy projects, including a gas interconnecter between Ireland and Britain.  This announcement is very welcome and, while it is too early to say what the precise EC contribution will be, this decision allows ample scope for substantial Commission support.</P>
    <P>The current Minister for Energy is no less committed than his predecessors to <Col N="1812" /> ensuring that the drive towards improved safety in the natural gas industry will continue to be vigorously pursued.  The Dublin Gas response time to publicly reported gas leaks has improved to 100 per cent on site within the hour compared to 70 per cent in 1987.  On average, calls are now responded to in 30 minutes, and such standards are improving all the time.</P>
    <P>Turning now, to Bord na Móna, the Government are anxious to ensure that Bord na Móna will provide viable and sustainable employment in the long term and will continue as a significant producer of indigenous energy.  The House should be well aware of the board's crucial, economic and social role in the midlands and the mid-west regions.  In this regard the question of the financial position of Bord na Móna is being comprehensively reviewed at present and the matter will be put before the Government in the near future.</P>
    <P>The main feature of the world oil scene so far this year has been the weakening of international crude oil prices.  Market commentators are projecting a strengthening of crude and product prices in the coming months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to have to say that I am very disappointed with the Estimate.  Ireland has no energy policy worthy of the name.  To crown that, the Minister announced recently his decision to abandon the promised production of a White Paper on energy policy for Ireland, although this was repeatedly demanded by the International Energy Agency in their reports on the sector.  Indeed, the Minister's predecessor had promised that a White Paper would be produced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister seems to imagine that announcing his policy objectives absolves him of the need to find instruments to achieve them.  We will pay a very heavy price for this in the years to come.  We see the Minister stumbling from one issue to another; reacting to situations rather <Col N="1813" /> than shaping events.  That is the sad state of the energy policy of this country.</P>
    <P>The key issues in the sector are: the excessive price paid for oil products; the wasteful use of energy in the country; the environmental damage wrought by extraction; and use of energy products. None of these issues has been coherently addressed by the Minister.  Whereas energy could be the engine of growth and recovery in the economy, it is the opposite.</P>
    <P>The Irish public are well aware of the high price of oil; but it is as well to restate it, because the Government appear to have forgotten it entirely.  Road diesel is the key to the commercial life of the country and is essential in getting goods to the European market.  In Ireland the pre-tax price of road diesel is 30 per cent dearer than the EC average.  In addition, the tax charged by our Government is 75 per cent higher than the EC average.  It is hardly surprising, therefore, that manufacturers complain that access costs to the European markets are double those of our competitors.  We are an island nation on the periphery and transport costs are a key element of the economy.</P>
    <P>The last EC report on the costs of distribution of oil products showed that it cost almost two and a half times as much to distribute the product as the European average.  This is a very serious problem for our economy, yet the Government have no strategy for dealing with it.  There has been no move to harmonise the taxation on oil products in line with EC levels.</P>
    <P>The battle talk of the previous Minister taking on the issue of distribution costs with the oil companies has fallen silent. The Minister for Industry and Commerce promised a new restrictive price order to increase competition in the retail trade, but it has yet to surface 12 months later. However, the promise of such an order is little more than a sham because the Director of Fair Trade indicated in his report that 11 out of the 12 existing restrictive practice orders cannot be enforced due to a lack of staff.</P>
    <P>The Government also proposed to do <Col N="1814" /> something about Whitegate, but nothing has come of it after three years.  Two years were frittered away in apparently fruitless negotiations with Nigerian interests.  In fact, no application was made to the European Community for funds to assist the project.  A task force was set up which was due to report within three months on the options open to the Government and now, 12 months later, we are glad to hear they have finally reported to the Minister.  So much for the urgency of the report.  The Minister seems to forget that Irish consumers, according to his own admission, have to pay an additional £25 million for the oil produced at the Whitegate Oil Refinery. The consumer has to bear the cost of the additional £25 million while the Government fritter away time without coming up with options for the refinery.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of coherent thinking on our natural resources.  Earlier this year the Dáil was asked to debate a Bord na Móna Bill which was little more than a mockery.  Bord na Móna face a deep financial crisis.  The value of their assets fall short of their debts by a margin of £73 million.  Yet the company achieved a remarkable turn about in increasing productivity and are now trading profitably. However, we all know, on this side of the House and on the other side, that no company can diversify and grow with this scale of overhanging debt.  Yet the Government have not responded to this need.  Only last week the chief executive of Bord na Móna revealed that the company had to forego attractive business opportunities in the key diversification areas of horticultural peat and the smokeless fuel market because the Government had not moved on their request.</P>
    <P>The debacle of selling off Tara Mines at a knock-down price, resulting in a major loss to the taxpayer, has not changed the Minister's policy on mining.  No new terms for giving the taxpayer a reasonable share in the fruits of mining discoveries have been worked out. Although the Minister has talked a good deal about the environmental impact of mining &mdash; indeed, he intervened in the Croagh Patrick case, which is welcomed, <Col N="1815" /> but this was done on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis &mdash; the Minister has refused to work out a policy which would build into prospecting licences some adjudication of the environmental impact of the second phase of mining.  Major responsible environmental groups have called for these measures to be taken, but the Minister has rejected their requests.</P>
    <P>The Minister's response to the 260 people who will lose their jobs in Arigna makes very dismal reading.  The workers are being asked to have faith and be buoyed up by the Minister's promise that if anything useful comes up the Government will not be found wanting in funding it.  I think the workers of Tuam, Thurles and Ballyforan can testify to the value of those assurances.</P>
    <P>The Government have tried to be very &ldquo;green&rdquo; on Energy and the Environment, but the reality is different. Despite making a commitment to the Helsinki and Sofia Protocols on emissions, we find that no reduction is planned on our present level of emissions of either sulphur dioxide or nitrogen oxides.  In fact, our Government stood in the way of an explicit target to reduce carbon dioxide emissions when the EC Council sought to do so.  This is the real testimony to the Government's commitment to environmental issues.  They are standing in the way of progress.  The cornerstone of addressing the greenhouse effect is energy conservation, but we have made no application to the EC for funds for energy conservation and we have not set aside a penny for activity that potentially will shave £700 million off our energy bill. The Minister announced that he would provide a pathetic £500,000 for energy conservation but this money would not fund anything approaching what is needed.</P>

      <P>The reality is that this money will not fund any change in our conservation practices.  We will remain <Col N="1816" /> the most wasteful user of energy in Europe, and we are 18 per cent worse than the rest of Europe.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would like to deal with radiological protection.  The Minister's protests about Sellafield are beginning to wear thin.  He has thrown out the previous Government's commitment to take the British Government to court on the issue.  He has abandoned previous attempts to bring this issue to the Paris Commission and seek international support for our proposals to close Sellafield. He has made no efforts to challenge the existing safety practices accepted by Euratom, despite the new evidence in the Gardner report.  In addition, he has produced a Radiological Protection Bill which even the British Government would be ashamed to produce.  The Minister wants to put the Radiological Protection Institute under his thumb entirely.  The Minister of State knows that independence is the essence of an environmental protection agency's work, but sadly her colleague has not picked that up from her.</P>
      <P>There are 35,000 houses in Ireland with excessive levels of radon gas.  They suffer from 80 times the limit that would be acceptable in Sellafield and 100 deaths have been recorded each year resulting from the effects of the gas.  Yet no action is being taken.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to the statement made by the Minister that getting the fuel mix right from an environmental point of view will carry a price tag.  The reality is that if the Government are not willing to fund an expansion in the gas grid, the consumers and householders will have to bear that price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I too should like to voice my disappointment at this Estimate.  The Minister did not state anything new in her speech this evening.  The Government's attempts to put a good face on the EC Presidency have failed miserably.  The Minister's speech did not show any achievements, rather it referred to what the Government hope to do.  There were <Col N="1817" /> no positive developments during that period.</P>
      <P>In my constituency we have the Leinster coalfields and I was very disappointed that the Minister did not refer to the problems in this area.  I am aware that very active committees in the area have lobbied the Department, both directly and indirectly, through their public representatives.  I am very interested in the area of energy but as time does not permit me to go through all aspects of it, I will devote my time to the problems in the Leinster coalfields.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred extensively to the problems of the physical environment but did not refer to the other environment, that is, the social environment. The social environment in the coal mining areas has been devastated through emigration, abandoned and dilapidated houses and abandoned mines.  There is ample evidence to suggest that if the Government undertook a positive approach to the development of our coal reserves this would substantially improve the social environment of many parts of the country, particularly the Leinster coalfields area where there are high levels of unemployment, emigration and poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are coal reserves in the Leinster coalfields and the need for this coal can be seen from the substantial amount of coal we import.  However, because the Government believe that the mines should be run by private enterprise, who will want to get a quick and immediate return on their investment, they will not reopen them.  If the Government were willing to give financial aid to the coalmines they could be developed.  I again urge the Minister and the Government to undertake this task.  The unfortunate unemployed workers who have devoted much of their time to putting proposals, through their unions, to the Government, deserve some response from them. However, the Estimate before us today does not contain any response to their proposals.  This will be a severe disappointment and kick in the teeth to the people who have worked very hard on various committees, particularly those in <Col N="1818" /> the Leinster coalfields area, to get some recognition from the Department of Energy.  I call on the Minister to give a positive reply to these people who have done more than anyone else in trying to rectify this problem.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the problems caused by Sellafield.  As we all know, Sellafield was the priority of the previous Minister for Energy.  Having watched that Minister in action over the past few weeks, I believe he would have succeeded in abolishing Sellafield if he had put half the effort into it that he put into trying to abolish RTE.  Obviously, he did not have the same determination to abolish Sellafield as he had to abolish RTE.  There is only a passing reference to the continuing problem of Sellafield in the Estimate.</P>
    <P>I got the impression from the Minister's speech that the new interconnectors will be used to import energy rather than export it.  We should be more ambitious in this regard.  I was disappointed to hear that the ESB are resting on their laurels, as it where, and they do not see the need for more capacity at present.  We should aim in the development of these interconnectors to produce electricity with the purpose of exporting it.  Ireland has probably more wind and tidal energy than any other country and we should develop a programme to export rather than import energy.</P>
    <P>I again ask the Minister to expand, if at all possible, the conditions for qualification for grants under the western package electrification grant scheme.  My constituency is regarded as a rich agricultural area but there are areas of extremely bad agricultural land there. Those people with no holdings do not qualify for grant aid under the present scheme and there is no way they can hope to get electricity.  This is a very good scheme but, because of the few people remaining to get electricity, it should be expanded further.</P>

      <P>I apologise for not being present for the Minister's contribution and that of the other Deputies. It is simply because I have a very heavy cold and there has been a dreadful <Col N="1819" /> draught all day long in the Chamber which I just cannot stand.</P>
      <P>As other Deputies said, the short time available does not allow anyone to deal in an adequate way with the Estimate because so many areas are covered, from the effects of Moneypoint on global warming to gas and electricity interconnectors and the use of cutaway bogs. I have decided, like others, to concentrate on one issue, our lead and zinc resources.  Will the Minister make a full public disclosure on the information available regarding the ore find at Galmoy on the Laois-Kilkenny border?</P>
      <P>It is well known, certainly as far as the media are concerned, that there has been a major zinc discovery in the area but the Minister has not given any details.  In response to a question I tabled on 3 July the Minister would not even say if a feasibility study, completed by the mining company, had been submitted to the Department.  He would only say that no application had been submitted to him for a mining lease.  The refusal of the Minister to supply the Dáil with information on the discovery is extraordinary because <i>The Financial Times,</i> in referring to the Galmoy discovery, said that Ireland now seems certain to provide a substantial new source of zinc to replace some of Western Europe's rapidly declining output.  The same article quoted the chairman and chief executive of Conroy Petroleum and Natural Resources as saying that he hoped there would be pilot production by the end of 1991 and that the mine would be at full capacity a year later.  It is extraordinary.  How can the chairman claim that, when the Minister said that the company have not even applied for a mining lease?  If that is true, is all this information false?  Has there not been any discovery?  Is it all a hoax? If the Minister has information why does he refuse to give it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main concern is that the appalling mistakes made by previous Governments in relation to the Tara ore body &mdash; I hesitate to mention Bula &mdash; should not be repeated in the case of Galmoy.  If the same mistakes are made, then the <Col N="1820" /> Galmoy ore body will make a lot of money for Conroy Petroleum and Natural Resources, whose chairman and chief executive is a Fianna Fáil member of the Oireachtas, but it will be of little value to the Irish people.</P>
    <P>The Tara ore body, which was discovered in the early seventies, came into production in the late seventies and was probably even more significant than the Galmoy find, but inept handling by the then Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government meant that the Navan find made virtually no contribution to the economy or to job creation.  I came into the Dáil in 1982 and every six months since then I asked a question about royalties or tax paid by Tara.  They did not pay one penny in tax or royalties for 12 years of production.  The main reason for this was that the flawed lease granted by the Coalition Government provided for the payment of royalties based on the company's liabilities for corporation tax. As a result of good accountancy and our lax tax laws Tara were able to avoid paying any corporation tax or royalties. The issue of royalties was finally disposed of as part of the deal in which the Government sold their shareholding in Tara Mines.  The Government accepted a paltry £16 million in respect of the full and final discharge of the previous 12 years and all future royalties due to the State.  No matter what the production will be in the future, £16 million covered the lot.  This was supposed to be a great deal. Surely it must be considered the sale of the century given the fact that Tara Mines, during the period from 1977 to 1989, exported ore concentrates to the value of £800 million?</P>
    <P>The very extensive lesson learned from the Tara affair is that all future mining leases, including Galmoy &mdash; if there is a deposit and an application for a lease &mdash; must have as a central feature the payment of a royalty on every tonne of ore extracted.  That is the only way you will get royalties and it was obvious, from the beginning, that Tara would never pay royalties.  Unless royalties are based on ore extracted, nothing will come from Galmoy either.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1821" /> The failure of the Government to ensure that a smelter was built in this country means that the ore from Tara, the ore from Silvermines Lead and Zinc Company and the ore from Tynagh Mines &mdash; both of which have left desolate areas in the south-west and west &mdash; was exported in its raw, unprocessed state and made no contribution to job creation, apart from a couple of hundred people digging it out of the ground.  It will probably all be gone in ten to 15 years, leaving a huge hole in the Navan area.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, lead and zinc concentrates with a value of over £800 million have been exported, creating jobs abroad.  If the Galmoy ore body, is as big as the media and <i>The Financial Times</i> lead us to believe, we must reassess the whole use of our mineral resources and there is a stronger case than ever for the building of a smelter here.  The IDA drew up plans for a smelter in the mid-seventies and Rio Tinto Zinc were invited to do a feasibility study.  Naturally, since they had two or three smelters in Europe which were crying out for ore, their feasibility study decided that it was not feasible in Ireland since there were smelters under capacity in Europe.  Tara have been able to supply about three of them from their production.  If we built a smelter, with the amount of production from Tara, we would not be able to use it all in a year because the production of ore is huge.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in her opening remarks that the ESB now have excess electricity which is a major requirement for a smelter.  When a smelter was being assessed the ESB would not have been able to produce sufficient electricity to service it but it is now feasible, particularly as we will have an interconnector to the European gas supply from Siberia right across to this county.  With cheap electricity, the feasibility of a smelter becomes much better.  There is enormous job creation potential from smeltered ore and, given our appalling level of unemployment, it would be criminal if the Government failed to ensure that Galmoy deposits and the remaining ore <Col N="1822" /> from Tara were not used to create jobs here instead of abroad.</P>
    <P>It is often asked why the Nordic economies &mdash; Norway, Sweden, Finland, etc. &mdash; are far more dynamic and powerful than ours.  After all, the population of Norway is the same as our own State. One single fact stands out, they have industrialised on the basis of the resources which they had, whether it is fish, timber or minerals.  That is why Finland have a State company, Outokumbu, controlling their mineral resources. When they run out of mineral resources for a particular smelter the State company purchase mineral resources abroad. We are in the embarrassing position that a State company from Finland, who have a smelter but no ore, take over our ore body and our Government hand over their share to them.  They send our ore to Finland where they create not only jobs from it but whole industries.  It goes into thousands of jobs keeping towns and factories going in the manufacture of various products from our lead and zinc.  Therefore, I call on the Minister for a full assessment and information on the Galmoy find and I call again for the building of a smelter.</P>

      <P>I thank all the spokepersons for their contributions this evening, and I apologise for the absence of my colleague, the Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, who could not be here to take this Estimate.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us respond first to Deputy Bruton in relation to the Government's decision to accede to the Helsinki Protocol.  It is indeed the Government's decision to do that and that was outlined in the environmental action plan published last January. I am aware of the Deputy's concern in relation to the levels of nitrous oxide, sulphur dioxide and so on.  As he is aware, the ESB are in the process of fitting <Col N="1823" /> nitrous burners at Moneypoint at a cost of £7 million and those burners are being fixed efficiently and effectively in order not to cause any disturbance of supply and so on to the consumer.  The level of sulphur dioxide is about 135,000 tonnes per annum.  When I was making regulations in relation to the banning of bituminous coal earlier this year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I also set down very strict standards for sulphur content, a standard of 1.5, in order to ensure that we keep sulphur dioxide levels to a minimum.  The Government's policy is that the ESB should use low sulphur coal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to allow us to accede to the Protocol, the policy of the Government is that the ESB should use low sulphur coal at Moneypoint and, if necessary, scrubbers will be fitted.  Those matters are being examined, but we are determined to accede to that Protocol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Deputy Bruton's comments on the Radiological Protection Institute Bill, the Minister for Energy has said in this House and elsewhere he is prepared to bring forward amendments and to consider very favourably any <Col N="1824" /> amendments brought forward by Opposition Deputies.  He is bringing forward a number of amendments himself and his wish is that that Bill will be as effective as possible.</P>
    <P>In relation to Sellafield, I have to take issue with Deputy Bruton, Deputy Pattison and Deputy Mac Giolla.  The Government's policy is to pursue this matter in the most effective way possible and the Government's wish is that Sellafield be closed down.  However, I think the Deputies will agree that it would be irresponsible for the Minister or the Government to take the British Government to court if there was not a very good chance of winning such a case.  The Minister has said, and this has been accepted by many of the environmental groups, that on the evidence currently available we could not sustain a case that would have any reasonable possibility of winning.  To take a case in those circumstances would be grossly irresponsible, a waste of taxpapers' money, nothing more than a public relations exercise and we would be rightly criticised if we were to engage in political opportunism of that kind.  An action of that kind if it were to fail would have a damaging and long-term effect and may well be seen as a vote of endorsement for Sellafield.</P>
    <P>Criticism was made of the level of expenditure on energy conservation.  This year it is £790,000, the highest since 1983-84. In the 1983-89 period the average expenditure per annum was £250,000 to £300,000.  It is now £790,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a very good start.  Obviously, one has to improve on that start with a view to making a serious effort towards energy conservation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to Whitegate.  As <Col N="1825" /> Deputies know, oil continues to meet about 45 per cent of our energy requirements. Any change in international prices obviously has a major impact on domestic energy costs.  It is the Government's policy and the Minister's intention to continue to up-grade the Whitegate Oil Refinery which will play a major part in the continuity of our oil supplies.  As the Deputies know, the task force have now reported and the report is being considered by the Department.  The Minister aims to minimise any diseconomy in the supply of oil at the Whitegate refinery and eventually dismantle the mandatory off-take regime.  Substantial capital investment will be necessary and the Government are committed to making the necessary investment.  However, Deputies will agree that that investment must be carefully considered and any rushed decision, not fully considering the task force's complex and comprehensive report, would be unwise and a waste of taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>In discussing Estimates it is important that we not just provide moneys for various public utilities and so on but that we get value for money and it is the Government's intention, in line with our financial policy, to ensure the taxpayers' money is wisely and properly spent.  That requires that full consideration be given not just to the task force report in relation to Whitegate but throughout Government Departments and the public service generally.</P>
    <P>In relation to Tara royalties and the sale of the State's assets, this is an old chestnut which is always brought up in these Estimates debates by Deputy Mac Giolla.  This matter was fully discussed during the Supplementary Estimate debate for this Department last December. The issues at that time were fully discussed.  In relation to Galmoy, no application has yet been made despite the media reports and it is not the Government's or the Minister's policy to let companies lie on rich ore bodies, as Deputy Mac Giolla indicated in his contribution.</P>

      <P>When an application is made the Minister, in conjunction with his Department, will give full consideration to that and the decision will be based on the best interests of the common good and the taxpayers.  I might add in relation to mining generally that it is now a requirement, as a result of the introduction of the environmental impact assessment procedure, that all mining applications have to be accompanied by an independent environmental impact assessment.  The Minister has said on a number of occasions that he will grant no mining licences until such an independent environmental impact assessment has been carried out by the developer.  I know the Deputies are pleased with the Minister's decision in relation to Croagh Patrick.  It is important that mining, which is necessary in order to exploit and explore our natural resources to the full and to generate wealth for this economy, is done in a way that is fully in consideration of environmental consequences.</P>
      <P>I think I have responded as fully as I can at the moment to many of the points made by Deputies.  I thank those who contributed.  Other issues that may not have been dealt with in my response may well be taken up subsequently by the Minister on his return.</P>

    <P>Pay and allowances, etc., account for 83.5 per cent of the total Estimates and show an increase of 9.3 per cent compared with 1989.</P>
    <P>As I have already announced, following publication of the Department of Justice Estimates last year, substantial additional resources are being committed to the Garda Síochána this year as part of a major crime fighting package.  The public want the reassurance of a visible Garda presence on our roads and streets and my crime fighting package is intended to ensure that the public get that reassurance.</P>
    <P>The allocation for the Garda Vote for this year shows an increase of 10 per cent on the allocation last year and allows for the following measures: the appointment of 250 civilian clerical staff to release gardaí from office work to perform outdoor crime prevention and detection duties; 200 additional promotions in the Garda Síochána to posts as sergeant, <Col N="1828" /> inspector, superintendent and chief superintendent level; an estimated 250 gardaí in the ranks of garda, sergeant and inspector who would be due to retire on reaching age 57 before the end of 1991 are being enabled to serve until age 60; and the pace of recruitment of 1,000 trainee gardaí is being accelerated.  348 trainees will be taken on during 1990, which is 50 more than originally planned. Some 260 young men and women will become fully attested members of the Force this year.  The first group of 82 were sworn in on 2 June and the majority of them have now taken up duty in the Dublin city centre area.</P>
    <P>Above and beyond the increase in Garda resources in 1990 which I have already mentioned, there is a number of further significant areas where additional resources are being made available.</P>
    <P>Additional funding is being provided for Garda overtime.  The allocation for 1990 is £10.5 million.  This represents an increase of £2.85 million on the provision for 1989.  Additional funding is also being provided for the purchase of Garda vehicles &mdash; an extra £250,000 and technical police equipment &mdash; an extra £250,000.  An increase of £500,000 is being made in the provision for Garda uniforms in 1990.</P>
    <P>Funding is being provided in 1990 to enable development of the Garda communications network to take place and thus to ensure that the Garda Síochána continue to be provided with the most modern communications technology. The Garda network has been operating very successfully for some time in the 18 Garda divisions outside the Dublin Metropolitan Area and the DMA system which incorporates a sophisticated computerised command and control system, which deals with &ldquo;999&rdquo; calls, came into operation in 1989.</P>
    <P>Additional funding has been provided for capital expenditure on Garda computerisation. The provision in 1990 is £395,000 that is almost double what it was last year.  Developments planned for 1990 include increasing the capacity of the Garda computer, linking additional <Col N="1829" /> Garda stations to this computer and developing new computer systems.</P>
    <P>All the measures I have outlined above are intended to increase the number of gardaí on the beat and to strengthen Garda resources in the fight against crime.  The increased allocations indicate my determination and the Government's determination that the Garda are provided with the resources, in terms of manpower and equipment, to fight crime and the criminal elements in our society.  As I have said time and again since becoming Minister for Justice, I intend to see to it that the number of gardaí available on the beat on our streets is maximised so as to provide the greatest possible protection for the citizens going about his or her lawful business, be it in the home, at work or on the street.</P>
    <P>Turning to crime, I am glad to be able to say that following a slight increase in the level of recorded indictable crime in 1988, the provisional figures for 1989 indicate a decrease over the 1988 level. The Garda authorities are continually involved in an ongoing process of assessing and adapting their strategies as the need arises to meet changing crime patterns. In the last number of years there has been a particular emphasis on dealing with crimes of violence.  The Garda authorities have informed me that their policies have met with some success and the provisional figures for 1989 show a substantial decrease in the level of armed crimes recorded throughout the whole country and particularly in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>The recent events, where gardaí confronted armed raiders in different parts of the country, demonstrate the continuing determination of the Force to apprehend the evil perpetrators of these robberies. In their difficult mission in seeking to prevent the successful perpetration of armed crime, the Garda deserve the whole-hearted support of the entire community.</P>
    <P>The continuing problem of attacks on tourists visiting our country is receiving a great deal of attention from the Garda. <Col N="1830" /> Measures being taken to tackle this problem include the deployment of additional Garda patrols, including gardaí on plain clothes duty in areas of high tourist interest.  Arrangements have been made with various bodies such as the Car Rental Council of Ireland, port authorities at Dún Laoghaire, regional tourism managers and the Irish Hotel Federation for the printing and distribution of leaflets which offer to tourists practical advice on such matters as car security and the safety of personal belongings.</P>
    <P>An important element in promoting police effectiveness is the Garda community policing scheme, which has proved to be a very successful way of putting the Garda in closer touch with the community they serve.  The number of community gardaí in Dublin now stand at 109, including 7 supervisors.  Essentially, what is involved in the community policing scheme, is the assignment of particular members on a full-time basis to patrol duties in specific areas.  The garda involved in each area participating in the scheme works the hours of greatest public activity in his or her area.  Through his or her work in this scheme, the garda becomes personally known to many individuals in the area.  People who might otherwise hesitate to approach the authorities about their crime and vandalism worries are greatly convenienced and reassured by this scheme.  The Garda Commissioner informs me that he is preparing a further expansion of the community policing scheme to take place shortly, now that the first batch of the new Garda trainees have become full members of the Force and taken up their assignments.</P>
    <P>The neighbourhood watch programme was developed to allow people play their part in preserving their own communities free from crime, working in close co-operation with the Garda Síochána.  The programme has achieved widespread success and there are now 831 schemes nationwide involving some 192,400 households.  The Garda authorities consider that these schemes have had a deterrent effect on the criminal, have <Col N="1831" /> improved co-operation and communication between the public and the gardaí, have increased awareness of home security and have lessened anxiety among participants about crime.</P>
    <P>A noteworthy development in recent months is the pharmacy watch scheme. This is a crime prevention programme on the lines of neighbourhood watch in which pharmacists and their staffs in an area agree to assist each other in co-operation with the Garda Síochána, to curb criminal attacks directed against chemists' shops for the purpose of getting drugs.</P>
    <P>These are all encouraging signs that more and more we are all playing our part in tackling the crime problem and, if we continue to work together, there is a great deal that we can do to beat the burglar, the vandal and the thief.</P>
    <P>The continued violent campaign of the Provisional IRA continues to pose a threat to us all both North and South.  We know that, unfortunately, the Provisional IRA have available to them large quantities of sophisticated weapons and explosives.  The Garda Síochána remain determined in their efforts to seek out and seize those weapons; in 1989, for example, 122 firearms, 24,712 rounds of ammunition and 1,824 pounds of explosives, including 60 pounds of semtex, were seized by the Force.  The Garda have continued that good work this year and continue to make regular finds of arms, ammunition and explosives.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the Prisons Vote.  The Estimate here allows for considerable developments in this area with estimated expenditure increasing from roughly £59 million in 1989 to £68 million in 1990. Among the principal developments provided for are the bringing into full operation of the new place of detention at Wheatfield, Clondalkin.  By the end of 1989, the first half of Wheatfield, comprising of 160 places, had been occupied and there are now 240 offenders detained there.  By the end of this year, the full complement of 320 offenders will be accommodated.  This represents considerable progress for Wheatfield is the <Col N="1832" /> first purpose built institution of its kind to be provided since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>Funds have also been provided for a new medical unit at Mountjoy Prison to cater for the special needs of about 60 offenders suffering from infectious diseases, including HIV/AIDS.  Other projects are the refurbishment of St. Patrick's institution and Mountjoy Women's Prison and I regard these as particularly desirable developments.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the coming on stream of the 300 or so extra places involved in these projects over the next 18 months to two years will not enable me to close any institution &mdash; pressure on accommodation is such that every place will have to continue in operation and to be maintained and upgraded as necessary. A sum of £8 million was allocated for this purpose in 1990 &mdash; £5 million for expenditure on capital works and £3 million for the maintenance of existing accommodation.  Work related to the upgrading of security and improvement of facilities generally is being undertaken in Mountjoy, Portlaoise, Limerick, Cork, Arbour Hill, Loughan House, Shelton Abbey, Fort Mitchel and Shanganagh Castle.</P>
    <P>The total allocation in the Estimates for salaries, wages and allowances is £47.599 million.  This represents a 14 per cent increase over the Estimate for 1989. This substantial increase reflects the cost of the additional staff required to operate the second phase of the occupation of Wheatfield, as well as additional costs arising in 1990 as a consequence of the public service pay agreement and the balance of a special pay award to prison service grades.</P>
    <P>The 1990 Estimate also reflects the aim, even at times of pressure on accommodation generally, to maintain the quality of regimes in the institutions at the highest possible level.  I would refer, for example, to the provisions made for education and work training programmes in the prisons and places of detention. An allocation of £315,000 is provided this year for education equipment and materials.  I should stress that this is only <Col N="1833" /> part of the overall cost involved in the provision of education in the prisons &mdash; there are the equivalent of 123 full-time teachers assigned and the cost of their salaries is borne by the vocational education committees.  In relation to work training programmes, an allocation of £725,000 is provided and this figure does not include the cost of the prison service staff involved.  There were other issues in relation to the courts and so on that I wanted to touch on but the Deputies can read about them in the script I circulated. I will be pleased to answer any questions put in the limited time available to me at the end of the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The manner in which the Minister was taken short indicates how ludicrous it is to expect any detailed or coherent debate on Estimates for more than £400 million in the short time available to us.  It is because of the time limit that my remarks will be general rather than concentrate on a detailed examination of the Estimates.</P>
      <P>The utter stupidity of the Taoiseach in appointing a part-time Minister for Justice is now becoming very obvious. From the foundation of the State the office of Minister for Justice has been a major and senior portfolio.  Very often, because of its law reform functions, a junior Minister has, in addition, been appointed.  For reasons which have never been explained, the Taoiseach has combined the office of Minister for Justice with that of Minister for Communications, has failed to appoint a Minister of State to either Department and, accordingly, must now bear responsibility for the utter failure of the Minister for Justice to discharge his functions properly and effectively.  Justice Minister Burke must, of course, share in this responsibility because of his willingness to participate in this arrangement by accepting both offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not for me to comment on the performance of Communications Minister, Deputy Burke.  Others have expressed very valid criticisms on that score.  My principal criticism is that a Minister who should be devoting his time <Col N="1834" /> and energies to a full range of functions in the Department of Justice has instead bogged himself down on the Broadcasting Bill and related matters.  He seems to be more concerned about opening and closing radio stations than about the very real problems of all our citizens in relation to crime and the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>The failures of our part-time Minister for Justice are manifold.  Many of his duties and responsibilities have been seriously neglected.  At times one has the impression that the Department of Justice are running on auto-pilot while the responsible Minister is concerning himself about other matters.  The Minister has failed to establish a comprehensive campaign against crime which now rates as the number one concern of the majority of our citizens.  With all due respect, referring to slight increases up or down is not relevant.  In the forties the number of recorded indictable crimes was 15,000; in the sixties it had gone up to 25,000 and we are now talking about 90,000.  That is the scale of the problem and it requires unremitting attention from a Minister if it is to be comprehensively tackled.  The Minister has failed to accept the need for and the request of the Garda representative bodies for a commission to review the role and effectiveness of the Garda Síochána. The Minister has failed to understand the need to update and consolidate our antiquated, Victorian criminal laws which at this stage are a boon to criminals who so often exploit the loopholes.  Here again the advice of the DPP has been ignored.  My proposals to establish a criminal law reform commission have been consistently rejected.</P>
    <P>The Minister has failed to appreciate the necessity for penal reform and has largely ignored the recommendations of the Whitaker report.  He has not even responded to my request for a Dáil debate on the issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also failed the victims of crime and to respond to the legitimate concerns expressed on their behalf.  Proposals for a system of restitution and <Col N="1835" /> compensation have been ignored, the reorganisation of the Criminal Injuries Tribunal has been neglected and the Minister is impervious to the feelings of those victims whose attackers receive over-lenient sentences.</P>
    <P>The Minister has failed to ensure the setting up of a Dáil Committee on Crime and, in fact, he has impeded the re-constitution of this committee by insisting on a Government chairman of a committee with a Government majority, thus breaking established precedent.</P>
    <P>The Minister has failed to avail of a golden opportunity now being offered to close the loopholes in relation to our bail laws.  I have offered Fine Gael co-operation to get the legislation through the House so that the necessary referendum can coincide with the presidential election in November.  Again, the Minister, while he agrees that there is a problem and that a referendum is the only solution, failed to act.</P>
    <P>The Minister has failed to allow the Garda Síochána Complaints Board to do this job as provided by statute and deliberately presided over a scene where the board have been unable to investigate a single complaint made since August 1989.  The damaging effects on public confidence and on morale in the Garda have been highlighted in the recent reports of the board which, as yet, have not been published by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister has failed to take any effective steps to deal with the chaos in the Land Registry.  In fact, he has presided over a situation where arrears and delays have virtually doubled during his relatively short term of office.  His inertia has resulted in many thousands of people being put to substantial loss as they are unable to obtain their title documents.</P>
    <P>The Minister has failed to undertake a programme of law reform.  Essentially, the legislation from his Department which has been dealt with in the Dáil since his appointment was largely inherited from his predecessor.  The joint Programme for Government promised a major programme of civil and criminal law reform.  Where are the promised <Col N="1836" /> changes involving the process of codifying the criminal law?  Where are the new laws in relation to libel?  Indeed, where are the promised laws in relation to phone tapping?  Similarly, court reorganisation involving the new Civil Court of Appeal and a promised scheme for family courts have not appeared.</P>
    <P>Nowhere is the failure of the Minister for Justice more obvious than in relation to extradition.  Fine Gael believe that no person charged with offences of violence against the person or offences relating to firearms or explosives should be entitled to hide behind the political offence exemption in the extradition Acts as currently constituted.  The Minister is fully aware of the gaping loopholes opened as a consequence of the Finucane and Carron decisions in the Supreme Court.  Yet he stands transfixed in a time warp using as his defence the need for further court decisions before he will take any action. Does he realise the logical consequence of this approach?  Very simply, it will involve those with blood on their hands walking free out of our courts because of the Minister's failure to act now.</P>
    <P>There is no point in the Minister attempting to obscure his failures behind phrases and language which are merely a cover-up for inactivity.  The case of Donna Maguire is a clear example of this. A request for a clear statement of the facts in this case has been met with evasion and ultimately three statements from Government sources, none of which gave the facts and which were themselves conflicting. The refusal to give basic facts has been justified on totally spurious grounds What I sought were matters of fact relative to the actions of the Minister for Justice and not matters of prejudice affecting a person now facing criminal charges in another jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The Minister has failed to give the facts.  He has obscured his inactivity behind verbiage and merely stated that &ldquo;the application for extradition was appropriately dealt with as soon as the legal advisers on the matter had satisfied themselves as to the action that should be taken&rdquo;.  What does this mean?  I challenge the Minister to give the facts of this case <Col N="1837" /> and to reply to the following questions: Was a request for extradition made?  By whom was it made?  When was it made? Was further information sought under the Extradition Act and was an order made and, if so, when?</P>
    <P>Before he replies to this challenge, may I convey to him that information has just now come to my attention that the reason for the failure to extradite in this case was that a warrant was not issued until the day after the accused had been acquitted in the Special Criminal Court and had left the country.  I challenge the Minister to confirm or deny whether this is a fact; it can lead only to one conclusion, at best confirming indolence and inactivity on the part of the Minister and at worst total ambivalence on the whole question of extradition.</P>
    <P>The catalogue of failures of the present part-time Minister for Justice is as long as your arm.  It is clear that the demand of the Dáil now should be for the appointment of a full-time Minister for Justice. That must presuppose the present Minister resigning either as Minister for Justice or as Minister for Communications. If his present record is maintained the demand will be that he resign from both positions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Office of Minister for Justice is perhaps one of the most onerous and demanding offices in Cabinet and puts enormous pressures on the individual concerned and his family, in terms of security.  In the normal course of events the Minister for Justice should have the support of this House in carrying out the functions of that office.  However, in the case of Deputy Burke, who is both Minister for Justice and Minister for Communications, I firmly believe, as I have said in the past, that it was bad judgment on the part of the Taoiseach to give an individual Member of this House responsibility for any other Ministry while carrying the very demanding and severe burden of the Office of Minister for Justice.  Given that his remit covers the prisons, courts, crime, the Garda Síochána, the Land Registry and so on, <Col N="1838" /> it is an enormous responsibility. Furthermore, given the other functions he is charged with on behalf of the citizens I suggest to the Taoiseach that it is now time we returned to the position where we have a full-time Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>It is quite clear that each of the areas for which the Minister has responsibility are in need of immediate attention.  In many instances, the Department are very much behind in terms of the work being done on legislation to be introduced in the House.  We will find it very difficult to support the Minister on the various aspects of his portfolio.  The legal aid scheme manifested itself in a most blatant manner in recent months.  The chairman of the board, a respected member of the legal profession, resigned in frustration because of the failure of the Minister to bring about the minimum changes in the legal aid scheme.  The chairman and senior members had no choice &mdash; if they had any respect for themselves &mdash; but to resign from the board.  That was an indictment of the Government's failure to support both the board and the legal aid scheme.  Deputy Collins, the previous occupant of the office, made clear pledges in this House, on the judicial separation Bill, that the scheme would be supported and extra resources allocated but, unfortunately, nothing has been done and resources have not been provided, with the result that the benefits of this legislation can be availed of only by those with cash.  Those who cannot afford the fees are being denied justice because of the failure of the Minister and the Government to support the legal aid scheme.</P>
      <P>The chairman of the Garda Complaints Board admitted in public in recent weeks that they are at a standstill, with the result that any confidence the public may have had has been undermined.  They are unable to process claims.  Indeed, they have made it clear to the public that their chances of ever eliminating the backlog are minimal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much debate on the prisons in recent weeks and it appears the Minister has little or no interest in the recommendations of the Whitaker <Col N="1839" /> report.  Certain improvements are being made and I urge the Minister to ensure that the conditions for female prisoners in particular are improved as quickly as possible.  It is important in the short-term that facilities are improved for women prisoners who are incarcerated in the most appalling conditions.</P>
    <P>The Minister had also failed to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána. Despite the public advertisements carried in recent years the shortage of numbers has become manifest in recent months.  Having regard to the extra responsibilities placed on them during the Presidency the Garda found themselves stretched but, to be fair to them, they did an excellent job and accepted the extra responsibilities placed on them.  I have to say, however, that the Minister placed a very unfair burden on them, given the increasing crime rate.  Against this, they have achieved an excellent success rate in tackling the most severe forms of crime, such as armed robbery.  The Garda deserve the support of this House and the best way of showing this is to ensure they have adequate numbers and resources to face the severe task they are confronted with which could result in many instances, as happened late last week, of members putting their lives on the line. They have done so without fear in recent months and for this they deserve the support of this House.</P>
    <P>In his contribution the Minister referred to the increase in attacks against visitors to the city and the rest of the country.  I put it to the Minister that the only possible way of tackling this problem is to increase Garda numbers on the street.  The press have highlighted the attacks on tourists but it should be borne in mind that we are not only dealing with attacks on tourists but also with attacks on motorists who are being attacked on a daily basis while stopped at traffic lights. It is not good enough to say that he has asked the tourist board and tourist offices to hand out leaflets to tourists offering advice on how to protect their cars.  What we need to do is put more gardaí on the streets and if need be we can direct the <Col N="1840" /> Minister to the locations around the city where people are likely to have their cars broken into while stopped at traffic lights. There is an urgent need for the Minister to put gardaí back on the streets and increase their numbers which have fallen in recent years.  It is also quite clear that members are being recruited at a very slow pace.</P>
    <P>The Land Registry has been the subject of much discussion in this House.  I am at a loss to understand why this institution, which makes a profit, cannot transact their business in a more efficient manner. The staff of the Land Registry, despite enormous difficulties and obstacles, still find themselves in a ridiculous position. Twice, if not three times, within the past six months the issue of the 50,000 cases before the Land Registry has been before the House.  Indeed, the backlog is increasing by about 10,000 cases every three months.  Perhaps the Minister will explain the reason the Land Registry, which is capable of making profits and a return to the Exchequer, are not being given the resources and the necessary computer equipment to enable them carry out their business in an efficient and strictly commercial manner.  The staff have made numerous suggestions to the Minister but, unfortunately, these have been ignored.</P>
    <P>The number of issues to be dealt with in the Department of Justice are beginning to pile up.  For instance, the need for law reform, it would appear, is being ignored.  The reports of the Law Reform Commission are gathering dust at a time when they should be implemented by way of legislation.  If the Minister wishes to do this he will find that the House is only too willing to assist him in updating both our criminal and civil laws.  If the Minister does not take his responsibilities seriously and update the law we also will neglect our responsibilities and the matter will fall back on the courts.  It is unfortunate that in recent years the courts have had to take the initiative in terms of law reform whereas it should be taken by this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to contribute to the comment on the Minister's Estimate <Col N="1841" /> and to say that the session that will be completed here tomorrow has been remarkable for a number of reasons, first, not least because it was a session in which we debated for the first time in a long time a motion of no confidence in the person in the office of the Minister for Justice and Communications.  On 23 February last I first raised the issue, in view of clear inability, on the evidence of his performance in the House and in the workload simply going unattended, that Deputy Burke, as Minister should be relieved of one or other of the portfolios. That case still exists.  I repeat that it is time we had a full-time Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>In view of the areas of law reform and the particular attention that is needed regarding the development of issues within the Department within the Law Reform Commission and now, most importantly, as presented to us by the Fair Trade Commission report into Restrictive Practices in the Legal Profession, there is a case not only for a full-time Minister for Justice but also for that Department to be serviced by a Minister of State with responsibility for reform and development in areas of law reform. This session was also remarkable because we have one of the most significant documents ever to be issued in regard to the legal profession and which should present us with a major debate for consideration over the next few months, in the next session and beyond regarding the future of legal practice and the delivery of legal services generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that regard I would ask the Minister to clarify what role his Department will have to play with regard to the promotion and development of the ideas contained in that report.  I understand there is some confusion as to whether it will be within his remit or that of the Department of Industry and Commerce to address the issues raised and to advance them further. It is also a remarkable session because we entered it with an undertaking, as I recall from a joint Programme for Government, to have a committee on crime established.  Although the motion had been debated by the Whips for <Col N="1842" /> months prior to the opening of this session, and was put on the Order Paper, and has been there for a number of weeks, it fails to be moved by the Government and, in particular, by the Minister whose responsibility it was to see that it was in place.  However, we do not yet have the committee on crime as promised.  As a result the work of this House in this important area has been damaged.</P>
    <P>I said the publication of the Fair Trade Commission report was a remarkable development.  I am disappointed with the response of the Government.  It is one of the most comprehensive examinations undertaken of the legal profession for a long number of years.  It will have serious implications, not only for the legal profession but for our tired legal system, the public and the legal consumers.  It is disappointing that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, in response to its publication, should have dismissed the prospect of any fusion of the two sections of the legal profession within the next ten years.  It must be said also that the response of the legal profession has been disappointingly negative.  It has been long acknowledged that there is an urgent need to update legislation governing this area and the report of the Fair Trade Commission would certainly have been the basis for such new legislation.</P>
    <P>The legal profession will have to realise that we are on the verge of a new century and that legal practice and legal education will have to be developed to serve the needs of a modern society.  Ideally, this updating should be done on the basis of discussion and co-operation between the Oireachtas and the legal professions. However, in the end, if the legal professions are not prepared to act, the obligation would clearly be on this Oireachtas to do so.  It is clear from a cursory view of the report &mdash; which is all I have been capable of at this stage &mdash; that many of the proposals are profound in their nature and by definition will require a serious address of the issue of fusion of the professions. This small community, this island, cannot afford two elusive and <Col N="1843" /> expensive arms of the one profession.  I regret that the reaction of the Minister for Industry and Commerce was to put on the long finger the address of that issue by suggesting it will not happen within the next ten years.</P>
    <P>In the general context I would ask the Minister, when responding, to indicate when the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill will be before this Dáil for debate and discussion.  There is a clear need to address structural shortcomings in the solicitors profession, particularly in the area of the supply of solicitors in view of the amazing shortage now being exposed in the development of the Financial Services Centre and its related industries.  It is clear that access to legal education and to the profession generally must be addressed.  We cannot await conclusions on this weighty tome of the Fair Trade Commission to act in these areas.</P>
    <P>Generally, other areas of the Minister's remit stand in chaos.  Two important State boards for which he has responsibility &mdash; the Civil Legal Aid Board and the Garda Complaints Board &mdash; are operating in conditions approaching impossible existence.  I commend the acts of the two leading members of the solicitors and bar professions in resigning from the Civil Legal Aid Board as an act of protest.  I recognise that the Minister has not responded to their acts of bravery other than reappointing them and has not addressed the fundamental issues raised by their departure.  I recognise also that the chairman of the Garda Complaints Board has made it clear that the Minister should fund that board properly or simply disband it.  Any words of acknowledgment and gratitude to the Garda Síochána ring very hollow as regards their morale in view of the way in which the Garda Complaints Board cannot deal effectively and rapidly with the complaints against them.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed also at the failure of the Minister to ensure that the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Bill has not passed the Dáil.  It has been in circulation now for over 18 months and we have not yet embarked upon the Committee <Col N="1844" /> Stage.  It was the absence of the Minister through important Stages of that Bill and the fact that it was being taken piecemeal one day here &mdash; one day there &mdash; that led me in February to consider that it was time to call on the Government to address the need for a full-time Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>The public concern about our bail system is understandable in the light of a number of recent incidents in which persons on bail were found to be involved in further serious offences.  However, I would urge the Government to react with great caution to popular demands to end or unnecessarily restrict the right to bail. The right to bail cannot be separated from the principle, which is the cornerstone of our legal system, that a person is presumed innocent until convicted by a court of law.  Any general attack on the right to bail would be an attack on that principle.  The public should also realise that any significant withdrawal of the right to bail would lead to a far greater number of persons, including the innocent, spending long periods in jail awaiting trial.  Unless we are prepared to spend possibly hundreds of millions of pounds building additional cell space this will mean grossly over-crowded prisons, more jail deaths and the strong possibility of Strangeways type prison violence.</P>
    <P>It is right that the public be concerned when persons on bail commit serious offences but there are other ways of approaching the problem.  It should be noted, first, that the number of offences committed by persons on bail has fallen dramatically since the Criminal Justice Act was passed which provided for consecutive jail sentences in respect of offences committed while on bail. Second, the most effective way of ensuring that those on bail do not commit further offences is to speed up the process for bringing persons to trial.  At present it is not unusual for a gap of up to 18 months or even two years to elapse between a person being charged and actually coming to trial.  In that regard the concern about tourists and the need to deal effectively with their plight when <Col N="1845" /> attacked by thugs in the city and elsewhere can be addressed effectively by a speedy trial, ensuring that tourists are in a position to attend the court, give their evidence and for the case to be dealt with without delay.</P>
    <P>The provision of extra staff for the courts and a general modernisation of procedures would greatly speed up hearings. Another initiative that could be taken is the forfeiture of bail money if an offence is committed while on bail &mdash; in other words, requiring independent bail, rendering the person putting up bail responsible for not just ensuring that the defendant turns up for trial but also that the defendant is of good conduct while on bail.</P>
    <P>I make the point, as have many others, that the time available to us is ridiculously short to address in any serious manner the Minister's task, something which we, as spokespersons in Opposition, would like to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I want to pay tribute to the Minister for Justice on what is, coincidentally, the first anniversary of the foundation of this Coalition Government and also of his appointment as Minister. Throughout the year he has rightly received praise from all quarters on his performance as Minister for Justice.  I might express the hope that in the years ahead in the lifetime of this Government he will continue to build on that success. I have no doubt at all but that he will.</P>
      <P>The Minister faces an onerous task. Over the past 12 months we had ample evidence of the major strengths and weaknesses of our criminal justice system.  In relation to the strengths, the Garda, in particular, have excelled their previous proud record and time and time again have confronted dangerous, armed criminals successfully.  I should like to pay them due tribute on the courage they have displayed and their dedication to duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While on the subject of the Garda Síochána I want to congratulate the Minister on the steps he has taken to ensure that 1,000 additional gardaí will be provided within a three-year period.  That is <Col N="1846" /> a very positive move on his part.  I would urge him to take all necessary steps to ensure that these additional gardaí are deployed on our city streets, within our communities, particularly in built-up urban areas, where they can best assist in the war against crime and where they can act as major agents in the early detection and prevention of crime.  That is where they can best serve the community.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased to note that steps have been taken finally to recruit 250 additional civilian clerical staff in order to release gardaí who have been tied up for years on work that was not proper to them at all.  While much had been said on that issue over the years, it was not until this year that action was taken &mdash; another matter that pleases me enormously.</P>
    <P>The overall area of justice, law reform and the fight against crime has been accorded priority by the Progressive Democrats since the foundation of our party.  It was only natural that on the negotiation of the joint Programme for Government we were particularly pleased to incorporate solid commitments on action in relation to law reform.  We have witnessed some of the positive consequences of that programme in recent weeks with the passage of legislation abolishing the death penalty. Having said that, I would be the first to admit that the pace of progress has been uneven and, in many instances, much too slow.  Many outstanding reforms remain to be tackled.  I have no doubt at all that in the course of the coming year the pace of reform will be intensified and quickened. I would urge the Minister to ensure that this is brought about.  In particular there is need to tackle major issues such as the codification of our criminal law, the necessity for which daily becomes clearer.  Far too much of our criminal law is disgracefully outdated.  For example, the major legislation on offences against the person is 129 years old and the major statute on offences against property 74 years old.  If action is not taken soon we shall find ourselves in the ridiculous position in which we will face into the <Col N="1847" /> 21st century with legislation properly belonging to the 19th century.</P>
    <P>There are two matters I want to address in particular in the time available to me.  One is the law in relation to bail, addressed in some detail by Deputy McCartan, and in a thoughtful manner. There was one point he made with which I thoroughly agree.  He recommended a measure which ought and can be taken in advance of any constitutional amendment, that is, the forfeiture of bail moneys.  When a person out on bail commits another serious crime, particularly one of armed robbery, the courts should be empowered to automatically and immediately seize that bail money.  This would have a salutory effect.</P>

      <P>There were a number of other matters I would certainly have liked to address.  I might request the Minister to address himself in particular to the problems occasioned by uninsured drivers on our roads.  There is another measure which could easily be implemented &mdash; again without any major discussion and one I would recommend &mdash; which is that drivers of uninsured vehicles ought have their vehicles impounded there and then and not be permitted to reclaim them until they can produce a valid insurance certificate and pay the appropriate fine.  The Victorians were able to do so with regard to wandering animals.  Surely we can do so in relation to uninsured drivers causing such havoc in so many ways to upright, lawabiding citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been flabbergasted at the contribution of the spokesperson for the Progressive Democrats, particularly her initial preface of congratulation to the Minister for Justice on a job well done.  This is another example of a script utilised for this House.  There are the scripts for party conferences in Galway, perhaps the most <Col N="1848" /> important ones emanating from progressive democracy in the Law Library. It all smacks of gross hypocrisy.  I would hope that Deputy Quill and her party colleagues would reflect on the contributions of former Deputy Colley and indeed her Cabinet colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Harney, on what they had to say on matters pertaining to justice and law reform when on this side of the House for a short period between the years 1987 and 1989.</P>
      <P>As all previous speakers have said, the time available does not allow us deal adequately with the many matters warranting attention.  Indeed, it is ironic that over the past four or five weeks it was the Minister for Justice, wearing his communications hat, who ensured that this Estimate, like others, would be subjected to a meaningless debate in so far as time is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might address myself to one topic: the fact that the legal aid shambles continues. In spite of Dáil motions of pledges by the Minister, promises on the part of his predecessor, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the resignations of the chairman and board members of the Legal Aid Board in February last, the crisis has escalated.  The Government have consistently refused to acknowledge the problem obtaining within this service while tens of thousands of our citizens are denied access to legal services.  The fact of the matter is that genuine cases will never reach the law courts because of the inadequacies of the legal aid system. Last December the Minister for Justice announced a package, including the appointment of additional staff to the Legal Aid Board &mdash; seven solicitors and 13 administrative staff.  This is repeated verbatim on the final page of the Minister's introductory remarks which he was unable to read in the House.  The Minister has admitted that nothing has changed in spite of those resignations, the longer queues and, more particularly, the ever increasing numbers of people attempting to avail of legal aid as a consequence of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act of 1989, an Act that would <Col N="1849" /> never have seen the light of day were it not for the contributions of the Fine Gael benches.  The fundamental weakness is lack of funds.  It is shameful that the Minister for Justice remains silent and inactive on this issue.</P>
    <P>There are lengthy waiting lists at the 12 full-time centres throughout the country with average delays running from six weeks in some of the Dublin ones to two or three months in the rural ones.  The centre in Mullingar is closed.  The centre in Portlaoise has ceased operating since March 1989.  The system needs an urgent cash injection and the Minister for Justice must stand accused for inactivity in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Legal Aid Board have filled a number of positions but difficulty has arisen in so far as the bad public profile and the stress-laden working conditions render the position of legal aid solicitor most unattractive.  Again the Minister must stand accused as far as the bad public profile of these positions is concerned. Barristers who assist the legal aid centres in the higher courts are being paid on a scale which is far less than operates outside the legal aid centres.  That again is leading towards the creation of a two-tier system and that is certainly not desirable.</P>
    <P>Eighty per cent of cases being handled through the legal aid centres are family law matters.  Since the passing of the 1989 Act there has been a huge increase in demand for legal aid.  These cases are only beginning to become manifest now. The problems of the future will be even greater.  Laws are introduced into this House to benefit society and law reform is meaningless without proper access to redress.  The concept of equality before the law rings hollow in the light of the present shambles, and the Minister for Justice stands accused.</P>

      <P>Thank you for your co-operation in the matter of time.  Deputy Noel Dempsey has five minutes maximum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the opportunity of speaking on the Estimates in order <Col N="1850" /> to make one or two points.  I note the important legislation that the Minister has passed in relation to the abolition of the death penalty.  This legislation has been sought for a considerable length of time.  It has been sought over the terms of many Governments.  None of them did anything about it, and the Minister deserves to be commended for taking action on that at last.</P>
      <P>I would also like to commend the Minister on the programme he has started for the recruitment of extra gardaí and on providing additional resources for the Garda for overtime, equipment and communications. Already the effects of the recent batch of recruits working in the city can be seen and has been acknowledged by everybody including many groups outside this House who have been calling for years for increased crime fighting sources.</P>
      <P>In regard to the reorganisation of Garda resources in the constituency of Meath, there is a particular problem.  The same could be said for Kildare and Wicklow which are adjacent to the Dublin Metropolitan area.  Maybe because the policing in Dublin has become so much more effective, we are suffering from an overspill of crime which is based in Dublin.  Places like Dunboyne, Ashbourne, Dunshaughlin and Kilcock are now being hit by criminal gangs from Dublin because they are so close to Dublin.  I would ask the Minister, if he has not already addressed this, to have discussions with the Garda with a view to reorganising the situation to increase the Garda strength in the areas adjacent to Dublin so that this problem that has arisen over the last number of years can be tackled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to Garda and Garda time, I would make one other suggestion.  It seems that an inordinate amount of Garda time is taken up with matters related to road traffic, insurance, weights, parking etc. throughout the country.  Instead of having a road traffic corps within the Garda we should have a separate road traffic corps separate altogether from the Garda to deal with matters relating to traffic, roads and <Col N="1851" /> transport.  The whole area of road traffic control is becoming much more complex. There are EC directives in regard to weights and measures.  There is the problem of uninsured drivers and people who do not pay their tax.  All of these areas take up valuable Garda time.  Some consideration should be given to allowing the Garda to get on with the major job of security.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the short time available to me I would first like to congratulate the Garda on the manner in which they successfully apprehended the bank robbers who carried out the raid in Leixlip just a week ago.  I would especially repeat what has been said in this House on many occasions in relation to bail laws.  One of the things that emanates from all this is the absolute necessity to change the bail laws in the case of serious crime.  There is no way that a person attempting to hold up a bank or any other financial institution using firearms or other weapons should expect to get bail. If a constitutional amendment is required, let us have it as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>At Question Time the other day the Minister correctly indicated that since 1984 there had been a drop in the number of crimes committed by people while on bail.  The problem now is that there is a hard core of people involved.  I would have to disagree entirely with Deputy Maureen Quill's suggestion that bail would be confiscated in those cases.  I do not think that would be a deterrent at all, but would set up a whole new industry.  I call on the Minister, as a matter of urgency, to look at that situation and try to meet the requirements as set down by my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to address two other aspects that the Minister might concern himself with.  One is in relation to the scanning devices that are now available. When persons involved in full-time crime set themselves up, the first thing they set themselves up with is good transport, the next is fire power and, after that, communications. There are readily available <Col N="1852" /> on the open market devices about the size of a pocket calculator with which the criminal can tune in to Garda patrol cars and, I am told, in certain circumstances, they have been able to cut through the scrambling system.  I do not know whether that is possible.  A constituent of mine has, however, brought it to my attention that he can, at any time, get a device which can, without any difficulty at all, link into all radio and telephone calls anywhere in the country.  They have been able to link in and obtain classified information in relation to directions, locations and so on.  This is happening.  I am told this by a law abiding citizen who knows what he is talking about because he is involved in the electronics industry.</P>
    <P>I have already put down two parliamentary questions to the Minister on this issue.  We all accept that it is illegal to intercept telephone or radio conversations. The point at issue is how to control it, and that is at the point of sale. We should make sure that those devices do not get into the country.  I have information to the effect that a car used by subversives or somebody involved in crime was found recently in a certain constituency and was shown to contain a gun and one of these scanning devices. If those devices are being used to that extent, they have now become a necessity as far as the average criminal is concerned. Information is important to criminals.  There is no earthly reason those devices should be allowed to be sold in the way they are.  There is a licensing system.  There are people who are entitled to have them, but people who have them for illegal purposes or people who are subversives have no right to have them or to have access to them.  I would ask the Minister to ensure, during the next session of the Dáil, or before that by order, that such devices are not available for sale, and the way to control them is at the point of entry.</P>

      <P>As has been mentioned by nearly all speakers, the time is very limited and Deputies will understand if I do not reply to each individual point that has been made.  It <Col N="1853" /> would be impossible to do so in five minutes, but I can assure them a careful note has been taken of the points they made and I will see what can be done in relation to them.  The concern of the Deputies in relation to the pressure on my family and on my life generally in relation to carrying the two portfolios of Justice and Communications is appreciated. I can assure them I am fully capable and committed to ensuring that my responsibility in these two areas is met in the fullest way.</P>
      <P>As far as the Estimate for Justice is concerned, the key area of justice is security for our people on the streets, in their places of work and in their homes. I appreciate, on behalf of the Garda, the expressions of support for what they are doing and how they are going about their task.  It is vitally important that Members of this House are seen to be supportive of the Garda.  As was mentioned, they are putting their lives on the line on a daily basis on our behalf, and on behalf of the citizens of the country.  Last Friday there was in incident which resulted in an unfortunate loss of life and the Garda were there defending our citizens.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy Quill for her expression of support for the extra gardaí who are being recruited and the 250 civilians who are being appointed to release gardaí from clerical duties and let them out on the streets to do work for which they are trained.  They are not trained as clerical officers but as law enforcement officers and guardians of the peace.  It is my intention in the period ahead to ensure that we have extra recruits and that the gardaí are out on the streets where they should be rather than in offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of prisons, it is no harm to repeat that since becoming Minister for Justice, I have given particular attention to improvements in the prison service.  No administration since the foundation of the State has done as much in such a short time in relation to the prison system.  For example, a sentence review group has been established to bring together the best expert advice available on complex problems such as prison deaths and infectious diseases. <Col N="1854" /> Wheatfield prison has been brought fully into operation.  St. Patrick's Institution, and the women's prison, are to be completely refurbished and a new unit is being provided to cater for offenders with special medical needs.</P>
    <P>The Fair Trade Commission's report on their study into restrictive practices in the legal profession has been published by my colleague, Deputy O'Malley, Minister for Industry and Commerce, to whom the matter was addressed.  Submissions on the commission's recommendations have been invited from the public before 7 September, and therefore there is no long-fingering of the matter. The Government have made no decision on specific recommendations in advance of the public debate on the issues involved.  Pending completion of that stage and subsequent decisions by the Government on the commission's recommendations, it is premature to make a commitment about implementing the commission's recommendations or to talk in hard and fast terms as to how the recommendations will be implemented and by whom.  As regards who is responsible, the matter transcends two Departments. For example, the consumer aspect is the responsibility of the Department of Industry and Commerce while primary responsibility for legislative control over the legal profession rests, as it will, with the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Garda Complaints Board, the board staffing level was originally set at five and was then increased to six.  I have secured additional resources to bring the number to ten at this stage. I acknowledge there is a problem in that area but we are trying to come to grips with it.  Everything cannot be done at once because resources are scarce and it is a matter of cutting the cloth according to measure.</P>
    <P>As far as the Land Registry are concerned, I can assure Deputies we are allocating 20 per cent more money to the Land Registry this year and they will also get additional staff.  Most important of all, there is a new active management in place.  A new registrar was appointed <Col N="1855" /> in recent months.  She is doing an excellent job and has reorganised the whole management structure of the Land Registry. I appreciate the Deputies concern in relation to delays but I can assure them the registrar is coming to grips with them.</P>
    <P>As far as the question of law reform is concerned, we have already brought a number of Bills before the House such as the Larceny Bill, the Bill dealing with the death penalty, which was referred to by Deputy Quill, the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Bill, the Prohibition of Incitement to Racial, Religious or National Hatred Bill, the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Bill, the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Bill and the Statute of Limitations Bill, but I acknowledge that there is much more to be done in the whole area of law reform. As Deputies are aware, we held the Presidency of the EC for the last six months.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Regulations in draft:</P>
      <P>Bovine Diseases (Levies) Regulations, 1990,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>copies of which were laid in draft <Col N="1859" /> before Dáil Éireann on 27th June, 1990.</P>
    <P>The proposed Regulations are being made under the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Act, 1979.  Their purpose is to provide an increased financial contribution towards the cost of the bovine TB and brucellosis eradication schemes.  The additional funds are required primarily to fund the bovine TB eradication scheme which was initiated as long ago as 1954.  By 1965 the level of infection had been greatly reduced but unfortunately progress since then has been very disappointing.  Various explanations have been advanced for this failure with the unfortunate tendency to each of the interest groups involved to blame the others.  The Government, therefore, in a new initiative established ERAD in 1988 with a management board made up of these interest groups.  In this way it was hoped that a co-operative spirit would be developed which would enable sectional interests to work together towards the objective of disease eradication.  ERAD were established with a Government commitment to maintain their financial contribution to the running costs of the eradication scheme at £31.585 million and to maintain bovine disease levies at £22 million.</P>
    <P>Every Member of the House will be aware that this was a unique commitment given the overriding need to restore order to our public finances.  The basis of the financing was that the farming community and the Government would fund the running costs in a ratio of approximately 2 to 1 and so a 50:50 basis when allowing for the costs of administration. Both the Government contribution and the rates of disease levies were increased in 1989 to provide for increased rates of grants to farmers for reactors.  For some years before ERAD was established about 30,000 reactors were discovered each year and the finances for ERAD were broadly based on this level of extraction. However, the vigorous programme which ERAD implemented in 1989 identified 43,400 reactors.  While the increase <Col N="1860" /> in the number of reactors might be seen as a cause of concern, one could equally interpet it as an indication of progress. Indeed this is my interpretation.  The increased effort and expense incurred will be wasted if the necessary measures to finish the job are not accepted by all concerned and strenuously pursued.</P>
    <P>I want to give full recognition to the improvements to the scheme which ERAD have brought about.  For example, special measures were introduced aimed at high risk herds and blackspot areas.  A reactor collection service was introduced to ensure that reactors are removed as quickly as possible.  This service is provided free of charge to the herdowner and experience has shown that factory quotations are better under this system that those available to individual farmers.</P>
    <P>For some time the Government have been giving serious consideration to these schemes and they have concluded that a number of aspects still require improvement. There is general agreement that the present provision whereby a pre-movement test is required before an animal may be moved unless it has been tested within four months does not provide adequate protection against lateral spread of infection.  This is particularly important given the huge number of animal movements, which are estimated at 12 million per annum.  In other words, a proper pre-movement test is critical to the success of the scheme.  Various suggestions have been put forward to improve the situation, including a 30 day pre-movement test and a 60 day two stop test.  This latter system would permit one further movement within seven days of a sale within the 60 days.  I have considered the situation carefully and I consider that a reasonable compromise which would be fair to all sides and which would not unduly disrupt the cattle trade would be to introduce a 45 day pre-movement test. I have seen suggestions that this change will cost farmers an extra £10 million.  I do not know the basis for this figure but it is unreasonable to look at a pre-movement test in terms of cost without taking any account of the benefit.  The cost of <Col N="1861" /> buying-in an infected animal is much greater than any test.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to refute a belief which seems to have gained a certain amount of currency.  I refer to the suggestion that only about 40 per cent of reactors prove to have TB on <i>post-mortem</i> examination.  I emphasise that the absence of visible lesions on <i>postmortem</i> examination is not proof that the animal in question is not infected.  It is essential, if we are to make progress in the elimination of the disease, that all animals which react to the tuberculin test are removed and that this necessity is accepted by the farming community.  It is the best test currently available to us.</P>
    <P>The Government have accepted that additional funding for ERAD is necessary. While it is not possible at this stage to predict accurately the number of reactors which will be disclosed in the current round it is clear, nevertheless, that the number will exceed the capacity of the ERAD budget.  The same will apply for 1991.  ERAD are facing a shortfall in this year alone of up to £13 million and this budgetary problem will have to be resolved if the current programme is to continue.  It would be unreasonable to expect all this amount to come directly from the Exchequer and the taxpayer generally.  It has, therefore, been decided that as and from 1 August 1990 the rates of bovine diseases levies will be increased from £6.90 to £7.90 per animal slaughtered or exported live, and from 1.2p to 1.4p per gallon of milk received for processing. The increases in the levies are estimated to yield over £1 million in 1990 and approximately £3.5 million in a full year.  These new rates will have to be maintained until such time as the farmer-Exchequer funding ratio of 2:1 is restored.</P>
    <P>The Government have agreed that the Exchequer will provide £9 million extra this year and this signifies their commitment to the eradication programme. Therefore, the Exchequer will be meeting more than its share of the shortfall this year, a point which seems to have been forgotten by those who have been so critical of other aspects of the scheme. <Col N="1862" /> The provision of adequate financial resources is the cornerstone of a successful eradication programme.  Stop-go funding has traditionally been identified as the main culprit in the lack of success. Stop-go funding is no longer a problem and the Government are determined to keep it that way.  Even with adequate funding, the detailed elements should operate to the highest standards of efficiency.  The quality of testing has become a cause of some concern in recent times.  In this regard, I am pleased that ERAD have set up a quality control monitoring system as well as introducing new procedures to deal with cases of below standard testing.  On the question of the testing arrangements generally, I have accepted a recommendation from the ERAD board which would allow for a detailed examination to be carried out with a view to achieving appropriate improvements for the 1991 testing programme. That is the earliest it can be done.  In addition, the establishment of a task force to carry out a certain amount of testing is being examined at present within ERAD.</P>
    <P>The involvement of wildlife has come under the spotlight.  This is an emotive subject and, because of the strong views on either side, the debate tends to generate more heat than light.  The Government have agreed that ERAD can carry out projects in two black spot areas and I believe that this, plus the normal licences issued for survey purposes by the Office of Public Works, will provide a useful and worthwhile programme on the ground.</P>
    <P>In the area of research ERAD are engaged in several different projects at present.  By far the most important is the work being done into the development of a blood based test for TB which initiated in Australia.  A success in this area &mdash; and early indications are optimistic &mdash; would be of enormous value in both the disease eradication structures and their cost effectiveness.  The Government also accept that a computerised movement permit system would be of enormous benefit to ERAD.  However, such an expensive and complex project could not be introduced in isolation from the other <Col N="1863" /> computer needs of my Department. Work on the overall computerisation for my Department is advancing and ERAD will, or course, benefit accordingly.  In the meantime, herdowners should consider the benefit of keeping their own records of the movement of cattle in and out of their own holdings.</P>
    <P>This House and, indeed, the general public, are well aware of the very considerable State funding expended on the TB scheme since its inception in 1954. Considerable funds are still being pumped into the scheme and we are now at the point where results will have to be achieved.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out that I have endorsed practically all the recommendations which have come from the board of ERAD.  I am, therefore, very disappointed that the veterinary profession and the farm organisations have seen fit to withdraw, or threaten to withdraw, their representatives from the board of ERAD &mdash; it must be perplexing for the taxpayer.  Expenditure on fees for private veterinary practitioners in the current year will be in the order of some £20 million which, incidentally, includes a substantial increase in the level of fees as recommended by independent assessment and accepted by the Government. In the circumstances, surely it is not unreasonable for ERAD to insist on a system for quality control of testing.  Anything less would create a credibility problem.</P>
    <P>To the farmer I repeat the national eradication effort has been undertaken to benefit the farming community and it is unrealistic and, indeed, unfair, to expect the taxpayer to continue to pay the costs of these programmes unless the full co-operation of the interests involved is forthcoming.</P>
    <P>Even today, in confirmation of a view already conveyed to me, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, understandably, conveyed their dissatisfaction with the fact that the general taxpayer has been asked to fund such a major contribution to the scheme at this stage when the farming community are complaining <Col N="1864" /> about paying one-ninth of the cost of the extra levy this year.  ERAD were intended to achieve a consensus on the approach to this vital task.  Certainly there are difficult decisions to be taken. I stress that if all the decisions taken by the Government or ERAD were easy and comfortable, there would be no need for ERAD or the Government.  We are now at the point where we have to face up to these decisions.  Time is rapidly running out and the advent of the Single Market from 1 January 1993 will have severe repercussions if the time left is not availed of to greatly reduce our levels of bovine TB.</P>
    <P>This is not the time for individual interests to steer their own course, nor is it the time for posturing.  It is, however, the time for teamwork, common sense and common purpose.  I appeal now to the interests involved to return to ERAD which they initially asked us to establish. The people who left &mdash; or who are threatening to leave &mdash; are those who demanded that they should be involved in this area.  I appeal to them, on the basis of their own original demand, to return to the board of ERAD and to take a sensible view of the difficulties facing the farming community in finally ridding themselves of this disease.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to draw the attention of Members to the recent European Community decision setting the level of EC financial participation for approved national disease eradication programmes in member states.  I am very pleased that I was able to bring about that decision during the course of our Presidency and I should like to tell the House that a request for such funding has already been made to the EC Commission.</P>
    <P>However, it is stipulated that a national programme has to be prepared and approved by the Commission of the EC. I am arranging, therefore, to have this programme drawn up as a matter of urgency but, realistically, it is mot unlikely that such funds will come on stream before the end of 1990.  If funds become available from 1991, and I intend to press very hard to secure them, then <Col N="1865" /> the disease levels can be reduced in line with the agreed ratio between farmer and Exchequer contribution.  I made that commitment with the farming organisations at the beginning of the ERAD programme.  Any reduction in overall expenditure would be applied to the benefit proportionately of both the farmers and the general taxpayer, and I intend to honour that commitment in the event that this arises.  In that event the Commission will more than likely insist on specific conditions which we will have to meet.  Therefore, we should relish the opportunity of establishing our own conditions under our own responsibility rather than having to respond to conditions that would be imposed on us.</P>
    <P>TB eradication has always been a controversial issue.  I appreciate that the leaders of the various interests can come under pressure from their members at certain times and from certain sectoral groups who have an interest in the number of movements an animal can have and how and where it is traded.  I also appreciate that disease outbreaks can cause severe problems for individual farm families.  That is why it is so vital to break the back of this disease once and for all.  That can be done only with full co-operation.  I would urge all concerned to renew that spirit of co-operation and commitment in a final push to bring TB under control.</P>
    <P>I recommend that these regulations be accepted by the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thankful for the opportunity to reply to the Minister. The decision to increase the TB levies on farmers is regrettable and totally unwarranted. The increase of 14 per cent in the disease levies comes when ERAD are being forced to reduce dramatically prices for reactor cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand there are to be eight different categories of payments for reactor cattle as against five at present.  The reduction in the prices paid by ERAD for reactor cattle is not justified.  Farmers must receive reasonable compensation for their diseased animals if there is to be any of the type of co-operation the <Col N="1866" /> Minister spoke about a few moments ago. ERAD's decision to pressure for financial resources from the Government to relate prices paid for reactor cattle to the current cattle trade can be both misleading and very costly as far as the farmer is concerned.  Many farmers would never contemplate selling cattle at a particular stage until demanded to do so because of TB infection.  Relating the price of these totally unsaleable animals to the current cattle trade is not comparing like with like.  Indeed, the farmer will lose on the double.  His replacement costs will be likely to be much higher if his herd is locked up for the minimum 240 days which I understand the regulation provides, or eight months as the new regulation demands.</P>
    <P>The decision to pile on 14 per cent extra bovine TB levies at this time when the trade for cattle and sheep has collapsed is insensitive, to say the least. Farmers are taking up to £120 less for cattle now and last week the ultimate was reached where farmers could not sell factory heifers.  However, the biggest objection of all by the farming community to the increased levies and to the reduction in the pre-movement test from 120 to 45 days is that the Minister and ERAD seem to have no clearcut policy or strategy on the TB scheme.  We all know a generation of young people picked up the historical fact at school that over £1 billion of taxpayers' money has been spent on the scheme since its inception almost 40 years ago.</P>
    <P>A number of basic objectives must be tackled.  Besides the compensation factor I have covered there is the question of the quality of testing procedures.  I am asking the Minister two straight questions tonight.  In his view, are the private vets leaving reactor cattle behind as is suggested? Is the quality of test what it should be?  All indications from ERAD that I can see at the moment are that there seems to be some discrepancy between the testing results obtained by the private vets and similar tests carried out by ERAD.  The Minister in reply to a Dáil question some time ago suggested that no such discrepancy exists.  If ERAD <Col N="1867" /> are correct, how could a TB scheme be successful if over 10,000 reactors are left on Irish farms every year?  I understand ERAD want a new veterinary task force to oversee testing procedures.  Would it not be reasonable to allow this request? If there is no such thing as substandard testing by private vets, then the task force can be disbanded after a couple of years. Let one thing be quite clear.  There must be quality control on testing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a 30 day pre-movement test, a 45 day test at one stage, a 60 day test and a 120 day pre-movement test.  Will the Minister lay before the House any scientific evidence to prove that one or all of the above pre-movement tests contributed to the control of TB?  There is not a single shred of evidence, and I defy contradiction on the Floor of this House tonight.</P>
      <P>No such evidence exists, but I will tell the House why.  I have seen them all, inside and outside this House both in the marts and as a farmer.  They all put unnecessary pressure on farmers to sell at inopportune times, a costly procedure on the farming community, and they do almost nothing to control TB.  Why is such a draconian measure being foisted on farmers at this stage?  Why did the Minister try to introduce the two stop sale which would crucify the marts of Ireland altogether?  The answer lies in Brussels and the Minister referred to it at the end of his speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has announced that Ireland may receive financial support from the EC for our disease programme. In itself that is good.  Obviously, the Minister wants to impress the EC authorities with a clear signal that the Government <Col N="1869" /> mean business on animal disease. Whether the measures are sensible or prudent from a scientific or veterinary point of view does not seem to be relevant. What is relevant is that whatever financial assistance we get, be it £4 million or £5 million or a sum far exceeding that, the Exchequer funding is likely to be reduced by this amount.  If the money comes it will be very interesting to see from whom the burden will be taken.  This ploy will not work.  I call on the Minister to give a solemn undertaking in this House this evening that when such EC funds are made available a corresponding reduction will be effected on the disease levies paid by farmers.</P>
    <P>The Minister must give this undertaking tonight.  Farmers cannot have confidence in a regime where silly schemes like the two stop proposal are dreamed up. Where did that come from?  This would upset the entire cattle trade.  It apparently was meant for cattle dealers.  Not alone would it have put half of them out of business, but it would have closed half of the livestock marts as well.  Backbenchers on all sides of the House know exactly what hapended during the last fortnight. It would have meant that farmers would have had to sell at the first sale which would depress prices.  Imagine a farmer bringing an animal again to the mart seven days after it had been brought out in the first place.</P>
    <P>There is only one way to control animals in transit.  We must have a proper computerised system recording the permission granted and the destination of all animals.  That would be worth all the pre-movement tests one can think of.  Why cannot this section of the Department of Agriculture and Food be computerised? For three years the Minister has been saying that it cannot be done.  Where is all the technology?  Every other Department seems to be computerised so why cannot the Department of Agriculture and Food be computerised?  Let nobody try to convince me that we have not the technology.  What is wrong is that we have not got the will to do it.  In relation to this carry on about pre-movement tests, there is no evidence to prove that <Col N="1870" /> it controls TB.  Computerised permits are the answer.</P>
    <P>We do not seem to have a detailed research programme.  Farmers are still at sea as to what causes TB and how it spreads.  Farmers have to pay £7.90 on top of all the other costs for cattle being either exported or killed.  This is another crippling burden on them.  I understand that one type of reactor cattle will fetch £100 less than they do at the moment. How can one expect the farming community to be happy with that type of procedure?</P>
    <P>Our back is to the fence with the approach of 1992 but the Minister will not get the type of co-operation he seeks with those mickey mouse schemes, and extra cash from farmers who know that they must pay up every time something goes wrong.</P>
    <P>I like the concept of ERAD and I hope it will continue to do the job.  I know ERAD are going through turbulent times and I know tremendous pressure is being exerted on the constituent bodies of ERAD.  There seems to be some sort of barrier between ERAD and the Department. I understand that the Minister is not sympathetic to some of the decisions made by ERAD.  Many people agree that there is not a good relationship between ERAD and the Department.  It is time for the Minister and his officials to strongly support what ERAD are trying to do. The proposal the Minister has laid before the House tonight will not contribute in any way to controlling TB.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should postpone the introduction of the increased levies until the end of this year. I would like to know how the Department calculated so early on in the year that there would be a huge shortfall?  How do the Department know how many reactors will be identified between now and next December?  Why did the Minister not wait a few months to find out what way the budget was likely to go?  Some people in authority tell me there are more reactors <Col N="1871" /> than ever before being identified, others say there are fewer.  It appears to me that the Minister is applying the soft touch to get money and that we will talk about it later; that we should hold on until the end of the year to make sure we want the money.  Neither the Minister nor I, nor ERAD have any way of knowing how many reactors will be identified between now and next December.</P>
      <P>The Minister's proposal to introduce a 45 day test should be scrapped.  A 60 day test would be reasonable but what we need above all else is to computerise the Department so that we can have on computer the knowledge in relation to where every animal is at a given point.  That is possible, it is done in other countries, and there is no reason it should not be done here.  When summing up, I would like the Minister to say why he is not going down that road.  There is no hope of controlling the disease properly without that sort of facility.</P>
      <P>This topic is important to every farming family.  It is the chief talking point at every farm meeting and I understand that a great number of Deputies on the benches opposite are very worried about this.  There is no point in being worried about it unless we do something about it.  The people who believe that the scheme is not going anywhere should come out and say so now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to have this debate, it is timely that we have it now.  There has been a total collapse of confidence in the bovine TB eradication scheme.  The blame for this must be laid squarely on the shoulders of the Government.  ERAD have failed to put forward the policies they know are necessary.  To a considerable extent they are limited in what they can do and they are proposing policies in desperation, notably the proposed indiscriminate slaughter of badgers.  It is understandable that the farmers have withdrawn from ERAD and that they feel aggrieved at the proposed increase in bovine levies.  It reeks of throwing good money after bad, increasing levies only to see the money <Col N="1872" /> spent on a bureaucratic black hole.  This and other Governments have avoided one policy option that could have a major effect on the level of bovine TB, namely, the establishment of a rigid and comprehensive movement permit scheme, I understand the resistance such a policy would face.  However, politicians and policy makers who suggest that there is any other way to defeat bovine TB are only misleading the farmers.</P>
      <P>Some progress has been made in recent years but despite the introduction of the national reactor collection system, the introduction of the new tags, the nomination of testers, and other improvements, until we are able to establish a movement permit system so that the origins of all animals are documented and traceable the problem will continue.  A movement permit system should be established in line with other initiatives.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that there are about 400 chronically affected herds.  These should be put down immediately and adequate compensation paid to the herd owners to ensure that they do not suffer financially. We must extend restriction measures where infection breaks out in a herd.  Up to 15 per cent of high risk herds break down at the six month check.  In Australia where there are multiple reactors the herd must go through a 90 day check, one six month check and two further six month checks before they can obtain a confirmed free status.  Such measures should be implemented here now.  The special Garda scheme where a uniformed garda was assigned to every district veterinary office should be reintroduced.  All cattle trucks should be required by law to be disinfected before leaving slaughter houses and marts or the owners fined heavy penalties and there should be special measures for disinfecting buildings and controls for slurry spreaders.  Those additional initiatives should also include an increase in funding for epidemiology research, that is, our understanding of the disease, its transmission to other animals and, therefore, its eradication.  This is woefully inadequate at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, those measures will not be <Col N="1873" /> effective without the introduction of a movement permit system.  While ERAD are projecting the introduction of such a system by 1992, the Government should expedite the introduction of one and ensure that transitional measures, such as the establishment of TB clearance zones, are put into effect immediately. However, Dr. Liam Downey, Director of ERAD, has stated that present staffing arrangements are insufficient to implement a national clearance zone strategy.</P>
    <P>If the Government and ERAD established a clear strategy and ensured the proper and consistent funding of the scheme, the bovine TB eradication scheme could regain the confidence of all concerned.  However, this will mean taking difficult long term decicions and there will be no room for a cop-out by taking short term measures to give the appearance of doing something, but something which is useless.  I refer specifically to the proposed slaughter and gassing of the badger population.</P>
    <P>A report prepared for ERAD by the ESRI states that the badger was not the sole or, indeed, primary source of bovine TB in many areas.  The report stated that the most serious risk of cattle infection in most areas was from direct or indirect contact with infected animals.  The report went on to state that the eradication of the badger population would not eradicate bovine TB here.  They are not my words but the views of the ESRI in a report commissioned for ERAD.  On whether the elimination of badgers in TB blackspots is necessary for the control of bovine TB the report was inconclusive. However, on other measures to control bovine TB, notably a movement permit system, the report was unequivocal stating that such a system was essential.  The badger population is being used as a scapegoat for political and administrative incompetence.  There is no doubt that control of TB infected badgers would be necessary to ensure that in bovine TB-clear zones cattle are not reinfected. However, proposals about wholesale clearances will amount to an ecological disaster.  The Labour Party will oppose <Col N="1874" /> at every level possible the indiscriminate slaughter of the badger population.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the point that additional resources were required to fund the scheme but he has made no serious attempt to get those resources from the EC.  He will now coat-tail behind the French and Germans who are now making such demands.  Tonight he appeared to take credit for the new proposal, which did not come from him in the first place.  We must ask why the Minister, during his Euro Presidency and before, failed to make this case for Ireland.  Was he trying to hide something from our European partners, namely, that we have a serious bovine TB problem or that our eradication scheme was so tired and ineffective that nobody would throw more good money into the black hole that has swallowed more than £1 billion of taxpayers' and farmers' money to date?  For an effective Euro assistance would be available, if sought.  However, the Minister went for the easy option, the same tired old scheme, an increase in the levies on farmers and further burdens on taxpayers.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party are opposing these regulations for the simple reason that we can see no clear strategy emerging from the Government.  We are not the only group opposed to them.  The withdrawal by the IFA and the vets indicates that they no longer see any merit in the scheme.  The Labour Party will support the Government if they decide to take sterner measures to protect this vital industry, the jobs it creates and the vast majority of farmers.  However, we are not going to give credence to the whistling-in-the-dark policy being pursued by the Government.  The scheme reminds me of Sisyphus, the Greek god, who after his defeat was condemned to eternally push a rock up a hill.  To farmers, taxpayers, and others the scheme appears to be an enternally futile activity of pushing a rock up a hill knowing that as soon as it is let go it will roll back down again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>On 14 November last, when we were discussing regulations to increase bovine TB levies, I indicated <Col N="1875" /> that we were prepared to support the increases, but wondered if we would be back in another ten years increasing levies yet again to fund yet another campaign of disease eradication.  Little did I realise that we would be back not in ten years, but in less than ten months, seeking new levies.  That we should be back on this topic within eight months is symptomatic of the whole disastrous way in which campaigns to eliminate bovine diseases have been handled by successive Governments, and it is no wonder that the patience of the taxpayer is now beginning to run out.</P>
      <P>The operation of the bovine disease eradication scheme, especially in relation to bovine TB, was described some years ago by the former Secretary of the Department of Finance and former Governor of the Central Bank, Dr. T. K. Whitaker, as the &ldquo;greatest financial scandal in the history of the State&rdquo;.  It is hard to argue with this description in the light of the huge amounts of money spent over the years and the spectacular lack of success.  Twenty-five years ago, Deputy Haughey, who was then Minister for Agriculture, was able to claim that the country was virtually free of TB in cattle. A quarter of a century later the reality is that we are as far away as ever from that objective.</P>
      <P>The cost to the State of this unsuccessful campaign has been enormous.  In today's terms more than £1,000 million of taxpayer's and farmer's money has been spent and thousands of public servants have had to be deployed in administering the various schemes.  Taxpayers, in particular, cannot be expected to continue footing this bill indefinitely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of vested interests have strongly resisted measures which could have contributed to the more effective tackling of bovine diseases.  About one-third of the money spent each year has gone in veterinary fees.  Fees paid annually to private veterinary practitioners for testing under the disease eradication schemes were as follows: 1983, £10.6 million; 1984, £8.3 million; 1985, £11.5 million; 1986, £11 million; 1987, £12 million <Col N="1876" /> and the figure for this year will be £20 million.  That money is being paid to the veterinary profession.  That is nothing short of a scandal and it is they who should be brought to heel and we should not be talking about the little badger, like Deputy Connaughton.  That is only a smokescreen.  There is no doubt but that the veterinary surgeons are responsible and we have been talking about them for years.  I accept that a small number of farmers are not co-operating.  I hope the Minister takes up this issue and ensures that progress is made.</P>
    <P>Much of the work done by vets in this area could just as easily be done by qualified technicians.  If you go into hospital for a blood sample, it will more than likely be taken by a nurse.  Why can the blood sampling under these schemes not be done by properly trained technicians? When the Bill to establish Teagasc was going through the Dáil in 1988, the new body were specifically excluded from carrying out disease eradication tests, largely, I understand, as a result of objections from the vets.</P>
    <P>Those small number of farmers who continually flout the regulations also have a lot to answer for.  They are not only endangering their own livelihoods, but also the interests of their neighbours and the taxpayers who are footing the bills.</P>
    <P>When ERAD was established many people hoped that it would be the final phase of the campaign to wipe out bovine TB.  Unfortunately, almost before it got a real chance to tackle the problem ERAD is on the rocks.  Firstly, the vets withdrew their representatives, followed by the IFA and the ICMSA.  The vets are blaming the farmers, the farmers are blaming the Department.  It is the usual story: everyone blames everyone else, while the taxpayer continues to have to dig ever deeper in his pocket to fund yet another campaign that probably has no more prospect of success than the last one.</P>
    <P>Disunity and division among those who have most to gain from co-operation in eliminating bovine diseases hardly increases our prospects of getting money from the newly established European <Col N="1877" /> Community veterinary fund to compensate farmers for the loss of diseased animals.  I have no doubt that the European Community will ask why it should make money available to compensate farmers for the loss of diseased animals when farmers, vets and the Department cannot sit down together to discuss a common action programme.  Unless action is taken immediately the agriculture industry will face enormous problems from 1992 onwards when farmers with infected herds will not be allowed to sell milk or animals from their farms.  Not only will this adversely affect the incomes of farmers but it will affect the entire community.  Farmers and non-farmers alike are paying a high price because of our failure to eliminate bovine diseases which have been dealt with effectively in other countries.  If we fail to tackle the vested interests in this area, we will continue to pour huge sums of money into this bottomless pit and make no progress.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to have this opportunity to contribute to the debate on the motion before the House. ERAD was established in 1989, as a semi-State organisation, under Dr. Downey, a Corkman, who did excellent work in many other fields.  I wish to take this opportunity to wish him every success.  I also wish the Minister for Agriculture and Food every success in his efforts to rid this country of tuberculosis before 1992.</P>
      <P>I appeal to organisations such as the IFA, the IVA and the IVU to rejoin the board of ERAD to co-operate and for us all to work together in implementing a disease eradication programme which may become the model for other countries in Europe.  The ICMSA have not yet joined the board and I appeal to them to reconsider their position.  I compliment the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society for indicating that they will continue to be a member of the ERAD board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A considerable sum of taxpayer's and farmer's money has been spent on disease eradication over the past 36 years.  The process began in 1954, but since then we have been plagued by the disease at farm <Col N="1878" /> level.  We have to change direction between now and 1992, as from then on we will not be allowed to sell milk or meat from farms with locked-up herds. We must now make a genuine effort to try to control the disease.  It is worth noting that we have the highest incidence of tuberculosis in the western world.  For example, we are at the bottom of the league, with Spain, in the European Community, while New Zealand, Australia, the United States and Canada have disease free status.</P>
    <P>We should join together to try to solve the problem once and for all.  In all, we have spent £1 billion in an effort to eradicate the disease, yet there are still 10,000 infected herds within the country who pose a threat to 150,000 other herds.  It should also be borne in mind that it is the small farmer who suffers most.  I am aware of small farmers who fear that their herds may become infected, given the problems that would arise not only for themselves but for neighbouring farmers.</P>
    <P>Approximately £25 million will be brought in by way of levies, to be paid by the 150,000 herd owners each year under the programme.  They cannot afford to continue paying these levies.  Because of this it is important that we receive the co-operation of all farmers and all those involved in the livestock industry, such as hauliers, cattle dealers, traders, exporters, factories and the livestock marts who have a vested interest in this matter.  In view of this they should be more vigilant and introduce stricter controls.</P>
    <P>The veterinary profession are paid approximately £20 million per annum.  It must be made quite clear to the vets that they have to maintain the highest possible standards in carrying out tests.  As a professional person, I am not prepared to question; but let me repeat it is absolutely vital that the highest standards are maintained.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given a promise that moneys will be made available from the new EC veterinary fund.  However, before any moneys will be paid I have no doubt that it will insist on strict guidelines being laid down.  Pressure may even be <Col N="1879" /> brought to bear to break the link between the vet and the farmer.  One may well ask if the time has come to consider the introduction of a contract system whereby vets would be given a contract. No other group employed by the State and in receipt of £20 million per year operate without contracts.</P>
    <P>I submit that a sensible scientific study should be carried out to see whether or not the badger is responsible for the spread of tuberculosis.  There is a danger that enraged farmers in blackspots will take the law into their own hands and kill badgers in a reckless manner.  This would not be desirable.  I am glad that, in addition to the Offaly project, the Minister is to initiate two major pilot studies on this question.  Ten years ago it was considered that polluted ponds, rivers and streams presented the greatest danger to herds.  However, corrective action was taken and I know of no farmer who depends on these as a source of water.  As a result of the generous grant aid provided by Government they have installed running water supplies.  We are now, at the eleventh hour, putting the blame on a helpless animal.  From what I know of this animal they do not present the problem in my area which it is alleged they cause in other areas.</P>

      <P>It is a pity everything went wrong between 1983 and 1987 when the Coalition Government were in power.  They failed to introduce a programme as they had promised to do and instead reduced funding with the result that 1,000 young vets who had been promised jobs were left high and dry. I also have to say that they published inaccurate figures and gave the impression that the incidence of tuberculosis was not as high as it actually was.</P>

      <P>I rise to support the regulation the Minister is introducing this evening.  I come from a county which is now a black spot in terms of TB eradication, having been an area that was practically TB free.  The previous speakers appear not to agree with anything in this matter.  They do not agree, for instance, with what is being done in relation to movement or that the badger is a problem. My view is that this is a compromise between different proposals and a 45 day free movement test.  There is no doubt that had it been the 60 day two stop test, it would have been restrictive and it could have done much damage to the cattle trade at a time when prices were not as high as often as they were before.</P>
      <P>We must look with grave concern at ERAD at this time and at the farmers and the veterinary profession who have withdrawn from that board.  ERAD were set up and given an opportunity to run the programme as they saw fit.  They received a fair amount of finance as they were talking in terms of £23 million from the Exchequer.  They had a free hand. Fianna Fáil, since their return to office in 1987, in every area of agriculture where there was a need for extra finance or where there was a need to change the system&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with two other colleagues in my party, Deputy Hogan and Deputy T. Ahearn.  I would like to remind the Minister for Agriculture and Food that Irish farmers have been at the receiving end of a constant stream of penal measures in the TB eradication scheme.  We are now half way through the four years eradication programme and there is not the slightest shred of evidence that any worthwhile progress has been achieved in reducing the incidence of TB.  The issues of infected wild life and the number of reactors missed during each annual test still have not been effectively tackled.  If the Minister does not come to grips with the situation in combating the estimated 25 per cent of the disease that is left behind each year and if the spread of the disease by affected wild life is left unchecked farmers will still be paying £30 million annually on TB levies for the next two decades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister for Agriculture and Food to explain to the House how he visualises that farmers must pay £4 million extra per year plus the £25 million which they are already paying &mdash; making a total of £29 million per year on bovine TB levies.  How can the Minister in his sane senses impose a reduction of up to £50 per head in the already miserable <Col N="1883" /> rates of reactor compensation?  Does the Minister understand the serious predicament in which Irish farmers find themselves at the moment?  Is he aware that milk prices are down almost 50p per gallon this year?  Is he aware that cattle prices have slumped to a fraction of what they were two years ago?  Is he aware that the bottom has completely fallen out of sheep wool prices?  Is he aware that farmers are leaving the land at the rate of at least five per day?  The Minister does not seem to have his ear to the ground when he insists that the already over-burdened farmer must find a further £4 million to finance the eradication of bovine TB.  The time has come to call a halt to the imposition of further crippling levies on our hard pressed and already over-burdened farming community. Does the Minister realise that eight out of every ten farmers are trying to exist on an income of less than £100 per week? In 1989, Ireland's beef industry received £450 million approximately from the CAP support system.  This represents the equivalent of £250 per head on all cattle slaughtered and exported live from Ireland in the same year.  Of this figure, a total of £55 million approximately was paid to our Irish farmers in the form of suckler cow beef and calf premium schemes.  The remaining £395 million went directly to the factories and cattle exporters.  Why does the Minister not take immediate steps to rectify that serious anomaly and pay that £200 approximately per animal directly to our farming community?  This would meet with the GATT demands of the USA and they would have no objection whatsoever if the Minister for Agriculture and Food pursued that policy. Then and only then could these exorbitant levies be met by a beleagured farming community.  I call on the Minister to accede to my request before it is too late.</P>
    <P>I call on him also to reinstate immediately the county committees of agriculture and the county animal health committees, two committees which were the watchdog of our farming community. <Col N="1884" /> For some unknown reason they were abolished and faceless people put at the helm to command this bovine TB eradication scheme.  If we want progress those committees must be reinstated.  I call on my constituency colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, who is listening to me, to reinstate those two committees straightaway.  If he does not, TB will never be eradicated from our cattle herds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>The total failure of the bovine TB eradication scheme to date is scandalous and disgraceful.  It has cost taxpayers billions of pounds and has cost many farming families their livelihoods. It has retarded agricultural development and dominated debate on agriculture. Yet the position obtaining is no better than it was when the first attempts to eradicate this disease were made some 36 years ago.  One might well ask why it is that today one in every four of our cattle herds is restricted.  One might well ask also why such fumbling with the scheme was allowed continue.  Indeed, one might even dare to contemplate the terrible trauma and hardship experienced by so many farming families who suffered immeasurably as a consequence of this disease.  I still hold vivid memories when, as a child, I observed our family herd of cattle depopulated in 1960, an experience no farmer wishes to have repeated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time has long passed when lip service can be tolerated on the matter of the eradication of bovine TB.  The attitude of the Minister and Government is intolerable. The first actions I have noted being taken by the Minister in this regard were, first, to increase levies and, second, reduce compensation for reactors.  Surely they represent two steps no Government would take were they serious about ridding the country of TB?  If the Minister for Agriculture and Food really understood the human trauma occasioned by herd depopulation, if we could only get him to accept that farmers are experiencing an alarming decline in their incomes, then he might realise that the <Col N="1885" /> measures he has taken should have been the last to have been considered.</P>
    <P>Today farmers pay £24 million annually for disease eradication.  The Government now say they will give an extra £9 million to an already seriously under-funded programme if farmers pay an additional £4 million, bringing their total contribution to some £28 million per annum.  I must stress that the increased levy, from 1.2p to 1.4p per gallon and from £6.90 to £7.90 per annum is totally unacceptable, representing an incredible demand on farmers at a time when their incomes have fallen by almost 20 per cent.  The reason for the increases in these levies is given as the dramatic increase in reactor numbers resulting from better identification of disease in the national herd.  Why should this additional burden be borne by farmers already struggling to survive?  Surely responsibility for past inadequate management and testing lies entirely with the Government.  I would suggest that in order to cater for the increasing numbers of farmers seeking compensation, the Government should secure EC funding or alternatively increase the Exchequer contribution. These new proposals are intolerable.  The future of ERAD based on such proposals is not alone doubtful but questionable.</P>
    <P>The level of compensation for reactors is inadequate and does nothing to encourage the farming community to co-operate fully in the implementation of the scheme.  The Minister must accept that the financial problems occasioned by an outbreak of TB are shattering.  Any farmer or banker will say that it has been the cause of major financial disasters for many farming families.  A reduction of up to £40 per head by way of reactor compensation, depending on the category of animal, is appalling and cannot be sustained by the farming community. I agree that the withdrawal of the IFA and the ICMSA from the ERAD programme was indeed justified.</P>
    <P>The recent proposal &mdash; under the new free movement restriction &mdash; places a farmer in the position that if he fails a test such movement could be restricted for up to eight months.  It is my belief <Col N="1886" /> that this will eradicate farmers, not TB. In addition, does the Minister realise that his proposal for a 45-day test will involve farmers paying the extra funding on account of the extra testing required?  I concur with the suggestion of Deputy Connaughton that a reversion to a 60-day test is reasonable.</P>
    <P>I agree &mdash; as I am sure does every Member of this House &mdash; with the need to rid the country of TB.  But any bovine TB eradication programme that does not have the support, confidence and co-operation of the IFA, the ICMSA and the farming community will not be acceptable.  The Minister's recent proposals are doomed to failure because they have failed to capture the trust, confidence and support of the farming community. Any scheme for the eradication of TB and brucellosis will be successful only if accompanied by credible testing, the most important factor of all. Adequate finance must be provided and the role of the badger must be thoroughly investigated.  It is my belief that to date such investigation has not been undertaken as thoroughly as I would like.  No real progress will be made until these issues have been addressed.</P>
    <P>Infected herd owners should have available to them special advisory services in order to ascertain how the disease may have entered their farm; how to prevent its spread within that farm; how to prevent it spreading to neighbouring farms, with proper compensation being provided.  Unless these issues are addressed the bovine TB eradication programme will continue to be as successful in the future as it has been in the past and the only change will be that the numbers of farmers will have decreased.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the traumatic experience of having one's herd locked up or depopulated is not fully appreciated by the Minister.  His failure to tackle realistically the eradication of this disease is disgraceful.  Of course, the only losers in all of this are the farmers themselves; farmers have suffered and paid most. While there is just concern at the cost to the taxpayer it must be remembered that <Col N="1887" /> farmers pay £3 for every £ contributed by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Everybody, most of all our farmers, wish the country to be rid of TB.  The farming community are willing to give their fullest support to a successful programme. However, the responsibility lies with the Minister to initiate a programme based on the many proposals advanced here this evening and those he will have received from all the farming organisations. I seriously question whether the Minister has the will to undertake this task.  I would seriously remind him that the future of many farming families rests in his hands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could find myself in worse pastures.  In introducing these regulations here this evening the Minister misled the House when he stated that he had always accepted in total the recommendations presented to him by ERAD. Yet one of the main bones of contention has been that the reason the scheme is in such disarray at present is that many of the sensible recommendations presented by ERAD have not been accepted by the Minister, particularly if they carried any taint of political implication.  This is best exemplified by the request of the board for a controlled system to sample wildlife. The only response the Minister could give to that request was to request the board to undertake additional research into the problem despite the fact that there is a fine volume of research incorporated in the document produced by Professor Bob O'Connor.  Indeed, the results of such an experiment carried out in parts of Offaly &mdash; many of the details of which have been conveyed to me by my colleague, Deputy Enright &mdash; clearly indicate that when this study was undertaken, compared with the remainder of the county, there had <Col N="1888" /> been a significant decrease in the incidence of disease among wildlife in the parts of Offaly subjected to this scrutiny.</P>
      <P>The Minister is seeking to increase levies at a time when the spread of disease appears to be escalating.  It is my belief that this is a panic reaction.  It is difficult to understand where the Minister will get the necessary finance, particularly when farm incomes are decreasing.  I plead with the Minister at least to wait until the end of the year, in the interim to review the overall position and ascertain how much money he will get from Brussels, thereby ensuring that the burden will not fall so harshly on an already depressed sector of our society.  I also call on the Minister to provide an adequate income supplement scheme, particularly as there is a stricter regime being implemented for classification of a disease free herd.  I regret that the Minister for Agriculture and Food has panicked and sought to put through this Bovine Diseases (Levies) Regulations tonight and that his only solution to the problem of bovine TB would appear to be to increase levies every time there is a greater number of reactors.  I reject this policy totally.  The Minister has sabotaged the great work of ERAD by his lack of action.  His credibility, and that of ERAD are intertwined and, unfortunately, in total shreds in the eyes of the farming community.  At the end of the day the losers are the farmers and their families and the people they have to feed rather than the animals.  The buck stops with the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not repeat everything that was said here this evening.  I will just say that we are all to blame. Nobody is in a position to blame anybody else.  We have failed for 36 years, to eradicate bovine TB.  The Government and An Foras Talúntais decided to hand over responsibility for the eradication of bovine TB to a board that has widespread knowledge of the people involved, the farmers, the veterinary profession, the Department and all the people who should be in a position to know how to go about eradicating this most dangerous disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1889" /> I do not want to blame anybody.  If I were to blame anybody I would not do it in ten minutes, or in two hours when, in 36 years, we have not got rid of bovine TB.  The House should co-operate with the Minister and ERAD.  Dr. Downey, who is responsible for the management of ERAD, does not want to see the scheme fail.  Neither does the Minister and neither do we, but pouring money into a system that is going down the wrong road is not the answer.  The first sign of failure is when one leaves the playing pitch, and the IFA and the veterinary profession, the people we trusted most to eradicate this disease and who were highly paid to do so, have left the playing pitch.  I appeal to them tonight to come back into ERAD.</P>
    <P>I believe ERAD, and the Minister, are on the right road.  Scientific research has not yet identified the reason for the continuing increased spread of this disease. We have more TB in our herds now than we had 36 years ago when we had no eradication programme.  Donegal was declared a free accredited county, and Sligo and Leitrim came closely behind in being declared disease free, at a time when there was no testing.  That could not be said today.  We have made no progress but have gone in the opposite direction.</P>
    <P>There are a number of things we should be doing.  Improving the quality of testing is one.  I would come down in favour of 45-day testing.  It is the one that comes closest to veterinary advice with the least disruption to the farming community. That is most important.  I will not go into the badger scene because investigations are being carried out.  There will be two other scientific tests in two other locations which will decide once and for all whether or not badgers are responsible for the spread of the disease.</P>
    <P>In the meantime we should ask our farmers to consider keeping log books or stock books.  In the absence of computerisation, which is on the way, the farmers must co-opeate in this.  It is very <Col N="1890" /> easy to blame the farming community, but only a very small number of farmers do not comply with the stringent regulations imposed.  Most farmers have sacrificed a lot to bring about eradication. The worse this gets the more damage will be done to the farming community, and they are the ones who will be hurt the most.  I want to bring to the notice of Deputies that if a farmer has what is known as a multiple reactor herd he will be penalised considerably.  A farmer who has carried out all his tests, and has done everything he has been asked to do by the veterinary profession and, through no fault of his own, is found to have a multiple reactor herd can have his cattle locked up for eight months.  That is penal and I know there are some small farmers in the west who will not be able to bear the brunt of that decision.</P>
    <P>The Whips have today been running around trying to facilitate speakers on both sides on this issue, and that is an indication to the many people who have been here, that we are all here to do what is right.  If the blueprint for doing that is not in keeping with our views we should hand it over to a board comprising people from all sections of the community, including the veterinary profession, to do the job for us.  It is time this disease was wiped out, If we are not ready by 1993 I know what our herds will be faced with on the European scene.  The challenge is great but we can only meet it with the co-operation of everybody.</P>

      <P>One of the reasons I was very much in favour of ERAD when set up was that there was farmer representation on that board.  I hope these people fight particularly for the replacement value of reactors.  It is regrettable <Col N="1891" /> that one farming organisation have already withdrawn from the scheme, as have the veterinary unions, and the ICMSA are also considering withdrawing from it.  There is confusion because no definite decision has been made that the board will continue in operation.  I greatly admire the work Dr. Downey has done. He has met with many of us and with many groups and explained what he and ERAD are doing.</P>
      <P>There has been a lot of hype about badgers and that is regrettable.  We should concentrate on infected wildlife generally rather than just talking about badgers, which is a very emotive issue. Dr. Downey has said that there is evidence that the removal of wildlife from north-east Offaly resulted in a reduction of 13 per cent in the incidence of TB, whereas in the rest of Offaly it increased by 33 per cent.  That proves the point that has been made by many speakers in this House &mdash; that it is not sufficient to remove the reactor cattle but that the infected wildlife also has to be removed. As the Minister has said, there are also other black spots where wildlife have infected cattle with TB.</P>
      <P>ERAD have given examples of what has been done to alleviate this problem in New Zealand.  A scheme was introduced there whereby herds are locked up for two years.  This shows how difficult it is to eradicate TB.  ERAD have said that if we continue to take out the same number of reactors each year as we have been doing up to now it might take until the year 2020 to solve the problem.  But we cannot afford to wait that long, especially when small farmers have been so badly hit by this dreaded disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already said that the farming organisations should fight for the replacement value of reactors, but it is important that the grants be paid punctually.  One of the major problems is that grants are not paid on time.  This applies not only to agriculture but to all areas.  The Minister <Col N="1892" /> should ensure that reactor grants in particular are paid promptly, especially when a farm is locked up and there is a shortage of cash.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent announcement by the Minister of two important measures, one of which is the computerised movement permit system which has been referred to by speakers here tonight.  This is a very complex and expensive under-taking but it is important that if be implemented.  Secondly, ERAD are undertaking work on blood tests for bovine TB and we are hoping for a breakthrough in that regard.  I would appeal to the representatives on ERAD to work together because it is only in a spirit of co-operation that bovine TB will be eradicated.</P>

      <P>The increase in levies proposed in this motion will be a further burden on our hard-pressed farmers, <Col N="1893" /> many of whom are facing financial ruin because of the collapse in prices in the farming industry.  Farmers have already been hit hard enough with the reduction in the price of milk without this additional imposition.  The proposed increase in the levy from £6.90 to £7.90 per animal killed or exported will add further to the gloom in the beef industry.  There is no scientific evidence to suggest that a 45-day pre-movement test is more effective than a 60-day or 100-day pre-movement test. The 45-day pre-movement test will encourage unrecorded movement of cattle, resulting in an extra cost to the farmer.</P>
      <P>In regard to reactor compensation and the income supplement scheme, the Minister knows this is totally inadequate. ERAD have stated that the income supplement scheme is totally inadequate and indeed flawed in its design.  On 2 July the Minister made an order to continue this flawed scheme in spite of the advice of ERAD.  This will have a devastating effect on some farmers.  For example, in the case of multiple reactor breakdown a farmer may suffer a considerable loss of income as he could be restricted from selling for up to ten months.  As a result of this scheme he will only qualify for income supplement as this is based on animals removed and not animals on hand.  Therefore, the scheme should be reconsidered immediately.  Unfortunately, the Minister has left the House but I would like to ask him whether ERAD recommended that an expert study group, chaired by an independent expert, be established to report and make recommendations for a comprehensive and adequate reactor compensation and income supplement scheme.  If not, would he agree that such a study group should be established as a matter of priority?</P>
      <P>What is required is a totally new management structure to manage the scheme. The Minister should engage a firm of consultants to report on the present management and make recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1894" /> This scheme costs £70 million to £75 million annually, and there are reports that it is not being properly managed.  We are still two years away from computerisation in this area whereas the system has been computerised in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of hysteria on the wildlife issue as a result of ill-informed and uniformed reports.  Scientific and veterinary evidence clearly shows that in certain areas the badger is totally infected with TB.  In this respect the Minister has taken a very pragmatic approach.  He seems to have the balance right and I would urge him to continue with this approach.  As Deputy Ahearn has said, the absence of epidemiology studies is one reason for repeated breakdowns in herds.  We have to consider this whole area because we will never be able to eradicate TB until proper studies are carried out.</P>
    <P>The Minister should listen to the farming organisations who have co-operated with ERAD despite pressure from many of their members.  It is very difficult to continue co-operating when the Minister rejects all reasonable proposals for compensation and a proper income supplement scheme.</P>
    <P>Finally, I suggest that the Minister listen to the farming organisations and not ignore what they have to say.  In line with what Deputy Connaughton has said, I think the 45 day pre-movement test should be extended to 60 days.  In addition the levy proposed here tonight should continue only until the end of July 1991 so that the £10 million that is then due can be passed on to the farmer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity, brief and all as it is, to speak on this important motion.  A number of Deputies have already said that the time allocated to this debate is insufficient and I could not agree more.  It is nothing short of scandalous that a major motion should be rushed through the Dáil in a matter of an hour and a half with Deputies being <Col N="1895" /> confined to three and five minute speeches because so many want to contribute. This is not my fault because I have been asking the Taoiseach for the past ten days to give a full day for a debate on the agricultural crisis, and this motion could have been included.</P>
      <P>I am far from being a pessimist; but I am a realist and anybody who is not aware of the crisis in farming should not stand up and discuss agriculture.  Prices are going through the floor.  The farmers are taking a hammering right across the board and nobody is offering a glimmer of hope.  The least we can do is discuss this matter and make provision for what will happen towards the end of the year when there is no market for the large number of cattle.  It is obvious that the Minister is not in touch with what is happening or he would not impose levies at this point in time when farmers' incomes are practically gone.  It is nothing short of insensitive.</P>
      <P>The Minister made a number of points to which I would like to refer.  I am disappointed with the attitude he has adopted because he appears to be trying to play the unions against the farmers. He quoted a union official as saying that his members as taxpayers were tired paying for the scheme.  I suggest that the Minister go back to that union official and advise him that if it was not for the agricultural industry he would not have as many members in his organisation.  It is time that people realise that this is an urban-rural problem and that it is in all our interest that the problem is solved once and for all and that we are not attacking each other over who contributes most.  I contend that the farmers have played their part and I will not take it from anybody that farmers did not do their bit to try to control this disease. They certainly have.  When farmers saw their good stock leaving the yard, in desperation they fought with the officials and tried to play for time and I certainly cannot blame them for doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1896" /> However, if the farmer had been paid adequate compensation for the stock leaving his yard, things would have been different.  There was no effort made to offer a farmer whose cattle were taken away an income until he got back into farming and such a policy does nothing to eradicate the disease.</P>
    <P>Whether you are a blue or a white collar worker, there is a social welfare scheme whereby income is made available in difficult times.  Such a scheme was never offered to farmers.  I suggest that the Minister should go back to the union official and put him straight on the importance of the agricultural industry for his members.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that he could not afford to put the details of all herds on computer.  That is very strange to me, because in the headage payment section or the farm grant payment section the excuse is that your file is on computer and there is nothing the officials can do about the delay in sending out payments. What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  If farm grant payments can be held up for eight, nine or even ten months because of computerisation, the details of the cattle herds can also be computerised.  However, I would suggest that the Minister get better operatives because it is not good enough to delay the payments to hard pressed farmers.</P>
    <P>The badger has been blamed for the spread of disease, but I do not accept that.  In fact, when I was going home from this House the other night a badger crossed the road in front of me and I wondered if the poor little fellow realised how much turmoil he was causing.  I wonder if the Minister realises how much turmoil he is causing in this country?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed that the Minister is bringing in these regulations tonight.  Even at this late stage I would point out how dangerous these regulations are at this point in time.  Most people in the farming community cannot understand why the Minister is increasing <Col N="1897" /> the levies at present.  The Minister would have to agree that the farm organisations have been very responsible and helpful to the Minister to date and I do not think they made the decision to withdraw from ERAD lightly.  They must have given it careful consideration.  Increasing the levies at this time will aggravate what is a difficult and delicate situation.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Minister or the Government fully understand the seriousness of the situation in Irish agriculture throughout the length and breadth of rural Ireland.  Almost every aspect of farming is facing difficulty.  As Deputy Boylan has said, farm incomes are dropping on a regular basis.  Indeed, the farmers I meet across Laois-Offaly are suffering declines in their incomes on a regular basis.  It is forcing people out of farming.  Milk, beef and sheep prices are declining while costs and outlay are increasing; indeed interest rates have increased.</P>
      <P>There is a real danger of forcing the cattle trade out of the marts.  The marts are the only real area where the Department and ERAD have a way of controlling the sale of cattle.  The Minister needs to be careful because cattle dealers and the mart officials are very concerned about the effects of these regulations.  If two movements only are allowed, if cattle are brought to the Birr or Tullamore mart, for example, but are not sold because of low prices, the cattle are only allowed one more movement within the 60 day period.  If they are not sold on the second occasion they have to be retained for a further 60 days.  This is very serious.</P>
      <P>If the Minister were introducing new proposals I think the IFA and the farming organisations would be happy, but the Minister is tinkering with a scheme that has failed to get rid of TB.  In fact, things are being made far worse because the Minister is taking further moneys out of the farmers' pockets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The badger has caused a great many problems for the farming community in County Offaly.  In fact, I saw a case where <Col N="1898" /> disease broke out on a farm which never had disease before.  A dead badger was found on his land and it was quite obvious that the badger was the cause of the outbreak.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I was hoping, if I had a little more than two minutes, I would share my time with Deputy Foxe &mdash; I would share some of my time with the badger as well as the fox.</P>
      <P>This is an important debate and all sides should be heard.  My contribution is slightly different from anything I have heard simply because of my experience on the Animal Health Council and my involvement in the pilot scheme in Bansha since the fifties.  One of the welcome aspects of the Minister's speech is that research is being carried out on an alternative means of identification of reactors.  The present comparative interdermal tests lead to sensitisation of the skin and continuous testing in the same location and interpretation by humans in extraordinary conditions cannot lead to good results, irrespective of the commitment to the veterinary profession.  I suggest that we try to make progress in epidemiology to find out how the disease is transmitted.  We cannot test live badgers, whether we like it or not, and we can only identify the disease in them when they are dead.  One of the problems I see in the field using the present method of testing is that, irrespective of how well it is done, it is very difficult to identify the bacillus and thus reactors that should have been identified can be left in the herd.</P>
      <P>Time is the great imponderable; and I do not wish to be unfair to the Chair, who has allowed the available time to be spread as widely as possible.  I want to give my colleague, Deputy Foxe, an opportunity to contribute.  I will talk to the Minister and Dr. Downey when the debate is over because I have much more to say.</P>

      <P>I want to refer to the point made by Deputy Ferris in regard to <Col N="1903" /> research.  ERAD haved targeted research as being of primary importance. This is a very major change in the pattern of recent years.  At present, 11 separate research projects are underway and ERAD will spend over £500,000 this year on research.  An equal amount will be spent by varius other bodies, such as coops, UCD, UCG, the wildlife service, etc., on research.  I agree that it was time this research was carried out so that we can get to the cause of the problem.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed with what Deputy Connaughton said in regard to pre-movement testing.  He implied that pre-movement testing is of no consequence, does not arise and was dreamt up by someone.</P>

      <P>The Deputy must have some other axe to grind.  The Deputy suggested that the pre-movement test of 30 days in respect of live cattle, which is a European Community requirement, is unreasonable.  The Deputy <Col N="1904" /> might not like that but that is the reality we have to face up to.  In the absence of a computerised movement permit system, conventional movement control is necessary and for that reason 45 days is the best compromise.  We are putting in place a computerised programme.  It does not do the Deputy any good to be complaining that we do not have a computerised programme when during his time in Government his party did not do a single thing about computerisation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We are facing a major problem which has not been solved over 30 years.  What are the specific factors?  I did not say that there was one single factor.

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Defence Forces Recognition of Merit.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for the opportunity to raise this issue, Sir, which I think, if nothing else, illustrates that life goes on within the Defence Forces at all levels irrespective of debates, proposals and procedures with regard to breaking new ground about representatives' associations and the like or in terms of awaiting the Gleeson Commission report on recommendations for improvements in pay and income levels within the Defence Forces.  My opportunity to raise this issue helps to illustrate that life is as it is at the moment within the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for the opportunity to deal with this matter at the end of this session before the long vacation and I thank the Minister for Defence for giving his time to come into the House to listen to the issue I have to raise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1909" /> It was advised from the Adjutant General's Office, by letter dated 31 January 1990, that certain considerations were in being and under review by the command within the Defence Forces with regard to what is known as the good conduct medal.  The correspondence that was issued to all members of the Defence Forces, dated, as I say, 31 January 1990, set out to lay down the basis for the withdrawal of the good conduct medal and its non-award for the current year of 1990.  It is stated in this correspondence that the main problem areas were:</P>
    <P> (a)  The medal had created divisions among NCOs and Privates;</P>
    <P>(b)  Introduced as a morale support, the restricted issue was having adverse effects on morale and had been raised with the Gleeson Commission by various groups.</P>
    <P>(c)  The medal title was a misnomer and a better title would have been The Meritorious Service Medal. </P>
    <P>The good conduct medal is a good idea in principle and it is a particularly apt award for the Defence Forces.  However, it must comply with appropriate criteria. The problems that recently arose with regard to the medal did not arise due to any disagreement between the NCOs and privates, as the Adjutant General's letter suggests.  It arises because of the incorrect basis on which the medal was awarded in recent times.  The award of the medal does not now reflect the good performance of the soldier.  It has become almost an emblem of patronage from those in command to those in favour, with nothing to do with merit and performance. For that reason it has become discredited.  The system should be reviewed, but unless we admit why it needs to be reviewed we will not get things right in the future.</P>
    <P>The Adjutant General's letter deals with a number of recommendations and suggests that qualifications should be laid <Col N="1910" /> down, such as the achievement of a certain number of years or a certain age or some other criteria to qualify for the award.  That is not a good basis on which to proceed in terms of reinstituting the medal.  The award should be based upon good performance and give impetus to morale.  It should be an aid to further promotion as well.  This should encourage the development of a smarter and more efficient Defence Force in the long-term. The Adjutant General's letter also suggests that all personnel who attain the required qualification should be issued with a medal.  That too is an incorrect basis on which to base the award.  I hope the Minister will look long and carefully at the basis for the re-introduction of the good conduct medal.  What it is called is not all that important, although there is a suggestion that a meritorious conduct medal would be a better name for it. However, I think it should be a good conduct medal based on one's service as a soldier.</P>
    <P>The circular also indicates:</P>
    <P>While the points on the medal title are accepted, the costs involved in designing and striking a new medal, the problems involved in withdrawing medals already issued and the writing off of existing stocks make the changing of the medal title unlikely.  I will however ask my staff to also examine this problem.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces are not being treated fairly in this regard.  The cost issue, unless astronomical, should not be brought into it.  It should be a good medal that will command the respect of all involved.  The existing ones should be withdrawn and a proper medal struck.</P>
    <P>In relation to the medal that has been issued to those officers and men who have served the UN peace keeping force, it does not refer to the fact that that body of men and women have been honoured by the supreme award, the Nobel Peace Prize.  That is a pity.  All of the men and women who serve in the UN peace <Col N="1911" /> keeping force are serving under the banner of having been the recipients of this high accolade.  The medal that was struck should refer to that award and I would ask the Tánaiste and Minister for Defence to look at that.  These issues are of genuine concern to members of the Defence Forces and they illustrate that life goes on despite what we may deal with here at other levels.  I hope the Minister will find time to address this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Lenihan) Minister for Defence (Mr. Lenihan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy McCartan for his suggestions with regard to the Good Conduct Medal and the UN Peace Keeping Medal and I will bring his suggestions to the notice of the Army authorities.</P>
      <P>I would first emphasise that there has not been a decision to withdraw the good conduct medal.  The good conduct medal will be issued during the current year.</P>
      <P>The good conduct medal was first introduced in 1987 and may be awarded to non-commissioned officers and privates of the Permanent Defence Force who fulfil certain conditions and who are recommended for the award by the officer commanding their units.  The medal is awarded in recognition of meritorious service characterised by exemplary conduct.  In order to demonstrate the value placed on high standards of conduct and to provide an incentive to personnel to strive to attain these standards it was decided that a limited number of medals would be awarded &mdash; 60 per annum.</P>
      <P>To be eligible for the award of the good conduct medal a non-commissioned officer or private must: (a) have been recommended for the award by the officer commanding his unit; (b) have completed a minimum of ten years' continuous service; (c) have an &ldquo;exemplary&rdquo; conduct rating; (d) not have a record of a conviction of any offence by a civil court or court-martial in the ten years prior to the assessment at (c) above.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1912" /> Recommendations for the award of the medal must be submitted by the officers commanding units.  They may include recommendations on behalf of personnel who are serving under their command or who, having been so serving, were discharged, transferred to the Reserve or died during the previous 12 months.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of officers commanding units are processed by command boards and the recommendations of these boards are submitted for consideration by a board at Army Headquarters.  This board submits its nominations to the Adjutant General who makes the final recommendation in each case to the Minister for Defence, the awarding authority.</P>
    <P>The medal was awarded in 1987, 1988 and 1989.  This year, however, the military authorities commenced a review of the criteria for the award of the medal in the light of experience gained since the medal was introduced and, pending the outcome of the review, suspended the processing of applications for the award of the medal.  I have, however, directed that, pending the outcome of the review, the existing regulations should be implemented in full.  The reason for the review is that because of the limit on the number of medals awarded annually many members of the Permanent Defence Force who ostensibly satisfy the basic criteria as to service requirements and conduct rating do not receive the award.</P>
    <P>This is the nub of the problem, which is a difficult one.  When one introduces an excellent idea like this into a close knit disciplined force certain members who do not receive the medal and are aware of others who have received it may get perhaps well founded ideas with regard to the award.  A certain invidiousness develops and an excellent idea can turn sour.  This is one of the human nature aspects that has arisen.  This aspect has come to the notice of the Army authorities, who are concerned about it, and <Col N="1913" /> hence the reason for a review of the criteria.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartan has made some suggestions tonight but it is important, pending the outcome of the review, to proceed as heretofore with the award of the medals.  In the current year 60 will be awarded and then we will have a look at the criteria and take on board other suggestions, including those put forward by Deputy McCartan, and I have some ideas myself.  We will try to devise criteria that will be more firmly based for 1991 and future years.</P>
    <P>However, there is the basic difficulty that there will be a cut-off point.  No matter how many we select there will be people who may feel they should be selected but are not selected.  That is part of the problem and one of the reasons why the review is being undertaken, The present system gives rise to a perception of invidious treatment.  It is felt that because such personnel may feel they were treated in that fashion there should be further consideration of the inadequacy or otherwise of the criteria.  That examination is proceeding and I will consider any recommendations which will emerge from the review.  I will take an interest in the review, particularly since the matter has been raised in the Dáil. Any changes in the conditions governing the award of the medal which may result from this review will be introduced in 1991.  The present criteria apply for 1990.</P>
    <P>With regard to the new UN medal, introduced last year for personnel who have served overseas with the United Nations, I should like to tell the House that the award of that medal is not affected by the review of the arrangements for the award of the good conduct medal.  The Deputy made the point that there was not an inscription on the medal to indicate that the UN peacekeeping force had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, a very important honour.  I will have the suggestion investigated and, as the Deputy suggests, the fact that the award was given to the peacekeeping <Col N="1914" /> force by the most prestigious peace awarding body in the world makes it more important.  I accept that to have an appropriate inscription on the medal would add to the prestige of the medal. I will have that matter investigated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Chair for permitting me to raise this important matter on the Adjournment and to thank the Minister for Finance for attending the debate.  My question related to the grant of £800,000 which Cavan County Council expected to receive this year from the ERDF Border Gas Pipeline Fund designated for the Border region.  To date that grant has not been paid and there is great concern among the officials and members of Cavan County Council about the delay in doing that.  Work commenced on the strength of the promise to pay that grant, which was indicated to us at our January estimates meeting.  In the mid-eighties it was proposed to bring Kinsale gas to Belfast and our Government, the Northern Ireland authorities, the British Government and the EC got involved in the programme.  A fund of £24.5 million was established; but, unfortunately, the proposal fell by the wayside when the British Government pulled out and the fund lay dormant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In late 1987 it came to my attention that the fund could be used for road improvements or projects related to tourism in the Border region.  I tabled a question to the Minister for Finance on 3 May 1988 and asked him the amount of money made available for tourism related projects from the EC fund originally designated for the gas pipeline from Dublin to Belfast, the projects which will be undertaken with this money and their location, and to include allocations for county roads as important tourist related projects.  In a further question I asked the Minister for Finance the counties <Col N="1915" /> which will qualify.  In the course of his reply the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Approximately £8 million in ERDF aid is earmarked for tourism under the programme for the Border areas of Ireland.  The counties concerned are: Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth.</P>
    <P>The submissions received from local authorities in connection with this programme greatly exceeded what could be funded with the amount available. The local authorities concerned were therefore invited to identify priority projects.  The revised submissions which have been received are now being examined with a view to drawing together a coherent set of projects which enhances the tourism potential of the area as a whole.  This will include both directly tourism-related amenities and county roads which provide access for tourists. </P>
    <P>At our estimates meeting in January last year I was delighted to hear that the Minister, and the then Minister for Tourism and Transport, had notified the council that they would receive £750,000 from the fund.  That money was more than welcome and was spent on a road from Killeshandra to Crossdoney taking in the Killykeen Forest Park, the focal point for the tourism related project.  The forest park is an outstanding development that was undertaken by the former Deputy for my constituency, Mr. Tom Fitzpatrick, when he was Minister for Lands, but the roads to it were in such a disgraceful condition that the tourists were reluctant to use the facilities to the full.  Indeed, local people were reluctant to use the roads.  The project proved to be an excellent success and the council were highly commended.</P>
    <P>At the time we were informed that the project would last between two and three years and that we could look forward to a further contribution in 1990.  At our estimates meeting in January, a meeting <Col N="1916" /> that was long drawn out and at which we failed to strike a rate, it was indicated that a further £800,000 would be made available.  That represented the second contribution under the gas pipeline fund. However, that money has not been paid, although on the strength of the commitment the council prepared a programme. In fact, it was hoped that the council would benefit to the tune of £1 million.  In my view we are entitled to the additional money because of the six Border counties.  I do not know how Sligo was classified as a Border county.  Cavan and Monaghan have greater road problems than any other county in the country.  That has been accepted by the Departments of Finance and the Environment.</P>

      <P>I do not think the fund should have been divided in six equal parts.  In my view Cavan and Monaghan were entitled to more than Sligo, Donegal, Leitrim or Louth.  In fact, Louth benefited enormously from many EC projects.  We are entitled to a minimum of £1 million this year.  On 4 July I tabled a question to the Minister in relation to the fund and he indicated that he was looking at a further balance of the original sum of £24.5 million of the remaining £5 million.  There is confusion there but I am not talking about the balance of £5 million, which to me represents a second phase of the £24.5 million allocated for various projects.  I am talking about the second phase of the first instalment of £8 million, not the first phase of the second <Col N="1917" /> instalment of £5 million.  There is confusion in the Minister's Department about that.</P>
      <P>It appears that the Minister has not decided what he intends doing with the balance of £5 million that was left aside to bring a gas pipeline from Louth to Sligo.  To be honest, I do not see any benefit in that for the immediate Border region.  The project should be abandoned and the money used for the improvements of roads and infrastructure that would help to develop the tourism industry in that region.  Will the Minister give me an indication that he will clear up the confusion about the £800,000 we understood we would be receiving from the fund?  If he cannot do so, he will have to explain what happened to this money. Was it siphoned off for some other project? There is no doubt in my mind that that money is available.  I cannot stand idly by while my county is being denied this badly needed grant&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I hope I will be able to clear up some of the confusion.  I have been advised that the council have received all moneys due to them for 1988.  I also understand that they have received an advance of the money due to them for 1989, even though the final amount has not been finalised.  As the money becomes available from the ERDF fund, they will receive what is owed to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the sum of money, £5 million, to which the Deputy referred, which has yet to be allocated, a feasibility study was carried out by Bord Gáis on the basis that 50 per cent of the cost would be recouped from Brussels.  As the <Col N="1918" /> Deputy is aware, under the new Structural Fund regulations and the Community support framework, it is possible to obtain between 70 per cent and 75 per cent for such a project if the Commission decide to grant aid it.  We have had many meetings with the Commission and informed them of the results of the feasibility study.  However, we were asked to have a number of further questions examined in a further study, taking into account the higher level of grant available, to see if this would alter the picture. As I said, the money has not yet been allocated and we are pressing the Commission to have the matter finalised.</P>
    <P>The matter may be complicated by the new programmes being put together by the Commission, Comprising of what are termed unallocated resources.  One of these programmes will be known as INTERREG.  We have held discussions with the Commission to see if they would be willing to grant aid a project to pipe gas from a gas field in the United Kingdom to here under another of the programmes. Such a pipeline could present us with a number of opportunities if such a project were to be grant aided.  We do not know yet whether it will be, as the matter has not been finalised with the Commission.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also made reference to tourism projects, but these may be grant aided under many other programmes. We then come to the cross Border programme, comprising unallocated funds, or, to put it more simply, additional structural funds.  Some of my officials are in Brussels today to try to finalise what is known as the peripherality programme.</P>
    <P>When the expenditure accounts for 1989 under the ERDF are finalised some money will be due to Cavan County Council.  I am not aware of what the exact figure will be, but I think I have brought the Deputy right up to date about the position in relation to the sum of £5 million. I hope there will be no misunderstanding about this matter.  The Deputy expressed the view tonight that this money could best be spent on a gas <Col N="1919" /> pipeline; but we fail to see, given 50 per cent aid, what economic benefits would accrue as a result.  Nevertheless, we were obliged to carry out a feasibility study. It is our view, which is shared by local authorities in the Border region, that the money would best be spent on other projects. In view of this, some of the local authorities &mdash; including, I think, Cavan <Col N="1920" /> County Council &mdash; have suggested projects to be grant aided once the allocation is finalised.  As the sum to be allocated has not yet been finalised, the projects submitted remain to be considered.  I hope that this has cleared the matter up for the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.45 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 13 July 1990.</P>

      <P>I have at all times made clear <Col N="1665" /> to school management, teachers, parents and business interests the importance of languages for our young people.</P>
      <P>In 1988 I had a survey carried out of the extent to which teachers qualified in modern languages were underutilised.  I followed this up with the introduction of a scheme for the payment of part-time teaching hours to those schools who introduced an additional modern continental language into their curricula.</P>
      <P>To cater for senior pupils who wished to begin the study of a language <i>ab initio</i> but who were not in a position to take on the leaving certificate course, I decided that, where schools so wished, senior cycle pupils could be permitted to follow the intermediate certificate course in French, German, Spanish or Italian and be allowed sit the intermediate certificate examination paper in the language studied at the time of sitting their leaving certificate examination.</P>
      <P>I also arranged for foreign language modules to be offered in VPT courses.</P>
      <P>I am happy to say that these initiatives have been most successful.  The number of schools providing German, for example, increased by one-third from 1987-88 to 1988-89 and the number increased further for 1989-90.  The number of post-primary schools now offering two continental languages has increased by 63 per cent since 1985-86.</P>
      <P>Action is currently being taken in relation to the implementation of the Lingua programme under the auspices of the European Community.  This programme, which will be operational next year, involves, <i>inter alia</i>, in-service training for teachers in the country of the target language and student and teacher exchange.  I am confident that this will ensure the wider provision of language teaching and learning in second-level schools.</P>

    <P>The position in relation to those years for which statistics are available is in the form of a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.  As a matter of policy information on candidates does not distinguish between girls and boys.</P>

    <P>As the Deputies are probably aware the terms &ldquo;pass&rdquo; or &ldquo;fail&rdquo; are no longer applied to the certificate examinations.

      <P>It has been long established practice in my Department to ensure that all national schools are easily accessible to disabled children including those who use wheelchairs and to provide suitable toilet facilities where required.  All new national schools are designed on the basis of the provision of these facilities as a matter of course.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40, 62, 78 and 203 together.</P>
      <P>In March 1988, the Government allocated £2.25 million from national lottery funds for the development of a national outdoor stadium.  In view of the huge costs involved there are no plans at this stage to develop an outdoor national sports stadium on a green field site.</P>
      <P>The need to provide a suitable venue for international soccer matches with large ground capacity requirements can be met only by way of and adaptation of an existing stadium.  In this regard discussions have taken place between my Department and the main sporting organisations.  However, pending completion of these negotiations I am not in a position at this stage to outline detailed proposals or to give a time scale for the establishment of a national outdoor stadium.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with International Literacy Year and my determination to tackle the problem of illiteracy generally, I have undertaken a comprehensive range of measures aimed at the prevention and remediation of illiteracy at all levels.</P>
      <P>My objectives in relation to illiteracy are two-fold; first, to prevent illiteracy at school level and, secondly, to address the needs of adult illiteracy through specially tailored and funded programmes.</P>
      <P>My approach can be classified under two headings &mdash; preventative and curative.</P>
      <P>As an example on the preventative side, I have arranged, during 1989/90, for the provision of an additional 95 teachers for primary schools in disadvantaged areas and 30 remedial teachers to supplement the existing cadre of some 900 remedial teachers in primary schools. Furthermore, I provided, during the year, an extra £1 million for the schools' library service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the curative side, I managed to double, to approx.  £1 million, in 1990 the allocation for the adult literacy and community education scheme which is run under the aegis of the VECs. The overall provision for adult literacy/education organisations in 1990 has been increased by 36 per cent, from £179,000 to £244,000.  These improved allocations have enabled certain of the organisations undertake special projects e.g., the Dublin Institute of Adult Education is receiving £15,000 for special <Col N="1679" /> research and development projects in literacy; the National Adult Literacy Agency is receiving £23,000 for its programme of events in International Literacy Year; the Association for Adult Education for Travellers is receiving £15,000 towards the cost of providing literacy and basic education courses for adult travellers.</P>
    <P>I should also add that, arising from International Literacy Year, the Government established a Cabinet sub-committee comprising myself in the Chair, and the Ministers for Labour and Social Welfare, to co-ordinate proposals in this area to ensure that the various resources available for adult literacy and community education and training schemes are used in the most effective and coherent way.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1680" /> In addition, the number of retirements include teachers retiring voluntarily before having reached the age for compulsory retirement and teachers retiring on disability pension.  While changes may be taking place in the pattern of such retirements, it is currently estimated that approximately 170 teachers per annum will retire on these grounds.</P>
    <P>Each retirement may not create a fillable vacancy as the staffing level for a school for a particular year is determined by the enrolment in the school on the 30 September of the previous year.</P>

      <P>While it is clear from the 1988 HEA survey &ldquo;First Destination of Award Recipients in Higher Education&rdquo; that the proportion of award recipients going abroad has risen sharply, from 5 per cent in 1982 to 19.9 per cent in 1988, that survey also shows that the accelerated annual rate of increase was halted and in absolute terms the number of respondents to the survey who found employment in Ireland was higher than ever before, at 500 more than the previous year.</P>
      <P>There are many reasons why award recipients in higher education emigrate; it is important to recognise that these reasons do not relate solely to an inability to obtain employment in Ireland and include such considerations as opportunities for further training, wider experience and career advancement.</P>
      <P>In the context of my Department's responsibility in contributing to a reduction in the level of emigration among third level award holders, the ESF-funded Advanced Technical Skills Programme and the Government initiatives to provide additional places in the university sector and to provide funding for the universities to meet development needs in specialised areas critical to industrial development are aimed at ensuring that graduates have the right skills to meet the needs of Irish industry and consequently improve their prospects of employment in Ireland.</P>

      <P>The increase in the percentage of teachers retiring on pension who retire voluntarily before reaching compulsory retiring age reflects the choice of the teachers concerned, influenced by changes in superannuation provisions which removed disincentives against such early retirement.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will note that despite large increases in the total number of teachers in employment in the periods up to and including the period in question the total number of teachers retiring from the service in 1989 shows a 28 per cent decrease on the number who retired in 1979.  This decrease reflects the effect of the 1988 special voluntary redundancy-early retirement scheme for primary teachers. The percentage figures for the number of people retiring on being awarded disability pensions is, therefore, artifically inflated for 1989.</P>

The drop in student numbers already evident at primary level will transfer to second level over the next five years with an anticipated loss of some 28,000 pupils by the end of the decade.  This significant change in the demographic pattern requires careful planning to ensure the optimum and most equitable use of resource allocations.</P>

      <P>One of the principal reasons for having a National Parents' Council is to enable parents to contribute more effectively to the development of educational policies.  Since the establishment of the council with its primary and post-primary tiers, it has been consulted on major educational issues.  It is my intention to continue these valuable consultations which can now be held on a basis genuinely representative of parent opinion.</P>

      <P>In recent years, the World Bank has made the environment a major focus of attention in its lending policies. To this end, the bank has substantially increased the resources it devotes to the environment which is enabling it to incorporate environmental concerns into all facets of its project cycle.  The bank's direct lending for environmental purposes has also increased dramatically. Moreover, environmental issues have become an ever increasing part of the bank's dialogue with the Governments of its borrowing countries and, in addition, the bank is developing its relationships with the non-governmental organisations (NGOs) which specialise in environmental issues.  In the light of these developments, I am satisfied that World Bank group resources, including Ireland's contributions, are being utilised with care and concern for the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already conveyed my concerns about the Narmada River Development Project to the Executive Director for <Col N="1699" /> Ireland at the World Bank.  I have been assured that the bank has taken special care in planning and implementing the project with the Government of India and that it continues to pay careful attention to the views of NGOs and to local interests about the project.  Furthermore, I understand that specific conditions relating to resettlement and environmental protection issues are inscribed in the bank's agreements with the Indian central and state governments involved in the project and failure to fully comply with these conditions could lead to a suspension of disbursements.  Finally, I am assured that the bank continues to monitor the situation closely, with its next detailed review of the project being scheduled for later this year.</P>

In administering the provisions of the legislation it is not necessary to distinguish between quoted and unquoted companies. Because of this, statistics are not recorded in such a manner as would enable the breakdown in question to be provided.  As regards (d), the number of profit sharing schemes approved between 6 April 1986 and 5 April 1990 for tax relief under the provisions of Chapter IX of the Finance Act, 1982, is 72.

      <P>Income tax legislation specifies that PAYE workers are entitled to a reduction in respect of expenses wholly, <Col N="1701" /> exclusively and necessarily incurred in the performance of the duties of their employment.  There are no fixed allowances. However, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that expense allowances have been agreed administratively in relation to various categories of workers in accordance with the legislation.  The levels of such allowances are set by inspectors of taxes following <Col N="1702" /> consideration of relevant data presented by or on behalf of the group concerned. The onus of applying to have expense allowances reviewed rests with the taxpayers themselves and/or their representatives. The various levels of expenses for certain categories of building workers together with details as to when they were last adjusted are set out in the following schedule.</P>

      <P>With the aid of the funds provided under the environmental action programme the Office of Public Works have prepared a programme of rescue excavation to be undertaken this year and has made proposals to certain local authorities to assist them in reconciling the protection of archaeology with urban development.  The setting up of a wetlands archaeology unit, to deal mainly with rescue of archaeological finds in bogs, was recently announced.  Other areas where archaeological sites are potentially endangered are being investigated in consultation with the relevant authorities.</P>

      <P>Under section 25 of the Irish Church Act, 1869, provision was made for the Commissioners of Church Temporalities in Ireland, to vest any church, ecclesiastical building or structure, which appeared ruinous and not suitable for restoration as a place of public worship, and yet deserving of being maintained as a national monument by reason of its architectural character or antiquity, in the Secretary of the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland, to be held by such secretary, his heirs and assigns, upon trust for the Commissioners of Public Works, to be preserved as a national monument and not to be used as a place of worship.</P>
      <P>It was as a result of this Act that the Commissioners of Public Works were given their first collection of national monuments.  The Commissioners of Church Temporalities also provided a sum of £50,000 to the Commissioners of Public Works for the maintenance of the vested structures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The definition of &ldquo;monument&rdquo; under the National Monuments Acts, 1930-1987 excludes any building which is used habitually for ecclesiastical purposes so there is a consistency between these Acts and the Irish Church Act, 1869.

      <P>The Office of Public Works have no record of an application from a German priest for permission to celebrate Mass at Clonmacnoise, this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may be referring to an inquiry made at Clonmacnoise on 27 May 1990 on behalf of a foreign priest as to whether it would be possible to celebrate Mass on the national monument site.  The person was advised that permission to celebrate Mass at the permanent altar on the site is usually given by the Office of Public Works provided a number of conditions are complied with, including one requiring the permission be obtained in advance from the Bishop of Ardagh and Clonmacnoise to celebrate Mass there.  The commissioners also require to be indemnified against all liability arising from the use of the site, and evidence of insurance cover has to be produced in advance.  These were the conditions upon which the Office of Public Works granted permission to the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association to celebrate Mass at Clonmacnoise on that particular day.  As this procedure had not been followed by <Col N="1708" /> the foreign priest it was not feasible to accommodate his service on that day and this was accepted by the person concerned.</P>

    <P>Figures for June 1990 are not yet available but December 1989 statistics show that there was a 16 per cent increase in numbers over the same period last year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1711" /> The very substantial 54 per cent increase in sheep numbers between 1986 and 1989 has been achieved in response to very strong market prices which have created a high level of confidence in the sheep sector as well as the support which has been provided by EC market mechanisms. A considerable build-up of the breeding herd in parallel suggests future sustained herd size.</P>
    <P>Having established very satisfactory supplies of sheep meat it now remains to build up and consolidate our market outlets, both domestic and overseas.  To this end there has recently been a greater promotional drive on the domestic market, as well as continued concentration on moving more of our lamb sales into higher priced outlets which demand quality produce.</P>

    <P>Pig numbers had been in decline from 1985 but by 1989 this downward trend was reversed and this year we have seen the national herd built up to over one million animals.  This welcome change in trend is attributable in part to improved prices, especially in the autumn of last year.  Prices so far this year are also running at favourable levels and are now above those applying at the corresponding period last year.</P>
    <P>In addition the major development programme for the pigmeat industry is well under way and proving successful.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1712" /> This too has helped to increase producer confidence in the industry.</P>

    <P>Figures for June 1990 are not yet available but the December 1989 figures show that there had been a 4.6 per cent increase at that stage over the same period in the previous year.</P>
    <P>Cattle numbers had been in decline for the three years up to 1988 principally due to the reduction in cow numbers following the implementation of the EC dairy quota.  However, I am pleased to say that cattle numbers have begun to build up over the past year due to increase in the size of the beef herd.  During 1989 there was a 16 per cent increase in the beef breeding herd which bodes well for future beef cattle herd size.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 125 and 127 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Land improvement including ancillary drainage in disadvantaged areas is grant-aided under the western package.  The western package which commenced in 1981 terminates in 1991.  In 1988, I negotiated a revision of the package to include, <i>inter alia,</i> grants for animal housing and pollution control.  These grants and other features of the package will <Col N="1714" /> be continued in other forms after the package's termination.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Northern Ireland measures referred to by the Deputy form part of an equivalent ten-year programme for agricultural development in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>As indicated in replies to other recent parliamentary questions, it has been necessary, as part of the arrangements for phasing out the western package, to suspend the processing of further applications for land improvement so that the extent of existing commitments can be established; if it emerges that these commitments do not exhaust the EC funds available for this purpose the processing of applications can be resumed until those funds are exhausted.  In any event, aid for land improvement will continue to be available in all areas under the Farm Improvement Programme.</P>
    <P>The priorities in the area of agricultural structural measures for the period 1989 to 1993 were agreed between the Government and the EC Commission during the negotiations last year on the Community Support Framework for Ireland.  The Community Support Framework does not provide for the introduction of a second western package although, as already indicated, some of the measures included in the package will be continued in other forms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department recognises Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, or ME as it is commonly known, as a certifiable incapacity. As ME is a very difficult condition to diagnose, it can take some time before a person is finally diagnosed as having ME.  In the intervening period, claimants are usually certified as being incapable of work from some other cause.  As a result of this, perhaps, and also due to the relatively low incidence of the condition, my Department sees very little certification that actually specifies the cause if incapacity as ME.</P>
      <P>I met with representatives from the ME Association earlier this year.  Senior officials concerned with the administrative and medical certification work in this general area also attended.  I assured the representatives from the ME Association of our fullest co-operation in regard to the dissemination of information and the understanding of ME.  I also assured them that my Department would keep in touch with international development.  Arising from this meeting additional information on ME was distributed to all the Department's doctors. In addition, as part of my Department's policy of keeping up to date with current medical issues, a number of our medical personnel recently attended a special session given by the Irish College of Occupational Medicine on the topic of ME. Also, my Department's medical adviser attended the First World Symposium on ME held in Cambridge, UK, in April and a full report on these proceedings was issued to all medical referees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All disability benefit and invalidity pension claims are subject to the normal medical evaluations by the Department's medical referees.  In arriving at a conclusion on any particular case the medical referee has regard to all relevant evidence provided and in particular to comments submitted by the claimant's own general practitioner.  In the instances in which a person is called before a medical referee his or her doctor is informed and invited to submit appropriate information in relation to the case.  It is important to get as much information as <Col N="1722" /> possible from the person's doctor in all instances, but particularly so in conditions such as ME where the person's doctor can provide information on the nature of his/her patient's complaint over a period.</P>
    <P>The person concerned was examined by a medical referee on 26 April 1990 who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.  Payment of disability benefit was therefore disallowed from 4 May 1990.</P>
    <P>He appealed against this decision and was examined by a different medical referee on 21 June 1990 who also expressed the opinion that he was capable of work. He was notified of the result of this examination and asked if he wished his case to be referred to an appeals officer.  The Deputy's representations have been accepted as a &ldquo;Notice of Appeal&rdquo; and the case will now be referred to an appeals officer.  Should the appeals officer consider that an oral hearing is necessary, the person concerned will be notified of the time and place to attend.</P>

      <P>Following investigation a deciding officer assessed the means of the person concerned at £12,011.50 a year from 15 December 1989.  His means are derived from the net yearly value of his holding, £12,000, and from capital, £11.50.  All receipts for expenses produced by the person concerned were available for the consideration of the deciding officer in arriving at his decision. In making assessments of means, deciding officers allow the ordinary expenses which would be necessarily incurred in earning the income to the extent that these appear reasonable having regard to the circumstances of the case.</P>
      <P>The means assessment exceeded the statutory limit of £7,540 for receipt of a qualification certificate in his case. Accordingly, he was not entitled to payment of unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>A form to enable him to appeal against the means assessment was issued to him on 3 July 1990.  On receipt of the completed form in his local office, his case will be referred to an appeals officer for determination and he will be informed of the outcome without delay.</P>

      <P>In the case of farmers, the means assessed in relation to their holdings are based on the normal income from the farm less any expenses actually and <Col N="1724" /> necessarily incurred in earning that income.  The usual basis of the calculation is the net income from the farm over the twelve months preceding the date of the investigation.</P>
      <P>In general, means can be readily established on information supplied by the applicant.  In some cases there can be evident disparities between the household circumstances and information initially supplied.  Difficulties can also arise where the person's bank transactions are not compatible with the reported turnover or activity.  In such cases additional inquiries have to be made.  This situation applies to all persons with income from self-employment.</P>
      <P>The statutory provisions governing the application for a qualification certificate oblige applicants to provide any information required to enable their applications to be determined.  In this regard a social welfare officer may seek further information where the officer is not satisfied that the facts presented represent the true position in a particular case.  Likewise an appeals officer may decide it is necessary to seek clarification of certain aspects of an assessment or to request a social welfare officer to obtain additional information from a claimant so that the relevant appeal can be determined.</P>

      <P>I presented a compromise proposal shortly after the commencement of the Irish Presidency of the European Community for the purpose of protecting fresh, coastal and marine waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources.  I took this initiative in an effort to resolve fundamental problems for a number of member states arising from the original Commission <Col N="1729" /> proposal, which had prevented agreement on the matter during the terms of the two preceding Presidencies.</P>
      <P>My proposal was considered in detail at a number of meetings at expert level and at the March and June meetings of the Council of Environment Ministers. Progress was made on the proposal, but this was insufficient to resolve all outstanding problems of member states.</P>
      <P>The extent of any &ldquo;vulnerable zones&rdquo; to be designated in Ireland under the Directive, when adopted, will depend on the criteria to be applied for the identification of such zones.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The EC Council of Development Ministers, under the Irish Presidency, adopted a resolution entitled &ldquo;Tropical Forests: development aspects&rdquo; at its meeting on 29 May 1990.  This resolution recognised the need for a worldwide co-ordinated strategy for tropical forest <Col N="1730" /> resources and endorsed a number of principles and activities.  It welcomed the increased priority given to tropical forestry in the Lomé IV Convention, indicated that greater emphasis must be placed on conservation of tropical forests and underlined that the success of the strategy requires increased attention of forestry aid policies in both donor and developing countries.  Finally, the Resolution urged the Commission and member states to monitor and assess the implementation of the strategy and to report progress to a future Council.</P>
    <P>The Declaration on the Environment adopted by the European Council in June expressed concern about the destruction of tropical forests and called on the Commission to open discussions with Brazil and the other Amazonian Pact countries with a view to developing a concrete action programme including the Community, its member states and these countries.  Elements for priority consideration are to include debt for forest conservation exchanges; codes of conduct for timber importing industries and the additional resources necessary to enable the forests to be preserved and managed on a sustainable basis, making optimal use of existing agencies and mechanisms.</P>

      <P>Following a communication from the Commission to the Council on a Community Strategy for Waste Management, the Irish Presidency proposed a comprehensive Resolution on Waste.  The <Col N="1732" /> Resolution set out the basic guidelines for Community waste management and established priorities and timescales for specific aspects of waste control.  The resolution was adopted by Council on 22 March 1990.  The text is contained in the Official Journal of the European Communities No. C 122/2 of 18 May 1990.</P>
      <P>The adoption of the resolution enabled work to be advanced on a number of specific waste control measures.  The Council, on 7 June, agreed a Directive which gives priority to waste prevention and the use of clean technologies; requires an emphasis to be put on recycling; and establishes self-sufficiency in waste disposal as the norm. The Council also reached a common position, which is subject to further consideration by the Parliament, on a Directive banning the sale of batteries with a high mercury content, promoting recycling and requiring disposal of used batteries separate from ordinary household waste.</P>

      <P>At a meeting with the Commission in January 1990 and in subsequent correspondence, the Irish Presidency pressed for the prompt submission to the Council of a proposal on a Community eco-labelling system.  A Resolution on Waste Policy, advanced by the Irish Presidency and adopted by the Council of Environment Ministers on 22 March 1990, brought the matter further by inviting the Commission to come forward as soon as possible with proposals for ecological criteria for products and a supplementary Community-wide eco-labelling system.</P>

Should there be undue delay in introducing a Community scheme, I will review the question of introducing a separate national scheme.</P>

    <P>While I am reasonably satisfied with the type and range of insurance cover availed of by each health board, I have been concerned about the growing cost of premia in recent years, particularly in the areas of public and employers liability. My Department are currently examining the matter, especially with a <Col N="1743" /> view to cost containment and value for money.  As premium costs are directly related to the cost of claims, such strategies as risk management programmes are being actively pursued.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, in recent years we have become a more litigious society and the problems associated with increasing costs of insurance is by no means confined to the health services but is reflected in almost every other area of Irish society today.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is as follows:</P>
      <P>The principal schemes of direct assistance for students pursuing courses of third-level education are&mdash;</P>
      <P>  (a) (i)  The higher education grants scheme administered by the county councils and county borough corporations.</P>
      <P>(ii)  Scheme of scholarships administered by the vocational education committees for students wishing to pursue courses in regional technical colleges, colleges of technology and other approved institutions of third-level education. </P>
      <P>In order to qualify for a grant or scholarship under these schemes a candidate must, <i>inter alia</i>, obtain prescribed successes in the leaving certificate Examination of the Department of Education and comply with the means test provisions laid down in the schemes.  The same benefits are payable under both schemes.</P>
      <P>(b)  The EC training grants scheme administered by the regional technical colleges and colleges of technology in respect of certain courses in those colleges.</P>
      <P>There is no means test prescribed in the scheme.  Trainees have their course fees paid and, in addition, they are paid a maintenance training grant.  </P>
      <P>A special scheme of assistance, broadly similar to the higher education grants A special scheme, is operated by the Department for students in Thomond College, Limerick for teachers of physical education, metalwork and engineering science, woodwork and building science and rural/general science.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department awards scholarships under the following three schemes on the <Col N="1753" /> results of the leaving certificate examination. There is no means test prescribed in the scheme.</P>
    <P> (a)  Scheme of scholarships for students from the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>(b)  Scheme of scholarships for students pursuing third-level courses through Irish.</P>
    <P>(c)  Easter Week 1916 commemoration scholarships.  </P>
    <P>The Department also operates a special grants scheme for mature women students under which 15 once-off grants of £1,000 each are awarded annually.</P>
    <P>The main criteria applying to the scheme are as follows: each application must be female and aged 25 years or over on or before the closing date for receipt of application; be unwaged or on a low income; be participating in an approved undergraduate degree, diploma or certificate course to the extent that she has completed at least one year of the course; not be in receipt of a grant, scholarship or funding from any other source; furnish <Col N="1754" /> a letter from the relevant college authorities confirming (a) her success in the previous academic year examinations (b) that she has re-enrolled for the academic year and (c) that she is not, to their knowledge, in receipt of a grant, scholarship or funding from any other source; provide information on the financial circumstances of the household/individual; furnish details on educational qualifications.</P>
    <P>Since 1985, the amounts payable under various schemes of financial assistance in respect of fees and maintenance have increased each year in line with tuition fees charged by colleges and with inflation.  These improvements in the provision of financial support for third level students have taken place during a period of budgetary constraint.</P>
    <P>In the 1989/90 academic year, it is estimated that the percentage of third-level students in receipt of financial assistance is in excess of 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>The tabular statement following summarises the financial benefits available under each scheme:</P>
