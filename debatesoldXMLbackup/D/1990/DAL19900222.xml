      <P>I wish to tell you, Sir, that my party has formally requested the Government for Government time for a debate on the implications of the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme of last night on the adequacy of banking supervision arrangements in Ireland and the adequacy of the resources available to the fraud squad for the speedy conclusion of investigations.  I wish to ask the Taoiseach if he is yet in a position to indicate when or whether such time will be made available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise in support of the request made by Deputy Bruton.  I believe the Taoiseach should make a statement and say if time is going to be made available.  Very serious allegations were made last night on the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme.  I believe this House should deal with them as a matter of urgency.  I would ask the Taoiseach to state that time will be available today if possible.</P>

        <i>(Limerick-East):</i> On a matter of legislation, a Bill abolishing Fóir Teoranta was circulated last week without an explanatory memorandum.  Is this to be a precedent and a departure from the usual practice of circulating Finance Bills with explanatory memoranda?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Adjournment last Thursday I was outlining the progress made since the 1987 election and the confidence which has been restored since then.  I complimented the Minister on the wide area he covered in the budget, the special attention he gave to the less well off and the old in the measures he introduced, the measures he proposed to prepare us for 1992 and the Single European Act and the removal of many anomalies which have been brought to the notice of various Ministers over a number of years.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision of £600,000 for agricultural training.  This, added to the £1.1 million from the European fund under Teagasc will ensure that agricultural students in residential training in horticultural and agricultural colleges will be on equal terms with vocational students.  It will remove an anomaly which has caused much concern to Macra na Feirme and many other bodies, and will encourage more students to undertake courses in agriculture and horticulture. If the family farm is to be retained we must adopt a more structured approach to farming be it in livestock, tillage or intense pig and poultry production. The day of inefficiency is gone.</P>
      <P>There have been many announcements and much discussion regarding alternative farm enterprises in view of the decline in many of the traditional areas of production, such as milk and beef. Milk production is curtailed and profitability on beef cattle has reduced.  Mention has been made of alternatives, such as rabbit, deer and goats for milk and angora wool, but it is recognised now that these are not alternatives, and it is time for us to look at some other areas.  While what I have referred to may well be all right as sidelines and may produce a reasonable return, they cannot be really regarded as alternatives.  We will have to look to areas such as flax production and seed potatoes as alternatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ray MacSharry, EC Commisioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, put forward plans for rural areas and alternative enterprises.  He mentioned forestry, craft industries and small food <Col N="312" /> processing industries.  In my constituency food processing has developed in the last few years and has given good employment but there is still room for progress.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred in the budget to the disease eradication programme.  I welcome the extension of the period for restocking before the clawback for stock relief.  TB in cattle is the most serious problem facing farmers.  An area in my constituency which at one time was clear of TB now sees many serious outbreaks and in some cases entire herds have had to be eliminated.  Despite all the surveys we do not seem to have made any advance in identifying the cause of this disease.</P>
    <P>A strong lobby has been mounted by the Green Party and others against the slaughter of badgers.  It has been established that in areas where there is a high incidence of TB in cattle, slaughtered badgers were found to have a high incidence of it also.  I do not see how anyone can claim that badgers should not be slaughtered if they are TB carriers.  We must face facts.  For years the number of cattle found to be affected by TB was small but now the incidence has increased greatly in many herds.  I do not know whether more intensive tests have brought this to light.  Last week the director of ERAD said that TB levels vary from country to country.  There is serious concern about the fact that animal movement takes place between five and seven times a year.  In most other countries animals do not leave the farm on which they are born until they are to be slaughtered. Had the calf-to-beef system been developed as proposed for the 12 western counties some years ago it might have solved many problems in regard to the movement of animals.  Obviously there is a serious danger of infection when animals are moved.</P>
    <P>In Northern Ireland movement permits are required.  It is expected to be two years before we can introduce such permits because the system would have to be computerised along with cattle headage and various other payment systems. The director of ERAD also drew attention to the reliability of the test, <Col N="313" /> which is about 80 per cent or 85 per cent and can be as low as 66 per cent in cows.</P>
    <P>The benefits of the budget in other areas are such that the trade unions have again agreed to enter into an agreement with the Government and employers. Union leaders are hard-headed negotiators and they know the benefits of a Government giving steady and sustained progress as against a free-for-all situation. Such sustained progress with a high level of industrial peace is one of the best weapons in tackling our difficult unemployment problem.  While there would be short-term benefits from putting money into unsustainable jobs, there would be no long-term advantage.  No country in Europe has found a shortcut to job creation.  Sustained and steady growth is the only viable road.</P>
    <P>I welcome the reduction in excise duties on a range of items and the fact that there was no increase in the old reliables.  I come from an area where trade has been devastated by smugglers exploiting the price differential between this country and the North of Ireland and this aspect is of particular concern.  The former Minister for Finance, Mr. Ray MacSharry, introduced the 48-hour residence clause which succeeded in stopping the bus tours and shopping expeditions across the Border.  However, towns in the immediate vacinity of the Border continue to suffer trading problems.</P>
    <P>The Minister reduced by 20 per cent the excise duty on table water and abolished duties on black and white televisions and on colour televisions with screens of up to 17 inches.  The duty on sets having screens measuring between 17 inches and 24 inches was reduced from £49 to £30 and the duty on larger sets was reduced from £60 to £45.  Excise duty was also abolished on records and compact discs.  I understand the reduction in the price of gas for cars will be about 43p per gallon.</P>
    <P>Prior to the budget all Deputies in the Border areas were pressed by electrical traders for a levelling off in the price differential between here and Northern Ireland.  Since the budget announcement <Col N="314" /> I have received letters from traders who are appreciative of the steps taken by the Minister.  Many of these people had said prior to the budget that if some relief was not forthcoming they would be faced with a decision whether to continue trading.  I welcome the fact that they have been given some relief.</P>
    <P>Areas in the immediate vacinity of the Border still suffer on a political, social, cultural and economic level.  This happens in the case of any partitioned country.  The extra difficulties caused by the land frontier on this island have never been fully recognised and corrective measures have not been taken.  I have stated continually that blame for this neglect of the Border areas must be placed on every Government who have held office since the foundation of the State.  Adequate provision to offset the problem created by the drawing of an arbitrary line across the countryside, cutting off the natural hinterland from towns and cutting normal trading routes, has not been made.  I speak in particular about towns like Belturbet, Clones and Dundalk which are immediate to the Border.  Three quarters of Clones is surrounded by the Border and its natural trading hinterland has been lost.  With the further loss of trade due to smuggling arising from the price differential in respect of many items, matters have been worsened.</P>
    <P>The overall picture in the Border areas arising from the various causes I have mentioned is bad.  It would be much worse were it not for the substantial local initiative in those areas.  I have watched the rise of industrial development in my own area since I became a Deputy and played some part in assisting the development of broiler and egg production, mushroom growing and processing and turkey production and processing.  These enterprises have helped to overcome many of the difficulties in the area.  There is also furniture manufacturing and engineering.  The people in that constituency did not sit on their behinds waiting for charity.  We ask only for fair attention to problems arising from our proximity to the Border.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="315" /> A number of surveys have clearly identified worthwhile projects and schemes for the Border areas.  The EC portion of the necessary funding is available. Some years ago it was not available.  However, local authority and private funding is very limited.  The available funding must be matched pound for pound in the locality. The local authorities who have a very small budget and are under financial stress are not in a position to take up the allocations.  The ball is clearly with the Governments on both sides of the Border.  People in that area are entitled to additional funding.  It would be a shame if the funding available from the EC and the IFI were not taken up because matching funding was not obtainable.</P>
    <P>There is much talk about the action necessary to deal with problems in the North and there are signs of action on the political front.  The Anglo-Irish Parliamentary group will hold their first meeting next week.  The most constructive and non-political action which could be taken would be the securing of EC funds for the Border areas to the fullest possible extent.  Over the years there has not been a constructive approach to the use of those funds.  A coordinated effort has not been made in this regard.</P>
    <P>Prior to the budget, the Opposition parties tried to raise expectations of major tax reforms to an unrealistic level.  In the last two budgets they have been almost as dramatic.  For example, they suggested that 63 per cent of those paying tax should be on the standard rate. The hard reality is that to change the tax structure in one fell swoop would not be practical.  The steady progress made in the last two budgets is the best and most workable way forward.  There can be no doubt that the Government targets will be achieved in the time set.  It is important that we all set ourselves targets and discipline ourselves.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent announcement by the Minister for Agriculture in regard to the allocation of 11 million gallons of <Col N="316" /> milk for special categories of milk producers. There will be an allocation of eight million gallons to the small producers, two million gallons to young farmers and one million gallons to other special categories.  This is in line with Government thinking and also Department of Agriculture and Food thinking. Special recognition is given to small producers to ensure that they can make a livelihood out of farming.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier mushroom production in Monaghan, which is one of the main sources of employment &mdash; full-time and part-time &mdash; for many people in that county.  On two occasions here I voiced a word of warning, that no area of development in agriculture or industry was increasing at such a pace as the mushroom industry, which has increased at a frightening pace over the last decade.  I was involved in that industry when it was set up and when they were seeking grants and assistance.  At present, with the differential in the punt-sterling, prices have been reduced and there seems to be more product on the British market at times than is required.  A few weeks ago a Deputy from my constituency said there are unlimited markets, but that is not true.  I would be very concerned about people who have invested substantial funds in this industry.  From now on that area should be monitored very closely.</P>
    <P>One of the most important aims of the Government at present should be to provide jobs in every area possible.  Our natural resources should be developed to the limit.  One hobby horse of mine, which I haved mentioned consistently here over the years, is the tannery industry. When I came into this House in 1973 there were 100 people employed in two tanneries in County Monaghan.  I think there were then between 1,500 and 2,000 people employed in the industry as a whole.  At present there are better quality hides available due to the warble eradication scheme.  The furniture industry is supplying high priced, up-market suites of furniture to the British market and there must be an opening for bovine hides for that purpose.  Because of the export refunds a few years ago, semi-processed <Col N="317" /> hides were transported to the North and to England to be processed.  It is no credit to us that practically all the bovine hides from every slaughtering plant in the country are going across the Border and to England.  That is something that will have to be rectified.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I have mentioned consistently is the construction industry who have been wailing over the years about a fall-off in employment.  In my constituency there are many poultry houses and the materials for the erection of these houses are being imported year after year.  They are imported in sections and about two dozen people erect the houses during the summer.  All the fibre-glass, alarm systems, temperature control systems, equipment for feeding and drinking, automatic equipment used in up-to-date poultry houses which could be manufactured here is being imported.  I brought this to the attention of the IDA. It is a matter that should be considered immediately.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to financial incentives for designated areas.  Up to now 20 centres have been selected for urban renewal and I find it hard to understand why this number has been selected.  There are tax allowances, rent allowances and rates relief which are great incentives, but of the 20 centres in the Twenty-six Counties, there is not one in Cavan-Monaghan. There is still three years of this scheme to run and I would appeal to the Minister for the Environment and the Cabinet to be more even-handed and to give consideration to Cavan-Monaghan in the future.</P>
    <P>With many of our State forests reaching maturity, serious consideration must be given to the setting up of timber processing and treatment plants.  It is ridiculous to see timber being felled and transported long journeys, most of it to Ballycassidy in County Fermanagh, and being returned as fencing posts, pallets and in plank form.  I made inquiries regarding the region in which I live, region No. 6, about the possibility of aid from the Structural Funds for the setting up of timber processing plants, but I was <Col N="318" /> told it would be a private area of development and that in all probability this region would not be suitable.  It is possible that the IDA are aiming too high in this regard.  I travelled through Europe as a member of the Council of Europe for a number of years and the number of small plants, sawmills, de-barking plants and treatment plants in countries such as Germany and France is colossal.  I cannot see why, when those countries can have those small family-type developments, we cannot have similar ones.</P>
    <P>Great play has been made in recent times about the number of people repudiated to be living in poverty.  There is no doubt that poverty exists but the actual level is a matter of dispute as it depends on where you draw the line.  The bandying about of figures of those living in poverty serves no purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the oppotunity of saying a few words on this year's budget.  Although holes could be picked in it, as in every budget, I have to admit that overall it has been accepted as a reasonable budget.  The Minister has given increases in the social welfare area in line with inflation but the budget fails to do much for the lower paid workers who are definitely losing out in comparsion with those on social welfare.  Like Deputy Leonard, I have some doubts about the claims made in regard to the extent of poverty here.  Last Easter I had the pleasure of visiting India with the Ceann Comhairle and I saw naked poverty there.  I will never forget the scenes I witnessed, people lying on the streets, people who had been born into abject poverty.  In that uncaring country, there is no social welfare system at all.  From <Col N="319" /> the cradle to the grave, they do not get a bowl of rice from the State.</P>
      <P>Here we have a most caring system. This is one of the best countries in the world.  Despite claims about poverty here, I sometimes believe that there are great abuses of the social welfare system. Many lower paid workers suffer very badly when contrasted with people who are well looked after by the State, people who get medical cards, free local authority services and who do nixers while many thousands of people in lower paid employment are exploited.  Many people on low incomes are struggling with mortgages whereas others are given a bonus of a council house.  The cost of a house is about £32,000.  Young people struggling with a first mortgage do not get any facility from the State.  Assessment of medical card eligibility is based on gross wages which rules out many hard pressed lower paid workers and their families.  It is one section in the community who are paying for everything.  Many people pay a high price for the doubtful privilege of being classed as employed.  The system of calculating medical card eligiblity on gross wages is out of touch with reality and should be revised.</P>
      <P>The increase of 75p in children's allowance is unbelievable.  The man who devised that derisory sum, less than 20p a week, which would not buy a packet of tissues, has to be a bachelor or a child hater or a woman hater.  I will draw a comparison between a married lady with eight children who receives between £1,400 and £1,500 in children's allowance and a bachelor farmer living on a mountain with 300 sheep who receives between £8,000 and £9,000 in grants and subsidies, £180 a week.  That is some difference.  Is more thought about raising sheep in this country than about raising children? Once again in this area the Government are out of touch with reality.  That 75p is an insult to every mother.  It should be withdrawn and a more worthwhile sum produced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I unreservedly welcome the increase from £28 to £45 in the carer's allowance. It is a long overdue recognition of the <Col N="320" /> role many people play in looking after aged relatives sometimes sacrificing their lives and careers to do so.  By doing this, they save the State a lot of money.  That sum should be embellished with each passing budget.  I hope the allowance will become a constant source of recognition for these people in successive budgets. The Government should look at the proposal by Deputy FitzGerald which was introduced in 1981 in relation to a State payment for the stay-at-home housewife. Many women in lower paid employment would gladly stay at home if a worthwhile allowance was provided.  The Minister should give further consideration to that suggestion.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Border, I share many of the views of Deputy Leonard.  When we were in Government he was very understanding and fair in relation to the difficulties which confront all Governments when dealing with the Border area.  I too, have been consistent in my condemnation of the lack of Government acceptance of the terrible tragedy that has evolved in the Border area over the last 20 years.  We have been consigned to a modern-day &ldquo;hell or to Connacht&rdquo; and there has been complacency and a failure to grasp the difficulties which are unique in Border areas.  Our difficulties cannot be paralleled in any other part of Ireland. After nearly eight years of continuing disillusion here, I believe one has to live in the Border area to appreciate the depth of the reagedy that Deputy Leonard, Deputy Cotter and myself have witnessed over the last 20 years.  It is a shame that no Government, my own included, has accepted the fact that in the town of Dundalk there is 35 per cent unemployment, double the national average.  I have seen the flower of manhood emigrate to cities like London, Birmingham and Manchester.  While some people have murmured, people in high places in Government have gone through the formality of acknowledging what is happening but direct action has not been taken.</P>
    <P>I indict the Fianna Fáil Party for their failure to improve on the poor record of my Government in that respect.  Many <Col N="321" /> leading Fianna Fáil politicians went on trips to the North on PR exercises and were clearly aware of the scale of the problem but they have failed to act.  I acknowledge the effectiveness of the 48 hour rule although it did not help the Border area in so far as people coming on shopping expenditions from Kinsale were not coming specifically to Dundalk, Carrickmacross or Castleblayney.  However, it kept money in the Irish economy and secured the jobs of people in this State.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the reduction in VAT on TV sets and videos although I wonder if anybody buys a black and white set. However, the retailers who have survived the nightmare of seeing their businesses crumble as a result of Government policies must see a glimmer of hope, especially if there is a further reduction over the next two years.  The need to harmonise VAT rates and excise duties, North and South, must remain the number one priority for public representatives in the Border region.</P>
    <P>With the approach of 1992 it is disappointing to find so little preparedness or real progress being made in this regard.  I have been asking for the last seven years for the creation of an incentive zone in Dundalk, Ardee and Drogheda, three towns crippled by unemployment who see their young folk drained by the spectre of emigration which has decimated my town of thousands of young boys and girls in recent years.</P>
    <P>Something must be done to recognise the fact that there has been criminal neglect of my county and the neighbouring county of Monaghan.  The creation of an incentive zone which was introduced with great success by the British Government in the early seventies when there were indiscriminate car bombings in Belfast kept the businesses alive in that city.  It is now booming because of the number of people going across the Border and buying the undeniably attractive goods there.  However, it was the business incentive zone and the availability of low cost finance that kept shopkeepers alive as many of them did not <Col N="322" /> have customers for several months, indeed maybe years.</P>
    <P>The creation of an incentive zone would provide derating of commercial property and provide low cost loans to keep business afloat in these regions, and it is the moral duty of the Government to do this.</P>
    <P>There has been very little recognition of the problems in the Border area in the past 20 years despite the fact that in 1984 the European Economic Council identified the Border region as one of the poorest in Europe.  Despite the availability of immediate help the Government of the day refused to initiate real and meaningful help for those regions.</P>
    <P>I should also like to remind the Taoiseach that in 1983 the Border region was clearly identified as a region crying out for help.  The Taoiseach is now the European supremo and wields tremendous influence on the affairs of Europe.  Why does he continue to neglect his own people in the most depressed region of this island?</P>
    <P>In the coming year the Minister should address the question of double taxation in the Border area.  Many people live in the Border region and go across to work in the Six Counties because of lack of employment on this side of the Border. These people are being asked to pay double taxation and in many cases they are being pursued by the sheriff.  I am talking about ordinary, law-abiding people who pay their taxes at source in the country in which they work and are being asked to pay the same taxation here for the doubtful privilege of living in the State.  This is an absurdity, indeed it is immoral.  I have spoken privately to the Minister and made him aware of the situation and he should ensure that this crime is stopped as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In 1987 an announcement was made by the Government, with a fanfare of trumpets, that a Department would be decentralised to Dundalk.  Three years later there has been no movement in that direction.  I welcomed the announcement although I would have been happier if my Government had made it some years earlier.  Nevertheless, I am big enough to recognise progress irrespective of who <Col N="323" /> initiates it.  It was a ray of hope that we would have a Department employing 200 or 300 people who would live and spend their money in the town.  Departments have been located in Sligo and various other places but once again we in the Border area have been ignored.</P>
    <P>The question of health and the provision of £10 million could be termed a sick joke if it was not so serious.  While I believe that the recent `flu epidemic was hyped out of all proportion by the media for their own reasons, it is an outrage that poor elderly people cannot get a bed in which to die with dignity.  A sum of £100 million was shelled out to the GAA, to rugby and golf clubs and art &mdash; a minority interest &mdash; all of which are self-financing; £60 million of that money should have been spent in the health area ensuring a better service for the poor who cannot go to the Blackrock Clinic or the Mater Private Nursing Home.  Money of that magnitude should be made available to upgrade health facilities which have sadly fallen behind in recent years.  I know that the health area was abused and that we had the highest bed occupancy in Western Europe in recent years, but there is no doubt that there is extreme difficulty in finding a bed for aged people who are usually poor.  Deep concerns must be expressed about that area and the Minister for Health should address them in the coming years.</P>
    <P>I now turn to a subject about which I possibly know too much, racing.  Men go mad &mdash; and certainly go broke &mdash; following racing.  I unreservedly welcome the decision of the Minister, Deputy Reynolds, to make £3.5 million available to the racing and greyhound industries both of which are useful contributors to our export industry.  I must add that this money has not been given unconditionally. Every punter in the country, except a chosen few, mistrust Irish racing and not without cause.  The racing industry should be the subject of a national inquiry.  That mistrust is the reason attendances at race meetings all over Ireland are dwindling and why the man in the steet is gambling on English racing <Col N="324" /> in SP offices.  In some cases people are gambling on racing in Happy Valley in Hong Kong.  &ldquo;Fiddler on the Roof&rdquo; was the name of a top musical produced some years ago.  &ldquo;Fiddler on the hoof&rdquo; would be an apt description of the Irish racing scene today.</P>
    <P>The final indignity for punters was the incredible &ldquo;Redundant Pal&rdquo; story at Christmas.  On the Friday at Leopardstown an animal named &ldquo;Finian's Law&rdquo; was beaten three quarters of a length by &ldquo;Scally Owen&rdquo;, a reversal of 24 lengths on their previous running.  Twenty four hours later, &ldquo;Redundant Pal&rdquo;, a top class race horse, a stable mate of &ldquo;Scally Owen&rdquo; and a vastly superior horse to &ldquo;Scally Owen&rdquo;, was beaten at 1/5 by &ldquo;Finian's Law&rdquo;.  Three weeks later &ldquo;Redundant Pal&rdquo; won a £30,000 hurdle race with &ldquo;Finian's Law&rdquo; 42 lengths behind, almost two parishes away.  In that race &ldquo;Redundant Pal&rdquo; arrived at the last hurdle with a double handful and a jockey swinging out of him.  It was only a matter of what he would win by.  &ldquo;Finian's Law&rdquo;, the horse that beat him three weeks earlier was 42 lengths behind.  Is it any wonder that people are staying away in such numbers from Irish racing?</P>
    <P>Even if a punter had a hot line to heaven the Holy Ghost could not help him because he does not know what is happening in Irish racing.  Nobody knows except a chosen few.</P>

      <P>Possibly, but if I was as dapper as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and wore a flower perhaps I would get more information.  It is the lack of information that is my problem.  I am aware that an owner does not pay expensive training fees for the benefit of the public but the Racing Board, and the Turf Club, do not seem to work in accord with each other.  They must strike a balance if the image of Irish racing is to improve, indeed, if Irish racing is to survive.  That is my concern.  I wish to see Irish racing survive and improve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="325" /> It is my belief that much of the badly needed money that the Minister has provided should be given to National Hunt racing.  I should like to ask the Minister to do what he can to ensure that National Hunt racing, the Cinderella of racing which is overshadowed by the more glamorous flat racing, gets a big slice of the allocation.  They should be given that money to help them increase the minimum prize money to £2,000 for a maiden hurdle and to encourage the small breeders, the backbone of the game, to remain in racing.  It is my hope that no money will be provided to build private boxes in Leopardstown or the Curragh for the international jet set or for Miss Joan Collins on her one day visits here. Joe Bloggs and Paddy Murphy must be catered for.  They are the people who matter.  It is absence of such people from race meetings, and their presence in SP offices, that is causing some of the problems that Irish racing is experiencing.</P>
    <P>Courses must be helped and if that is not done many of them will not be in existence at the turn of the century, particularly country courses.  By increasing the National Hunt prize money we will be helping the Irish racing industry to continue what we do best &mdash; breed, produce and race the best racehorses in the world.  I regret that the Minister for Finance is not present for my contribution because he knows the racing scene.  I am aware that he is concerned about what is happening in racing.  I applaud his decision to make money available to the horse racing industry. However, I must express my grave concern about the cleanliness of Irish racing. One has only to read John Comyn in the <i>Irish Independent</i> to learn of the terrible irregularities that occur in Irish horse racing.  There has been a tremendous influx of English bookmaking concerns such as Ladbrooks, Hills and Coral to this country because the masses are to be found not at the race tracks but in SP offices.  Irish punters are happier to bet on English racing because they do not trust Irish racing.  I could be classified as one of those people.</P>
    <P>Another unhappy chapter in the saga <Col N="326" /> of irregularities in Irish racing took place at Leopardstown last Saturday when &ldquo;Scally Owen&rdquo; won a race by six lengths. In his previous run &mdash; I believe it was at Navan &mdash; he was beaten by a distance of 52 lengths.  That in racing parlance is equivalent to a distance from here to Edenderry.  The horse led from start to finish; he could have won by two furlongs pulling a train.  As a punter, and a redundant one after my experience last Saturday, I object to that.  It appears that the same people are involved.  There is a common denominator to all these appalling irregularities.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the decision to make public money available to help the Irish racing scene, the Turf Club and the Racing Board should get their act together and clean up Irish racing.  Otherwise, it will be like Luton Town football matches which are played behind locked gates with nobody in attendance.  The only people who will attend race meetings will be the Joe Rogues, the needy and the greedy.</P>

I have a deep concern and, unfortunately, a love for Irish horse racing which has cost me a lot of money over the years.  I am concerned about what has taken place.  I applaud the Minister for his generosity.  The help was badly needed because Irish racing is in a parlous state.  Many Irish courses are in danger of going under but the real need is to clean up the game so that more people can be encouraged to attend race meetings.</P>

      <P>After listening to that <Col N="327" /> excellent contribution by Deputy McGahon it is obvious that Irish racing has need to fear that it is about to lose one of its greatest supporters and stoutest defenders.  Irish racing had better get its act together if, as suggested by Deputy McGahon, it is to survive.  I agree that a number of incidents in recent times have given rise to doubt in the minds of the ordinary punter.  As a former punter I would not be encouraged to support the present set up.  Deputy McGahon and I are in agreement on that issue.</P>
      <P>The budget should not be considered by any Member, or anybody outside, in isolation.  Essentially, it is a continuation of the Government's work and a continuation of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> as further developed by the Programme for Government.  Therefore, it is a continuation of the excellent work of national reconstruction which was commenced in 1987 by the then Fianna Fáil Government.  The outstanding progress achieved in recent years can continue. We have made progress towards rebuilding a shattered economy.</P>
      <P>Progress has been achieved largely because the Fianna Fáil Government in 1987 recognised the seriousness of our problems.  They had the courage to provide the leadership and skill which dispirited people sought at the time. Unfortunately, that was lacking in the preceding years.  Considerable progress has been made in the last three years because of the consensus achieved between the social partners.  That consensus was based on a set of agreed policies and targets and was also based on a mutual understanding and respect among the partners.  The consensus was further supported and buttressed by the mechanism which was built into the agreed programme, and that is the operation of the central review committee.  That was an outstanding feature of the programme because it allowed for considerable discussion and debate where difficulties arose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Principal Features of the Budget are intended to promote more economic growth and inevitably this will lead to the <Col N="328" /> creation of jobs.  We are all agreed in this House that unemployment is at an unacceptably high level, in the order of 17.9 per cent at the end of 1989.  I identify particularly net job creation as the crunch issue for the nineties.  People who are unemployed want to work and have a right to work.  Therefore, we must not be sidetracked from the goal of achieving considerable new job creation and net job creation.  It is generally recognised that the economy fared very well in 1989. It is accepted that there was considerable improvement in the net number of new jobs created and this is accepted by the partners to the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> Therefore, I expect that there is a reasonable expectation that unemployment will continue to fall, based on the net creation of new jobs.  We will be looking to the coming years to see a continuing trend which has emerged in job creation in recent years.</P>
    <P>Taking all the relevant factors into account, net job creation, excluding the farming sector, was over 30,000 in the last few years.  Forecasters tell us also that in the year up to 1990 there is an expected net increase of jobs in the order of 30,000.  We can all accept this as an encouraging trend.  In the year up to 1991 we could be looking at net job creation in order of 17,500 jobs, based on some very positive features which are now present in the economy.</P>
    <P>The trend in rising employment needs the active support of employers particularly at this time.  This is a crucial issue and will have a major bearing on any future agreement between the social partners and the Government.  We have to be clear in our minds that the employers have a very crucial role to play in the area of job creation.  It is accepted by all of us that industry had a very difficult time during the eighties when employment fell by approximately 60,000.  We were faced with very substantial interest rates and inflation for a good part of the eighties was at an average of approximately 7 per cent.  We are aware also that the export markets already available to Irish industry proved very difficult to hold and the creation of <Col N="329" /> new markets was also difficult.  Industry was faced with considerable energy and communication costs.  Taking all these factors into account, industry found itself in a position where cutting back on staff numbers was the order of the day.  I have outlined the many reasons for this.  The change in the circumstances of the economy, the decreasing interest rates, the lowering of costs and the improvement of our competitiveness must give industry new heart.  Because of Government policy and, in some cases, external factors, industry will have to show that it is capable of meeting the challenges necessary to provide a considerable number of new jobs.  If industry fails at this time, major problems will arise in the next four to five years.</P>
    <P>Industry, having pared back to some extent on overloading in certain areas, in terms of staff and other costs, should now be in a position to gear itself to take advantage of an improving international situation and to take advantage of markets that are becoming available for the first time to a country such as ours.  The fact that we are a member of the EC gives us an immediate entree to over 300 million people.  The new relationships that are developing between the EC and Eastern Europe should undoubtedly lead to some additional advantages for our own industry in terms of product supply and the supply of skills and management. This is a crucial opportunity which is available to us and which we must be able to take up so that the improvement, particularly in exports, should lead to the creation of additional new jobs.  This is the only way in which new, sustainable jobs can be created.</P>
    <P>Industry has fared very well over the last few years in terms of Government policy.  It has benefited greatly from sound financial management and now it needs to show that it has the capacity to build on that good policy be creating sustainable jobs which are based on the export performance of the companies concerned or on the provision of products and services to displace imports &mdash;<Col N="330" /> in other words, import substitution, which is a major aspect of Government and IDA policy.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn to the area of tax collection which has been a bone of contention in this country for many years. Historically, tax collection had been a taboo subject with many people holding the attitude that somehow tax evasion was all right, it was acceptable if one could get away with it.  Indeed, in the old days it might be taken as something akin to a strike or a blow against the Empire. However, if it was to continue in that vein it would have had major repercussions for the finances of the State.  The taxation system at the time, including tax collection, was anything but progressive and it was not until the major tax marches of the eighties that we saw a focus of public attention on the whole area of tax collection and, indeed, of tax evasion.</P>
    <P>The publication of the reports by the Commission on Taxation geared the debate in earnest and brought home to all of us the need for a complete overhaul of our tax system which should lead to an opportunity to distribute the tax burden in a fairer way over all sectors.  In looking at the issue we could have faced it immediately, and completely disbanded the system as it then existed for tax collection, or adopted the gradualist approach rather than the immediate approach in overhauling the taxation system.  Successive Governments in the eighties showed the gradualist approach as being the best way to achieve what we all considered was essential, a complete reorganisation and overhauling of the tax system.</P>
    <P>During the eighties the public perception and understanding of the National Debt assisted the efforts made by successive Governments to overhaul our taxation system.  The national debt, which played a significant role in cooling the major expectation of people in the mid-eighties and later, made people realise that we were all citizens of the State, owners of the State's assets and responsible for the State's debts.  This realisation helped people to focus on the need to overhaul our taxation system and <Col N="331" /> ensure that everybody paid their fair share of tax, that evasion in future would not be tolerated or accepted and that there would be no sympathy for those charged and convicted of evasion.</P>
    <P>In recent years many factors have affected taxation policy and changes have brought about major improvements in the system.  The appointment of Revenue sheriffs was a major step in the right direction and the extensive use of technology by the Revenue Commissioners helped considerably to improve the level of tax collection.  The more aggressive approach adopted by the Revenue Commissioners towards tax collection helped to improve the system.  Of course, the tax amnesty, produced outstanding results and all of us should be aware that this was indicative of the amount and type of taxes which were being wrongfully held from the State.</P>
    <P>The recent introduction of self-assessment will help greatly in the improvement of tax collection.  This system puts the onus on taxpayers to make the appropriate returns.  It will also allow the scarce resources within the Revenue Commissioners to be diverted towards chasing up those who failed to pay their tax on time.  There is considerable room for optimism in so far as the payment of taxation is concerned.  As I have said the appointment of Revenue sheriffs was a very logical and long overdue step in giving the Revenue Commissioners an effective enforcement arm which they lacked in the past.  The improvement in the collection of taxes in recent years can be traced to the appointment of Revenue sheriffs, improved technology and the other factors to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>One area which still needs to be addressed in the collection of taxation is the ability of the Revenue Commissioners to bring tax defaulters before the courts quickly.  I believe the time has come to establish Revenue courts which would specialise in matters concerning taxation.  These courts could have trained personnel to deal with tax evasion matters and other cases concerning tax avoidance brought before the court by the <Col N="332" /> Revenue Commissioners.  This would speed up the making of decisions in regard to tax evasion and delays in the payment of tax and would be an indication to taxpayers who avoid their responsibility to pay tax that the system had been changed fundamentally.  The public would be made aware of what was going on and to a certain extent public pressure would be brought on those avoiding the payment of tax to keep their tax affairs in order.  The courts could also have trained personnel who would be skilled in examining accounts, determining difficulties about tax liability, deciding on penalties, interest on late payments, etc.  They should concentrate only on the issue of tax collection and the failure of individuals and organisations to pay their tax on time.</P>
    <P>The establishment of such a court would strengthen the hand of the Revenue Commissioners and ensure that those who are not meeting their responsibilities in the payment of their taxes on time would know that there would not be a delay of a year or more on the part of the Revenue Commissioners in bringing their case before the appropriate court. This would give an added impetus to those who are responsible for paying their taxes to get their affairs in order.  They would know that difficulties could accrue for them because of the operation of the Revenue courts.</P>
    <P>The Companies Bill which is currently being considered by a committee of this House will further strengthen the role of the Revenue Commissioners in the discharge of their functions.  Many sections of the Bill are devoted almost entirely to matters concerning taxation, tax avoidance and the ability of the directors of some companies who, once their company goes into liquidation, leaving large debts, including tax debts behind, set up again in the Phoenix company syndrome. I am glad we are facing up to this issue in our discussions on the Companies Bill.  Even though we still have a considerable number of amendments to discuss I hope we will be able to complete our deliberations on the Bill quickly so that it can come into effect as soon as <Col N="333" /> possible.  This Bill has a major role to play in regard to taxation.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress has been made by all concerned in the collection of outstanding taxes.  I hope this will continue so that the attitude which has prevailed for too long in this country &mdash; if you can avoid paying tax, fair enough, but do not get caught &mdash; can be dealt with once and for all.  I am confident we are on the road to changing this attitude.  As we have seen in the past number of years, our finances will be dramatically improved when the people who collect taxes on behalf of the State will be able to pay them over to the State at the appropriate time.  That is the only effective way in which we can keep the nation's finances properly balanced.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the social welfare aspects of the budget.  I welcome many of the provisions in the budget.  I will not refer to all of them but I want to refer in particular to what might be described as the smaller social welfare issues which had been raised for some time by many individuals and organisations but on which no substantial progress was being made.  I will refer first to the new clothing allowance.  This is a new allowance for school and winter clothing for families on social welfare.  When the Minister is working out the details of his scheme I hope specific guidelines will be laid down by 1 September next so that people who are entitled to these allowances will receive them and it will be clear to all concerned that they are entitled to such an allowance.  I hope the Minister will not allow individuals too much discretion and that a person will not have to go through the hoop arguing that their case is more pressing than someone else's.  This is a welcome innovation and I hope it will be in place by September next as this is a time when parents find it difficult to get by financially.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a carer's allowance marks a great step forward and will help to reduce the number of incapacitated elderly people who have to be institutionalised. As anyone involved in the health service or health board would <Col N="334" /> know, the vast majority of elderly people wish to remain in their own communities among people they know.  It is very sad that elderly people have to be plucked out of their own communities for a variety of reasons and placed in institutions where they have to begin the process of making friends all over again, which is not an easy thing to do at their time of life.  Any attempt on the part of the Minister to address this problem would be welcomed by all of us.  It may well be that this allowance will have to be looked at again in the light of the number in receipt of it and the cost involved, but a very good start has been made.  For that reason we will be watching the implementation of this allowance in the year ahead very carefully to see if it is proving beneficial for those to whom I have referred.</P>
    <P>I now wish to refer briefly to the family income supplement scheme.  It is a great disappointment that this scheme is not being taken up by all entitled to avail of it.  To some extent the reason for this is the amount of bureaucracy involved.  I appeal to the Minister to take another look at this scheme to see if we can get around this problem.  In certain health board areas some people who have availed of this allowance have ended up losing their entitlement to a medical card and there appears to be a divergence of opinion on this matter.  I understand that the Minister has made a decision that those who avail of this allowance will not be disqualified from receiving a medical card.  I ask him to implement this decision as soon as possible so that all the health boards will act in uniformity.</P>
    <P>Some criticism has been made of the increase in child benefit.  If we look at it in terms of the specific increase given we can understand this argument.  However, I understand no increase was given last year and, if I recall correctly, the Minister was not subjected to any criticism because of this.  This is a 5 per cent increase which will take effect from October, and which I hope will be above the rate of inflation which is expected to be around 3 per cent or 3.2 per cent this year.  This should be taken as an indication that the child benefit is not <Col N="335" /> going to be abolished.  I welcome this. We will need to continuously review this benefit to see if further increases are necessary.  The increase in respect of a fifth child, £1, is also to be welcomed. Obviously, the more resources that are made available the greater the increases for all concerned.</P>
    <P>There are a few other points I would like to make.  First, I would like to refer to local authority housing.  Unfortunately the housing lists are beginning to lengthen once again and because of this the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, and the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, will have to address themselves to this issue.  This is a cause of concern for Members of this House, members of local authorities and those who find themselves on a waiting list.</P>
    <P>I am not so sure that the right direction to take would be to begin building large local authority housing estates once more, as happened in the past.  It may well be that the Minister for the Environment will have to look at new ways of providing local authority housing.</P>
    <P>Perhaps there could be a coming together of the public and private sectors to provide housing.  Possibly, this is one way by which this need could be met.  I do not believe there is any great demand in Dublin, the area in which I am most familiar, to build huge housing estates as happened in the past.  I would much prefer to see the Department of the Environment introduce a scheme which would allow the acquisition of houses by local authorities for allocation to those on waiting lists.  Such a scheme could also allow tenants to apply for part ownership of the house with the option of applying some years down the road for full ownership.</P>
    <P>The argument has always been advanced by local authority officials that it is very difficult to maintain individual houses in estates not exclusively owned by the local authority.  One could accept this argument if the local authority own only one or two houses in a particular estate when the costs could be substantial. I suggest that the way to deal <Col N="336" /> with this problem when allocating houses is to give the tenant the responsibility for maintenance as part of the arrangement which would ultimately allow that tenant to become the owner of the property, at preferred terms, at some stage in the future.  I would like the Minister to address this matter as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I had no difficulty at all about Deputy Flood's intrusion into Opposition time because his remarks in relation to local authority housing were very pertinent.  I would like to think that Deputy Flood might succeed in getting through to the Minister for the Environment and the Cabinet because it would appear that they are not listening to <Col N="337" /> anybody else.  They are certainly not listening to people from the Opposition benches.</P>
      <P>The fact is that there are about 30,000 people on local authority housing lists and there will be a very serious crisis in terms of local authority houses.  Therefore, I welcome Deputy Flood's intrusion into Opposition time because he was stating what a member of the Opposition would be saying.</P>
      <P>Some time back, when the present Government was formed, when the Coalition arrangement was hammered out, I made some remarks in this House, wishing the Government well in the task they were facing.  I even tried to assist and give some guidance by identifying some of the tasks.  At that time I said:</P>
      <P>Over the next months and years, two main question will pre-occupy the political system of our country.  At least, these two questions ought to be among the principal issues that we face and deal with.  It may well be that these issues will be ignored, and that they will be settled by default.  It may well be that the politicians we have elected to Government will simply turn a blind eye to them, and allow them to be decided by faceless, anonymous people.  If that were to happen, the result would be disastrous, as it has been disastrous in other countries where these issues have arisen.</P>
      <P>The questions are these: first, how are the fruits of economic growth to be distributed?  And second, who is going to wield the power and influence of ownership in Ireland in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are huge and difficult questions. They may not seem at first glance to be the most obvious ones that arise on a day like this.  But if recent political experience has shown us anything, it has shown us that issues like these must be pushed to the centre of the political stage.  Too much of our recent experience has been tied up with defending people against the callous and unthinking consequences of an ill-considered approach to policy.  Too much of our recent experience has been tied up with unscrambling the consequences of <Col N="338" /> secret deals and political cronyism.  We cannot, as a community, allow the style and substance of this kind of Government to continue.</P>
    <P>We have now had an opportunity to assess the style and substance that I referred to in that speech, and I have to say that the result of my assessment, at any rate, is that this Government are failing abjectly to address these two fundamental issues.  I want to address both of these issues in turn.  Because of the importance of the issue of accountability in Government, I want to deal with it first.</P>
    <P>The last Fianna Fáil régime was one which specialised in secret deals.  Many of the details of the agreements they made will, I suspect, take years to unravel.  I have already on a previous occasion, for instance, referred to some of the highly dubious and unpublicised elements of the agreement made between the Government and a single individual for the development of the beef processing industry.  That agreement was subsequently clouded even further by the very deep reservations held in many parts of this House about the granting of export credit insurance to the same individual in circumstances where, to put it at its mildest, objective consideration of risk would have led to different decisions.</P>
    <P>What is disturbing is that there is already a great deal of evidence that this Government are set on a similar course. Perhaps the first example of this relates to the scandalous treatment of the Office of the Ombudsman just before Christmas.  Evidence now available to me suggests very strongly that the Minister for Finance knew for several months before Christmas that the term of office of the Ombudsman was due to expire at the end of the year, and that he refrained from telling the majority of his Cabinet colleagues about it.  If that is the case, it must be equally true that the Minister, despite all his protestations in this House, was involved effectively in an unworthy conspiracy to remove the Ombudsman from office, presumably for the purpose <Col N="339" /> of replacing him with someone more congenial.</P>
    <P>But that is only one example of the style of this Government.  There are many others which deserve to be outlined. The assurances given to Deputy Jackie Fahey and the overt deal offered to Deputy Tom Foxe are other examples of a style which is less concerned with parliamentary democracy, and more concerned with the back room, stroking politics of old which have done so much damage to this country.</P>
    <P>In the middle of a major health crisis, which has caused untold suffering and hardship to thousands of Irish citizens, it is not acceptable that the subject should be dealt with as if the only issue were possible embarrassment for the Government. Wheeling and dealing on issues involving the basic rights of our citizens, and the major policy choices that must be made by Government, is a shabby form of politics.</P>
    <P>I have seen detailed proposals, made essentially by the Nigerian Government, to the Irish Government.  These proposals involve an agreement by the Nigerian Government to supply oil at favourable prices to Ireland.  This oil would be stored in Whiddy, refined at Whitegate, and distributed throughout the country as finished product.  Both Whiddy and Whitegate would be considerably upgraded.  There would, of course, be a price to pay, and a considerable investment to be made, both by the Irish Government and by the Nigerian Government on a joint venture basis.</P>
    <P>On the face of it, I would have to say that this is a proposal that deserves the most serious considerations.  It might be that after careful examination we might decide as a country that the price was too high, the risks too great, or that it failed to meet some strategic consideration. But it deserves to be studied and debated.  The public deserves to be involved.  Instead, my understanding is that for all sorts of reasons, to do with personalities, power plays, and bureaucratic inertia, the idea is simply being sat <Col N="340" /> upon, with nobody willing to expose it to the light of day, and to examine where the public interest in this matter might lie.  What kind of a way is that to run an accountable Government?</P>
    <P>Exactly the same argument applies to the issue of privatisation, which is now being intensively discussed behind a large number of closed doors.  It is impossible to make decisions about privatisation without deeply affecting the national interest &mdash; and yet a great many of these decisions are going to be made without the slightest involvement by the public at large.</P>
    <P>There are a number of issues involved in the privatisation debate.  I must say that it often seems to me that the public good is the last issue that gets discussed on the agenda.  But these issues must be addressed, before any rational decisions can be made on this subject &mdash; and certainly before the public can be assured that their interest is being served by a privatisation programme.</P>
    <P>To listen to many of the commentators on this subject, one would almost believe that there was no point in raising one's voice about this subject.  A culture has been growing, in the financial press and in the pubs frequented by the business gurus, to the effect that privatisation is the only sensible way to approach the issue of the development of State companies. All right &mdash; thinking people, they proclaim, will readily agree that it is nonsense for the State to be holding on to valuable assets when they could be offset against the national debt, or when they could be sold in order to reduce taxation.</P>
    <P>What these so called independent experts never talk about is the large fees to be got from advising and consulting the State about these matters.  Ever since the good people in NCB were paid more than half a million pounds to advise the Government to sell Tara Mines to Outokumpo, the fashion for consulting about privatisation has grown.  There are huge question marks about why that fee was paid in the first place, expecially when anyone with eyes to see could have told the Government that once the decision to sell has been made, there was only <Col N="341" /> one company that made any sense as a customer.  This was well known in the industry for the last ten years.</P>
    <P>But since then, there have been consultancy reports on State companies generally, on Irish Life, on the Irish Sugar Company, on the Great Southern Hotels, and on Irish Steel &mdash; that we know of. First, no consultant worth his salt nowadays will say something his paymasters do not want to hear.  Secondly, all these reports were prepared on the basis of anti-public sector bias.  In the case of Irish Life, for instance, I understand that four options have been recommended, but each is a different method of privatisation. I believe no serious examination was given to the possibility of developing Irish Life into a stronger player on the European Insurance scene as a native-owned Irish public company.</P>
    <P>When are these reports going to be published?  When are the policy holders in Irish Life going to be consulted about their future?  When will the workers in Irish Steel, the farmers who supply the Irish Sugar Company be consulted about their future?  When will the tourist industry generally be consulted about the Great Southern Hotels?  When will the people as a whole be consulted?</P>
    <P>If a consultant prepared a report for, say, Michael Smurfit and told him the only sensible way to deal with his overdraft was to sell off most of his profitable business, I doubt if he would be working again for the said gentleman, but that is what we are being told.  When I say &ldquo;we&rdquo;, I mean the Irish people, and we are not even being given an opportunity to express our views about these consultants and their conventional wisdom.</P>
    <P>The argument is being bolstered by some public company managers who feel constrained by the influence of Government Departments and who long, it would appear, for the excitement of the private sector.  I have some sympathy for them in this dilemma, and would argue strongly that when public sector control becomes public sector interference they have a case, but the way to deal with this is hardly to swap the control of a Government Department for the control <Col N="342" /> of a German multinational.  If our public sector managers believe they are going to be better off in the private sector, many of them are going to have a rude awakening.  Over and above that, it was the spirit of public service in our public companies that was one of the main-strings of our national economic development from the thirties through to the sixties.  I do not believe we can allow that to be frittered away in dreams of private sector glory.</P>
    <P>On the subject of national development, there is another side to this argument. How can our national interest be served by selling our insurance companies to the French, our steel industry to the Germans, the flagships of our tourist industry to the English, our sugar industry to the Americans, or our aviation company possibly to the Arabs?  Surely the future economic prosperity of this country depends on the development of strong, native owned industries.  How can we be so blind as to be willing to sell to the highest bidder, without any regard for the future?</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, there are a great many issues involved in this whole debate, but these subjects are being swept under the carpet, and the debate is being conducted only among the vested interests and the decisions are being made in secret.</P>
    <P>I fully endorse the call by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions for a White Paper on this subject, which will set out all the arguments, and not just the self-serving ones.  I would go further, and assert here that if any of these State companies are sold off without the people being consulted, then the Government who do that have lost all sight of the need for accountability.  Irish State companies are the property of the people of Ireland &mdash; our past and our future is bound up with those companies, and we are entitled to say in what happens to them. They are not the property of any Minister, any consultant or any entrepreneur &mdash; they are ours, and we are entitled to demand to know what is going on before any final decisions are made.</P>
    <P>I now wish to turn to the other theme I mentioned at the start of these remarks <Col N="343" />&mdash; the importance of policy directed at fair and equitable distribution of the fruits of growth.</P>
    <P>There is every possibility now that we are facing into a period of sustained economic growth.  The recent medium-term review published by the Economic and Social Research Institute heralded the possibility that within a few short years we will be making capital repayments on our debt, rather than simply servicing the interest.</P>
    <P>According to the ESRI, our economy could grow on average by 5 per cent a year for each of the next five years.  By 1991, on the basis of present revenue and spending policies, we will be taking in more in taxation then we spend, for the first time since the early seventies.  This appears to create a rosy picture &mdash; some would say that it is much too optimistic and is not unusual for the ESRI to have to change their predictions &mdash; but even if we allow for a degree of optimism, the likelihood is, as I have said, that our economy will grow.  The question that poses is &mdash; who will benefit from that growth?  The authors of the ESRI review pose the question well.  They say: &ldquo;The policy dilemma will be the reconciliation of the need for economic efficiency and the desirability of social equity.&rdquo;  The Labour Party in the past have attempted to pose the same question over and over again.  We have insisted at all times that the management of our economy must go be efficient and tough, but it must go hand in hand with a deep, underlying commitment to the principles of social justice.</P>
    <P>We have had economic growth in the past two and a half years.  We have had more efficiency in the public service and throughout the economy.  Nobody can deny that, but it has been built on the backs of 100,000 emigrants and a quarter of a million unemployed people.  It has been built on the backs of one million poor.  It has been built at the cost of increasing inequality and disadvantage at every level of our society.</P>
    <P>Side by side with the increasing <Col N="344" /> efficiency of our economy, we have witnessed, in the past two and a half years, an increasing polarisation in our society. It is manifest in our two tier health service, just as it is manifest in the virtual collapse in our public housing, the gradual elimination of free education, and the dismantling of social welfare schemes.  A more efficient economy, coupled with a more unjust and a less equal society is what we have begun to create in our country in the short lifetime of the last Dáil.</P>
    <P>Sad to say, there is little evidence in anything we have seen so far that the issue of equality and justice will feature on this new Government's agenda.  From what we have seen of the programme for Government, it is not a programme for government at all but a recipe for ensuring that the spoils of office are grabbed and held on to.</P>
    <P>From the recent &ldquo;Kanturk Declaration&rdquo; of the Minister for Finance we can deduce that what is uppermost in his mind is the need to assure the party faithful that he at least has not lost sight of Fianna Fáil's &ldquo;core values&rdquo;.  Not for him the weight issue of how economic growth should be fairly managed.  Not for him the task of ensuring that those who are now marginalised in our society will be entitled to participate fully in the future.  His primary concern &mdash; indeed, his only concern &mdash; is the task of positioning himself to succeed his present leader by sniping in private at his Government partners.  For as long as this power struggle bubbles under the surface of the Fianna Fáil Party, I see no prospect that their senior members are likely to deal, or are even capable of dealing with the major issues that ought to be their principal preoccupation.  In short, I have seen or heard nothing that persuades me that this Government are even aware of the fundamental importance of wisely managed and fairly distributed economic growth.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach himself is on record as saying that the major issue facing us in the context of growth is the question of how to ensure that that growth is translated into jobs here in Ireland, but what is he doing about it?  What review of <Col N="345" /> industrial policy has been initiated since he took office?  The only views we have heard on the subject from the Taoiseach appear to rely totally on renewal of the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> without spelling out the new and different elements that will make that programme meaningful to those who are unemployed. The only views that we have heard so far from the relevant Minister, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, appear to consist of suggestions that the buses should be privatised.</P>
    <P>The experience of the Irish economy since Independence has been the failure of job creation in Ireland.  That has been the central fact of Irish economic and social development.  Associated with this, apart from certain brief periods, we have had comparatively high levels of unemployment and unique levels of forced emigration by European standards.  For the last two years Labour have been undertaking a fundamental reassessment of the type of policies necessary to confront fully this legacy of failure by our society.  We see it as our task to place back on the agenda the goal of full employment as the fundamental objective of Government.  This needs to be demonstrated and expressed as a moral as well as a political commitment. Growth, competitiveness and job creation can and must be pursued in the context of Labour's vision of a humane, just and democratic economy.</P>
    <P>One of the most critical factors in ensuring long-term economic growth and employment is this: no small country has achieved self-sustaining industrial growth and expansion in employment based mainly on multinational investment from abroad.  A strong domestic industrial base is of central importance.  The objective must be to retain value added in Ireland. This is not being achieved by the current strategy &mdash; all that the current strategy has achieved is that a high proportion of value added by overseas industry is repatriated as profits &mdash; nearly £2 billion in 1988.  That is dead money &mdash; money which is being generated here, and is going to create jobs and wealth elsewhere.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="346" /> The key to creating wealth and jobs here is retaining value added in the economy. To retain value added in the economy we have proposed: public ownership, part or whole, in the traded sector; public intervention by targeting grants and incentives to overcome the issue of firm size and tax reform through radical changes in the income, company and wealth tax codes with far larger revenues from the company sector.</P>
    <P>This approach is not in conflict with any obligations arising from the Single European Act, and is applicable to both manufacturing and internationally traded services.  We recognise that strategic investment abroad by Irish firms will often be an essential part of the overall development.</P>
    <P>One of our key proposals to build up native industry is to get the IDA to focus entirely on inward investment from abroad, and fundamentally to reorganise the National Development Corporation as the major leader in the development of Irish industry.  We cannot hope to win the battle for retaining value added in Ireland and increasing jobs if we sell our proven winners to foreigners.</P>
    <P>Another key proposal is that public sector commercial enterprises must be given independence to make commercial decisions and be compensated by the Government where they are required to retain non-viable enterprises for social or national reasons.  The reward package for top managers in the enterprises must be market-related and the link with public service pay and control by the Department of Finance must be broken.  The National Development Corporation must be allowed powers to raise up to £500 million of commercial capital for selective investment in expanding indigenous industry, with the transfer of the IDA grant budget for indigenous industry to it.</P>
    <P>In addition, Labour want every public and private sector worker to have both an individual and collective financial stake both in his place of work and in the creation of new resources of wealth in the economy.</P>
    <P>We have already published detailed <Col N="347" /> plans for the establishment of employees investment funds.  These plans include: tax relief in the form of a deduction from taxable income of 125 per cent saved and contributed to a fund each year; a key promotional role for the trade unions and the funds to be used for expansion of existing public or private companies.</P>
    <P>There are a number of reasons why the extent of poverty in Ireland is so great, and has grown larger in the past few years; high unemployment; low pay; an increasing number of people in part-time or casual work; inadequate social support, charges for essential services like health care; cutbacks in education, and so on.  Perhaps the largest single cause is unemployment, and we have already outlined a number of proposals in regard to that.</P>
    <P>In many other areas that have been mentioned, direct Government action is not only essential, but possible in the short term.  Under the social charter that was signed recently, for instance, our Government have accepted a moral obligation to ensure that part-time workers are no longer exploited.  That will require legislation, covering such things as pay, sick leave entitlements, protection against unfair dismissal, and so on.</P>
    <P>There is also an obligation on the Government now to examine the whole issue of low pay, and to legislate for a minimum wage if necessary.  There has been a great deal of publicity lately about the so-called &ldquo;poverty trap&rdquo;, which results in some people on social welfare being better off than some people at work.  The right-wing politicians and commentators always seem to draw the conclusion that the reason for this is that social welfare levels are too high. The truth is that in too many cases wage levels are too low.  But it is in the context of the budgetary process that the Government can do most to begin an attack on poverty in the short-term.</P>
    <P>Last year, for instance, the 1989 budget aimed to remove 24,000 low-paid employees from the tax net.  But according to the Combat Poverty Agency and other reputable sources, there are still <Col N="348" /> families paying tax whose incomes are less than 60 per cent of the average industrial wage &mdash; in other words, very poor families.  In most cases, the £10 or more that they pay in income tax is the reason they fall below the poverty line.</P>
    <P>To take another example, it has been estimated that the cost of feeding, clothing, and caring for a child varies from £19.60 a week for children under four to £28.20 a week for children over four. Almost 350,000 children in Ireland are being maintained by social welfare payments &mdash; and the basic child dependant rate was £10 a week until the budget. Is it any wonder that too many of our children are under-nourished?  Child benefit, which is intended to supplement these rates and to be an income for mothers, has been frozen ever since Fianna Fáil returned to office &mdash; or to put it another way, it has been cut in real terms by about 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>The 1989 budget contained a welcome innovation inasmuch as it introduced an addition of £200 per child to the exemption limits that applied to low-paid workers.  In our pre-budget submission, we estimated that it would cost about £20 million in 1990 to increase that allowance for each child to £600, and the net result would be to remove perhaps 50,000 low-income families from the tax net altogether. In addition, it would cost about £60 million to increase child benefit by 25 per cent, and to pay an extra mother's benefit in September, a time when many families suffer the hardship of enormous additional child-related expenditure.</P>
    <P>These are not solutions to poverty &mdash; that cannot be achieved by one or two isolated steps, but only by a concentrated and integrated programme of activity, which may take several years, and which must be based on the twin principles I mentioned earlier &mdash; economic efficiency coupled with social justice.  But they would help many families who are suffering now to share in the benefits of the very considerable improvements in our financial situation that the last few years of hardship have brought about.</P>
    <P>What was the Government's response <Col N="349" /> in the budget?  They raised child dependency rates by about £1, increased the children's allowance by 19 pence a week, and through various other measures exempted about 30,000 people from the tax net.  Just as in 1989, the vast bulk of the relief granted in budget, instead of representing even the beginning of an assault on poverty, will instead go to benefit the better-off sections of our community.</P>
    <P>When the budget was published, we issued the following statement:</P>
    <P>Many of the individual items in Budget 1990 are welcome, but in overall terms it is a Budget that tinkers with our many social problems, rather than addressing them in any fundamental way.  There is nothing in the Budget that seriously attempts to address the unemployment and emigration concerns that affect us, and not nearly enough to address the growing crisis in health.</P>
    <P>The money allocated for mental handicap will do no more than begin to reverse the cutbacks implemented by this Government.  And the crisis in our health services generally has been totally ignored.  There is nothing here to shorten waiting lists, to reopen the acute beds that are urgently needed, or to employ the doctors and nurses.</P>
    <P>On income tax, it is surely typical of a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats coalition that it would offer more to the highest paid taxpayers in our country than to the lowest paid.  The combination of measures outlined today will ensure a disproportionate benefit to those on the highest incomes.  Many of the measures applicable to low pay will have effects that are more cosmetic than real &mdash; The PRSI exemption package, for instance, is clearly designed to benefit only casual workers, and even then, they will not secure that benefit every week.</P>
    <P>Child Benefit is increased for the first time since 1986.  It continues to lag well behind inflation, and in general, the provisions in this Budget for children show that the Government has not <Col N="350" /> studied the evidence available that shows that the cost of nuturing children is almost twice what the Government is providing.  In this context, an increase of nineteen pence a week in Child Benefit can only be described as a cynical gesture &mdash; especially when set beside the continuing favourable treatment for companies and profits.</P>
    <P>The real value of tax reductions has to be measures against increases of £70 a month in typical mortgage repayments, increases in local authority rents, increases in telephone and ESB bills, and increases in the cost of genuine life insurance policies.  Few people, apart from the very well paid, will see significant improvements in their living standards when all these factors are taken into account.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in this Budget to deal with the growing housing crisis, nothing to alleviate overcrowding in our classrooms.</P>
    <P>This was a sticking plaster Budget, not a reforming one.  Sharing the fruits of growth demands more fundamental reform than the Government has attempted.</P>
    <P>I see no reason to change that judgement now.  The reality is that our economy needs fundamental reform, in order to bring justice and equity to our society. The task of reform holds no interest for the parties now in Coalition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport (Mr. Lyons)</NameTxt>
      <P>Is mór an t-áthas dom gur tugadh seans dom cuidiú leis an díospóireacht ar an gcáinaisnéis seo thar a bheith tábhachtach a thug an tAire Airgeadais dúinn ar 31 Eanáir 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This budget continues the constructive and realistic policies of the past three years which have proved to be successful. History will record that these were the years when we reversed the downward spiral in economic activity and achieved a level of growth which surprised even the most optimistic forecasters.  This note of confidence should not be mistaken for smugness or complacency.  We in <Col N="351" /> Government are well aware of the pitfalls and we will heed the economic commentators in their warning of a need for a continuing cautious approach.  The message that must go forth from this debate is that we must continue with our present economic strategy which has been clearly demonstrated as being the correct one.  The strategy adopted by and the performance of the Government over the past three years has convinced the financial markets and the many investors both at home and abroad that we in Ireland can tackle the fundamental problems of our economy.  This in turn has underpinned business confidence as it implies greater certainty in regard to future movements in prices and in costs.</P>
    <P>The Government have laid great stress on the need to achieve growth in the tourism sector.  In this context, quite ambitious targets have been set by us for the industry.  This budget demonstrates a continuation of the firm commitment of the Government to the development of Irish tourism.  By any standards, the sustained growth in Irish tourism since 1987 represents a remarkable recovery.  Up to then the eighties had seen little or no growth in overall visitor numbers but thankfully this situation has been turned around and the industry is now beginning to realise its undoubted potential as a generator of significant fund revenue and a provider of viable employment.</P>
    <P>While official figures are not yet to hand for 1989, Bord Fáilte estimate that visitor numbers will be around 2.8 million, an increase of 15 per cent on 1988 and, more significantly, an increase of almost 50 per cent on the 1986 performance. This 50 per cent increase in tourism traffic and the broadly similar increase in foreign tourism revenue is estimated to have created over 18,000 new jobs in the economy since the beginning of 1987.  The growth in tourism is a vivid testimony to the success of the tourism development strategy adopted by the Government since 1987.  It is a strategy that will be continued and with increasing vigour, this year and in the years ahead.  We know the true potential <Col N="352" /> of Irish tourism and that with the right strategy, the industry can deliver the goods.</P>
    <P>At the heart of the Government's strategy for tourism development is a signficant increase in capital investment in the tourism product.  Over the past few years we have seen a significant rise in private sector investment, largely stimulated by increased tourism activity and with the help of Government incentives, not least the business expansion scheme which we made available to tourism when it was only previously available to manufacturing industry.  This increased level of investment, on the one hand, represents firm evidence of the confident light in which the future of Irish tourism is viewed; however, on the other hand, it highlights the accepted need for increased investment in developing the range and quality of our tourism facilities and amenities to meet the growing demand and the changing requirements in the international market.  It was for this latter reason that Irish tourism was chosen by Government for priority development in the Government's <i>National Development Plan 1989-1993.</i> Investment over the next four years will radically change the face of Irish tourism. It will ensure that we have a world class saleable product which will generate a significant increase in tourist traffic and create an additional 25,000 new jobs, the jobs target we in Government have set for the industry.</P>
    <P>On a specific tourism matter, I am very pleased that the Government decided to provide financial assistance to Swansea Cork Ferris Limited for the provision of a service between Cork and Swansea in 1990.  The financial assistance, in case it is not known already by everybody, consists of a grant of £500,000 together with a loan of £500,000.  Arrangements are well in hand for the commencement of the service on 9 May and it will operate until the end of September 1990.  I am confident, and I have always been so, that the service will be of significant benefit to tourism interests, and the economy generally in the south-west region.  In that regard, I am glad to record the enhusiasm <Col N="353" /> and welcome it has received both at home and in the UK.</P>
    <P>If I had more time available to me I would expand on that but I would just indicate that when I was at a tourism workshop in London recently and visited the UK tourist office in Lower Regent Street I was pleasantly surprised by the welcome attitude of British Rail to the news that the ferry was back.  Another indication is that when the office opened in Cork this week people were waiting before the staff arrived at 9 a.m. and in the first 15 minutes of opening there were five firm bookings.  Since then the enthusiasm has been reflected in the continuing phone calls and calls to the office.</P>
    <P>As regards the longer term, the Government support the maintenance and indeed the expansion of our ferry services in the interests of tourism and trade.  I must stress however that it is Government policy that access transport services should operate on a commercial basis.  In those circumstances, Cork Swansea Ferries Limited have been informed that the Government have decided that no further Exchequer assistance will be available to the company from 1990 onwards.  I am a lot more confident than some of my cynical political colleagues from that area that the ferry will be commercially viable.</P>
    <P>It is now up to the operators of the service and to the people of the Cork-Kerry region to prove that a commercially self-sustaining service can be operated in future years.  I would appeal to my cynical collegues in that area to lend a hand also to the success of the ferry.  It will continue to have my full support and commitment. I would ask a constituency colleague, Deputy Allen, to be gracious enough to withdraw the personal attack he levelled at me, as reported in the local <i>Evening Echo</i> on 18 January 1990.  He should acknowledge that he was wrong in the case of the ferry, as he has been in many of his negative utterances about Cork.  At the same time, he might indicate either here in the Dáil or outside it what he has done for Cork at any time in his public life, including the time when he was Lord Mayor of Cork.  I am a firm believer in <Col N="354" /> the old adage that talk is very cheap and easily available but that actions speak louder than words.  Deputy Allen must be very disappointed &mdash; and he is not alone in that politically in Cork &mdash; that the ferry is back.  They would much prefer if it was not back for narrow political gamesmanship.  To quote another heading from my very respected local paper &ldquo;It is ferry blossom time in Cork&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In relation to tourism development at EC level, on assuming the Presidency of the Council of Tourism Ministers, the Minister and I set our sights on raising the profile of tourism in the Community's programme of activities.  The lack of progress to date in the development of Community tourism policy has been disappointing, particularly having regard to the single market objectives.</P>
    <P>In order to give impetus to the development of an EC tourism policy during the Irish Presidency, the Minister, Deputy Brennan announced at the inauguration of European Year of Tourism in Dublin Castle that we were bringing forward to next month an informal Council of Tourism Ministers which had originally been called for April.  This informal meeting will be followed by a formal Council of Tourism Ministers in June.</P>
    <P>We will be using these two meetings to concentrate on four specific themes which require urgent development at Community level.  These are: the development of an EC Tourism Research Programme; a speeding up of the time scale of the harmonisation of tourism statistics in the Community; a detailed assessment of the impact the single market will have on the tourism sector and the maximisation of the return on EC financial support for the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>We are determined to use our term of office as President of the Council of Ministers to achieve concrete results in these four crucial areas.  This will create a revitalised tourism agenda at Community level, one that will be positioned to carry the industry safely into the twenty-first century.</P>
    <P>A prerequisite to realising our tourism ambitions is the availability of an effective access transport system.  Through our <Col N="355" /> policies we have created a climate in which the efficient transport operator can prosper in a liberal environment.  All elements of the transport sector are experiencing an upturn in fortunes and are assisting the tourism cause through the services they are providing.</P>
    <P>The provision of services represents only half of the picture, however.  We must also ensure that the airports and the air traffic control facilities and navigational equipment at the airports are able to cope with the expansion in services and traffic.  With this in mind, ambitious investment proposals for the State airports, involving expenditure of over £100 million in the period up to 1993, are planned under the National Development Plan.</P>
    <P>I am glad that a significant proportion of this investment will be concentrated at Cork Airport where a major extension of the existing passenger terminal is planned to commence this year.  The extended terminal together with the recent extension of the runway and improved navigational facilities, will ensure the availability of first-class passenger facilities at Cork to cater for the rapidly growing passenger throughput at the airport. I take pride in reporting to the House that in 1989 passenger throughput at Cork Airport reached 600,000 which is almost double the figure recorded in 1985.</P>
    <P>More generally, I am satisfied that the planned development of Cork Airport, which I have set as one of my fundamental objectives in office, will play a major role in stimulating the economic, industrial and tourism development of Cork and the south-west region generally.</P>
    <P>With regard to air traffic control and air navigation facilities, the Air Navigation Services Office of the Department are currently engaged in a major equipment renewal programme at the State airports involving total expenditure of £30 million. The main elements of the programme are: new radar systems at Dublin, Cork and Shannon Airports including a secondary surveillance radar at Dublin Airport which has already been <Col N="356" /> installed; complete replacement of the main VHF communications systems at Dublin, Cork and Shannon Airports which will be completed over the next few months; replacement of most of the existing navigational aids at Dublin and Cork Airports including the installation of additional instrument landing systems; this project is also nearing completion; and installation of instrumented runway visual range systems at Cork and Shannon which are currently being evaluated.</P>
    <P>The re-equipment programme will be completed by 1992 and within budget.  I am satisfied that the new air traffic control facilities coupled with the recruitment of additional staff will substantially expand the capacity of the Irish air traffic control system and further enhance the safety of aircraft operations within Irish controlled airspace.</P>
    <P>A lot has been said and written in the recent past about Ireland's peripheral location.  As an island trading national we have a serious problem due to our geographic location on the edge of Europe. That does not mean that there are no measures we can take to offset the disadvantages of peripherality.</P>
    <P>The Government have been very active in negotiating increases in EC funds which will also be used to help fund major investment programmes in the areas of roads, port and airports.  Subject to the results of a feasibility study, which is being carried out in conjunction with the EC, investments in sea and air freight shuttle services may be considered. Investments made will not bring us physically nearer to Europe but we will be closer to our key export markets in terms of the key parameters of competitiveness, namely the quality, frequency and cost-competitiveness of our access transport service.</P>
    <P>On the domestic front, it is essential that the transport sector operates as efficiently as possible.  All transport services whether road or rail, public or private are and should be judged on the quality of the services provided and the costs to the user.  If transport services are not cost-effective and efficient they will <Col N="357" /> constrain the future growth in the economy. The Irish transport industry has become more competitive in recent years but there is still room for improvement, particularly if the economy is to harness to the maximum, the potential benefits of the Single European Market.  The need for greater competitiveness has led to the revision of the road passenger transport legislation which is in progress.  At the same time I must assure the House that the Minister, Deputy Brennan, and I will not lose sight of the need to continue to provide socially desirable, but in some cases unprofitable services.</P>
    <P>In air transport, the second phase of EC liberalisation, which will mark a further advance towards achieving a single air transport market in Europe, will be concluded during our Presidency.  The first phase, adopted by the Council of Ministers in December 1987 provided opportunities for Irish airlines to operate on additional routes within the European Community.  The measures contained in the first phase together with the even more liberal terms of the Memorandum of Understanding concluded with the UK in 1988 have allowed Aer Lingus to commence direct services from Dublin to Newcastle and Hamburg and to operate fifth freedom services through Manchester to Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Hamburg and Zurich.</P>
    <P>In addition, Ryanair have introduced services from Dublin to Liverpool, Coventry and Munich and have developed new routes from the regional airports at Connacht, Galway and Kerry to a number of points in the UK.</P>
    <P>This budget continues the policies which have proved so successful over the past three years.  The available evidence tells us we are on the right path.  The most striking example of that evidence is the fact that the Exchequer borrowing requirement for last year was down to £479 million or only 2.4 per cent of GNP. The Government are aware that there is no room for complacency and that the job is not yet complete.  We must continue to strive for growth and to improve employment prospects for our youth.</P>
    <P>Growth in employment will depend on <Col N="358" /> our success in producing and selling profitably more of our goods and services in the wider international market, particularly that which is opening up to us in the context of the single market and the new Europe of the 1990s.  I am confident that the tourism and transport sectors will not be found wanting when we come to review the decade which we have just entered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak because this is the first opportunity I have had to speak in this House on a budget.  No doubt, some of the sentiments I will express will be a little bitter, but I hope people will take them in the right spirit.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan was right when he likened the budget to Lannah Machree's dog, it went a little bit of the road with everyone but did little for anyone.  The initial reacton on the evening of the budget and the following morning was that it was a success.  On closer examination, however, it was described as cautious and, as the week went on, it was seen as a non-event.  The Minister fiddled about with figures and he succeeded in doing nothing worthy of note during the process.  He reduced the top and bottom rates of tax which was acclaimed at the time.  However, the bands were not index-linked, many people who expect to pay tax at the 30 per cent rate will, after a small increase in their wages, end up on the 48 per cent band and many others will move up to the 53 per cent band under similar circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister relieved a little bit of the misery at the bottom end of the scale but the middle income people, many of whom have hefty mortgages, will pay more tax.  The figures for the tax take next year are up by something in the region of £104 million to £110 million on last year.  Mortgage interest relief remains unchanged even though interest rates have gone up by four points since the relief was originally cut.  That was done at a time when interest rates were moving downwards, which is why it was done.  We can expect another revolt from <Col N="359" /> this group later in the year when the budget propaganda is translated into the reality of take home pay every week.  This will especially be the case if interest rates are increased further because of developments in Eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>The tax changes in the budget can only be described as a failure.  The PAYE sector are still left with the old, familiar and unfair burden.  The Minister scattered a few crumbs in the direction of those in the poverty trap.  There is no doubt that social welfare recipients and the lower paid will be a little better off. However, the quality of their lives has not been improved one whit and the budget did not give them any hope for the future.  The lower paid workers end up quite often worse off than those on social welfare because of the way the system operates.  This group will take little solace from the fine statistics and the proud boasts of the Minister during his speech.</P>
    <P>The surplus in the balance of payments reduced Exchequer borrowing requirements and there was a lower than expected budget deficit.  These facts are hardly music to the ears of the poor because they do not put bread on their tables.  Our society is as deeply divided today as it was the day before the budget was delivered.  The unemployed and the lower paid are still trapped in the twilight zone where social justice and equality of opportunity remain empty slogans.  The roots of this problem go back 13 years.  I have to get this off my chest and I hope the people on the Government side will have the patience to listen to me for a while.</P>

      <P>Some of the authors have left the stage but some are still in the House.  The Fianna Fáil Party produced the mad manifesto of 1977 and the same party spent their way recklessly into the eighties.  I could mention the massive rise in the pay of teachers and gardaí and the crazy Estimates of 1981.  The same party tried hard to get the people to rise against <Col N="360" /> the FitzGerald Government during their efforts to put the economy right.  We all remember the way pressure groups were given a hearing and a little push in the right direction.  That same party are now masquerading as the saviour of the republic. The poor people literally belong to Fianna Fáil as they are the authors of their abject poverty.  They will see to it that the majority in this House, which Fianna Fáil so urgently desire, will be denied.  All their utterances point to the fact that life began in 1987.  They pretend that they are undoing the wrongs although they originally perpetrated them.  The saviours of the country are my colleagues on these benches.  If it had not been for the Tallaght speech we would still be squandering money and in the same squalid mess.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dukes could have played tricks with Fianna Fáil.  For example, he could have demanded extra money for the hospitals in Kildare and he could have blackmailed them in regard to every constituency.  To use a pun, he could have foxed them in every corridor in the House.  However, Deputy Dukes decided to stand by the country and its people.  If the Taoiseach had decided to adopt these principles in 1983 what would the position be today?  We can only guess.  What would have happened if we had had a Kinsealy strategy?  In the light of our experience, it is obvious that we will never have a strategy from that quarter. The people &mdash; in particular the poor &mdash; have often been used as pawns in crazy power games and it is noticeable that they have recently come to realise that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Social justice and equality of opportunity are the markers against which we measure the achievements of society. How do we score?  In education, health, social welfare and the administration of justice we are way off target.  Free primary education is a myth.  Parents are paying for maintenance, equipment and basic heating oil.  Indeed, they are paying an even bigger price.  Pupils in primary schools right across the country need remedial help, particularly in rural areas as, in many cases, the bigger schools in towns are provided with a service.  These <Col N="361" /> students must do without assistance of this kind and they languish at the back of large classes.  Later on they will be dropouts because they leave school at 15 years of age without certification and have not benefited from 11 years of school.  They are then the beneficiaries of a social guarantee, which means that they will be given the benefit of a six months FAS course.  It would be better if at least some of the resources put at their disposal when it is too late could be used when it would be most beneficial.  Could we channel some of these funds into remedial education at primary level, thereby cutting down on the demand for social guarantee courses later on?  I hope the Minister will see some sense in this approach and consider it.</P>
    <P>In the delivery of the health services, the weaker members of society are locked out.  According to reports, the situation in Roscommon has improved &mdash; or will soon do so &mdash; and I understand that things are also looking up in Waterford. Generally, the situation is very bad&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that there are no problems in Cork.  The Minister must have been away for a while if he does not know about the problems in the rest of the country.  It has come to my attention that the street-wise in urgent need of medical attention have taken to falling down on the streets which means that they gain admission to hospital through casualty.  It is in the health services that the clearest picture is thrown up of the deep divisions in our society and there is no indication that that will change.  In an area where we need urgent decisions no decisions are forthcoming. We have to make do with further studies. Our health services must be the most studied services in any country in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the social welfare code we have a most ridiculous inequity.  Under the means test a few pounds in savings is reckoned to be worth a return of 10 per cent to the owner.  That is classified as <Col N="362" /> income for the saver.  Will the Minister for Social Welfare advise those who have saved a few pounds of where they can obtain such a return?  Will the Minister not consider changing that element of the means test immediately?  The same ridiculous anomaly applies in the case of means test for health cards.  In fact, it is even more ridiculous.  In the case of two identical units with the same incomes one family is entitled to a medical card and the other is not.  When income is obtained from employment a ficitious figure is used in the means test.  It is called gross income.  However, a family can only spend the money they receive; they cannot spend the gross income.</P>
    <P>I should like to appeal to the Minister to introduce an element of fairness into the means test.  Obviously, it is one of the main reasons for the poverty trap we hear so much about.  There are many clearly defined cases of blatant injustices in the way we conduct our affairs and the budget did not make any attempt to root any of them out of the system.  Social justice and equality of opportunity are a myth and the Government prefer to leave things as they are.  One of the hallmarks of the Government is that they will not change anything.  That is true as far as the health services and the systems of taxation and social welfare are concerned.</P>
    <P>There were many glaring omissions in the Minister's analysis of the economy. In his budget speech he never once referred to interest rates.  I have no doubt that the reason is that our interest rates are four points higher than those of our European partners in the EMS.</P>
    <P>The Minister displayed a passing interest in agriculture.  The industry was mentioned on three occasions in his speech and was given one sentence on each occasion.  The Minister did not carry out an analysis of the agricultural industry. He did not refer to the difficulties in the industry or the fact that farmers are not getting a proper price for their produce.  Milk is holding a little but there is not much milk produced in the winter time.  We have been told that within a couple of months the price of a gallon of <Col N="363" /> milk will have dropped by up to 17p per gallon.  It is surprising that the Minister did not mention agriculture, or outline the prospects for its future.</P>
    <P>Most people expected the Minister to produce a number of prescriptions for improvement in that industry.  He did not do so and it is my hope that the farmers will take note of that.  In my view, the farmers have been relegated to the lower divisions by the Minister and, obviously, by the Government.  It appears that farmers no longer count.  That may explain why they must wait so long for their headage payments and why their 55 per cent anti-pollution grant works out at half that when they receive their cheque. It may also explain why roads leading to farmers' houses are badly holed dirt tracks.</P>
    <P>What about the completion of the Single Market?  That is of particular interest to me because of the constituency I represent.  The top rate of VAT is down 2 per cent, selected excise duties have been decreased and, in some cases, abolished.  There was great joy in some circles about that.  The Minister felt extremely proud of himself and he thought he was doing an enormous amount of good for the Border regions. He told us he was preparing for 1992 but he should ask representatives from Border towns, such as Clones, Castleblayney and so on, if that contribution will do anything for the wellbeing of retailers in those towns.  In my view the answer will be in the negative.</P>
    <P>Price differences for many products, North and South, can only be described as ludicrous.  I should like to give some examples and I will express the differences in percentage terms.  Most people are aware that the difference in the price of petrol is between 45 and 50 per cent.  In the case of a personal computer the price south of the Border is 50 per cent higher than it is north of the Border.  I checked those prices myself.  I came across a ludicrous case last week.  I discovered that a 5lb box of sweets manufactured in Dublin was 87.5 per cent more expensive in the South <Col N="364" /> than in the North.  I do not understand how sweets manufactured in Dublin cost twice as much here than they do in the North.</P>
    <P>A few days ago I asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce to investigate why the sweets were almost twice as expensive here and he pointed out that as the Prices Commission had been abolished he had no mechanism for examining such complaints.  I should like to tell the Minister, and this is the first opportunity I have had to do this, that he is acting like a puppet.  He does not have any intention of getting off his &ldquo;butt&rdquo; and examining what is a ludicrous price as far as this product is concerned.  I have no doubt that a few phone calls would give him some of the reasons for the difference in price.  If he investigated the matter in greater detail he would discover that flaws in our economy are the cause of many of the higher prices.  If he discovered that, I have no doubt that he would take steps to improve the position. It is unfortunate that the Minister has adopted the attitude that as the Prices Commission have been abolished he intends sitting in his office and letting the prices go where they like.  On another day the Minister told us that there was a 2 per cent decrease in the VAT rate in the budget and he intended to monitor prices to ensure that consumers got the value they were entitled to.</P>
    <P>I do not understand his attitude.  He would benefit greatly from investigating the reason for the huge difference in prices north and south of the Border.  He would learn a lot about the fundamental flaws in the Irish economy and, given his past record, I have no doubt that he would do something about the difference. We would all benefit from such a move. People in the southern half of the Republic have little idea of what I am talking about.  They do not cross the Border for their petrol or to buy sweets and other goods for Christmas.  I accept that they cannot do so legally.</P>
    <P>The same huge differences are evident in audio and visual equipment and the Minister thinks he has resolved the problem there also.  He should ask the people <Col N="365" /> in the Border towns and they will tell him.  To begin with the price difference was so wide that what he did was totally and completely meaningless.  The Government party proclaimed loudly that they had solved the Border problem in 1987 and many people actually believed them.  Committees were set up along the Border which were designed to put pressure on the previous Government. Needless to say they were Fianna Fáil committees in most cases but in 1987, after the election, the committees disappeared into the ground and were never to be heard of again.  The Border traders and their families were then left in the mud and now three years later the Border people are beginning to realise they were gulled.  I am now being called to meetings in the Border areas to help and support them.  Much could have been done in the past three years but nothing was done, it was all politically motivated which is a shame for the people involved.</P>
    <P>When one asks the Minister about the completion of the internal market &mdash; I did it recently &mdash; he will say he is not sure how it works.  He will tell you that there may well be approximation of VAT and excise duties, but then again he says there may not be.  He says that this whole business may be market driven; whenever he says that another shiver goes down the spines of the people in Clones, Castleblayney and all the other Border towns because they know exactly what that means.  It means that another nail will be driven into their coffins, and given the conditions at present for many it will be the last nail.</P>
    <P>The people who work at the Border posts &mdash; the customs officials &mdash; are very anxious to know what the future holds for them.  When the Minister is asked about it he says: &ldquo;I do not know, it will transpire sometime in the future.&rdquo;  The customs officials are wondering whether they should sell their houses or keep them; young married people working in the customs are wondering whether they should buy or rent a house, but the Minister says he does not know.  This whole business of the Border difficulties is well worth looking at from the Government's <Col N="366" /> point of view because, as I said earlier, it points to the fact that all problems are not tax and excise based, though some are.  Tax and excise duties are the major elements involved, but there are others, and these are fundamental flaws in the economy.  For example, the exclusive import agreements &mdash; where many products are imported exclusively by a single individual or company into Ireland &mdash; allow importers to charge what they like as there is nobody else in the market against them.</P>
    <P>I have two ESRI reports in front of me &mdash; The Economics of 1992 A Symposium on Sectoral Issues and an Analysis of Cross-Border Shopping &mdash; which have dealt in great detail with this problem. They have analysed and found market differentiation to be the problem.  Companies are producing products for particular markets at a particular price or whatever price that particular market will hold.  We have a lot of that in Ireland. There was a great furore a few years ago and it certainly helped because what is known as the KVI &mdash; the known value items, those which are bought every day &mdash; and the wholesalers and producers took note and withdrew their prices and there was a levelling off at the pre-tax level.</P>
    <P>Many of the problems in the economy which are visible to us in the Border counties could well do with an examination. For example, the distribution of goods and transport costs.  If you were living in Monaghan you would ask if we can afford to maintain Whitegate.  When you tell somebody in that area that it adds 20p to the cost of petrol he knows what it means.  The poor boy in Cahirciveen does not think about it too often because he has no choice, he buys £10 worth of petrol or whatever but, of course, it is a fact that by maintaining Whitegate we are pushing up the price of every product we buy in Ireland because the price of petrol is a factor in the price of everything. If you ask us about Whitegate we could give you the answer.  That, of course, would be an emotional answer; it might not be the correct or the best answer but we would have an answer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="367" /> When the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, tells me that he has no interest in looking at prices along the Border I will give him an answer; it may not be the right or the best answer but it is an emotional answer. I hope the next time I ask him a question about the welfare of the Border people &mdash; this is a matter which it is within his competence to look at &mdash; I hope he will respond a little better than he did the other day.  The people of the Border towns would hope that the Minister for Industry and Commerce would display an interest in matters pertaining to Industry and Commerce irrespective of whether there is a Prices Commission.  I am sure that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, if he thought about the situation for a while, would excuse me for becoming angry.  These are the problems we have to deal with.</P>
    <P>I am glad I had the opportunity to get these problems off my chest in this House.  Some of the matters about which I feel very strongly are now on record here for the first time.  Having them on record in Leinster House is no guarantee that anybody else listened or that there will be any material change as a result of my 30 minute contribution today, but at least I can point to the record and say these are the matters which mainly concern me and these are the things which I share with my constituents.  I want the people in this House to listen, to act and to tell the people in the Border areas: &ldquo;We are sorry we have forgotten you, we will be a little more understanding about your problems in the future&rdquo;.  There are things we can do, things we have not done which we can do, so let us do them now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ColmMHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak on the 1990 national budget.  In 1987 this country was in a major crisis where there was virtually no growth in the economy in the previous years under the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government.  The change about in the economic situation during the past two and a half to three years, since 1987 <Col N="368" /> is unbelievable for any country in western Europe.</P>
      <P>This budget will certainly maintain economic progress.  It will continue to encourage and facilitate the continuation of social equality and share the gains of productivity and the extra revenue derived from that extra productivity, among all our people, but especially among the less well off in our society, and rightly so.  For any political party to identify the Fianna Fáil Party as a right wing party &mdash; which Labour and The Workers' Party have been doing over the last few years &mdash; is completely ridiculous because this is a very solid, sound, social budget.</P>
      <P>The first <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> has been an outstanding success and the Government and the social partners all have to be congratulated.  I have no doubt that the only successful way to higher employment in this country and better living standards in the future is to continue along this road.  I am very pleased, indeed, that the unions recently agreed to continue their support for the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> for the remaining eight or nine months.  This is a clear sign of acceptance that the only way to future national progress is working together and not working apart.  All sectors of our community must respect one another and work together for the common good.  If this is not done, national progress will not continue at the rate it has over the past three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a good, well prepared expressed and well planned budget which looks after the less well off in our society.  There have been 5 per cent increases in social welfare and an increase of 11 per cent in long-term unemployment assistance. Many other important policy decisions have been taken in this budget.  The budget seeks to control inflation and has given major tax reliefs to workers.  I would point out to Opposition speakers who have commented on our performance that we have reduced income tax from 35 per cent to 30 per cent in 12 months.  I challenge other political parties to match that record.  We are also moving <Col N="369" /> towards tax harmonisation with out partners in the European Community.  If we do not take steps in this area now we will have another crisis on our hands in three or four years' time.  At least this Government, unlike the previous Coalition Government, have the courage to take decisions.</P>
    <P>The foundation for future growth in the economy and employment creation has also been strengthened by the budget. Families, the elderly and persons living alone are well looked after and extra finance has been provided for priority areas such as education and health.  The Opposition parties may be critical of these small increases but at least this Government, unlike the previous Coalition Government who had nothing to give, are in a position to give something.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the budget is the programme to improve and protect our environment.  A sum of £12 million is provided in the budget towards this programme. This amount may be small but at least this Government are acknowledging the fact that our environment must be protected.</P>
    <P>During 1989 there was solid growth in the economy and investment, a very healthy trade balance and further improvements in employment.  For the third year in a row the outturn in the 1989 budget was well below the figure estimated at the beginning of the year; in fact, it was less than half that estimated. The budget deficit which stood at £1,055 million at the beginning at 1989 was reduced to £479 million by the end of the year.  This is a clear sign of good Government financial management. Government borrowing is at its lowest level for 40 years.  At the end of 1989 the budget deficit was £479 million compared to the figure of over £2 billion under the previous Coalition Government.  This is a remarkable achievement in economic terms by any Government.  However, we must not run away with ourselves; much hard work must still be done.  We should make hay while the sun shines and build sound foundations for future developments and trade.  We should do this now <Col N="370" /> because our trading prospects may not be as favourable in the future.</P>
    <P>The total budget deficit will be reduced to £449 million in 1990.  If trade and commerce continue to grow as they did in 1988 and 1989 we should not be surprised if we have a surplus budget at the end of this year for the first time in history. This would be an outstanding national achievement.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have already made it clear that we are not out of the woods yet.  I wish to repeat that message loudly and clearly here today.</P>
    <P>It is of the utmost importance that we work towards reducing our national debt, which stands at £25 billion, now that our financial position has improved.  The national debt high jump record was achieved by the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition during their period in office from 14 December 1982 to 10 March 1987.  They achieved the record of increasing the national debt from £11.669 billion to £22.812 billion, which is almost double. It is strange that, having been a total failure when they were in office these are the political parties who are now advising this side of the House on how we should run the economic affairs of this country. It costs over £2 billion to service our national debt at present.  This is a massive liability on future investment and progress. We must become experts on how to use taxpayers' money, how to invest and reinvest and where to invest and not to invest.  We must also keep a close eye on the cost of financing our loans, which can be an expensive business.</P>
    <P>Some very important financial savings have been undertaken in this area.  I am very glad the Taoiseach decided to set up immediately a national debt office.  This is a major step forward.  I am sure this office will keep the Government fully briefed on developments in international financial markets and financial trading costs.  The setting up of this body has been long overdue.</P>
    <P>It has been difficult to achieve the progress made over the past three years. Many sectors of our community were affected by the policy decisions made by the Government.  I do not deny that fact, <Col N="371" /> but I must point out that the minority Fianna Fáil Government at that time had the courage to make difficult policy decisions for the common good.  The record of this Government under the leadership of the Taoiseach, Deputy Charles J. Haughey, will be recorded in national financial history books as having saved our national economic ship from sinking.  The policy decisions taken by the Fianna Fáil Government have resulted in new national pride and confidence.  I know it is not easy for the Opposition parties to stomach what I am saying but these are the facts.  I hope we can continue to achieve further economic growth and success in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>It is still essential, and will be for many years to come, for the Government to exercise very disciplined control over our public expenditure in order to achieve major reductions in the national debt as well as meeting other major demands which may arise.  The strict control of public expenditure which was imposed is being maintained for no reason other than to safeguard the future economic well being of the people, and our economy, which was in grave danger of collapse some years ago.</P>
    <P>Some sectors of our community are of the opinion that now is the time to make claims for increased services and wages.  I hope the Government and social partners will act wisely in this regard.  We still have a national debt of £25 billion and a £2 billion plus annual interest repayment to honour.  We cannot use one penny of this £2 billion for any productive developments until we have first cleared our national debt.  The reality is that continued economic progress depends entirely on the exercise of tight control on public expenditure.  If we fail to do this we will soon find ourselves back in the poverty trap.  As the people do not want to find themselves in that position again, we must draw the line and get back to having balanced annual budgets.  We cannot allow the successes of the past few years to be thrown away.</P>
    <P>In 1989 there was yet another excellent increase in exports.  In the year 1987-88 <Col N="372" /> there was a 15 per cent increase in exports.  A similar increase is likely to be recorded for 1989, along with a trade surplus in excess of £2 billion for the three-year period, with the balance of payments also remaining in surplus. Industrial production continued to increase over the past three years, reaching a 10 per cent growth and more in volume, the highest ever increase achieved.  Given the renewed flow of investment of the past two years there is no reason why this good export performance cannot be sustained.</P>
    <P>I now wish to refer to unemployment. The aim of the Government must be to increase the net number of jobs created. I am sure that this will be one of the main issues discussed during the negotiations on the second programme for national recovery between the Government and the social partners.  In the two year period to mid-April 1989 net employment rose by 10,000.  It has been forecast that this figure will increase to at least 13,000 for the year to April 1990.  The Government are determined to increase further the net number of jobs created during the next three to four years.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that 21,500 new jobs were created in manufacturing and international services in 1989.  It is worth remembering that the trade unions, in difficult circumstances, honoured their commitments under the first <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> We should continue making prudent investments to increase employment and slow down emigration.  The days of creating artificial jobs are over.  It is of the utmost importance that the social partners be in full agreement with Government policy if we are to maintain economic growth and create employment in future years.  No matter what the differences may be between them the well being of our people should be our first priority in the discussion on the second programme for national recovery.  I wish them well.</P>
    <P>Unemployment can have devastating effects on people and their families.  All politicians should appreciate this.  Given that the books are now almost balanced <Col N="373" /> it is now time to really tackle the unemployment problem and I hope new policies will reap results.  We cannot allow our young generation to be condemned to idleness on the dole queue.  They will lose whatever hope or trust they have in us as politicians to manage the affairs of the country if we fail to make a serious effort to solve the unemployment problem. Although unemployment has much to do with idleness, people need not be idle.  They could be active.  We cannot afford to allow them to be idle.</P>
    <P>We all have a part to play as some unemployment is self-inflicted and what is self-inflicted is curable.  The position is not as bad as four or five years ago when there was a high rate of absenteeism, idling on the job, abuse of expense accounts within companies, neglectful, managements, excessive profits, high imports which could have been replaced by home produced goods and strikes which we do not appear to suffer from at present for the simple reason that the Government and the social partners came together to draw up a national plan. If these matters are corrected and if productivity is increased jobs could be created.</P>
    <P>Many people like to talk about this problem but it is a different matter altogether when one is asked to do something about it.  Increased profits are not necessarily the answer.  One of the reasons we have high unemployment and poverty is that there is too much greed in the world today.  Many business people and institutions could employ one more worker. I accept that this would lead to an increase in production costs but at the same time all that would happen is that the company would make reduced profits at the end of the year.  There must be new thinking within the community if we are to create employment.  Businesses should try to link up with the third level system to meet those about to qualify to discuss their futures.  In this way we might prevent them from travelling abroad where they will be grabbed.  There is no doubt that every parish and community council as well as the local authorities could employ one or two extra workers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="374" /> Another way to create employment would be for the Government to establish a risk fund with the funding being distributed to the county development officers, in the process cutting out much of the red tape, with the aim of encouraging young people to set up small enterprises of their own by offering them grants ranging from £10,000 to £30,000. Even if three-quarters of these projects failed the other quarter would be successful and although money would be lost at least it would have been lost within the country.  This is a suggestion which should be considered.</P>
    <P>We must also give some thought to the suggestion of providing incentives for employers and employees.  In the past, the policy appeared to be to invest in mechanisation rather than in labour.  One would have to say that the company employing 100 people and making £500,000 a year profit should be provided with more incentives than the company employing ten people and making £500,000 a year profit.  However, the policy appeared to be to invest in mechanisation. Perhaps this is the reason that only ten people are being employed with machines doing the work that the 90 in the other company are doing.  I am glad that the Minister touched on this matter in his Budget Statement and has provided a sum of £11 million for employment incentives.  The result of this will be investment in labour and not in mechanisation. There are too many companies coming into this country and promising to create, say, 500 jobs over four years, when applying for and getting massive grants for capital costs.  If one were to look back at the records one would find that none of the employment targets was ever reached.  Some of these companies went bust before they even reached the three or five year target.  I am not criticising the IDA for that because there have been many successes but the point I am making is that the jobs were not created as promised in the applications these companies put before the IDA to get State money.  There is a change taking place here and I am delighted to see that.</P>
    <P>It is an indisputable fact that each year <Col N="375" /> industry employs more capital and fewer people.  Each year fewer people are required to carry out the work; each year there is less purchasing power and that creates further unemployment.  It is important that we reverse this trend.  We must control the ratio between production and the number of people employed in that production.  Grants for automation to decrease employment and so reduce purchasing power and create further unemployment does not appear to be good policy.  Let us now acknowledge those who increase employment rather than capital grants.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the second <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> will be agreed and, together with the £3 billion Structural Funds properly invested, the next five years should be very exciting for future progress and new employment. The Government alone cannot solve the unemployment problem.  That is why I would emphasis so strongly the necessity for the Government and the social partners to agree to the second <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and to develop new ideas.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words about investment. The first <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> has also made a remarkable improvement in the volume of increased investment in our country; investment as a whole increased by 10 per cent last year and is expected to increase further this year.  This is certainly a breath of fresh air when one looks back three or four years ago when money was running out of this country and there was little or no confidence here.  There is an inflow of new industrial investment now and a very strong interest in overseas companies locating here in the near future.  I would like to emphasise again the moral responsibility on those with money and property to give priority to productive investment within their own country.  My message is invest at home and ask before buying goods if they are Irish made.</P>
    <P>The year 1989 witnessed a strong revival in the construction industry with current sales up by 20 per cent and the number of new house completions up <Col N="376" /> by 13 per cent with some increases in employment.  I would like to have seen more, but that is the situation.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words on agriculture. Agriculture has also done well over the past three years.  As a result of this budget farmers will benefit from an increase in the VAT refunds to 2.3 per cent.  The placing of agricultural trainees on residential courses on an equal footing with other vocational trainees in regard to payment of fees, charges in stock relief rules to accommodate farmers whose herds are affected by disease eradication and the indexation of capital acquisitions tax thresholds in 1990 and future years, are intended to be of particular assistance to farmers in facilitating the orderly transfer of farms from one generation to another.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about the success rate of the TB eradication scheme to date. The farmers are now more or less paying for the entire cost of this scheme through levies.  It is time all concerned sat down and discussed a better way to speed up progress in that area.  We must protect our future agricultural export business.  If we wait much longer we may be too late. I appeal to all concerned to set definite targets to be achieved over the next five years.</P>
    <P>The Government should call in all concerned to decide on a national food export plan with set targets over the next ten years.  This is an area where much employment could be created.  I know certain efforts have been made and that there have been advances but we have not gone very far up that road yet.  The European market is wide open to us. Even if we were to double our food exports to the EC we would still be supplying less than 5 per cent of the total EC markets.  I call on all Irish agricultural cooperatives, creameries and agricultural business enterprises to stop the infighting and join together as one massive national food unit.  We should have a single national brand for all our top quality foods for sale abroad and at home.  There are many people out there prepared to pay dearly for quality food.  There is no limit to the market.  The Government <Col N="377" /> must act immediately to encourage debate and discussion on this important issue.  We must act now or it will be too late.  It is a pity we cannot unite in this area for the common good of national progress as opposed to individual success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>As this is the first time I have spoken in a budget debate I would like to take this opportunity to wish my fellow constituency TD, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Albert Reynolds, well in his position.</P>
      <P>In the time allowed to me I wish to immediately raise the problems in my constituency.  The major problems for the past number of years in County Longford has been the lack of jobs.  The young people are leaving by the plane load some, perhaps, never to work again in their own country.  In the sixties I, like many others, emigrated and worked abroad for some time.  However, since then, and especially in the early seventies, forced emigration was a thing of the past.  It was during the latter part of the seventies that the economic ills about which we hear so much today and which are supposedly being solved, were created.  Emigration crept back in the early eighties and in latter years has become one way traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great opportunity was missed in the late seventies.  If a reasonable approach had been taken at that time the young people today would have choices and there would be jobs available and I would not have had to listen today to what previous speakers said about a debt management department.  If the same action had been taken by the politicians at that time, there would not have to be the debt management we are now witnessing.  The young people are paying the price.  I have read this Budget Statement many times and I find no ray of hope in it for my constituency in the area of job creation.  In County Longford we have suffered from closures and redundancies to the tune of almost 700 jobs lost in a number of years.  I hope the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, will listen to my <Col N="378" /> appeal that our part of the country needs investment.  I would like to see Longford designated as a special area for increased grants.  The workers in that area are as good as workers anywhere else in the country and they deserve a chance. Major industry is needed there and I hope the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the IDA will listen to my comments in this regard.  For example, Granard had a clothing industry some years ago and no industry has been found to replace it.  We have an excellent workforce of machinists there who are ready, willing and able to work and in the town of Longford also we have machinists.  It is not their fault that the jobs are not there; they are prepared to work.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand why the Fianna Fáil Government who, in past years, constantly boasted that they were on the side of the builders have scrapped the home improvement grants.  These grant schemes gave employment to small builders, boosted the builders' suppliers business and improved houses.  I call on the Government to remedy this mistake and to introduce some badly needed boost for the small builder.  Surely this is one way of creating jobs on the ground.</P>
    <P>On the health issue, I welcome the extra money for the care of the elderly. I spoke on this matter here recently and I am glad the Minister has taken the first step in the right direction.  I welcome also the extension of free travel to companions of the disabled.  I have raised this issue at the request of people directly concerned in working for the mentally handicapped, etc., so I must compliment the Minister on this.</P>
    <P>The Minister has missed a great opportunity in this budget by not being more adventurous about job creation.  He has sidestepped this issue.  It is easy for me as a Deputy to advise any Minister for Finance to make unpopular decisions regarding Government expenditure, but bearing in mind the extra tax collected in 1989, together with the extra funds from Europe, the Minister has stopped short. So much was expected from this budget; indeed, so much pre-budget hype has <Col N="379" /> seldom been experienced.  In my estimation it was all hype and very little fight. There was a great opportunity to give the unemployed of the country and of my constituency a chance to fight back but the Government failed to give that lead. I will give an example.  The proprietors of two family-owned hotels came to me saying they were anxious to expand their business and to install extra bedrooms. Unfortunately, they will not be helped and there are no grants for them.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear today that it is the Government who are making the decisions, contrary to recently expressed beliefs that it was only part of the Government who are making the decisions.  If the Government were serious about job creation in the rural areas and the small towns, surely a small town hotel is an ideal business in which to generate jobs, for young girls especially, and others.  It would bring people on holiday to my area, especially for fishing holidays and it would generate business. The Government talk about tourism. Money seems to be available for larger projects and things like leisure centres and there is nothing wrong with that, but the money should be evenly spread and the small hotelier and investor should be taken into account.  Let us not be carried away.  In the past, large industries were State-supported and unfortunately some of them did not stand the test of time. We have heard about supporting smaller industry.  I am citing the example of the small hotelier who should be helped out in the same way as the large hoteliers.</P>
    <P>While the increases in social welfare payments were welcomed, they were just above the rate of inflation.  The standard practice of successive Governments has been to keep in line with inflation in these increases.  Here the Minister has continued the practice when increasing allowances for the long-term unemployed. Surely those in our society who have been deprived of employment for a number of years deserve increases.  I fail to find in these increases any reason for cheers.</P>
    <P>In my constituency in the last few <Col N="380" /> weeks many farmers were under severe pressure due to problems caused by flooding because grants have not yet been paid out to them.  I take this opportunity to appeal to the Minister for Agriculture to pay out those grants because these people are in dire straits waiting for money, and their farms, their farmyards and in some cases their houses, were flooded.  I am not blaming the Government for that but I am asking the Government, and especially the Minister for Agriculture, to see that those grants are paid.  There have been delays and it is time this money was paid.</P>
    <P>There are proposals in my constituency for a regional airport at Abbeyshrule and I would hope when these plans come before the Government every support would be given to this project.  An airstrip has been established there for some years.  If the Government give their support for European funding, this regional airport will serve the midlands well.  It is well situated between Mullingar, Athlone and Longford.  I hope the project will get the necessary support and go ahead.  The region certainly needs a boost, although I am not saying that an airport would be an answer to all our problems.</P>
    <P>Calls have been made for a Government Department to be located in Longford and I am asking that at least a section of such a Department should be centred there.  This would help an area which has been badly deprived over a number of years.  I was elected to raise my voice to highlight the neglect of that area and the need for foreign investment.  This is not idle talk; these are facts.</P>
    <P>For the unemployed of County Longford the Minister has given little hope and for that reason I cannot welcome this budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government and the Minister for Finance are to be congratulated on this very good budget which has been well received throughout the country.  This does not mean that it was simply a popular budget; it was far more than that.  It continued <Col N="381" /> the progress towards national recovery commenced in 1987 and continued ever since with notable success.  In common with budgets since 1987, the budget of 1990 has as a major objective the promotion of economic growth, the provision of more jobs at home and a better standard of living.</P>
      <P>The first and foremost objective of the budget is to reduce the high level of unemployment.  All Deputies have a common interest in finding a solution to the greatest problem facing the country, that is, unemployment, and all the consequences that flow from it.  The whole country must be involved in setting this problem.</P>
      <P>The area I represent has particular problems in regard to unemployment levels.  Not only do we suffer from the general unemployment problem but because of our location close to Northern Ireland there are other added problems. My colleagues in Government are well aware of these problems and are very conscious of the pressure which I constantly put on them to improve the situation in the north eastern part of the country.  When one checks the figures for employment creation in the area over the past two or three years one sees there has been a significant increase in the numbers employed in manufacturing industry, which is the barometer of the rate of progress and wellbeing in an area.  In 1987 in the north-east there were 14,736 people employed in the manufacturing sector, while in 1989 the figure had risen to 15,677.  In County Louth employment in manufacturing industry in 1987 was 7,056, while at the end of 1989 that figure had risen to 7,596.  The figures for unemployment in the county have decreased significantly since 1987, from 9,664 to 8,770 at the end of 1989.  The clear indications are that we are moving in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget shows the firm determination of this Government to continue the task of putting the public finances in order.  Current expenditure must be kept closely in control so that every penny taken from taxpayers is spent in ways <Col N="382" /> which are not only essential but worthwhile. Government borrowing must be kept to a minimum.  It is notable that last year Government borrowing was at its lowest level for about 40 years.  This excellent progress as regards borrowing must be tempered by the thought that payment for past borrowings by previous Governments cost over £2 billion per annum, which is roughly equivalent to all the income tax paid in a year by the PAYE sector.  These two facts should be looked at together.</P>
    <P>We must consider what a determined Government can do when they set about the task of putting the national finances right.  We must also think of all that could be done with the money from the PAYE sector if we did not have to pay for the spendthrift policy of previous years.  The answer to the second point is very simple. The Minister for Finance would be in a position to greatly reduce tax on earnings and he would have the equally important option of providing money for capital investment in many areas.</P>
    <P>The end result of good management of the economy since 1987 is the improvement in inflation and costs.  The Minister for Finance has predicted that by the end of 1990 our inflation rate could be less than 2.5 per cent.  These are very important elements in making sure the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> continues on its steady course.  It is important for for all our people that the successful understanding between the Government and the social partners should continue. If we had not had such an understanding during the past three years I would not like to contemplate the problems we would have to confront.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that the target of 20,000 jobs in manufacturing and international services was met in 1988. The same target of 20,000 jobs was met in 1989.</P>
    <P>The £3 billion from the European Structural Fund over the period 1989-93 will be of great help in supplementing benefits to the whole economy.  To make full use of these funds our inflation and costs must be kept as low as possible. There is a continuing need to attract <Col N="383" /> investment from outside the country.  We have improved greatly the view taken of Ireland by financiers and business people in other countries.  This is a direct result of the way in which the Government have approached economic management since 1987.  A major beneficial factor in attracting investment is that we are members of the European Community, which is becoming more integrated with the passing of time.</P>
    <P>The Government have continued to show their concern for the under-privileged in our society.  That has been the policy of Government over the past three years and is continuing.  Public representatives, through their weekly clinics and many other contacts, know far more than most people about the very difficult circumstances of the old, the unemployed, and the disadvantaged in our society.  I am glad to say that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Albert Reynolds, has shown through the increases he has given over the whole range of welfare payments, that Government policy is continuing and is geared to helping the poor, the old, and the unemployed.</P>
    <P>This Government have also continued in their policy of reducing the burden of income tax.  This continuance of income tax relief has taken two forms.  Firstly, there have been improved tax provisions for the people earning low incomes.  Secondly, there have been significant reductions in the standard and higher rates of tax.  Very important also is the new scheme where employees on the lowest earnings will be relieved of PRSI.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank the Minister for Finance for the changes he has brought into effect as regards excise duties on televisions and on equipment such as videos.  This measure will be of great benefit to the business community in my constituency.  It has been a matter of major political controversy for some years and we are delighted Deputy Reynolds has taken the necessary remedial action.</P>
    <P>Before finishing my comments on general aspects of the budget, I would like again to congratulate the Minister <Col N="384" /> for Finance and his colleagues in Government for having brought in what I think is a very successful budget.  I hesitate to mention other Ministers individually. However, one man in particular has had a particularly difficult task over the past three years.  I am speaking of the Minister for Health, Deputy Rory O'Hanlon.  He has had a difficult task reducing expenditure and at the same time improving efficiency in the health sector.  More than any other Minister he has come in for a quite unjustified amount of criticism, a large amount of it, unfortunately, on a personal basis.  He must be congratulated on having carried out a very difficult task in a most effective way.</P>
    <P>Before going on to deal with horticulture, my main area of responsibility, I am glad to say that work is proceeding with the plan to revise the disadvantaged areas.  I am looking forward to a successful completion of that work and approval by the EC Commission.</P>
    <P>Legislation to set up An Bord Glas has now been passed by the Dáil and Seanad. I hope very soon to be in a position to establish the new board.</P>
    <P>I am glad of the opportunity to pay tribute to the interim board for the very good work done since their establishment in 1987.  The interim board took very many initiatives which have had a good impact on the outlook of the country and in particular of horticultural procedures as regards future possibilities for this important industry.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to go into detail here about An Bord Glas.  This has been done already during the debate on the Bill in the Dáil and Seanad.  Nevertheless, a few points deserve mention since An Bord Glas have their place in Government policy of improving balance of payments through decreasing imports and increasing exports.  It is also a very important vehicle for the creation of jobs.  Anybody who has read the interim report of the review committee on the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> will have seen that An Bord Glas made their contribution to job creation in 1988 and 1989.  I am glad to say that significant increases in <Col N="385" /> employment in the horticultural industry have taken place.</P>
    <P>A development programme for horticulture was published at the end of 1988. It is the most important job done by the interim Bord Glas.  Very clear and concise targets are set out in that programme. The main work of the new board, in close collaboration with Teagasc and other State agencies, is to put the programme into effect.  Again I do not wish to go into detail but a very important point in the development programme is the need to improve marketing by horticultural procedures.  This means that products must not only be of good quality.  It also means that producers should not set about the production of a particular product without arranging for an outlet for their produce beforehand. This means the producer must know to whom he will be selling and that he will arrange with the purchaser regarding quantities, delivery dates and so on. These arrangements are already made in certain cases but not on a sufficiently wide scale.</P>
    <P>I recognise that it is difficult for individual producers to make marketing arrangements working alone.  To overcome this, producers should band together to make more unified deals with wholesalers. Above all they should set up producer groups for which they can obtain valuable financial assistance from the European Community.</P>
    <P>In the eyes of many people the success of An Bord Glas will be reflected in developments in the potato industry. There have been improvements but there is still a long way to go in regard to both ware potatoes and seed potatoes.</P>
    <P>There have been close contacts between An Bord Glas and the IFA as regards the IFA appointing a marketing co-ordinator for the potato sector.  In the past year I have obtained EC approval for the extension of the producer group regulations to cover the potato sector. We are looking forward to the appointment of the market co-ordinator and the operations of the producer group grant scheme, effecting the changes in the marketing end of the potato industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="386" /> Concerning hardy nursery stock there has been close co-operation between An Bord Glas, CTT and producers aimed at improving our exports of these products. Great possibilities exist for such trade in Britain and further afield.  An important new grant scheme was introduced on the recommendation of the interim Bord Glas for the refurbishing of glasshouses. Unfortunately, because of lack of investment both in the refurbishing and the building of new glass houses over the past number of years, there has been a decline in that sector.  We are looking forward to both the increased grant aid available under the farm improvement programme and the new greenhouse grant scheme, providing encouragement and the incentive to people to invest and refurbish, as is so necessary in the sector.</P>
    <P>The mushroom sector has shown remarkable expansion in recent years. The present annual output is valued at £35 million at farm gate level.  That figure has been reached over a relatively short period.  Because of the very labour intensive nature of the industry, it is making a very valuable contribution in places such as Wexford, Monaghan, Claremorris and other parts of the country.  We are looking forward to the continued expansion in that sector.  The bulk of production is sold on the UK market.  It is also fair to say that at present, because of the weak position of sterling, we are encountering some difficulties but we hope they will be of a temporary nature and that the ongoing rate of progress, the expansion and the gaining of new markets will continue after we have overcome the present difficulties.</P>
    <P>I am glad to tell the House that in recent times I have had discussions with Mr. Peter Bottomley, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Northern Ireland Office.  This followed a recent visit to the North.  We have agreed to establish a working group to identify areas of common interest in regard to research and we hope to make progress in that area in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>I am sure Members are also aware that a new section has been established in the Department of Agriculture and Food for <Col N="387" /> the purpose of developing the organic farming sector.  A European Community draft directive is now before the Council to lay down rules on the control and marketing of organic products.  There is undoubtedly a niche market for organically produced food and if we are to identify market needs, we will obviously have to take the necessary measures to improve developments in this sector.</P>
    <P>I am sure many parents were very glad of the announcement in the budget regarding the provision for students at both agricultural and horticultural colleges. This State will be making its contribution towards the cost of their education.  This matter has been near and dear to the heart of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Michael O'Kennedy.  He is particularly glad that changes have been effected in this sector. There was a certain inequality of treatment with regard to students in our agricultural and horticultural colleges <i>vis-à-vis</i> those in the RTCs.  It was very necessary to effect the changes in that area and they are certainly very welcome.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Michael O'Kennedy, is making quite steady progress recovering from his operation.  He is looking forward to being back in the Department and being involved in the deliberations of this House.</P>
    <P>To conclude, we can say that the 1990 budget is a very successful one; it is a further stage in the <i>Programme of National Recovery.</i> We can look forward with considerable optimism to 1991, 1992 and beyond, to the process of national recovery and the re-establishment of our economy as a vibrant one within the Community.  The fact that the targets that have been set out for 1988 and 1989 are being reached clearly indicates that the projections were accurate and close to reality when first framed.  We look forward to continuing progress in that sector in the years immediately ahead.</P>

      <P>I will take up a couple of points made by the Minister of State.  It was fascinating that Deputy Kirk <Col N="388" /> should say that the Minister for Finance had stated that he hoped that the inflation rate will decrease to two and a half per cent by the end of 1990.  I have no doubt that everybody is aware of the Minister's projections for interest rates in the last budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 63 and 109 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="389" /> In December 1989, I made regulations which allow long term unemployed persons to take up full-time education courses while at the same time continuing to receive their unemployment payments. Long term unemployed persons, over age 21, may now participate in second level courses such as the intermediate, group and leaving certificates, some city and guilds courses and other courses leading to a certificate recognised by the Department of Education. Courses may be pursued at any approved centre.  This latest facility to pursue education courses complements the vocational training opportunities scheme and the part-time education initiative. Together, these initiatives make the pursuance of further education a real option for unemployed persons.</P>
    <P>I do not have details of the number of persons who are availing of the facilities to undertake full-time or part-time education courses.  In most cases permission to participate in these courses is sought and granted at local level.  In relation to the vocational training opportunities scheme which is administered by the Department of Education, the scheme is operating in 13 centres with about 200 participants.  It is planned to progressively expand the number of centres throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I intend to cater for those who wish to pursue third level education by introducing a pilot scheme permitting participation in these courses while continuing to receive unemployment payments.  The scheme will be primarily aimed at older, long term unemployed persons.  Details of the pilot scheme are being finalised at present and I expect to be in a position to make an announcement shortly.</P>
    <P>My Department are currently preparing an information leaflet on educational opportunities for the unemployed. Within the next few weeks leaflets will be made available to local and public offices by my Department, unemployed centres and VEC's.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the further details of the scheme announced in <Col N="390" /> December.  I am disappointed that the Minister cannot be clear about the numbers participating.  Of the 240 places in the vocational opportunities area what is the number participating in those?  Can the Minister estimate the numbers who will be involved?  In view of the fact that we have 250,000 people unemployed would the Minister not consider admitting that the educational opportunities takeup in this country is abysmally low?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some 200 people participating in those VTOs already, which is a substantial number in a very short time.  The number is continually rising.  There is a clear demand.  Those courses are set courses and that is how we can have the numbers going to those courses.  Those courses can accommodate up to 250 participants and further expansion beyond that is a matter which the Minister for Education is considering.  An expansion of the scheme would require the establishment of additional centres which means the allocation of extra resources on the education side, in terms of teachers, classrooms and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to some new initiative in his reply.  What proposals has the Minister in relation to third level education?  In relation to the long term unemployed, would the Minister not accept that it is unnecessary to restrict the courses in any way and that any educational opportunity that a long term unemployed person may wish to take up on the basis that it would be of personal development value should be allowed?  Will the Minister have another look at any restrictions he is putting on, having regard to the very long term unemployed, and interpret the regulations in the most flexible possible manner?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that there are financial implications in all of these measures.  The system is operating for second level.  One of the difficulties about numbers at second level is that people from all around the country are going into their local secondary <Col N="391" /> school or VEC to take what is not a specified VTO course.  We would not have those numbers very readily because those courses are available to people on an ongoing basis.  We could do a survey at some stage to find out how many are doing those courses.  In relation to third level, I will shortly announce the details of a pilot scheme which will enable people to participate in third level education. We can discuss it at that stage.  The pilot scheme will have restrictions on it during its period.</P>

Some colleges are making, or considering <Col N="392" /> making, special proposals in view of the flexibility which I am offering now, but that is all in the making at the moment. In another few months the Deputy will be able to quantify exactly what has happened.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>if he will outline the method of application for invalidity pension; if forms are available; if so, where they may be obtained; if he will outline the procedure involved; the reason many recipients of disability benefit are not informed of their entitlement to apply even after years of benefit; the number who are successful on their first application and after; the nature of monitoring of invalidity pensioners; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Persons who have been on disability benefit for a year or longer, and who satisfy the medical and contribution conditions, are entitled to claim invalidity pension.  Contribution conditions for invalidity pensions are similar to those applying for receipt of disability benefit for longer than 12 months.</P>
      <P>Detailed information, including information leaflets, regarding invalidity pension is provided by the Information Service of my Department through three public offices in Dublin and 36 information offices located throughout the country.  In addition, this information is available at over 80 community information offices which are operated under the auspices of the National Social Service Board.  Application for invalidity pension is made by completing a claim form and these forms are available, by writing to or phoning the invalidity pensions section in Dublin.</P>
      <P>There are about 26,000 persons receiving disability benefit on the long duration basis, on foot of monthly medical certificates. Last year 6,350 persons applied for invalidity pension.  A further 2,700 cases were identified by my Department as being suitable for invalidity pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 2,700 cases related to persons who <Col N="393" /> had been seen by a medical referee and who were considered to be likely to continue to be incapable for at least a further year.  Not every long duration case is referred for review each year.  Many persons were previously found to be permanently incapable but they refused an offer to be transferred to invalidity pension.</P>
    <P>The 6,350 direct application cases were examined and 4,790 cases were approved.  The combined total of approved direct applications and the persons invited to apply is 7,490.  Only 5,040 (or 67 per cent of 7,490 qualified cases) accepted the offer.  Thirty three per cent of these claimants did not accept the offer to go on to invalidity pension and chose to remain on disability benefit.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied from the level of direct applications that the public are generally aware of the invalidity pension scheme.</P>
    <P>As part of the normal controls in the administration of invalidity pensions, medical control is necessary to ensure that only persons who fulfil the necessary medical conditions are paid.  This control is exercised through medical referees to whom claimants are, from time to time, referred for examination for the purpose of obtaining independent second medical opinions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that there is a problem in relation to information about invalidity pensions which is evident from the length of time people may be on disability benefit? There is no mechanism for notifying people and he should arrange that application forms &mdash; not just information leaflets &mdash; should be available as is the case in relation to almost every other pension scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Information is widely available in all the relevant offices. Application forms are made available to people who seek them.  The Deputy should not be confused regarding the information and the application form. The reasoning in that case is that it is purely a medical referee decision as to <Col N="394" /> whether a person goes on to invalidity pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>They must apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>When people knew they could apply they had a medical examination and, if they were found suitable, they were asked to supply other details which are necessary in relation to a long-term pension.  That is the way the system operates.  I will certainly look at the question of making the application forms more widely available as there has been a conscious decision, because of the nature of the scheme, to operate in that way.  The Deputy must bear in mind that of the people entitled to receive an invalidity pension 33 per cent did not accept the offer and chose to remain on disability benefit.  Obviously, there could be a number of reasons for this, including taxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 10 and 69 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="395" /> The substantial increases in the rates of unemployment assistance and the extension of the means limits, which I announced in my budget speech, will benefit many farming families.</P>
    <P>Since 1987 I have substantially improved the position of smallholders and their families, and increased the longstanding lower rural rate of unemployment assistance to match the higher urban rate.  As a result a smallholder with a dependent spouse and three children who received £87.60 in June 1987 will receive £116 in July 1990.</P>
    <P>The social welfare legislation provides that the yearly value of any advantage accruing to a claimant from the use of property &mdash; other than property personally used and enjoyed by the claimant, such as a dwelling &mdash; is assessable as means.  In the case of farmers, the value of the yearly advantage is basically the income from the farm less any expenses actually and necessarily incurred in earning that income.  The normal basis of the calculation is the net income from the farm over the 12 months preceding the date of the investigation.</P>
    <P>The investigation of means of smallholder claimants is carried out by social welfare officers.  In the normal way, the officer's report is based on the claimant's income and outgoings in the previous year.  However, in making the assessment, due allowance is made for any unusual features in that year so that the level of means assessed reflects the situation in an average or normal year.</P>
    <P>For instance, where the claimant had an abnormally high income in the previous year from the sale of stock, the assessment would be adjusted to reflect his normal income from this source. Similarly, a large amount spent on something which does not occur every year, such as fencing, would be averaged out to reflect the smallholder's normal outgoing under that heading.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the prices for farm stock and farm commodities, and consequently farm incomes, will vary from year to year.  It is open to smallholders in receipt of unemployment assistance who <Col N="396" /> have suffered a reduction in farm income due to a fall in the price of agricultural produce, or the exceptional circumstances mentioned in the second question, to apply, in the normal manner, to have the means assessed against them reviewed so that full account can be taken of their changed circumstances. However, when a degree of normality was restored, these cases would generally be reviewed again so that the means assessment would reflect the normal situation.</P>
    <P>Any smallholder who, due to a fall in his income, now considers that he might be entitled to unemployment assistance should apply to his nearest local office.</P>
    <P>The system of assessment of the means of smallholder applicants is intended to be fair and equitable and to have the flexibility to cater adequately for cases where, for whatever reason, farm income is seriously reduced.  This is a matter which I keep under review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gave us figures for unemployment assistance which, of course, involve the top rate for a person with no income.  Does the Minister accept that there is a crisis in farm incomes and that farmers on small holdings are facing a level of poverty which &mdash; as has been said by agricultural commentators &mdash; has not been experienced in 20 years?  Does he feel that his invitation to those 13,000 people to apply individually is an adequate, efficient or practical response from his Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated at the outset that since 1987 I increased the income of smallholders exceptionally.  I am very conscious of this because I know that people on long-term unemployment assistance in deprived areas of cities were not getting as big an increase because the smallholder was on the rural rate and various other matters.  I have taken numerous steps to improve the position of the smallholder.  I said that the increase in the case of a family with three children was nearly £30 per week from that alone apart from other benefits of social welfare. Aggregate farm incomes increased <Col N="397" /> by 32.5 per cent in 1987 and by 26.8 per cent in 1988.  This is from information supplied by the national farm survey.  The projected increase for 1989 is 4.5 per cent.  Steps which I have taken have generally more than met the position although I accept that there can be cases where this is not so.  It is fairly widely known that if circumstances change people are entitled to come forward under the scheme.</P>

      <P>A special provision of £500,000 was made in the budget for projects aimed specifically at women.  Of this special allocation £150,000 is being made available to support the work of the rape crisis centres around the country.  The balance will be used to give grant-aid to self-help groups working with women in the local community.  They will be particularly directed towards the support of women in the home to assist in their personal development and involvement in the community.</P>
      <P>The detailed arrangements for allocating these funds are being finalised at present.  I expect to be in a position to make an announcement in this regard in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate that we did not elicit a lot of information from the Minister's reply.  Is it the Minister's intention to consult with the Combat Poverty Agency or the Council for the Status of Women on this matter?  Is it his intention to get their opinions as to how best the remaining £350,000 should be spent?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I should like to point out that as Minister for Social Welfare it is my responsibility to know where the problems exist.  I am conscious of where the problems exist and I work closely with those involved to overcome them.  We have been in contact with the Combat Poverty Agency and the Council for the Status of Women.  Indeed, we made contact with many organisations in regard to this matter.  It is open to people to come forward with ideas but I must emphasise that it is not intended that the money be taken up by organisations for use on administration.  The funds are intended to support women, particularly those in the home.  We want to help them improve their position.  We have proved in a number of projects how that can be done.  I do not want the idea to go abroad that the money can be used on administration or research.  I should like to point out that the Combat Poverty Agency introduced some useful projects. They have strong views as to what should be done with the money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that applications for grants will have to be made directly to his Department and that he will decide on them?  Is that an admission that the Government were wrong to abolish the section of the Department responsible for women's affairs which should be dispersing such funds?</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to the rape crisis centres and I should like to ask him if he took into account the submissions made to his Department by <Col N="399" /> those centres, particularly the one in Clonmel?  The people who run that centre do excellent work.  They have stressed to me that they are in great need of funds and that has been communicated to the Department.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that I am not happy that only £350,000 is available. <Col N="400" /> What will happen when the advertisements inviting submissions appear in the newspapers?  In my view, we will end up like we did with the community grant scheme, we will have so many applications that we will not have sufficient money to satisfy a portion of them.  If the Minister is serious about assisting those self-help groups he should make £350,000 available to the Council for the Status of Women and the Combat Poverty Agency for distribution.  They are aware of the women who are in need.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept what the Deputy has said about political interference. I represent the Members of the House as Minister for Social Welfare and it is my responsibility to discharge my duties as best as I can.  Members can question me on how I discharge my duties. The Deputy, who is a new Member, may not be familiar with the amount of questioning that is possible in the House.  Very often some of the best ideas come forward in the House.  It is not my intention to hand over any of the money for research or administration.  The money will go to community-related projects. I have encouraged the Combat Poverty Agency to carry out that type of work. They have a number of projects in hand that will qualify and I will communicate with them in regard to funding.  I should like to tell the House that I have a sum of money in a development fund and we are working in co-operation with the Combat Poverty Agency in regard to that fund.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>There are two agencies under the aegis of my Department: the Combat Poverty Agency and the National Pensions Board.</P>
      <P>The role of the Combat Poverty Agency is to advise me on all aspects of economic and social planning in relation to poverty in the State, to examine the nature, causes and extent of such poverty, to initiate measures aimed at overcoming poverty and to promote greater public understanding of poverty and the measures required to overcome it.</P>
      <P>The task of the National Pensions Board is to advise me on all aspects of occupational pension schemes and on the most suitable approach to a national pensions policy.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to privatise or commercialise either of these agencies or any of their activities.  I am sure the Labour Party would not want me to privatise the Combat Poverty Agency.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>if he will back-date the validation of the granting of an old age contributory pension to the date of the original claim made by a person (details supplied) in County Dublin.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned applied for old age contributory pension on 16 March 1987.  On 10 April 1987 his claim was rejected as he failed to satisfy the statutory condition which required him to have a yearly average of 20 contributions over a prescribed period.  The person concerned had a yearly average of 19 over the prescribed period from 1968 to 1986.</P>
      <P>He supplied new details of his history of employment to my Department on 29 July 1987.  Detailed investigations by my Department were necessitated by the fact that a number of employers were involved, one of which was in liquidation. Further insurance contributions were paid on 16 May 1988 by one of his previous employers.</P>
      <P>In June 1988, as a result of the additional contributions paid, a deciding officer awarded the person concerned an old age contributory pensions of £51.70 per week, with effect from 20 May 1988, the Friday following the date on which outstanding social insurance contributions were paid.  This is in accordance with legislative provisions which provide that for the purposes of any right to benefit, a contribution shall not be treated as having been paid on any date earlier than the date on which it is paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are provisions in the legislation governing the late payment of contributions which enable contributions to be treated as having been paid on the due date where it is shown that the failure to <Col N="403" /> make, or the delay in making, payment of contributions was not with the consent or connivance of or attributable to any negligence on the part of the insured person.</P>
    <P>These provisions were not applied in this case on the basis that the person concerned was deemed to have contributed to the non-payment of contributions in not presenting an insurance card to a number of employers between 1969 and 1978.</P>
    <P>The person concerned appealed this decision and the appeal was disallowed in April 1989 following an oral hearing.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that all inquiries in this case were necessary and conducted in a proper manner.  It was not possible to know at the outset which employers, if any, would pay arrears for a period which was statute barred so far as my Department is concerned.  The person concerned delayed a long time in reporting arrears spanning back 20 years.  In the circumstances, the appeals officer could see no justification for back-dating the period of entitlement.</P>
    <P>There is legislative provision whereby the person concerned may seek to recover from an employer the amount of lost benefit as a simple contract debt in the courts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  The problem here is that the individual in question has no opportunity of claiming against anybody because his previous employers are in liquidation.  There is the misunderstanding about the length of time it took to investigate the insurability of his employment with various employers from 1968-78; it was an administrative delay, in practical terms, because of the need to investigate in different areas.  The second point I should like to make is that the contribution eventually made, which brought up his contributions from 19 to 24, was actually paid by a director of a new company in respect of a company that had gone into liquidation some years previously.  I am appealing to the Minister, given the circumstances and the fact <Col N="404" /> that this individual is in dire circumstances and was depending on his money being paid to him from March 1987, to use his discretion to back date the payment to March 1987.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an individual case and I will not go into the details. Obviously, there were factors which the deciding officer and the appeals officer took into account which they regarded as very clear.  The Deputy has indicated a problem which arises when he said that a director of the new company paid for something just to say: &ldquo;Well, get that sorted out&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a very decent thing to do.  There is the danger in these areas &mdash; and it happens with reasonable frequency &mdash; that the contributions are not paid and subsequently when it is discovered or when it becomes a problem, the contributions are paid.  It is in that area that a major difficulty exists in the social welfare legislation.  Given what the Deputy has said, if he would like to give me the fresh evidence he mentioned, particularly in relation to the person's circumstances, I will have it looked at again.</P>

      <P>I do not want to go into detail but the Deputy should not make those suggestions.  The appeals officers are very genuine people who work under the legislation.  I have told the Deputy I am satisfied with the position they have taken within the law as it stands at present.  However, because of what the Deputy has said in relation to the circumstances of the cases, I am prepared to look at that another way.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>the reason he is unable to provide statistics on the number of senior citizens who would qualify for pro rata old age pensions if this provision were to be extended generally to those with contribution averages of between five and 19 as currently apply to only one group of pensions; the way in which any decision on the provisions may be made without basic information; and if he will undertake to supply that information urgently to Dáil Eireann, the National Pensions Board and the aggrieved pensioners.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the conditions for entitlement to an old age contributory pension requires an average of at least 20 contributions from the date of entry into <Col N="406" /> insurance to the end of the tax year before reaching pension age.</P>
      <P>Pension is not generally payable on contribution averages of less than 20.  The only exception is the special arrangement which I introduced in 1988 for persons whose contributions averages had been reduced by reason of the operation of the remuneration limit on social insurance for non-manual workers which applied up to 1974.</P>
      <P>To introduce <i>pro rata</i> pensions for all persons with contribution averages of less than 20 would have significant cost implications. The information previously requested by the Deputy concerned one particularly of these, namely persons with a mixture of full and modified insurance.  These would be mainly workers in the public sector who move from a fully insurable grade to one insured at the modified rate.  The estimates of the cost which the Deputy requested on that occasion are being compiled and will be conveyed to the Deputy when available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The particular group the Minister referred to are those on mixed insurance.  Would the Minister not accept that the particular group who are lobbying very extensively for an extention of similar pension arrangements for themselves had the additional difficulty over and above the group who have already been catered for, in that they had no option but to opt out of the insurance scheme whereas there was a choice available to those who have now been awarded this pension?  Does he not see the inevitability, in justice and fairness, of extending equal treatment to all pensioners with an equal contribution record?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a much more complex matter than that described by the Deputy.  First, the people who move within the public service move on to promotion and to an occupational pension and have an occupational pension as a result.  What has happened with the improvement in the pensions in social welfare&mdash;especially during the period I <Col N="407" /> was Minister&mdash;is that the person who is on a much smaller pension has an occupational pension combined with the social welfare pension and can be better off than the person who went into the management level.  It is a much more widespread problem and includes a large number of people who are on mixed insurance.  I was able to pick out that particular category which began and ended and to specify them clearly.  That is why I took that action at that time. These mixed insurances are tied up with the public service generally and also with the self-employed.  At my request, this question is being considered at present by the National Pensions Board, and I hope to have their report later this year. I will be happy to take any action I can in that regard.  The question of public service and social welfare pensions is being discussed at a much wider level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will be aware of the group of workers in CIE, who are a dying breed at this stage, and who have left work with as many as 19 contributions.  These workers feel bitter &mdash; I am sure the Minister understands the reason for this &mdash; that with 19 contributions they cannot qualify for an old age pension while other people who leave their employment with as little as five contributions are eligible to receive a quarter of the minimum pension.  I hope the Minister will give consideration to this serious problem.  These elderly people are at a pensionable age and have worked all their lives&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I met those people and I think they are very much aware of the nature of the problem and of my anxiety to have something done about it.  Anything I do in this regard will, as Deputy Flaherty said, have to result in equal treatment right across the board.  The problem is that mixed insurance is a much larger area with much wider implications. <Col N="408" /> If it was a matter of simply changing the rules for that small group it would not have posed any great problem for me in the first instance.  Incidentally, this seems to have been a problem for previous Governments but I will not go back into this.  I did what I could and the National Pensions Board are now trying to quantify that and delineate it for me so that even if we do not get into the issue of a wider public servant involvement in our schemes we will be able to define it and take action which will stand up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 32, 56 and 59 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Child related expenditure includes mainly spending on child benefit, child dependant increases and family income supplement.  Table A accompanying this reply, which I will make available to Deputies, given time series data on expenditure on child benefit and family income supplement since 1980.  The decline in expenditure on child benefit indicated in this table is due to the decline <Col N="412" /> in the number of children in recent years. Statistics are not kept in such a way as would allow similar data to be compiled for child dependant allowance expenditure. However, I can inform Deputies that expenditure on this area is estimated at £22 million this year.  Data on the family size of child benefit recipients are given in Table B accompanying this reply which I will also make available to Deputies.</P>
    <P>The estimated full year cost of increasing child benefit by 25 per cent and of paying an extra month's benefit, at present rates, would be some £50 million and £17 million respectively.  I am very much aware of the financial needs of families with children and I have made significant progress in recent years in increasing the level of social welfare payment to such families.</P>
    <P>Following on the achievements of last years' budget, improvements costing £216 million in a full year have been made in this year's budget.  These include an increase in the minimum child dependant payment from £10 to £11, the reduction in the number and range of child dependant payments, the payment of child dependant increases until age 20 to recipients of long-term payments where the child continues in full-time education, a 5 per cent increase in the rate of child benefit and the introduction of a clothing allowance for families on social welfare.  The tax exemption limits for low income families have been increased and a child related allowance of £300 per child has been included.  Improvements costing £1 million are being made to the family income supplement scheme.  Deputies will recall that one of the main improvements last year was the introduction of widower's and deserted husband's assistance scheme for men with children.</P>
    <P>The focus of recent budgets has been very much on the family, and I categorically refute any suggestion that this is not the case.  The following examples of increases show this to be true from this year's budget alone.  A couple with two children on long term UA will receive £105 per week, an increase of £8, while <Col N="413" /> a couple with four children will receive an increase of £10 bringing their payment to £127.  A couple with four children on short-term UA or supplementary welfare allowance will receive £120 per week, which is an increase of £11.10, while a couple with six children will get an increase of £13.10, and a total payment of £142.  A lone parent under 66 with three children on an assistance payment will receive an additional £5.20 per week, giving a total payment of £93.50.  A widow or deserted wife on a contributory payment with four children will receive a payment of £116 which is an increase of £5.10 per week.</P>
    <P>Since June 1987 we have increased the payments to a long-term unemployment assistance family with five children from £104.85 to £138.  The report of the Economic and Social Research Institute on <i>Poverty, Income and Welfare in Ireland</i> which was published in October 1989 contained much useful information in relation to the situation of families with children.  Arising from their report the Combat Poverty Agency have commissioned further work on this area which will be completed shortly.  These reports and the agency's conclusions in this area will be considered by my Department, and I will consider the need for further analyses in the light of these reports.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the House that the Government will, as resources permit, continue to improve the position of families and thereby build on our progress to date.  Such an approach is in line with our commitments under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which to date we have more than met in the social welfare area.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his detailed reply and the statistics he gave. Does the Minister not agree with us and agencies such as the Combat Poverty Agency that child care is of particular concern?  Many outside agencies have made submissions to the Minister on this issue.  Does the Minister not agree that the cost of maintaining a child is much higher than that provided in any of the social welfare schemes, up to £19 per week, for a four year old child and rising to £28 per week for a child over four years?  The best the Minister can do is <Col N="415" /> give £11 per week.  Child benefit in the budget was increased by 19p per week.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Deputy to use more up-to-date statistics.  The ones he is using are for the end of 1986 and the beginning of 1987.  Things have changed a lot since then, as the Deputy is aware. The Commission on Social Welfare recommended the introduction of an allowance of at least £10 per child.  We achieved this figure last year.  Instead of granting the usual percentage increase we managed to increase the figure by £1. Even though things have not been easy in recent years we have made much progress. I am very conscious of the need to do something.  One report indicated that it costs about £11.09 per week to adequately feed a child.  I appreciate that other costs have to be taken into account but we are making a substantial contribution and have improved the position. We must maintain a balance between the needs of those on social welfare and those at work.  I mentioned in relation to the family income supplement that we will be taking some further steps.  I hope to make improvements at the lower end in the light of the difficulties which have arisen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>All the major schemes and services in my Department have been computerised.  All claims and payments are currently processed with computer assistance, with the exception of some of my Department's local offices.</P>
      <P>The unemployment payment schemes are administered through a network of local offices and the installation of country-wide telecommunications network is a fundamental requirement for the computerisation of these payments.  A major project to provide such a network is underway.  At present some 100 offices of the Department around the country, including 36 employment exchanges, have been linked to the computer systems. It is planned to link up the remaining employment exchanges during the course of this year.  This will allow the progressive implementation of computerised systems at local offices, for example, unemployment payments processing system, and the local in-putting of medical certificates for disability benefits purposes.  It will also allow speedy access to claim and payment information on the Department's computerised information system and thus provide a better service to members of the public at local level.</P>
      <P>I am also considering extending the links which my Department already have with health boards and FÁS.  Linkages will also be provided to most, possibly all, locations where the public come into direct contact with social welfare officials around the country.  These developments will be completed by 1991 or early in 1992.</P>
      <P>This programme of computerisation will provide the framework for the development of services at a local level so that my plans for one-stop-shop facilities for clients can be fully implemented.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  In welcoming his plans for extending computerisation may I ask him if he would not agree that social <Col N="417" /> assistance payments merit serious attention in that there appears to be dupication between the Department of Social Welfare and the health board?  Can he tell us if he has any plans to increase the number of people working in the field and to extend computerisation to these payments?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Our assistance schemes have been computerised.  I think the Deputy is referring to the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is being operated by the health boards.  Currently, I am trying to improve the links which my Department already have with the health boards and FÁS which are not under my direct control, as the Deputy understands.  Rapid progress has been made over the past two or three years for the simple reason I have concentrated on this matter.  We are now in a position to discuss with people ways by which we can link up with them if they have the necessary computer facilities.  What the Deputy is looking for will be done in the not-too-distant future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reason we included those who are in receipt of assistance.  The Deputy is speaking about agencies over which I have no control. They are under the aegis of the Department of Health.  I am working on ways by which we can extend our links with them but if they do not have the necessary computer facilities we will not be able to link up with them.  At present they are developing these.  We are also trying to regularise and standardise the payments as much as possible so that there is no infringement on the supplementary welfare area.  One example would be the fuel scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>In his reply the Minister referred to a number of agencies with whom his Department are considering extending their links.  Are any efforts <Col N="418" /> being made to link up with the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners? Second, is the Minister aware that the extension of computerisation which allowed decentralisation to take place to such centres as Sligo has also led to substantial communication problems?  Can he tell us if he plans to ameliorate his problem by providing a free telephone service?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question. I think there is another question down on that matter today.  This system is working very efficiently and effectively. At present we are working with the Revenue Commissioners with regard to RSI numbers and this should prove productive.</P>

      <P>The information requested is given in a tabular statement which I will make available to the Deputy.  In 1980, social welfare Vote expenditure was 5.4 per cent of GNP and 7.5 per cent in 1989.  This expenditure broadly represents the Exchequer's contribution to total social welfare expenditure, which amounted to over 57 per cent of expenditure in 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Measuring the adequacy of social welfare expenditure in terms of percentages of GNP can be misleading.  The percentage may, for example, decline due to a fall in the numbers of unemployed which would be reflected in a fall in expenditure on unemployment payments. Changes in the financing of social welfare expenditure are also relevant in this context.  A significant change in the structure of social security financing <Col N="419" /> occurred in 1988 following the extension of social insurance to the self-employed in April 1988, which resulted in a reduction in the Exchequer contribution to overall expenditure offset by the additional income from contributions by the self-employed.</P>
    <P>Gross expenditure has increased in money terms each year, reflecting the significant improvements that have been made in social welfare payments, particularly in the last three budgets.  Over <Col N="420" /> the period of these budgets long-term unemployment payments will have increased in real terms by over 37 per cent, and short-term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance, which are the lowest rates of payment, by 32 per cent.  The real value of other payments have been maintained or increased.  These improvements more than meet the commitments given by the Government in the context of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>

      <P>As part of the 2nd EC Poverty Programme I arranged for a report on poverty to be prepared by the ESRI.  This report was based on a major survey carried out by the Institute and was funded jointly by the Institute, the Combat Poverty Agency and the EC. The report was published in October 1989 and a number of other reports have been made based on the survey's findings.</P>
      <P>Arising from that report the Combat Poverty Agency is funding a number of further research projects based on the ESRI survey covering child poverty, take-up of social welfare benefits and income sharing arrangements in households. It is expected that draft reports on the findings of some of these projects will be available this year.</P>
      <P>I will also be discussing with the agency its plans for further research in the poverty area in the context of the agency's strategic plan for the period 19901993.</P>

      <P>The vocational training opportunities scheme affords long term unemployed persons the opportunity to attend a full-time educational and training course leading to a certificate.  The scheme, which was piloted as the educational opportunities scheme by my Department is now administered by the Department of Education.  It is available in 13 centres with almost 200 participants and it is intended to progressively extend the number of centres throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The scheme is targeted at the long term unemployed.  Studies have shown that there is a link between lack of educational attainments and long term unemployment. There are no plans, at present, to extend the scheme to categories other than the long term unemployed. However, the Deputy may be interested to know that a recipient of disability benefit or invalidity pension may in certain circumstances be allowed to attend a course of education while continuing to receive his payment.</P>
      <P>My Department has approved attendance at third level courses and leaving certificate courses for some recipients. Each application from an incapacitated person is treated on its merits having regard to the individual circumstances of the recipient.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not excluding recipients of disability benefit from taking part in vocational training but they <Col N="422" /> must notify the Department in advance of taking up the course.  We would all accept that this type of training could be therapeutic and may assist the recipient of disability benefit to get back into the workforce.  It certainly would not be injurious to their health.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it is, of necessity, done on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis because a recipient of disability benefit could be somebody who is receiving the benefit temporarily and returning to work at some stage.  Long term disability benefit is a different question and in such circumstances maybe those arrangements could be made.  For example, permission has been granted for persons to participate in rehabilitation courses and approval has been given to some persons in respect of attendance at third level courses and courses leading to leaving certificate.  These would tend to be people on long term disability benefit and invalidity pensions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 37 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The law relating to means assessment requires that an applicant be assessed with the &ldquo;yearly value of any advantage <Col N="423" /> from the use of property&rdquo;.  Where the property is a farm, big or small, the &ldquo;yearly advantage&rdquo; is basically the gross income for the year less the cost of inputs and overheads.  In addition account is taken of farm produce consumed, but the sum assessed is usually small and well below market value.  Smallholders with access to own supply of turf or vegetables are considered to be in a somewhat better position than claimants living in urban areas and who have to buy these items at market value.  The legislation provides for the assessment of this advantage.  I am however, looking at the means testing arrangements generally to see what improvements can be made within the constraints of available resources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will probably agree that this home produce consumed goes back into the antiquities of time when the social welfare officer went out and counted the chickens and quantified the amount of eggs etc.  This, however, has no relevance to the present day and is an unfair form of discrimination against small farmers who may not have a vegetable patch.  Likewise, the criteria does not apply to a person in a town who may have a garden and be drawing unemployment assistance. The Minister states the amount as small, often from £100 to £300 a year in value.  It might appear large to the farmer&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Deputy.  I am anxious to help him if he will help me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to move rapidly in regard to means assessment and rub out this aspect because it is no longer relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that chickens are not counted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The eggs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The items covered are turf, milk, potatoes and other vegetables and <Col N="424" /> it is the yearly value of these that is taken into consideration.  The Deputy asked about the amount of assessment.  It is between £50 and £200.  It is a matter which I have under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that there is an inconsistency as to what constitutes home produce consumed? He refers to turf, milk and vegetables. Does the Minister not think it unfair that these products are taken into consideration in the assessment of smallholders but not in the case of a person who, for example, buys a wine making kit and makes wine for his own use or a person who produces honey for his own use?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that there are inequities.  I would remind Deputies that it has been in the legislation since time immemorial.  I am conscious of what the Deputies are saying but all of these things have financial consequences.  I will certainly look at the means testing generally to see what can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillCotter" hpid="Mr. Cotter Mr. Cotter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to a person's savings in the context of means tests, money in excess of £400 is reckoned to be valued as income to the person at a rate of 10 per cent.  Could the Minister indicate to the House where a poor person would get a return of 10 per cent on an investment at this stage and why is that figure taken into account?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That has been the basis of assessment for a long time and it is a separate question.  The question relates to produce.  These are very specific questions put down by rural Deputies who know exactly what they are talking about and are specifying exactly what is involved.  They want me to give some sort of commitment here and I have gone as far as I can by saying that I am sympathetic to them and that I am looking at this question.</P>
      <P>The other question is a more major one and perhaps we can discuss it on another day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="425" />
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's assurance that he is looking seriously at the possibility of eliminating this outmoded form of assessment which, after all, has been operated very arbitrarily by social welfare officers.  In some cases there is nothing put down in respect of home produce; in other cases it can be between £300 and £500.  I also welcome the Minister's assurance that he is looking at the whole question of assessment.  Is he doing this in the context of introducing a single assessment, because we have a situation whereby the Minister's officials can arrive at an income determination for an applicant for unemployment assistance of, say, £60 and in the same week a community welfare officer could come up with a completely different figure varying by as much as £30 or £40 in relation to medical card entitlement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am certainly considering simplifying the means test as far as possible. The difficulty that arises with some of these things is that special extras are allowed in certain cases.  For instance there are special allowances for the elderly in regard to savings that do not apply to people who are regarded as able-bodied and active etc.  There are some differences there.  The other aspect is the question of computerisation and linking of these things.  Once they are linked together one can then work a lot more on the same test.  I am trying to do as much of that as I can and I believe we will make a good deal of progress on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As already announced to the House, the Government have approved the setting up of a new separate <Col N="426" /> social welfare appeals office.  The necessary legislative changes are currently under consideration with a view to inclusion in the forthcoming Social Welfare Bill.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the administrative arrangements to set up the new office are proceeding.  These include the appointment of additional staff.  In this context, it will be necessary to review a number of aspects of the current appeals system, including the manner in which appeals are processed.  The problems of delays occurring at present in certain areas &mdash; for example, disability benefit appeals &mdash; will be addressed with a view to devising procedures for the new office which will minimise delays and inconvenience to claimants.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the number of medical referees serving at present is adequate.  I wish to assure the House that appeal cases are given priority by medical referees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that under the review he is now starting all letters and recommendations, particularly of medical specialists, for all claimants be taken as gospel?  In other words, where a specialist provides medical evidence in respect of a claimant's disability that should be taken on board as fact by the Minister and the practice of leaving people waiting until the proper specialist to investigate the claimant's case is available should cease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The specialist's report is one element in a decision and can be and often is an overriding one.  Sometimes it is not the overriding consideration because a specialist may say a person has a particular condition which may debar him from a particular kind of work, but not from other kinds of work.  All these things arise.  The Deputy is familiar with cases which come to his clinics and to his attention in that way.  Basically I agree with the Deputy that the specialist's report is a major element in any consideration of the ability of a person to work or of a disability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's previous statement about the appeals agency he has set up.  We welcome it on all sides of the House.  When using the new appeals procedure, will the Minister ensure that medical referees at local level use medical facilities to enable them to carry out a proper investigation in respect of medical appeals?  Arbitrary decisions are made with no recourse whatever to a medical examination except for sitting down in front of the applicant and making a medical decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is open to, and in many cases there is a report from, the GP which may be fairly clear to the medical referee and the case may not, therefore, need much further examination.  That is one situation in which decisions can be taken very quickly.  It is not always appreciated by the claimant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Particularly so, and one can understand the embarrassment that may arise for a GP in some cases, but that is the formal system and the way in which it works.  From time to time we try to improve matters any way we can.  We are conscious of the points made by Deputies in relation to this area.  I am also conscious of the point Deputy Ferris made about facilities and rooms for that purpose.  Where we have any new offices we are putting in very fine facilities, but there are areas where those facilities are not available.  I have the points made noted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make sure that when the new appeals agency are in place, instead of interviewing people on medical grounds in bedrooms of hotels and otherwise, outpatient clinics in hospitals which are idle now will be used. There are facilities there for proper medical examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that some of the cursory examinations done by his medical referees are insulting to the claimant?  For example, will he agree that somebody wearing a medical corset being asked to touch his or her toes is outrageous and should not be tolerated? Will he agree that the medical referees should be trained in their approach to claimants that in many cases they are arrogant, suspicious and unsympathetic and that they would best serve his Department's public image by being given a training course in human relations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I must reject the general statement the Deputy made about them being insulting, arrogant or otherwise. Generally speaking, they carry out the job, which is not easy, on behalf of the people and under the legislation passed by this House.  It is never easy to tell somebody that it is time for him to go back to work or that he is fit.  I have a very bad back and I carry on.  People come to me saying they have a bit of bother with their back, that they have not been working for so many years and that they will never work again.  If you get that into your mind you probably never will work again.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Somebody has to make the decision at the end of the day &mdash; we discussed this before Deputy Bruton came in &mdash; whether the person is available for lighter work or if there are other kinds of work <Col N="429" /> he can do, but not to say he is not available for any kind of work.  Someone has to make that decision and we entrust that to the medical referees.  They are qualified people, some with higher qualifications than others.  I said earlier that I would arrange for the medical referees to participate in the courses we have on dealing with the public and on relations with the public generally.  That was raised by another Deputy earlier and we discussed it and I said I would do that. Arrangements are in train.

We can all remember the Minister's Budget Statement last year when he said the mortgage interest rates would be down quite substantially. The headings in all this evening's papers are to the effect that interest rates have increased by another 1 per cent.  Since last year's budget, therefore, the increase in interest rates has been of the magnitude of 5 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State also talked about unemployment figures in County Louth. I cannot say I am an expert on what is happening in County Louth, but the figures he gave for 1987 and 1989 are interesting.  Unemployment figures decreased by 1,000, but I did not hear the Minister mention anything about <Col N="499" /> emigration, which is the main reason for the drop in unemployment in County Louth.  Most of the young people in the constituency are not finding work there but in London, New York and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The budget was a non-event as far as most people were concerned.  It had a little bit for everyone.  The Government and the Minister for Finance had a great opportunity which they did not take. They could have used a Fianna Fáil slogan, &ldquo;The Way Forward&rdquo;.  The opportunity for that sort of declaration was immense.  Unfortunately, the Minister decided to play safe and introduce a very static budget with no great vision.  It was very unlike his recent speech in Kanturk, the Kanturk Declaration, where his vision for the next couple of years seemed very far-reaching, in line with his other aspirations which have nothing to do with the financial position.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to be negative about the budget.  There are some positive points, like the increase in weekly welfare payments, concern for the welfare of emigrants abroad, the new carer's allowance, the expansion of the social employment scheme, the increase in third level intake and changes in indirect taxation, VAT and excise duties.  I will deal more specifically with these points later.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his budget speech made no reference to interest rates, which affect the vast majority of our population.  This budget is linked very much to current interest rates.  Unfortunately events in Eastern Europe have not been taken into consideration and I foresee an increase in interest rates in the next few months.  An increase has already taken place today, regardless of events in Eastern Europe.  German economic union is being pursued at a great pace and when eventually the East German mark is withdrawn and the Deutsche Mark is the currency for both Germanys, that will have a great effect on the EMS, which will result in increased interest rates.  Not only will housebuyers, farmers and business people suffer but the general thrust of this budget will be greatly affected.  Our still very high <Col N="500" /> national debt will be increased, putting a great strain on the economy.</P>
    <P>We need buoyancy in the market place and a return to full mortgage interest relief would have helped enormously. The housing market was booming this time last year and in his 1988 budget speech the Minister stated that interest rates would not increase; in fact, there has been an increase of five percentage points during the past 12 months.  The cost of an average mortgage has increased by £100 per month, which is very tough for a young couple or anyone who is finding it difficult to make ends meet.  If such increases occur again this year the effect will be disastrous.  The buoyancy which has been experienced in the market place during the past 12 or 18 months has disappeared and the market is now static.</P>
    <P>It was with some amazement that I listened to the Minister's shoddy reference to agriculture.  We are all aware of the importance of agriculture in our economy.  It is still the backbone of rural areas and when the agriculture sector is going well all the service industries in rural Ireland experience growth.  Every Deputy would agree with this.  It is amazing that the Minister devoted about three lines of his budget speech to the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>During the last election campaign Fianna Fáil promised that the income limit for headage payments would be abolished and that extra areas would be included in the disadvantaged areas scheme.  This has not happened as yet. The Minister of State, Deputy Kirk, stated that it would happen soon.  As a first time Deputy I am beginning to realise that &ldquo;soon&rdquo; can mean anything.  I always thought it would be a matter of days or weeks but in this context it could be years.  I hope I am incorrect and that &ldquo;soon&rdquo; will be before Easter.</P>
    <P>I come from a constituency which is already included in the disadvantaged areas.  People outside these areas think that all their Christmases will come together if their areas are included in the scheme, but many anomalies exist.  The income limit for headage payments is having a harsh effect on a number of <Col N="501" /> farmers, and I appeal to the Government to fulfil their election promise.  Double headage payments were also promised but this has not been implemented. Farmers in the disadvantaged areas are certainly entitled to double headage payments and there would be no great cost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Problems have been experienced because of the undue delay in the payment of headage grants.  For the first time since the scheme was introduced payments were made before Christmas but they amounted to only 70 per cent of the amount due and farmers are still awaiting the balance.  These payments relate to 1988 and they have not yet started to receive the 1989 payments.  It is ludicrous that payments are almost two years behind.</P>
    <P>I am glad to hear that the Minister for Agriculture and Food is recuperating well and I hope that he will be back in the House in the near future in good health. In his absence, I call on the Government to make the outstanding payments within the next couple of weeks.</P>
    <P>The inordinate delay in the payment of reactor grants is also causing much hardship in my area and elsewhere. People whose herds have been locked up have to wait between six and ten months for reactor grants.  This can only be described as disgraceful.  If these people are full-time farmers they have no other income and they and their families are put in a very difficult financial position. There is no excuse for such a long delay and I call on the Government to rectify this problem as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I do not want to deal at length with the health problems; they were dealt with quite adequately in the Dáil over the last couple of weeks.  All of us have listened to the various health problems regarding the waiting lists for hip replacements, eye tests, the dental service, angiograms and such matters.  I am in the presence of an Independent Deputy for Roscommon and unfortunately all constituencies cannot have somebody of the calibre of Deputy Foxe who can get extra money for health facilities.  I would call <Col N="502" /> on the Minister to immediately review the health service.  If he can sort out the problems in Roscommon I see no reason why he cannot sort them out in the rest of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Social Welfare is another area in which there are a lot of anomalies.  There was no mention in the budget speech of any measure to correct these anomalies.  As I said at the outset of my speech, I welcome the increase in the carer's allowance; it is very worthwhile.  An anomaly which exists, especially in rural Ireland, is that people who are entitled to a carer's allowance find it very difficult to be accepted by the Department of Social Welfare. Many Deputies are aware of the position whereby elderly people who are living at home &mdash; maybe a husband and wife &mdash; in a small farmhouse need full-time care and attention but fortunately due to the fact that they have some property in their name, anyone looking after them is not entitled to a carer's allowance.  This is an anomaly which should be corrected. The problem does not arise in urban areas but it certainly arises in rural Ireland and is victimising the rural community.</P>
    <P>Another problem arises in regard to people on unemployment assistance. They are assessed by the Department of Social Welfare and the assessment takes into consideration the price of cattle in 1987-88 which was very high at that time. We are all quite aware of the drop in cattle prices over the last 12 to 18 months. It is totally unfair to assess people on the basis of a price for cattle which they are not receiving.  The experience in my constituency is that many people who are genuinely entitled to unemployment assistance have been cut off because the Department of Social Welfare have not, in line with the decrease in cattle prices, decreased the level for assessment.  This is very unfair and is something which the Minister for Social Welfare should consider.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with the problem of local authority housing.  I will take my constituency of Sligo-Leitrim as an example.  In County Leitrim in 1989, 28 house building projects were started and in 1990, 12 are being started, a decrease <Col N="503" /> of 16.  This does not seem a very large figure, but, a survey carried out by our local authority revealed that 337 people were in need of housing, 219 of whom were in need of acute housing accommodation. I must admire Leitrim County Council on the responsible approach they have taken to this matter.  They have sent an application to the Department of the Environment for 52 housing units for this year: 18 rural houses, two family-type houses and 32 OPDs.  I do not see great scope for the Minister for the Environment to provide for this amount of housing for County Leitrim because the housing allocation has not been increased dramatically.  Unfortunately, I would envisage a decline in the number of houses to be built.  In the long term this will cause unnecessary hassle and hardship for many people who cannot get local authority housing.</P>
    <P>Last year in the Sligo Corporation area six houses were built.  Since 1987 Sligo Corporation have been awaiting sanction from the Department of the Environment for a 100-house scheme for Magheraboy, phase 2.  There is a big problem in this area.  In 1988 and 1989 Sligo County Council built 24 houses and in 1990 they hope to build 16 family-type houses and ten rural houses, a total of 26 houses.  As only 24 houses were built in the last two years, obviously, as far as the Department of the Environment are concerned, to build 26 in one year would be a dramatic increase.  As I stated previously, there will be a major housing difficulty throughout Ireland in the not too distant future if we do not tackle the problem now.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with tourism.  The Minister, in his budget speech, stated that he was &ldquo;increasing the provision for Bord Fáilte promotional activities by £2 million, conditional on matching funds from the industry&rdquo;.  I am not sure if the Minister is aware &mdash; and I would like to make him so aware &mdash; of a recent report about Bord Fáilte and their recent promotional tour of the USA.  The chairman of Bord Fáilte stated that the promotional tour was tough work and that they were up <Col N="504" /> against enormous competition, with 42 other countries also promoting tourism in their countries for the US market. Unfortunately, due to the large size of the USA, Bord Fáilte found that their promotional tour lacked the necessary amount of money needed in order to carry out proper promotional policy.</P>
    <P>With the withdrawal of Pan Am from Shannon, as I have stated in the House before, there will be a reduction of 45,000 seats coming into the country next year. It is not good enough to take up the slack; we need to increase that number.  The Government's projected growth in tourism from the US market is 100,000 for this year.  Taking into account the promotional difficulties and the withdrawal of Pan Am from Shannon, at this early stage of the year &mdash; and I do not want to be pessimistic &mdash; it seems to be very difficult&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is very difficult to see how the target of an extra 100,000 tourists from the USA will be reached. Another anomaly that is very much in evidence in the tourist industry is that there is no incentive for small family-run hotels to get grant aid.  At present hotels with 45 bedrooms or more are entitled to grant aid from Bord Fáilte for accommodation and leisure facilities, while hotels with fewer are not entitled to grant aid.  This goes against the grain if we are trying to promote the tourist industry. We are promoting Ireland as &ldquo;Ireland of the Welcomes&rdquo; and we assure people that they will get a homely and personal welcome in a small family hotel.  However, it is difficult to maintain small family hotels in business without providing grant <Col N="505" /> aid for accommodation and leisure facilities. The Minister for Tourism and Transport is well aware of the problem.  The small business tourist industry is being victimised.  We should remember that the tourist industry is very labour orientated. This victimisation should be eliminated rapidly.</P>
      <P>I welcome the reduction in excise duty on electrical goods.  However, there is a problem, especially in the Border areas, where people may have a lot of stock on hands which they will not now be able to sell at an economic price seeing that they will not be able to reclaim the old excise rate which they have already paid.  Perhaps the Minister can do something to alleviate the problems in this area.</P>
      <P>I welcome the expansion of the social employment scheme, which has been of great benefit in my constituency and throughout the country.  To be eligible for the social employment scheme one must be unemployed for 12 months or be aged 25 years or over.  Would the Minister consider reducing the age limit to 19, for instance?  There are not many 25 year olds left in the country at this stage, but people aged from 19 to 25 are in a vacuum.  Although they could have been long term unemployed, they cannot get on to this scheme.  That is a great pity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget has done nothing to create employment and it has not given any incentive to people to look for work.  We have not taken the radical options that were open to us.  One of the major disincentives to employers employing more people is the cost of employing people. Until we tackle that problem we will not tackle unemployment.  Neither is there any incentive for our emigrants to return. My county has been devastated by emigration and I see nothing in the budget to encourage young people working in London, New York or Australia to come home and make a go of it here.  Unemployment and emigration are the two plagues that have devastated rural Ireland and are now hitting urban areas.  Unemployment was always a problem in urban areas, but emigration is fast becoming as serious a problem.  The Minister for Finance missed a great opportunity to <Col N="506" /> introduce a radical budget to develop the future of our country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the difficulties of Members of the Opposition and I congratulate Deputy Reynolds for his more positive approach and recognition of many of the positive things in the budget.  The Deputy's colleagues, particularly former Ministers, were very negative and lukewarm about the budget. These were the only people who were really dissatisfied with the budget.  I am glad that Deputy Reynolds at least recognised that there were many good things in the budget and acknowledged the achievements that have been made over the last three years.  These achievements were significant considering the situation we inherited from the Fine Gael/Labour coalition.  Before we came to office, the people were very despondent about their future.  Deputies mentioned emigration, interest rates, unemployment and so on. The legacy of the eighties, during which the Opposition parties were in Government most of the time, underlines the disadvantages we suffered as a result of Government policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget was one of the best and wisest budgets in 20 years.  It is a tribute to the Minister and the Government that they achieved a sound balance between economic development and the needs of the less well off in society.  It is widely accepted outside of this House that this is a good budget despite the concern expressed by Opposition Deputies.  The budget is good for social welfare recipients. There have been significant real increases for a wide range of beneficiaries. The budget has also been good for people at work.  People earning less than £60 per week are now exempt from PRSI while retaining full social welfare entitlements.  Workers on low pay with families can benefit from the increased child related tax exemption schemes or from improvements in the FIS.  Workers earning higher levels of pay will benefit from the reduction in the tax rates from 32 per cent to 30 per cent and from 56 per cent to 53 per cent.  The reduction in tax liability will benefit single workers <Col N="507" /> who we are frequently told would otherwise emigrate to countries with more favourable tax regimes.</P>
    <P>Reading the newspapers prior to the budget one got the impression that commentators were trying to outdo each other in raising expectations in advance of the budget.  This is in marked contrast to what prevailed through most of the eighties when the talk was about increasing taxation.  There was a succession of commentators competing with each other to give ever higher estimates of how much the Government could afford to give away.  Many of these commentators seemed to have forgotten that the poor economic conditions we experienced through most of the eighties were caused by excessive budget deficits and by borrowings to meet current expenditure. This approach is again being advocated by various commentators and pressure groups but we cannot afford to return to the policies of the mid-eighties.  It is clear that Fianna Fáil's policies in Government over the last three years have proved to be successful.  The central element of their strategy has been the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which, generally, has been a success, providing much needed stability to the economy, keeping inflation down, contributing to job creation, tax reduction and special increases in social welfare.  All these things will prevent a return to the free for all in industrial relations a few years ago.  All those who participate in the programme must be congratulated for their positive approach.</P>
    <P>There were 41 strikes last year and only two were concerned with basic pay increases.  The number of days lost was 41,400 which, with the exception of 1944, was the lowest ever.  The programme played a major part in contributing to a growth of 3.5 per cent in the economy over the last two years and an expected growth of 4 per cent in 1990.  The targets set in the programme for job creation have been achieved.  Private sector employment is now estimated to have grown, providing between 30,000 and 40,000 jobs over the last two years.  This <Col N="508" /> was partly offset by declining numbers in the public sector as part of the Government's necessary reduction in numbers there.  There has also been a very welcome reduction in the number of job losses.  The number of notifiable redundancies was 13,400, half that experienced in 1984.</P>
    <P>All this progress further underlines the achievements we have made in co-operation with our social partners.  We have all benefited from the provisions of the programme and workers have received a real increase in take-home pay.  This budget continues the process begun last year by Fianna Fáil of reducing personal taxation.  I should like to refer to media reports that Deputy Dukes is insisting on a commitment to low taxation as his price for participating in an all-party committee on the financing of local government. I call on Deputy Dukes to end this charade of concern for taxpayers.  He should stop trying to hold the Government to ransom by setting out pre-conditions for the outcome of the deliberations on the whole area of local government reform and funding.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes also seems to have discovered a new found concern for taxpayers but this is very much out of character with his record in Government. As Minister for Finance in the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government in the mid-eighties he presided over a period of unprecedented increases in taxation.  This was achieved during a period when that Government, who were elected on a platform of fiscal rectitude, let the public finances go completely out of control.  I remember hearing Deputy Dukes being very complimentary to himself because he has been the longest serving Minister for Finance in recent times.  Let us look back at his record.  The national debt doubled to £25 billion, the debt GNP ratio increased from 94 per cent to 130 per cent; borrowings reached £2,145 million in 1986, or 13 per cent of GNP, its highest ever.  The budget deficit reached a record of 8.5 per cent while interest rates went to a high level; unemployment grew from 170,000 to 254,000 while the numbers at work fell by 60,000.  The <Col N="509" /> economy stagnated, the 25 per cent tax rate was abolished and the top rate raised to 65 per cent.  VAT was increased to 35 per cent and there were no special increases above inflation for social welfare recipients.  In the context of Mr. Duke's performance in Government his claims of concern for the taxpayer now ring very hollow.  He should put aside this pretence and join an all-party committee to consider the situation.  Our Programme for Government provides for the establishment of a select committee of the Oireachtas to examine and report on the whole question of local authority funding, structure and function.</P>
    <P>As a member of Cork Corporation I consider it essential to undertake an examination and set local government on a firm footing.  In the past Fine Gael were committed to reform of the Oireachtas and to provide structures whereby Members of the Dáil can make a positive contribution to the management of the affairs of the State.  They are given an ideal opportunity here to participate in a committee which will review the whole area of local government.  I call on Deputy Dukes and the Fine Gael Party to participate in this review in which they can express their views and work towards an agreed approach instead of trying to pre-empt the views of parties in the Dáil. Deputy Duke's colleagues in Cork Corporation &mdash; particularly one of them &mdash; wrote a full page article in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> outlining the need for urgent Government reform and calling on the Members of the Oireachtas to get on with the job of bringing in necessary legislation so that local government would continue and perform as it should on behalf of the people.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are committed to reducing taxation and increasing the numbers at work.  In contrast with the last Fine Gael-Labour Coalition, Fianna Fáil have stabilised the national debt, reduced the debt-GNP ratio and reduced the budget deficit to about 2 per cent &mdash; or £449 million &mdash; the lowest for 40 years.  They reduced the standard rate of tax from 35 per cent to 30 per cent in two years, reduced VAT from 25 per cent to 23 per <Col N="510" /> cent and provided a substantial increase for a wide range of social welfare recipients, especially the long-term unemployed. We have not heard about any of these measures from the Opposition.</P>
    <P>The reduction of VAT will affect a wide range of goods through its reduction of 2 per cent.  Every item which a householder uses will benefit from the decrease.  These include electrical, non-electrical, household, non-durable and consumer goods, goods for personal use and sports and recreational equipment which is very important as many people have been calling for the removal of VAT from hurleys, tennis racquets, fishing equipment, cameras and many other items.  Educational goods such as copybooks, drawing paper, notebooks and pencils will also benefit from the reduction in VAT.  The same applies to building materials, marine and medical goods, farm machinery and office equipment. People may not want to hear that but it is the reality of the budget.  It will affect everybody and will certainly help employment throughout the community.</P>
    <P>A central objective of Government policy over the last three years has been to create conditions for sustained economic growth.  The growth rate, which was stagnant in the period 1980-86, was 1.6 per cent of GNP in 1988.  It reached 3.25 per cent in 1989 and it is estimated that it will reach 3.75 per cent in 1990.  This is clear evidence of the success of Government policy.  Despite the strict financial pressures on the Government since 1987 they have strongly committed themselves to eliminating poverty and improving the position of the less well off in society.</P>
    <P>The 1988 and 1989 budgets saw the position of all social welfare recipients maintained with special increases for those on the lowest payments.  Unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance beneficiaries received increases in real terms of some 20 per cent over the last two years.  The budget takes that progress a big step forward. Apart from more than maintaining the position of all those in receipt of social welfare benefits with a 5 per cent increase, it introduced a wide range of <Col N="511" /> special increases.  They include an 11 per cent increase for the long term unemployed, an increase of up to 15 per cent for adult dependants with a new minimum payment of £13.  There has been an increase of more than 10 per cent for people on disabled person's maintenance allowance and more than 8 per cent, to a minimum of £53, for widows and other lone parents.</P>
    <P>I am pleased with the introduction of the new schemes and the extension of existing ones announced in the budget. The introduction of a new clothing allowance will help social welfare recipients to provide for their children's schools and winter clothing.  A total of £3 million has been provided for this purpose.  The scheme will come into operation in the autumn and, while the details have not yet been announced, it is my hope that it will provide for a fixed payment as a right rather than leaving it as a discretionary payment.  It is important that those arrangements are in place as soon as possible. That should be done so that payment can be made in August, before the children return to school.  I make the same suggestion in regard to the footwear scheme under which payments can be delayed until as late as November.  Then it is too late for those who incur heavy costs with their children returning to school and it is too early for expenditure on food for Christmas.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister for Social Welfare on listening to the views of his backbenchers and managing to convince his colleagues in Government of the need to deal with these problems.  We are all aware of the problems poor families must contend with when their children are returning to school after the summer holidays.  They are unable to meet the cost of school books, clothing and footwear.  This is the first time a Government have recognised the importance of giving direct financial assistance to parents at a time when they have to face heavy costs.  It is important that this should come in the form of a fixed payment.  Many of us have seen <Col N="512" /> queues of people at local community welfare offices applying for those benefits.  It should not be necessary to do that and it is my hope that the Minister will accede to my request for a fixed payment.  From past experiences I am confident that the Minister will ensure that the scheme is streamlined to the benefit of those people.  They have many problems to face at that time of the year.</P>
    <P>A lot has been said by some of the poverty lobby about the failure of the Government to implement the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.  The only specific reference made in this context was about the minimum payment, said to be £60 for a single person and £96 for a married couple.  It appears that the substantial progress that has been made by Fianna Fáil in phasing in a wide range of recommendations in that report is being ignored.  The first thing to note is that arising out of the budget all long term social welfare payments will be brought up to the interim priority rate set by the commission.  At the time of the recommendation the rate was £45 and that is £53 in present day terms.  The rate for an old age pensioner ranges from £53 to £65.50 for a contributory pensioner over 80 years of age. Long term unemployment assistance is being increased to £52, an increase of £15.20 from £36.80, which was the rate in June 1988.  That represents a substantial increase and it will be of direct benefit to the long term unemployed.  Widows, widowers and other lone parents receive from £53 to £60 for a contributory widow over 80 years of age.</P>
    <P>Among the recommendations implemented are: the establishment of an independent appeals office; the extension of PRSI to the self-employed; a rationalisation of and an increase in the child dependant allowance and an extension of the free fuel scheme to the long term unemployed.  The commission considered that, due to the cost of implementing those recommendations, there were four areas that warranted priority attention.  They suggested a significant step to bring the minimum payments <Col N="513" /> within reach of the recommended allowance. That has been done in the budget. They recommended improved child income support, and that has been done in the budget with the lowest payment now at £11 and the number of rates reduced from 36 to 16.  We are all aware that with 36 rates the officials had to spend a lot of time calculating allowances. The decision in the budget will remove a major obstacle to streamlining the system.  I welcome that move.</P>
    <P>The commission also recommended a broadening of the social insurance base, and that has been done.  They recommended that the self-employed should pay £60 million in PRSI this year.  Those moves introduce greater equity in the financing of social welfare and benefit the self-employed and their families.  With regard to the delivery of services, major progress has been made.  Almost £4.7 million has been spent on the provision of six new buildings and the refurbishment of a further six buildings in the last two years.  This year a further £4.1 million is being provided to speed up that programme.  Members have had complaints from people about the conditions at employment exchanges.  It is bad enough that they have to go to those buildings to collect their benefits but it is wrong that they should have to tolerate the poor conditions that exist in them. They are unacceptable in this day and age.  I am pleased that the Minister has tackled this problem and that the Government have provided the necessary finance to improve many of the buildings.  I should like to pay tribute to the Minister for sanctioning the building of a new employment exchange in Cork. It will provide services for the unemployed and a wide range of other facilities. The Minister has given it an appropriate title, a one stop shop.</P>
    <P>While major progress is being made in the creation of conditions for economic growth leading to increased employment, we continue to face the problem of having 220,000 people in receipt of unemployment benefit.  We should ensure that the resources of the State are directed <Col N="514" /> towards helping the unemployed, particularly the long term unemployed.  I should like to pay tribute to FÁS who are doing a tremendous job and to the Minister for Labour, Deputy Ahern, who had streamlined that service by bringing AnCO, YEA and National Manpower under one organisation.  That move was a breath of fresh air and the new organisation is doing great work.  However, like Deputy Reynolds, I should like to appeal to the Minister to look at the terms of reference of FÁS.  There is no doubt that the over 25s have a problem.  Many people under that age are in a position to avail of schemes that older people cannot.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the serious problem that has occurred near my home since the Sunbeam plant was put into receivership.  I am very concerned about the future for that industry which employs 475 people.  It is unfortunate that it was external problems that led to the factory being put into receivership.  It is acknowledged by the local people, the receiver, the IDA, the management of the factory and the unions representing the workers, that the workers have adopted a very responsible attitude since the receiver was appointed.  I should like to ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce and Finance and those with an interest in Cork city to do everything possible to make the resources of the State available to protect that industry. There is no doubt that there is a future for the industry.  It overcame the difficulties it faced in the past and the workers have shown what they are capable of.  If one walked through that factory today one would not find any evidence that there is a threat to the jobs of the staff.  I appeal to the Government to leave no stone unturned in their efforts to protect the jobs of those people.  There are enough unemployment problems on the north side of Cork and if anything were to happen to Sunbeam Wolsey it would have devastating effects.  I am making a strong appeal to the Minister to convey to his colleagues this serious situation.</P>
    <P>In common with many other Members <Col N="515" /> of this House I have had long involvement with various community and self-help groups in Cork.  Local people are in a special position to identify the needs of their community, to take action to meet deficiencies and to develop and improve themselves for the benefit of the whole community.  Because of this I was very pleased with the announcement in the budget that moneys are being provided to assist local community development initiatives.  This is particularly so in the case of the north side of Cork.  The project submitted to the EC for European funding under the poverty project failed to secure that funding.  The Government have, however, decided to step in and provide co-funding.  This Cork project was submitted by the Knocknaheeny support group and the Mayfield enterprise group.  It seems to cover the whole of the north side of Cork including Farranree, Churchfield, the Glen and Gurranabraher.</P>
    <P>I had sought a meeting with the Minister for Social Welfare to discuss how this money will be used and to press for the largest possible allocation for Cork. The north side has been particularly hit in recent years and needs to see a commitment to developing community based projects.  This will provide a vital resource for a wide range of activities, with projects for the elderly, young families, the unemployed, single parents and other groups in need of help and support. Allied to this initiative is a special allocation for programmes for women.  I would like to see the Minister give special consideration to the requirements of family resource centres.  We have a number of such centres in Cork which provide essential services to the women of the area.  Unfortunately, there is no regular or adequate source of funding to cover the cost of the excellent services they provide.  I will be pressing to get funding for these five family centres, because having worked with them I realise &mdash; and it is well recognised in the community today &mdash; that we need local people to use their initiative; they are closest to the problem.  I will be calling <Col N="516" /> for full financial support for the family resource centres in the areas in Cork to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>There have been wide-ranging and strongly articulated views to the effect that the public finances have been rectified at the expense of those on social welfare.  There are equally strongly held views that this is not the case.  There have, of course, been some reductions in a proportion of expenditure on certain services. However, expenditure is now being increased.  In education additional money has been allocated to meet the needs of schools in disadvantaged areas, an extra £120 million has been allocated to the health services as compared with the Estimate for 1989, a reduction in the net amount required from the taxpayer for social welfare hides the increases in PRSI income from the self-employed and the increased numbers at work as well as the reduction in the number unemployed.</P>
    <P>A National Economic and Social Council report published in 1988 found that real income from work fell between 1980 and 1987.  During the same time the real value of social welfare payments increased, due mainly to the large increases given by Fianna Fáil Governments in 1980-81 and 1982.  Since 1987 payments to those on lower social welfare payments &mdash; the long term unemployed &mdash; have been increased by over 25 per cent with other real increases for recipients. The position of workers, especially those on low pay, has improved in real terms, but not to the same extent as for people on social welfare.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have always cared for people in need and continue to do so. This budget is clear evidence of that concern. Deputy Noonan, Fine Gael spokesman, was critical that this budget did not do enough for the poor.  He was a member of the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government which simply kept payments in line with inflation.  He showed no initiative in making any special provision for social welfare recipients, something which Fianna Fáil have consistently done in the last three budgets.  Likewise, Deputy Spring, Leader of the Labour Party, was critical of the budget for not <Col N="517" /> creating additional jobs.  Having listened to some of Deputy Spring's contribution here today, I was amused, because people who were in a position to do so at a particular time, when things were very difficult, made no effort.  They did not think of the poor; they did not think of the problems of the people; they did not think of the unemployed or anybody else. They thought only of themselves.  They stayed in power as long as they could, but certainly they did not think of the people out there which we have certainly done in the last three years.  Deputy Spring would need to look into his own conscience and be a little more honest about his approach in knocking this budget.</P>

      <P>I would like to refer to one or two other points.  I am delighted the Minister has recognised the need of the mentally handicapped by providing additional money.  In relation to the dental services, which are so vital in my area, there are major problems with orthodontic treatment being needed by many.  I should like to refer to my own constituency of Cork because some of my colleagues have been very negative.  One would think there was a competition in the local press between Opposition Deputies to see who gets most publicity. The provision this year by the Government of money for the Cork-Swansea ferry is widely welcomed by the local people, yet all we get is a negative response from the Opposition.  They never give credit for anything.  This is a very positive move.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development which is taking place at Cork Airport is unprecedented and certainly the future is looking bright for the region.  No doubt there are problems with which we have to contend and we are tackling them.  I appeal to my Opposition colleagues on behalf of the people, if not on their own behalf, to be a little more responsible in representing the people of Cork, because if we do not do it together we certainly will not do it at all.  I congratulate the Minister and his colleagues <Col N="518" /> in Government for the budget they have brought in which benefits the whole community both economically and socially.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear to me that Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have been in a state of false euphoria since the budget.  I would like to remind them that it was the Government led by Deputy Garret FitzGerald that laid the foundations for our economic recovery.  It is not too long ago that the exemplary attitude of Fine Gael contrasted very much with the irresponsible attitude of Fianna Fáil, who called us, at the time, monetarists, Thatcherites, bookkeepers, etc.  It was Deputy Dukes, the Leader of Fine Gael, who launched us on the Tallaght strategy which guaranteed political stability as long as Fianna Fáil pursued the correct economic strategy for this country.</P>
      <P>I often wonder what would have happened since 1987 if Fianna Fáil had the clear-cut overall majority which they had in the past.  Would they have displayed the same economic prudence?  However, I suppose one should give them a little credit for their belated Lazarus conversion to politics even if it was under duress by both Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.  However, I would like to address a few points in the remainder of my speech to highlight many of the inadequacies of the budget and the areas which need to be redressed.  I would like to dwell on a few points in relation to agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The area of agriculture is under siege. It is regarded as being a primary activity in this country and rightly so.  Speaking at this stage about the disadvantaged areas sounds almost like a long-playing record because the saga has gone on since 1987 and we are still waiting for this famous submission to the European Commission. In relation to the activity in this area of disadvantage, it has often been stated by Fianna Fáil that they are pursuing the largest revision ever of over four million acres.  I would like to remind them that in 1985 the Fine Gael-Labour Government achieved the most significant extension and reclassification <Col N="519" /> of disadvantaged areas.  It is significant that they surveyed 10,000 townlands, covering 600 district electoral divisions, and in the end added 425,000 acres which were included for the first time and 870,000 which were reclassified.  That was significant.  If Fianna Fáil can achieve the same success with this submission many people will be extremely happy, but the many farmers who are waiting quite some time tend to be apprehensive at this stage, because it would appear that many Ministers and Deputies have been absent from various political meetings around the country organised by the IFA and other farming bodies to discuss this issue. I often wonder whether they are serious in their intent for major inclusions in the disadvantaged area or for reclassification.</P>
    <P>The Government addressed the issue of farm inheritance tax in the budget. This tax can cause terrible problems when farms are transferred from fathers to their sons, daughters or other relatives. The maximum amount which could be inherited tax free was £150,000 and, even though the Government have attempted to address this issue by increasing this provision by 4 per cent to £156,000, it will still remain a millstone around farmers' necks and be a deterrent to farmers who want to transfer their lands.  I ask the Minister to consider revising this amount in order to make it more relevant.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the farm improvement programmes.  In many cases literature is printed about these programmes and farmers are promised a certain percentage. However, the costings are outdated and need to be urgently reviewed to bring them into line with present day values.  The Minister should rectify the problems in this area.</P>
    <P>Local authority housing is of concern to those of us who are local authority councillors and Deputies.  We know of tragic situations where people will not be able to get houses because of the serious cutbacks over the past few years.  Like other parts of the country, there is a serious housing need in County Limerick at present.  It is worth mentioning how <Col N="520" /> this housing need has developed.  This housing need developed because of a lack of local authority funding for housing developments.  I want to contrast this with the position during the early eighties when many imaginative proposals were introduced by the then Government.  At that time local authority tenants received a grant of £5,000 to vacate their houses; there was the £2,000 new house grant and £2,000 mortgage subsidy.  These grants made it attractive for people to vacate their houses and meant that local authorities had a housing stock which they could fall back on.  The only grant available to a person building a new house nowadays is the £2,000 new house grant. There are no incentives for local authority tenants to vacate their houses.  In addition, the very generous tenant purchase scheme, which has to be applauded, will further exacerbate this problem in the future and will give rise to a very serious housing crisis.  The Government will have to address this issue, which they have not done for the past few years.  As we are all aware, we have an increasing older population. Thank God, older people are living longer; but many of them look to local authorities to provide housing.  We cannot meet their needs at present, nor are we seriously attempting to do so.</P>
    <P>There has been much discussion about the health services.  I want to refer specifically to the position in County Limerick. The problems being experienced in County Limerick are similar to those being experienced in other counties. There are long queues for urgent operations in the general hospital and there are delays of over two years in gaining access to orthopaedic hospitals.  This surely lends credence to the allegations that we have developed a two-tier medical system.  If somebody who has a medical card has to attend a public hospital he will have to wait a considerable length of time whereas a person who is fortunate enough to be able to afford it can attend a private hospital.  It is wrong that this should be happening.  The number of beds in the geriatric hospital in my home town of Newcastle West has been <Col N="521" /> reduced from over 220 to 160.  This is happening at a time when the number of older people in our population is increasing. This does not make sense.</P>
    <P>It is time the Government redressed the problems in regard to the hospitals in County Limerick.  It is wrong to make an exception for County Roscommon and not give the same priority to County Limerick. An investigation should be carried out into this matter.  Our older people demand respect.  In many cases they do not have representative organisations to articulate their views and they are often embarrassed to air their views to their public representatives.  These people deserve and need attention.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to industrial development. The people of County Limerick are fortunate that the Shannon Free Airport Development Company operate in that area.  I am sure the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, who comes from County Clare and who was in the House earlier, appreciates the work done by the SFADCo.  However, a black cloud is hanging over industrial development in Limerick city, County Limerick and the mid-west region.  Local papers regularly report on the future of SFADCo and what the Government intend to do with the company.  Any decision the Government make about this money should be clear cut.  They should immediately give SFADCo an extended mandate for the entire mid-west region so that they can get on with their job and get rid of this uncertainty.</P>
    <P>There are many unemployment black spots in County Limerick and SFADCo have a very hard job to do.  My home town of Newcastle West is becoming an unemployment black spot, as is the town of Kilmallock and other small towns.  I am disappointed at the lack of industrial development in those areas.  There are modern advance factories in many of those towns which are not being filled with alternative industries.  There is a tendency to concentrate industrial development in the larger industrial areas such as Limerick city and Shannon.  We should endeavour to bring industries to <Col N="522" /> rural towns so as to bring back the population to those areas.  Indeed, many of those people who have emigrated would welcome the chance to return home if jobs were available for them.</P>
    <P>The port of Foynes is the hub of activity in County Limerick.  This port is situated in the Shannon Estuary which for a long time has been defined as the jewel of the western world.  A special study has been commissioned into the role of the Shannon Estuary in the future.  However, there appears to be a great cloak of silence and mystery surrounding this report.  People who have a tremendous interest in this area have not been privy to the information in the report.  This matter was raised recently with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who said he did not intend to discuss it beyond Cabinet level at this stage and did not appear to have any immediate plans to do so.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government to come clean about their plans for the estuary.  As public representatives for the area we deserve to know what is likely to happen to the port in the future and the potential developments there.  I serve on the Foynes Harbour Board.  The port at Foynes, which has a throughput of over one million tonnes, has received only £570,000 in Government aid since it was founded 100 years ago this year.  It is significant that the largest contribution ever made to the board was by Deputy Jim Mitchell, who gave them £500,000 in 1985.  I hope that there will be good news in the EC peripheral programme, which has been long promised, for Foynes and that substantial grants will be provided so that the board can expand the port in order to accommodate the increased volume of business.  The Government should provide moneys for this port which is vital to the industrial development of County Limerick.  I call on the Minister and Minister of State from that constituency to remember where Foynes is when it comes to distributing funds from this peripheral programme.  They should also try to expedite EC sanction for this programme.  I believe there will <Col N="523" /> be tremendous returns from any investments made in the port.  The board are prepared to match whatever moneys are allocated in order to provide the stimulus for growth in Foynes.</P>
    <P>The Government have not met the real requirements of the country in the budget.  It is a budget of missed opportunities and is a complacent response to our current needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, Deputy Ryan and, in particular, Deputy Taylor-Quinn for giving me this opportunity to contribute to this debate this evening on the withdrawal of labour by nurses at Ennis Hospital, where there has been severe overcrowding, particularly in the casualty department, for the past number of years and where an insufficient number of acute beds is available to meet demand.</P>
      <P>This problem arose following a policy decision of the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, to cut down on the number of acute beds to be made available in the area, from 127 to 70.  However, following negotiations this number was increased to 78.  The statistics compiled by the hospital administrator indicate that even in the period of lowest demand, the August holiday period, the average number of beds required is 85.  This is the position that obtained in both 1988 and 1989.  When we contrast this statistic with the original allocation of 70 beds we can see that even in the period of lowest demand 15 extra beds are needed.  The Minister and the health board took a decision to close a ward in the hospital and this has led to great distress being caused.  We have now reached the stage where if a major disaster occurred in the mid-western region there would be no beds available, as all 78 beds are being used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly an insufficient number of beds is being provided at Ennis Hospital.  The Minister will have to make a policy decision to reconsider the allocation for County Clare agreed with the officers of the health board.  The population of County Clare is over 90,000.  Given what Deputy Foxe was able to secure for County Roscommon the other day the Minister should reconsider the decision made in respect of Ennis.  I understand that a meeting was held here yesterday between representatives of the Minister's party and himself at which he indicated that a geriatrician would be appointed. <Col N="525" /> However, I do not believe that this will solve the problem as what the staff are calling for is the reopening of the ward. In fairness, there has to be equity and we need to recognise the position the staff find themselves in.  They are working in intolerable conditions and have been for a long time.  I ask the Minister to review his policy decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment and the Minister for Education and Deputy Ryan for allowing this matter to be taken first.  I join with Deputy Carey in making the case on behalf of Ennis Hospital.  The proposed go-slow which will commence as and from next Monday could have serious consequences for those who are due to be admitted to the hospital.  At present the number of beds available is insufficient to meet the demands being made on the hospital.  We will soon reach the position where the casualty department will be unable to cope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of the go-slow no extra beds will be made available.  Therefore there is an onus on the Minister to inform the House where those people who come to casualty are going to be admitted if no additional beds are made available.  As Deputy Carey said, the demand far exceeds the number of beds available.  This is the position right throughout the year.  The increased demand is not due, as was claimed recently by the Minister, to the 'flu epidemic.  In the height of the summer season in the month of August demand far exceeds the number of beds available. In view of this there is an onus on the Minister to reopen the ward that was closed and which contains 22 acute beds. The Minister must be aware of the need to do so as three years ago when Opposition spokesperson on health he called for the provision of 200 beds in Ennis Hospital.  However he now seems to think that 78 beds is an adequate number.  Some of his colleagues even claim that because medical technology has advanced so much a reduction in the <Col N="526" /> number of beds from 127 to 78 is justified. Of course this is ludicrous and untrue.  I am afraid medical technology has not advanced to such an extent that the number of beds could be reduced by that number.  Therefore that is an unacceptable argument.</P>
    <P>There is a responsibility on us as politicians to ensure that the health services are delivered in as equitable a manner as possible and that everybody gets a fair crack of the whip.  I would remind the Minister that the population of County Clare is 93,000 people, yet only 78 beds are provided at Ennis Hospital.  In County Roscommon the population of which is 53,000, 70 beds are provided, with another 20 promised.  If we were to do our sums County Clare should have 140 beds and if we take into account the promises given in respect of County Roscommon the number of beds available should be close to 160.  The people of County Clare are being very badly treated.</P>
    <P>The staff of the hospital decided to take this action as a last resort.  They have been working in extremely difficult circumstances and in appalling conditions and only took this decision after much consideration.  They have not taken it lightly.  They realise that the position is very serious and that the future of the hospital is highly questionable.  They are also concerned at the attitude adopted by the Minister and the health board.  I am sure the Minister will stand up to tell us that it has been decided to appoint a geriatrician in County Clare and to make ten additional beds available at Ennis Hospital to carry out geriatric assessments. While we welcome this appointment we would like to remind him that there are young people as well as old people in County Clare and while a geriatrician will be more than welcome at St. Joseph's Hospital there is no point in appointing one at Ennis Hospital.  What we want is an increased number of acute beds.</P>
    <P>What is the Minister's answer to the people of County Clare who find themselves on waiting lists and who have no hope of having their operations carried <Col N="527" /> out in the immediate future?  The people of Clare are looking to the Minister for an answer.  These are matters that must be considered.  The Minister must recognise the seriousness of the situation in the county.  We have not repeatedly raised the matter here in the House lightly, but because of our concern and the concern of the people of the county about the provision of a health service.</P>

      <P>I am very reluctantly intervening at this stage because on the last occasion when a similar question was raised here I was accused by my local constituency, because I did not intervene, of having no particular interest in the hospital in Ennis.  Lest the same thing happen on this occasion I want to briefly intervene to say that the Government are totally committed to the development and maintenance of Ennis General Hospital as an acute medical surgical hospital.</P>
      <P>As a further indication of that commitment, the Minister for Health, only yesterday, indicated that he had decided to appoint a geriatrician with the full back up services he will require, which is a very important additional vote of confidence in the hospital.  This appointment will necessitate the appointment of some medical back up staff, some nursing staff, additional beds in the assessment unit and the reopening of part of the hospital that is at present closed.  It will also mean the permanent establishment of a 22 bed unit linked to that in the geriatric hospital, St. Josephs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Overall what we have at present from the Government and the Minister is a deep and firm commitment to the maintenance of Ennis Hospital as an acute hospital and the provision of the best <Col N="528" /> possible medical service for the people of the county who need those services.  I would also like to put on record that the services which are being provided at Ennis are of the highest possible standard and I would like to compliment the medical and surgical personnel of the hospital, the nursing staff and all the staff at Ennis Hospital for the first class service which they are providing for the people of County Clare.  It will now be further enhanced by the new appointment and further provisions which will be made there for physiotherapy services and casualty services.</P>
    <P>Rather than being negative about this, as Deputy Taylor-Quinn appears to be, we are being positive and working consistently to provide in Ennis the best possible level of service that can be provided for the people of County Clare.</P>

      <P>At present there are seven consultants employed in the hospital. These include two physicians, two surgeons, two anaesthetists and one radiologist.  There are five outpatient clinics catered for at the hospital.  These include orthopaedics, ENT, antenatal, mammography, gynaecology and a medical surgical clinic.  A total of 11,551 out-patients attended the clinics in 1988. There was a total 2,998 inpatients treated in the period January to September 1989. The number of admissions fluctuated between 55 and 91 last year, so 84 beds seems to be a very balanced allocation by the Mid-Western Health Board.  In relation to the matters raised by the Deputies, I understand that officers of the Mid-Western Health Board have had a number of meetings recently with nursing representatives at Ennis General <Col N="530" /> Hospital concerning the effect on staff of admissions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which temporarily take the number of patients in the hospital above the normal complement.  This arose most recently during the influenza outbreak over Christmas.  I am satisfied that the hospital responded extremely well to the situation and coped satisfactorily with the higher than normal number of admissions.  Following these discussions the nursing unions recently notified the board that extra beds would not be put up except in the case of coronary and surgical emergencies as and from 26 February 1990.  As the number of admissions is now returning to normal the health board do not anticipate that this action will lead to any major problems in the provision of acute hospital services in County Clare.  I would appeal to the unions involved not to proceed with their proposed action because at the end of the day the patients may well be the innocent victims of their decisions and subsequent actions.</P>

      <P>Of course, the situation will be kept under review by the health board and any action required to safeguard the health of the patients will be taken.  The problems raised by the Deputies and admissions at Ennis General Hospital received widespread coverage in the media recently.  According to the Mid-Western Health Board the hospital responded extremely well to the problem and coped well with the high number of admissions which arose in a short space of time.  The problems encountered were not unique and were caused by a higher than usual incidence of respiratory illness mostly related to the influenza outbreak.</P>

      <P>The necessary measures were taken by the Mid-Western Health Board to deal with the problem, <Col N="531" /> which was of a temporary nature.  These included the opening of a ward at the nearby St. Joseph's Geriatric Hospital to relieve pressure on beds in the general hospital.  The ward, which is still open, started with seven beds but the number varies depending on demand.  It should be noted that the pattern of admissions at Ennis General Hospital has in recent months been out of line with the general pattern throughout the country.  When the CEO of the Mid-Western Health Board suggested that the situation be assessed by the consultant geriatrician at Limerick Regional Hospital there was a significant change which brought the hospital into line with what has been experienced elsewhere.</P>
      <P>It is the health board's view, supported by my Department, that the appointment of a consultant geriatrician for Clare and the development of support services for the elderly is the most appropriate and cost effective solution to the problems.  I am very pleased to be able to confirm that my Government colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Rory O'Hanlon, yesterday approved of the appointment of a consultant geriatrician for County Clare to be located at Ennis General Hospital and ten accompanying assessment beds.  This is proof of the positive commitment and attitude of my Ministerial colleague.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to thank you for the opportunity of raising the issue of the lack of accommodation in September 1990 and the need for a new building at Fingal Community College in Swords.  I have been persistent on this issue in the Chamber and such persistence has been demanded by the people of Swords because of the problems of overcrowding, lack of play areas and lack of car parking facilities.  As a former member of the County Dublin Vocational Educational Committee, I was directly involved in negotiations with the Department going back to 1985 when sanction was given for the provision of a fourth post-primary school for Swords. In that context I was amazed to hear from the Department of Health on 16 November, in reply to a question I asked in regard to the delay in starting the new post-primary school at Fingal Community College, that Fingal Community College was accommodated in the old vocational school.  The question of providing new accommodation for the college was being examined by the Department in the context of the overall long-term requirements for post-primary places in the area.  No final decision had been taken on the matter to date and consequently the Minister was not in a position to say when any new building would commence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="533" /> I was utterly amazed at this response and I hope it was the attitude of the officials and not the Minister.  A new school building is a priority.  This is a growth area.  Swords has a population of 20,000 and the catchment area includes Donabate, Rolestown, St. Margaret's, Santry, etc.  I hope the Minister this evening will put all that in its proper context.</P>
    <P>The VEC's original intention was that the site should be located on Drynam Road.  However, the Department rejected that in 1986 because the proposed site would join part of the proposed motorway, there were noise and lead pollution problems and aircraft using Dublin Airport.  It is ironic that some three years later the same problems did not prevent planning permission being given for the development of 500 houses on the same land.  What priority have educational facilities?</P>
    <P>In 1985 Fingal College moved to the old vocational school.  From September 1989 to June 1990 the 380 pupils are being accommodated in 11 prefabricated buildings on the site as well as in the major structure.  The buildings take up about 98 per cent of the site area and there is no room for the children to play. The Minister will appreciate the excellent principal and teaching staff and the very patient parents connected with Fingal community college.  In chaotic conditions they have achieved excellent results and parents and teachers must be commended on that.  However, because they are so patient they feel they have been taken for granted, and they look at other areas where people have taken to the streets, stopped traffic, etc., thereby achieving their aims.  I hope the Minister will take this on board.  It is projected that next September more than 400 pupils will be attending that school.</P>
    <P>I know negotiations have taken place in regard to valuation of the adjoining land, but I would like a commitment from the Minister this evening that the valuation problems relating to the adjoining site will be resolved as a matter of urgency and the purchase price agreed with the governors.  Secondly, I would <Col N="534" /> like a commitment to finance for the additional prefabricated buildings for next September.  We want them and we want them located on the new site.  We also want space for car parking.  At the moment teachers' cars are parked on the road and accidents and damage have occurred.  That is not fair to the teachers.</P>
    <P>There is a fear that the existing school assembly area could be seen by the Department as an easy way of providing additional accommodation.  In no circumstances are either the Minister or her Department to consider using this assembly area for classrooms.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister for a commitment that finance will be made available to build this much needed school for Swords.  I ask her to see that the Department and the VEC come together on this. This school is very restricted and it has roads all around it.  This matter has been going on for six years, so I ask that there be no further delays.  The people of north County Dublin, the parents and teachers at the school, demand better than they are getting and they are looking to me, as their public representative, and to the Minister to deliver on this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir, for the courteous way in which you have handled this half hour of business.  I commend Deputy Ryan's tenacity.  He has asked for this debate on so many occasions, I thought we were never going to get together, so to speak.  Now we have done so, but as we are in public we will be very restrained.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ryan has brought before the House this evening the question of St. Fingal's College, Swords.  This matter has been going on for six years, as he said. Without castigating him, let me gently remind him that three of those years his party were in Government, but I do not intend to make a point of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In November 1987 we agreed a price. <Col N="535" /> Deputy Ryan knows that and I want to put it in context.  We were willing to pay the price.  There is no point telling what it was as the Deputy obviously knows it. The lands we are buying, which adjoin the site of the old vocational school, are subject to an endowment fund and because of this consent for the disposal of the site to me by the governors has to be obtained from the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland.  The governors refused the request on 20 June of last year.  The Department appealed via the Chief State Solicitor's Office.  The Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests &mdash; they do not seem too charitable &mdash; turned that appeal down on 21 November 1989. The solicitors for the governors considered the reason for the refusal was that they wanted much more money.</P>
    <P>Three weeks ago the Valuation Office were asked to put what they would consider an equitable value upon the land. The building unit of my Department contacted the Valuation Office in the last week and the Valuation Office tell us they will be coming back with the views of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests within the next few days.  I put that in context because of Deputy Ryan's strong request that I give a commitment to hassle the Valuation Office and various other parties.  We have continued to do that but we are effectively not so much in the hands of the Valuation Office &mdash; they have come forward with a price &mdash; but of the other body to whom we will be beholden if we get the site at all, and at what price we do not know.</P>
    <P>Education has been carried on in the college very satisfactorily and successfully. I hold County Dublin VEC in high regard.  They are a growth VEC who have been pioneers in the type of courses they run, in particular post-leaving certificate courses.  The development of Fingal college in Swords is very important and I am as anxious as Deputy Ryan to get the impediments cleared as quickly as possible.  We are harrying all we can <Col N="536" /> and I hope within a very short period that the permission to sell, and the price, will be agreed.  Once that happens I will be able to give a commitment to provide the necessary accommodation, albeit for a short term, for the students next September and the other matters the Deputy spoke of.  The Department and the VEC will get together to work on that as soon as possible.  My ministerial colleague, who is not here now because he is abroad on official business, has spoken to me quite strongly about this, as is his wont when he is anxious about a matter.  The tenacity with which Deputy Ryan has pursued this in the Dáil deserves its own reward.</P>

I undertake to get back to Deputy Ryan as soon as we get permission from the commissioners to buy and the price is agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the problem. The second level programme is a global provision, not an itemised one. The arrangement of the components of primary and post-primary is a matter for myself and the Department.  How can the Government allocate separately to every school?  That is for me and my officials to sort out.  Therefore I cannot give a commitment until we get over this jump first, which is outside my scope, but I am trying to get the matter addressed.  If the Deputy has some influence with this body perhaps he can put some pressure on them.</P>

    <P>The existing comprehensive system of social insurance has served the country well.  Entitlement to benefits, on the basis of social insurance contributions made, is an accepted method of financing social <Col N="431" /> welfare payments, as there is a direct link between payments made and rights to benefit.  I am convinced that the future development of social welfare in Ireland should be based on social insurance schemes, complemented where necessary by suitable schemes of assistance. Coupled with this is the need to co-ordinate the tax and benefit system to focus resources, in a coherent fashion, on those in need, and to avoid poverty traps.  The employee exemption scheme, announced in the budget, is another step in this process. I will be examining other measures to ensure that the social insurance contribution system contributes to the fullest extent to employment creation, in tandem with the ongoing changes in personal taxation structures.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 62 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the existing arrangements for mortgage supplementation under the supplementary welfare allowances scheme, mortgage supplements are essentially provided on a temporary basis.  The supplements are intended to cover the interest element of the repayments and are only provided where the <Col N="432" /> applicant can make the capital repayments or comes to an arrangement with the lending agency that it will defer capital repayments for the time being.</P>
    <P>Supplements are reviewed at six monthly intervals and will not normally be continued after 12 months.  Where, however, the mortgage supplement is no greater than the rent allowance which would ordinarily be payable in any case, the mortgage supplement may be paid indefinitely.  In this way temporary relief is afforded on a uniform basis to all applicants in order to give them time to make suitable long term arrangements appropriate to their situation.</P>
    <P>Amendment of the regulations governing mortgage supplementation so as to permit payment of assistance in respect of the capital element of repayments could have significant cost implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The function of collecting PRSI was transferred from my Department to the office of the Collector General of the Revenue Commissioners in 1979.  Since then a joint collection system, the PAYEPRSI system, has been in operation for collecting tax and PRSI.  Also, a common registration number, known as the RSI number, that is revenue social insurance number, has been used by the two organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the ongoing drive to combat fraud and the achievement of greater efficiency and effectiveness in overall administration, the possibility of greater integration of revenue and social welfare data has been kept constantly under review in the meantime.  In this <Col N="433" /> regard periodic meetings of a joint social welfare &mdash; revenue executive group take place about four times a year and various studies have been conducted in recent years which have specifically addressed the question of greater integration.  This work will be ongoing in 1990.</P>
    <P>A working party, consisting of officials of my Department and the office of the Revenue Commissioners carried out a special review of certain aspects of the system.  Areas were identified which, it was decided, should be addressed with the aim of improving the identification of clients.  These areas were mainly the elimination of multiple RSI numbers for individuals and the resolution of PRSI records which could not be fully processed because of the absence of adequate identification details on employer returns.</P>
    <P>Two major studies were carried out in my Department in recent years with the aid of management consultants.  One of these related to the redesign of the central records system and the other was in connection with a security review of the Department's payment systems.  Both studies recommended that RSI number registration which was assigned to Revenue in 1979 was a function which would be more appropriate to have carried out in Social Welfare.  Arising from this recommendation, officials of my Department and of the Revenue Commissioners have been having discussions on the arrangements for transferring RSI number registration to the Department of Social Welfare.  These discussions are now nearing completion and the necessary computer development work and other arrangements involved in the change are being planned and scheduled.</P>
    <P>Further studies will be undertaken as necessary and the ongoing contacts at working group level will continue.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>Under the rent allowance scheme, which applies to tenants affected by the de-control of rents, the level of allowance paid in any case depends on the income of the claimant, as well as the rent charged. The scheme is designed in such a way that, if a rent increase reduces the claimant's rent income to a level lower than £54.40 in the case of a single person, or £97.40 in the case of a couple, the allowance is increased to bring net income up to these levels.  These income limits are reviewed each year and increased in line with budgetary increases in social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>I am at present considering what changes in the income limits for rent allowances will be required from July 1990 and I will be taking account in this context of the increases in rent levels arising from the five yearly review of rents by the rent tribunal.</P>

      <P>Under current legislation a person can be appointed on behalf of a claimant to receive and deal with amounts of benefit payable in respect of adult and child dependants.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 26 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in the Dáil recently, it is my view that the best approach in the long term is for my Department to directly administer the supplementary welfare allowance and the disabled persons maintenance allowance schemes. My objective is to ensure that all income maintenance services will be delivered in a co-ordinated and cost effective manner and that clients should as far as practicable have one point of contact when claiming their entitlements.</P>
      <P>Changes along these lines will have major implications for my Department, the health boards and the staff working in them.  What I would envisage at this stage is a phased approach with responsibility for disabled persons maintenance allowance being transferred to my Department as soon as the necessary administrative arrangements can be made.  I am also examining the question of the transfer of the administration of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  These matters will be discussed fully with the Department of Health and the health boards before the detailed arrangements are finalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am conscious of the part played by community welfare officers in relation to these income-maintenance services and other health board services.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 70 together.</P>
      <P>Means from farming for unemployment assistance purposes is assessed under specific provisions of the Social Welfare Acts.  This legislation provides that the yearly value of any advantage accruing to the claimant from the use of property &mdash; other than property personally used and enjoyed by the claimant, such as dwelling &mdash; is assessable as means.</P>
      <P>In the case of farmers the value of the yearly advantage is essentially based on the income from the farm less any expenses actually and necessarily incurred in earning that income.  The basis of the calculation is the net income from the farm over the 12 months preceding the date of the investigation.  The aim of the assessment is that it should reflect the net income in a normal year from that farm.</P>

      <P>The administration and operation of private occupational pension schemes is the responsibility of the trustees and administrators of such schemes.  As Minister for Social Welfare I have at present no statutory function in regard to the control and regulation of <Col N="441" /> such schemes.  I have had no discussions with any of the interests involved in the pension scheme of the H. Williams group.</P>
      <P>Private occupational pension schemes are invariably set up as trust funds and accordingly their administration is subject to the general body of law relating to trusts.  Under such law the trustees are responsible for the administration of the trust on behalf of the beneficiaries.  If the members of the scheme have reason to believe that their scheme is not being administered in accordance with the trust deed or is being mismanaged, they may seek redress through the courts by suing for breach of trust or seeking an order removing the trustees.  They may also seek to have their rights to information enforced through the courts, if necessary, in accordance with trust law.  Any intervention on my part in a situation which is ultimately a matter for the courts and in relation to which I have at present no statutory function would not be appropriate.</P>
      <P>The National Pensions Board have concluded that the protection afforded to the interests of members of pension schemes under trust law is not satisfactory. Accordingly, they recommended that detailed provision be made in a Pensions Act to afford more comprehensive and specific protection to members' interests in this regard.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to shortly introduce before the House a Bill designed to provide the type of additional protection for the interests of members of occupational pension schemes recommended by the Pensions Board.

These restrictions apply, <i>inter alia</i>, to city bus services in Dublin, Cork and Limerick from 7 a.m. to 9.45 a.m. and 4.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. Monday to Friday, inclusive.  The restrictions have been imposed because the services concerned are under severe pressure from commuters travelling to or from work or school and would not be able to cope with the additional influx of passengers which could arise if the restrictions did not apply.  The restrictions in question do not apply in the case of mentally handicapped persons, or persons attending long-term rehabilitation courses or blind persons attending full-time rehabilitation courses.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on the free travel scheme in 1990 will be £27 million.  An extension of the schemes on the lines proposed would have significant cost implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context.  Any easing of the restrictions would also have significant implications for Bus Atha Cliath and Bus Éireann, whose services would be affected.</P>
      <P>Deputies will also be aware of the initiatives announced recently by my colleague the Minister for Health including the setting up of a Dublin hospitals initiative. Out-patient arrangements will be one of the issues to be addressed in the context of that initiative.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 68 together.</P>
      <P>Those eligible for the pre-retirement allowance, which is an optional scheme, are persons aged 60 and over in receipt of the long-term rate of unemployment assistance and who retire from the labour market.</P>
      <P>Almost 5,000 completed applications have been received in respect of the pre-retirement allowance.  More applications are still being received by my Department's local offices.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme, payment will be made by means of a book of pension orders encashable at the local post office. In addition, participants will be relieved of the necessity of having to attend on a weekly basis to prove unemployment at their local employment exchange or Garda signing centre.  Another feature is that persons in receipt of the allowance will no longer be required to satisfy the conditions which apply to unemployment assistance claimants of being capable of, available for or genuinely seeking work. As a consequence, should a participant fall ill, the allowance will continue to be paid to him or her.</P>
      <P>The rate of pre-retirement allowance will, for most participants, be the same as that which they received while on unemployment assistance.  Some claimants with means will gain slightly by reason of the structure of rates payable in the scheme.  In addition to the basic allowance, participants will continue to receive fuel allowance, butter vouchers and any other special payments to which they were entitled while in receipt of unemployment assistance.</P>

The remaining applications are awaiting further information before the claim can be processed.</P>
      <P>Where payments are awarded they will apply from the date of application.

      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for entitlement to contributory old age pension for the self-employed, which is payable at age 66, is that the person must have entered insurable employment before reaching age 56.  Farmers and other self-employed persons who were aged 56 or over on entering insurable self-employment for the first time and who as a result cannot qualify for a contributory old age pension, are entitled to a refund of the old age pension element of the contribution, provided that they are not eligible for the award of a noncontributory old age pension.

      <P>In order to qualify for a free telephone rental allowance a person must be in receipt of one of a number of specified payments and reside either entirely alone or only with persons who come within certain excepted categories.  These excepted categories are: children under the age of 15; or people who are so permanently incapacitated that they could not summon help in an emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A pensioner residing with a person aged over 66 in respect of whom an adult dependant allowance is payable, may qualify for free telephone rental allowance where either the pensioner or adult <Col N="448" /> dependant is so permanently incapacitated that they could not summon help in an emergency.</P>
    <P>The procedures for examining and deciding on the eligibility of applicants for a free telephone rental allowance where the applicant is residing with other persons are as follows: (a) confirmation is required of the date of birth of all persons residing in the household and this procedure determines the eligibility or otherwise of any household member on age grounds; and (b) medical evidence is required from a registered medical doctor in respect of any household member aged over 15 so as to confirm their inability to summon help in an emergency.</P>
    <P>This medical evidence is generally referred to the Department's medical adviser for his opinion.  When the medical adviser has given his opinion a decision is then made on the claim for free telephone rental.</P>
    <P>Many of the applications are referred to social welfare officers for investigation. I am having the procedures in these cases examined with a view to speeding up the decision process.  The operation of the scheme is kept under continuous review and modifications and improvements made as required.</P>

      <P>As part of the Government's decentralisation policy, three branches of my Department were transferred to Sligo where they now form the pensions services office.  The pensions services office administers old age, retirement, widows and orphans pensions together with the various social assistance allowance schemes and the free schemes.</P>
      <P>The pensions services office has a planned staff complement of 319 and there are 318 serving at present.  The one vacancy is at a junior level.  My Department is satisfied that the level of staffing in the pensions services office is sufficient for the efficient discharge of the work of the office.</P>
      <P>I am aware that some delays are being experienced by some claimants to pensions. It was inevitable, given the sheer size of the decentralisation project, that service levels would initially be affected somewhat by the transfer of staff, and from the loss of experience arising from the replacement of long serving staff by new staff recruited locally in Sligo and by staff redeployed from other Government offices.  For this reason a major training programme was undertaken by my Department.  This programme began well before the transfer took place and also included lengthy periods of on-the-job training.  I have ensured that the full complement of staff is available and I am confident that the measures being taken will result in the elimination of any delays being experienced.</P>

      <P>Following a re-investigation of the person's circumstances, a deciding officer assessed the means of the person concerned at £55.38 per week from 12 July 1989.  His means are derived from the yearly value of his holding of £2,880 per annum (gross income £6,585 less outgoings of £3,705).</P>

      <P>This assessment leaves him entitled to payment of unemployment assistance at the long term weekly rate of £41.60.  If he considers that his circumstances have changed since the last investigation was carried out, it is open to him to apply at his local office for a review of his case.</P>

      <P>EC social security pensioners may qualify for fuel allowances under the national fuel scheme under the same <Col N="453" /> general criteria applying to beneficiaries under the Irish social welfare schemes. An EC pensioner must, accordingly, live alone or only with certain persons in excepted categories.  These categories include dependants and other qualified recipients.  A claimant must be unable to provide for his heating needs and those of his dependants.</P>
      <P>An EC pensioner is regarded as being unable to meet these heating needs if his total income does not exceed the appropriate maximum Irish contributory pension rate plus £5 per week.  In assessing his total income for these purposes, his EC pension has to be converted to Irish pounds.</P>
      <P>Because exchange rates can fluctuate frequently and because it would not be practicable to determine entitlement to fuel allowances (or other social welfare payments) each time that a particular currency exchange rate changed, it is necessary to adopt a practical approach to the problem.  Accordingly, a mechanism, which is employed within the EC in relation to certain social security transactions between member states, is used to convert EC pensions when calculating means.  This exchange rate is fixed under EC regulations in the first month of each quarter for use in all transactions in the succeeding quarter.  The rate represents the average of the daily exchange rates for the month preceding the adoption of the rate.  In appropriate cases assessment is made by reference to the more favourable of the two most recently publicised sets of rates.  This can be more favourable than the current rates of exchange.</P>
      <P>Certain claimants may feel they are losing the benefit of a more recent movement in exchange rates when these would be favourable.  However, the current procedure avoids the need for very frequent reviews of existing entitlements in other circumstances.  This gives an important degree of security to persons who have qualified for the allowance.</P>

      <Quest>the number of persons whose social welfare benefit has been discontinued as a result of suffering from ME; and if he will review his refusal to acknowledge this condition.</Quest>

      <P>I am glad the Deputy has afforded me an opportunity to put the record straight in regard to this matter. Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, or ME as it is commonly known, is a very difficult condition to diagnose and I am aware that the medical profession itself has quite a few problems in this regard.  It can take some time before a person is finally diagnosed as having ME.  In the meantime they are usually certified to my Department as being incapable of work from some other cause.</P>
      <P>As a result of this, perhaps, and also due to the relatively low incidence of the condition, my Department sees very little certification that actually specifies the cause of incapacity as ME.</P>
      <P>All disability benefit claims are subject to the normal medical scrutiny offered by my Department's medical referees.  In arriving at a conclusion on any particular case they have regard to all relevant matters and in particular to whatever comments are afforded by the claimant's own general practitioner.</P>
      <P>I would stress the importance of this particular aspect of the situation.  When a person is called before a medical referee his or her doctor is also advised at the same time and invited to furnish appropriate information in relation to the case. It is very desirable and useful to get this information in all instances, but particularly so in conditions such as ME where the certifying doctor has seen the complaint at close quarters for a longer period of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had the pleasure recently of meeting with representatives of the ME Association and we had a useful mutual exchange of information.  The association gave me some good literature on the subject of ME.  I arranged to have that literature distributed to all my Department's medical referees and to maintain departmental contact with the association.  Our medical personnel keep up to date in <Col N="455" /> medical matters and a number of them recently attended a special session given by the Irish College of Occupational Medicine on the topic of ME by one of the country's leading medical specialists in the field.  In addition, I have arranged that the Department's medical adviser will attend the first world symposium on ME that takes place in April in Cambridge. I mention all these things to illustrate that my Department is particularly conscious of the problems of ME.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would invite the Deputy, if he has a particular case in mind, to forward details to me and I will arrange to have it looked at specially. There are no statistics available that would enable me to say how many persons certified as suffering from ME have been found to be capable of work by the medical referees but the numbers are very small indeed.</P>

      <Quest>the reason payment of occupational injuries benefit was discontinued in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Waterford in view of the fact that he was not fully examined by the medical referee and medical evidence submitted by his doctor and specialist confirmed his inability to work; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Medical referees provide a second opinion to that of the person's own doctor for the guidance of my Department's deciding officers and they carry out such medical examinations as are necessary in each individual case.</P>
      <P>Every effort is made to ensure that the interests of persons referred for medical referee examination are fully safeguarded. Their own certifiers are advised of the forthcoming examinations and invited to submit an appropriate medical report including references to any recent consultant examinations.  In addition it is open to a certifier to attend a medical referee examination if he or she so wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned who was <Col N="456" /> allowed injury benefit under the occupational injuries scheme from 1 September 1989 in respect of incapacity resulting from an accident at work on that date was examined by a medical referee on 1 December 1989.</P>
    <P>The medical referee expressed the opinion that the claimant was not incapable of work.  In this connection no report was received from his certifying doctor nor was any specialist report received.  In carrying out the examination the medical referee noted there were full limb movements of the areas of the body concerned and that he was fully mobile. Payment of injury benefit was disallowed by the deciding officer from 9 December.</P>
    <P>The person concerned gave notice of intention to appeal against the decision on 6 February 1990 and submitted a final certificate to the effect he was fit to resume work from 5 February.  He submitted a completed appeal form on 20 February together with further medical evidence.  This evidence and a medical certificate from the out-patients department of Waterford Regional Hospital received from the final certificate have now been referred to an appeals officer for decision.</P>
    <P>The person concerned may be qualified for disablement benefit and a claim form was issued to him for completion and return if he wishes to apply for this benefit.</P>

      <P>The new carer's allowance will provide a payment of £45 a week, which is equivalent to the new short term rate of unemployment assistance, in place of the prescribed relative allowance of £28 a week currently payable.

It is my intention to extend the scope of the scheme beyond that of the existing prescribed relative allowance.

      <P>The assessment of the value of free board and lodgings is the main item of means assessed in the case of single applicants for unemployment assistance living with their parents or relatives.  This is in accordance with statutory requirements and each case is decided on its merits having regard to the standard of living of the household and the circumstances of the applicant.</P>
      <P>The statutory requirement to take account of the value of board and lodgings has been a feature of the unemployment assistance scheme since its inception.  Its purpose is to achieve a degree of equity as between applicants whose parents are well-to-do and those whose parents are in poorer circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="458" /> These criteria are continuously reviewed and changes are made to them from time to time where considered appropriate and having regard to budgetary constraints.</P>

      <P>Proposals for a third EC Poverty Programme were adopted by the Council of Ministers in June 1989.  The programme will have a budget of £42.7 million and will run from December 1989 to June 1994.  I fully supported the Commission proposals in this area and have been active in getting the programme into operation as far as Ireland is concerned.</P>
      <P>Projects in Limerick, Connemara and Dublin have been selected by the Commission to participate in the programme. The Limerick and Connemara projects are large scale pilot projects aimed at developing an integrated set of measures to tackle poverty.  The project in Dublin is a cultural and educational project with travellers.</P>
      <P>The process involved in putting forward projects for inclusion in the third programme revealed a wide range of activities in different areas of the country concerned with combating poverty.</P>
      <P>There are also a number of projects which were set up under the Second EC Poverty Programme 1985-1989 and which I am anxious to support.  With this in mind the Government have agreed to make available a special allocation of £550,000 for continued support and assistance for projects of this kind.  I am discussing with the Combat Poverty Agency how this money will be allocated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the activities during the Irish Presidency I have arranged to host a conference in June 1990 under the Third EC programme on the role of non-governmental or voluntary organisations in relation to disadvantaged groups in <Col N="459" /> society.  The conference is being funded jointly by the EC and the Government and represents a major initiative in this context of the EC programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>The formula for assessing the means derived from capital is set out in the legislation.  Applicants for social assistance payments who have capital are assessed with a notional income from the capital.  The formula for assessing the value of capital varies with different schemes.  A 10 per cent rate of assessment is applied under the old age pension and unemployment assistance schemes to amounts of capital over certain levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the old age pension scheme there is an overall means disregard under which a person can have means from all sources of up to £6 a week and still qualify for the maximum pension.  In the case of <Col N="461" /> a married couple this would be £12 per week.  This means that, under existing arrangements, a married couple could have joint capital of over £5,900 and still qualify for maximum pension.  They could have joint capital of almost £56,000 and still qualify for a pension.</P>
    <P>I am keeping the means testing arrangements under review to see how they can be simplified and rationalised. Any additional concessions in this area would however have considerable financial implications.  My priority has been to direct available resources as much as possible to increasing basic levels of payments for the benefit of all claimants including those with or without means.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a review of the taxpayer's tax liability for 1988-89 was carried out on 30 January 1990 and an overpayment for £6.54 arose.  A cheque in settlement was issued to him on 7 February 1990.  As the taxpayer had continued to be paid by his employer during the full period in which he was on sick leave in that particular year, a refund of tax on the basis of unused tax free allowances did not arise.</P>
      <P>For the current year, 1989-90, i.e. since 6 April last, the taxpayer has not been paid any income by his employer, and consequently no tax has been paid by him.  Accordingly, there is no refund due for this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The following is the position in relation to legislation for which I am responsible.</P>
      <P>(i)  Section 2 (1) of the Exchange Control Act, 1954, provided that the Act would come into operation &ldquo;on such day or days as by order or orders made by the Minister for Finance might be fixed therefor&rdquo;.  The Exchange Control (Commencement) Order, 1955 (S.I. No. 128 of 1955) fixed 1 July 1955 as the day on which the Act &mdash; other than section 14 and section 15(1) &mdash; came into operation. These sections dealt with a proposed system of authorised depositaries for reserved securities (section 14) and a prohibition on the import of such securities and of coupons (section 15 (1)).  The reason for non-implementation of these sections is that the obligation to deposit bearer and foreign securities and the prohibition on their import has not been deemed necessary in view of other safeguards available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii)  The Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1976, made provision for the eventual repeal and amendment by ministerial order of sections of the superannuation code dating back to 1834.  The Act provided this would be done in conjunction with the making of a consolidated principal civil service superannuation <Col N="467" /> scheme.  The scheme has been drafted and is with the parliamentary draftsman's office for clearance before being signed by me.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Section 4 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1987, and the repeals contained in section 26 thereof relating to section 21 of the National Monuments Act, 1930, and section 15 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1954, are not yet in force.  These provisions would substitute the Historic Monuments Council for the National Monuments Advisory Council.  The application of the provisions is still being considered in the light of the recent setting up of the National Heritage Council.</P>
    <P>(iv)  Section 13 of the Central Bank Act, 1989, dealing with fees in respect of supervision by the Central Bank has not yet been implemented as it is under examination by the bank.  Section 27 of the Central Bank Act, 1989, dealing with investigation of complaints is currently being examined in consultation with the Central Bank.</P>

      <P>(b)  Abattoirs Act, 1988 &mdash; The following parts of the Abattoirs Act, 1988 have not been commenced: Part I &mdash; All sections in so far as they apply to knackeries; section 3 (2) in so far as it applies to abattoirs.  Part II &mdash; All sections. Part IV &mdash; Sections 36 to 43 inclusive. Part V &mdash; All sections.  Part VII &mdash; All sections in so far as they apply to knackeries.  Owning to the complexities of the Act it is necessary to introduce the provisions of the Act on a phased basis.</P>
      <P>Regulations relating to veterinary examination and the health mark on meat for human consumption are being finalised and will when introduced enable all sections of the Abattoirs Act, 1988, apart from those relating to knackeries, to be implemented.  Commencement of those provisions of the Act which relate to knackeries is being deferred pending the outcome of current EC discussions in relation to harmonised rules for the disposal of carcases, slaughter offals and other animal waste.</P>

      <P>(1)  Part VI of the Insurance Act, 1936. This part provides for the establishment of a State reinsurance company to which compulsory reinsurance cessions would have to be made if the circumstances so warranted.  There has been no need to activate this provision.</P>
      <P>(2)  Part IV of the Insurance Act, 1989. This part provides for the regulation of insurance intermediaries.  The other parts of the Act were activated by commencement order on 20 March 1989.  A transitional period is being allowed in relation to Part IV to enable intermediaries to gear up to compliance in advance of the legislation.</P>
      <P>(3)  Section 7 (1) (a) (ii) of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1986.  This section of the 1986 Companies Act has not yet been activated pending full implementation of EC directives governing the individual and group accounts of certain corporate entities including credit institutions.</P>

      <P>The Safety, Health and Welfare (Offshore Installations) Act, 1987 requires the making of ministerial regulations before becoming operational.  Four sets of regulations for the purpose of bringing the Act into operation are at an advanced stage of drafting.  When these regulations are drafted, the Act will be brought into operation by order and the regulations subsequently made.</P>
      <P>Part II of the Dangerous Substances Act, 1972, requires implementation by ministerial order.  Matters relating to the control and use of explosives generally are dealt with by the Department of Justice under the Explosives Act, 1875.</P>
      <P>The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989 is in operation since 1 November 1989.  However, the provisions of section 4 (3) of the Act, relating to the repeal of various other enactments will be brought into operation progressively in accordance with section 1 (2).</P>
      <P>Section 9 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1969, which provides for the appointment of members of the Labour Court to arbitration boards in the public service, has not been implemented by ministerial order.  The interim arrangement introduced in 1976 as an alternative to implementing section 9 continues to apply.  Labour Court members serve on conciliation and arbitration boards when requested to do so.</P>

All persons on the live register are considered available for employment and are accordingly considered for the social employment scheme as opportunities arise.  However, persons who refuse an SES opportunity, without a reason acceptable to FÁS, are reported to the Department of Social Welfare.  It is a matter for that Department to decide if they may continue to draw unemployment benefit or assistance.</P>

      <P>The following provisions of the Social Welfare Acts require ministerial order before they can be brought into force.</P>
      <P>Section 28 of the Social Welfare Act, 1988, as amended by section 24 of the Social Welfare Act, 1989, provides for the introduction of a pre-retirement allowance.  The necessary administrative arrangements are currently being finalised and the scheme will be introduced when they are completed.</P>
      <P>Sections 12 and 13 of the Social Welfare Act, 1989 impose, <i>inter alia,</i> a liability on the spouse of a recipient of deserted wife's benefit, deserted husband's allowance or supplementary welfare allowance to contribute toward such payments.  Arrangements for the implementation of the new provisions are being considered at present in the light of a detailed report on the matter which was prepared by my Department.  These provisions will be brought into force as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>There are various other regulatory powers contained in the Social Welfare Acts which empower but do not require the Minister to amend or extend certain provisions of the Acts.  These provisions are brought into effect as considered necessary from time to time.</P>

      <P>Under current legislation, an applicant for unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit must &mdash; at all times &mdash; be available for, capable of and genuinely seeking work, having regard to his/her age, sex, physique, education, normal occupation, place of residence and family circumstances.</P>
      <P>A refusal by a claimant to participate in a social employment scheme would be approached by my Department in the same way as a refusal to accept an offer of other employment or training.  Where the Department becomes aware that the claimant has not accepted any offer of suitable employment or training, and thus might not fulfil all the statutory conditions for receipt of unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit, the case is investigated and referred to a deciding officer if the facts so warrant. The deciding officer would have regard to all the circumstances of the case before arriving at a decision.  In any such case, claimants are afforded every opportunity of putting their reasons to the deciding officer before a decision on entitlement is made.</P>
      <P>Every refusal does not lead to a disqualification for receipt of unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit.  There is a right of appeal in every case where the person is disqualified and is dissatisfied with the decision.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to introduce a free natural gas allowance as an optional alternative to a free electricity allowance for qualifying pensioners whose homes are connected to a natural gas supply.  A natural gas supply is now available in <Col N="478" /> Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Clonmel and Waterford.</P>
      <P>The qualifying conditions for both schemes will be identical.  A person may qualify for one of these allowances but not both.  Applications for free natural gas allowance will be received and processed in the same manner as applications for free electricity allowance from March 1990.</P>
      <P>The free natural gas allowance will be applied to the natural gas bill of qualified pensioners from the start of the next two-monthly billing period following the date on which the claim is received.</P>
      <P>Bord Gáis operate a variety of tariff structures.  Accordingly, different arrangements will apply to each category with a view to providing equivalent benefits in money terms.  The number of free therms will vary from 84 to 201 with the normal standing charges also covered where appropriate.

      <P>This action on the part of the dentists is a result of the Irish Dental Association's objections to the extension of the scheme to dependent spouses of insured persons in 1987, and its dissatisfaction with the fees paid to dentists under the scheme.</P>
      <P>I recently met representatives of the association to establish if there is a basis on which the present difficulties can be overcome.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 119 and 120 together.</P>
      <P>It is my policy to sanction proposals from housing authorities for the purchase of private houses where they comply with the terms of the scheme, introduced in December 1984 for the purchase by local authorities of private houses and where there is provision within the authorities' capital allocations to finance them.  Given the wide disparity in the cost of building and purchasing houses throughout the country and differences between houses built or purchased it is not possible to indicate what savings may arise.  In the period from November 1989 to 15 December 1989, Dublin County Council submitted proposals to purchase and carry out some repairs to 14 second hand private houses in various parts of their area.  The all in costs ranged from £27,000 to £49,600.</P>

      <Col N="485" /> Approval issued to eight of these proposals and the remaining six were not approved as it was considered that one of the conditions specified for the pirchase by a housing authority of private houses, viz. that the all in cost of the houses being acquired be attractive compared with the cost of building by the authority, was not being fulfilled.</P>

My Department have been involved in detailed discussions with the Western <Col N="488" /> Health Board regarding the implementation of the recommendations contained in <i>Planning for the Future.</i> The board are continuing to make progress in putting a community oriented service in place.</P>

This list is kept under regular review and priority is given to those cases which because of medical need, must be dealt with promptly.</P>
      <P>I should mention that the information available to me in respect of this patient is that he/she was first placed on a waiting list in late 1988.</P>
      <P>As a result of the additional resources which have been made available, waiting times for ENT procedures have been significantly reduced and it has been possible to make arrangements to have this patient admitted to Temple Street before the end of March.</P>

      <P>As I said in my reply to the Deputy last week, I am concerned to achieve improvements in the health services of County Roscommon, including the psychiatric services.</P>
      <P>Of great importance to the development of psychiatric services in Roscommon will be the opening of the 30 bed psychiatric unit at Roscommon Hospital in the near future.  This unit will provide acute psychiatric services for the people of County Roscommon.  Certain other psychiatric services will continue to be provided in St. Patrick's Hospital, Castlerea.  As part of the Western Health Board's development plan, a range of back-up facilities, such as supported hostels, day centres, workshops and community residences, are being put in place in various locations throughout County Roscommon.  Included in the board's proposals are the provision of a sector headquarters, day centre and workshop in Castlerea.  As a result of these developments, there will be a great improvement in the services for psychiatric patients.</P>

      <P>I take it the Deputy is referring <Col N="494" /> to the conductive education system which is being pioneered by the PETO Institute in Budapest.  The conductor in this system is not merely a teacher but a person who on his/her own employs the various skills of teachers, nurses, physiotherapists, etc., in developing the potential of the child to become mobile.</P>
      <P>I understand that a number of children are being taught at the Cork Spastic School using conductive methods but with parents, physiotherapists and other professionals involved under the guidance of a teacher who has had some training in the conductive methods.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday 21 February 1990 I met a delegation of Cork Deputies to discuss this matter in detail.  I will now be taking the matter up within my Department and will ask my officials to report back to me as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The allocation of £4 million in 1988 to the capital grants scheme was fully committed to projects in the earlier part of that year.  With the exception of funds carried over to meet these ongoing commitments no further allocation was made to this scheme to fund additional projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As outlined by the Minister for Finance on 24 October 1989 in his reply to Questions Nos. 26, 48 and 55, the Government decided to amalgamate the capital grants scheme operated by my Department with the amenity grants <Col N="495" /> scheme operated by the Department of the Environment into a single scheme.</P>
    <P>Under the new arrangements, the Minister for the Environment will allocate grants to projects recommended by local authorities, who will also be responsible for the processing of all applications under the new scheme.</P>
    <P>All applications submitted to my Department, including the application received from Raphoe Community Hall Committee, have been forwarded to the local authorities for consideration.</P>

The small balance of grant remaining will be paid when the mechanical and electrical installations have been inspected and found to be satisfactory.  I have arranged that this inspection be made at an early date.</P>

In the light of the Deputy's indication now about the applicant's attendance at lectures for a lengthy period at a considerable distance from her home I have asked my Department to make further inquiries about this case and to review the position, if appropriate, in the light of the results of these inquiries.</P>
