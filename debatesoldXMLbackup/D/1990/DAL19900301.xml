    <Title>Decimal Currency Bill, 1990: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill will allow the Minister for Finance to issue a set of coins to commemorate the Irish Presidency of the European Council and also permits the issue of a new £1 coin.  It also proposed to amend the decimal currency Acts to permit a change in the metallic composition of the 1p and 2p.  I am confident that the House will support the proposals in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Irish Presidency of the EC Council will see the putting in place of many of the final building blocks of the 1992 objective.  Developments in Europe generally are likely to make this period one of historic significance.  The issue of a commemorative coin will be an enduring reminder of the Irish Presidency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have decided to issue the coins in gold and silver.  The coins will be purely commemorative and not legal tender.  Other member states have issued commemorative coins in the past.  Most <Col N="1219" /> recently Spain produced a set of five coins in precious metals to mark their first presidency of the Council.</P>
    <P>The coins will be issued by the Central Bank and will consist of a series of three &mdash; a gold 50 ECU piece, a silver coin 10 ECU, and a silver 5 ECU piece.  The gold coin and smaller silver coin will be roughly the same size as the 10p while the larger silver coin will be of &ldquo;crown&rdquo; size, that is somewhat larger than the old half crown.  The gold coin will be 22 carat gold and the silver coins will be sterling silver.  They will be issued in proof standard to encourage interest among coin collectors.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that the gold coin will be priced in the region of £250.  The larger silver coin will cost £20 to £25 while the smaller silver coin will be priced at £10-£15. These prices are tentative since much depends on the value of gold and silver at the time of purchase of the metals.  However, the intention is that while the gold coin and larger silver coins will be of interest mainly to collectors the smaller silver coin at £10 to £15 should be accessible to the ordinary citizen who wishes to have a keepsake of the occasion.</P>
    <P>This is our first step into the market of specialised coins.  There are certain risks associated with the issue of precious metal coins.  The metals must be purchased in advance and may fall in price subsequently thus affecting market value.  There is also the risk that market demand may not be as strong as anticipated.</P>
    <P>On the advice of the Central Bank, it is proposed to issue 5,000 gold coins, 20,000 of the larger silver coins and 20,000 of the smaller silver coin.  These are the minimum levels necessary to offset the manufacturing costs.  An issue of this size will, it is felt, minimise, the risks and enhance the scarcity value for collectors.</P>
    <P>The question of design is obviously a matter of importance.  The Government decided that the design of the red deer selected for the £1 coin, on which I will comment later, should be retained for <Col N="1220" /> the ECU coin.  Given the increased awareness about conservation of the environment, the symbol of the Irish red deer is very appropriate.  The use of this theme will also increase interest in our coinage abroad.</P>
    <P>On the obverse side, it is intended to reproduce the harp surrounded by the 12 stars which is the logo of the Community. The coin denomination will appear on this side also.  The use of the stars is common to issues by other countries and again symbolises this country's adherence to the Community.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the other main purpose of the Bill &mdash; that is the £1 coin.  The question of a £1 coin has been under consideration for some time.  The short lifespan of the pound note, combined with rising costs of production, has made it an unattractive proposition to continue to produce notes of this denomination.  In addition, many people, including several Deputies in this House, have commented on the ragged appearance of our notes once they have been in usage for some time.  It is not good for the image of the currency, or indeed the country, to have notes in circulation in a less than acceptable state.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided that it is opportune to introduce a £1 coin.  They considered this matter very carefully from all aspects.  Many other States have coins of a denomination roughly equivalent to the Irish pound.</P>
    <P>At present the bank issues roughly 59 million notes per annum and these have a life expectancy of only six months. About 50 million £1 coins will be issued initially and an issue of about 3 million per annum will be sufficient to ensure there is enough in circulation.  The lifespan of 40 years for each coin is a considerable cost-saving factor.  The cost of changing to the £1 coin will be recouped within five to seven years.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets out the weight and metallic composition of the coin.  The metals used are copper and nickel, similar to the existing 5p, 10p and 50p.  The weight is 10 grammes &mdash; lighter than the 50p and the 10p, the coin will be 31.1 mm in diameter and 1.7 mm in thickness.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1221" /> The Bill, however, does not mention what many would consider the most important aspect &mdash; the design of the coin.  This will be the subject of an order under section 3 of the Decimal Currency Acts, 1969 to 1989 which I will make when the Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>The Government decided that a special design should be commissioned for the new coin.  The design chosen for the coin, as I said earlier, is that of the Irish red deer.  I have made sample coins available for inspection by Deputies.  I am confident that the design will find favour with the public.  The red deer is native to this country and is a striking and majestic animal of which we are proud.  The deer has been under threat but active conservation is ensuring that it will be preserved for future generations.  The Arts Council who were consulted at an early stage agreed with the choice of a deer.</P>
    <P>Mr. Tom Ryan, President of the Royal Hibernian Academy, was commissioned to prepare the drawings based on photographs of actual red deer submitted by Mr. Seán Ryan of County Cork, an acknowledged expert in this field.  Mr. Tom Ryan had already designed the motif for the 50p piece issued to mark the Dublin Millennium celebrations.  I should like to thank both these gentlemen for the pains they took in advising the Government in this regard.</P>
    <P>As with all new coins, many organisations have been consulted, for example, the users and makers of coin operated machines and representatives of the visually impaired.  To help the visually impaired, the coin will contain special features to distinguish it from other coins.</P>
    <P>Firstly, the size and weight alone will be of assistance to the blind.  In addition, the milling on the edge has been so constructed that it will be recognisable by touch.  This milling is unique to the £1 coin.  In addition, the coin has a beaded edge around the circumference of the coin which is again unique to the coin.</P>
    <P>The Government's aim is to overhaul the coinage fully over the next three to four years.  The introduction of the £1 coin is but one of many changes which we will see.  I am concerned that the <Col N="1222" /> coinage, generally, is too heavy and we will be endeavouring to reduce the weight of the coins where possible.  The first priority in 1991 will be the issue of a new, lighter and round 50p.  The coin will be reduced in size by about 5mm and will carry the current woodcock design.</P>
    <P>Next it is planned to issue a new 5p and 10p on which the two existing designs, the bull and the salmon, will be reversed to face left.  This will give a uniform orientation to all the motifs.  Both coins will be reduced in size.  The metallic composition of both coins will be altered to make them lighter.</P>
    <P>For the 1p and 2p coins it is proposed to revert to the Metcalfe designs.  The 1p will feature the Irish wolfhound from the old sixpence while the 2p will have the hare which appeared on the pre-decimal 3p.</P>
    <P>My Department consulted the Arts Council on the designs and I have taken on board most of their suggestions.  I am grateful to the Arts Council for their advice and we will consult the council further as appropriate.</P>
    <P>The Bill also allows for a change to the 1p and 2p.  These coins are made of bronze at present and cost more than their face value to produce.  The Central Bank have recommended that the metallic composition of these coins should be altered in advance of the design changes I spoke about earlier.  It is proposed that the current metallic composition should be replaced by a copper covered steel core.  There will be no change in the dimension, size, weight or design of the coins.</P>
    <P>This change in metallic composition will enable the bank to break even on the production of these coins.  Coins of this sort are common on the Continent and I note that the UK Royal Mint have recently announced a similar change.</P>
    <P>I now turn briefly to the provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 deals with definitions and is self-explanatory.  Section 2 relates to the ECU coins.  Subsection (1) allows for the issue of coins in ECUs in such sizes, metallic composition, design and weights as the Minister for Finance may decide.  Subsections (2) and (3) allow the <Col N="1223" /> coins to be sold through the Central Bank at a price determined by the Minister. Subsection (4) provides that the coins will not be legal tender.</P>
    <P>Subsections (5) and (6) apply certain sections of the Decimal Currency Act, 1969, to coins issued under section 2.  By virtue of these the Central Bank will bear the expenses of the issue and the income from the sale of the coins will accrue to the bank.  The bank will also bear the cost of any redemption.</P>
    <P>Subsection (7) applies to section 57 of the Copyright Act, 1963, and vests the copyright in the design in the Minister for Finance.  This is a standard provision of coinage legislation.  Section 3(a) inserts a new section 4A in the Decimal Currency Act, 1969, to enable the provision of 1p and 2p coins in the form of copper coins with a steel core.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (b) is a technical amendment of section 14 of the Decimal Currency Act, 1969, to include a reference in that section to coins issued under section 2 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (c) amends the First Schedule to the Decimal Currency Act, 1969, to provide for the issue of a £1 coin.  The amended Schedule specifies the standard weight and composition of the coin and the permitted variation from these standards. The size and design of the coin will be dealt with separately by an order under the 1969 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is the Short Title and construction of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Coinage is one of those issues on which everybody has an opinion.  It is, I know, a subject on which some people have strong feelings.  The coinage is an important symbol of our nationalhood and a symbol of which we should be proud.  The designs on our coins are of a recognised high standard and the Government are anxious to ensure that these should remain so.  I am happy that the new £1 coin, and the coins to follow in the future, will be well received by the public.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I welcome this Bill which appears to be thorough and efficient legislation.  It is also timely.  I thank the Minister for explaining fully not only the terms of the Bill but the intentions of the Government in respect or our coinage.  I have no difficulty with the Bill whatsoever.  I am glad the Minister has decided to maintain and extend the Metcalfe designs.  The motif of the stag, designed by Tom Ryan, is entirely appropriate.  One of the ushers in the House has just distributed the sample coins which the Minister has arranged to have put on display.  It seems to be a very attractive coin.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to hold up the proceedings on the Bill &mdash; we are taking all Stages this morning &mdash; but let me ask the Minister one or two questions.  Is it the intention that the £1 coin will be in circulation simultaneously with the £1 note or will the £1 coin replace the £1 note after a period of overlapping which is normal?  Second, the £1 coin in the United Kingdom is a bit of a nuisance when one receives it in change.  I think it is too small.  One feels after they have chased £5 sterling that what they get back is useless and one ends up throwing it into the drawer, putting it on a shelf or trying to lose it in one's pocket.  I am glad that what has been distributed here this morning is of larger size.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the remarks made by the Minister on the weight of coins.  Our coins are too weighty.  The normal fist of change drags at the lining of one's suit and clothes.  They are far too heavy. However, we should distinguish between weight and size.  It is quite possible to reduce the weight of the coin while maintaining a reasonable size.  We should also maintain a variation in size so that if we put our hands in our pockets either in the dark or when buying a pint we can distinguish by feel alone the denomination of the coin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for dedicating a part of his speech to the problems faced by the visually impaired and for taking into account the real difficulties they encounter with coinage.  I welcome <Col N="1225" /> the fact that the design of the coin incorporates features which will make it distinguishable by touch.  I hope that this pattern will be used in respect of other coins in the future.  Obviously there must be variation in the size of coins.  As we have £1, 50p, 20p, 10, 2p and 1p coins, there must be a variation in size so that people will be able to distinguish them by touch.  This is very important.</P>
    <P>The design of our coins is very good. The original Metcalfe designs, which were introduced back in the twenties at the foundation of the State, were excellent and our coinage was much admired around the world.  I do not think the Celtic scroll designs which were introduced more recently are as attractive.  I understand the Minister intends to replace some of these designs and revert to the beautiful designs of the greyhound and various flora and fauna which made our coins distinguishable.</P>
    <P>While there may not be an increase in the cost of living there will be an increase in the cost of paying one's way at Confirmations and First Communions.  The silent collection in church will not be the same any more.  From now on people will have to give £5 as the person rattling in the £1 coin will be easily distinguishable by his neighbours.  There is always a downside to these matters.  The Minister answered a question in the House recently put down by Deputy Harte and if I recall correctly the Minister stated that the present value of £1, using 1954 as a base, is about 2.5p.  Therefore, there has been a huge diminution in the purchasing power of the pound.  The normal progress, as purchasing power goes down, is to replace notes with coins.</P>
    <P>There is only one question I have to ask on that section of the Bill.  Will the £1 coins replace the £1 notes after a period of overlapping or will the two run simultaneously?  I take the Minister's point that our £1 notes now are raggy and everywhere one goes one gets a fist of tattered notes in one's change.  That arises from the fact that the £1 note does not have great purchasing power now and denominations of notes or coins which <Col N="1226" /> have low purchasing power have a very high frequency of usage.  Because they have such a high frequency of usage it is virtually impossible now for the Central Bank to have crisp new £1 notes available on all occasions because £1 notes go around as quickly now as pennies did 30 years ago.  Consequently the note cannot take the wear and tear.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the Minister's proposal to issue coinage in ECU to commemorate the Irish Presidency.  It is an honour for a small country such as ours to have pride of place in a position in Europe even though it comes simply by right of membership when our turn comes round and we hold it for six months.  Even though it arises automatically we should note it and a good way of doing it is by issuing coins. I understand &mdash; and the Minister might confirm this &mdash; that the coinage to commemorate our Presidency is merely commemorative and will be available for coin collectors and souvenir collectors but will not be common currency.  I am not quite clear if the Minister suggested that the motif on the ECU coins will be based also on the Metcalfe designs or if he has some new design in mind.  Perhaps he would clarify what the design will be on the commemorative coins because I think it important that the sequence be maintained and that there be a similarity between the coins in circulation and any commemorative coins which are issued.</P>
    <P>I think that is all I have to say.  I welcome the Bill.  I take the Minister's point about reducing the metal content in some of our lower denominational coins. Obviously it is not feasible to maintain a situation where the face value of a coin is less than the actual metal content of the coin.  It stands to reason that the Central Bank cannot run a coinage at a loss.  I remember in regard to the two shilling piece back in the forties one examined one's change to see if one had one because it was solid silver and was worth far in excess of the face value of the coin.  It was great fun going to school as one got a great break if one got one of these because it was worth about four times the face value.  I do not think we <Col N="1227" /> should have that kind of treasure hunt with our 1p and 20p coins.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two essential aspects to this Bill.  The first is the question of the issue of the commemorative coins, the second the introduction of the £1 coin.  It is fair enough and entirely appropriate that commemorative coins be introduced to commemorate the Irish Presidency of the EC.  However, I think it borders on the indecent to include among that range a gold coin that will have a selling price of about £250.  I would have thought that the commemoration arrangements could have been very well catered for by commemorative coins in silver or in an other base metal that ordinary people who might want to spend about £5 on getting one would have been able to afford.  For the State to lay out a very considerable sum on the purchase of gold to make these 22 carat gold coins to sell to a very elitist group of people at £250 is not appropriate in the present economic circumstances.  We are not told what volume of gold would be purchased or what the cost would be and I do not think, in the economic situation we have now, with the level of unemployment and the level of poverty, that we should be producing these £250 highly specialised items for a very wealthy few.  It is not appropriate.  The commemoration is appropriate but I would have thought that if we had the coin in silver, copper or bronze it would have been entirely appropriate.  I do not know what kind of market there will be for coins of £250 <Col N="1228" /> each.  There may be quite a big market. The Minister himself indicates that he does not know either.  I often thought that the comparable area of postage stamps was never exploited by this country in the way it is exploited in many other countries.  It is a far cheaper commodity to deal with and there is a much wider interest in postage stamps purchased for various interests all around the world than perhaps there would be for coins.  This coin market has become a bit of a bandwagon.  They are produced all over the place and, in many cases, they turn out to be a complete flop and do not at all achieve the level of interest that perhaps might be anticipated.</P>
      <P>So far as the £1 coin is concerned, here again I have reservations about the advisability of it.  It seems to be the old story: the British have brought in the £1 coin so we copy that all along the line.  I do not know what it is about our approach to these things that we have to slavishly follow whatever they do in Britain in the coinage area and in many other areas as well.  My view is that it is not a great success in Britain.  Quite honestly I find it irritating &mdash; may be it is because one is not used to it &mdash; to be at the loss of the £1 note when visiting Britain.  The £1 note has a very good role to play.  It has served us well and I do not think it should be written off just yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Great care should be taken about the size and description of the new coin if there is to be one.  Many people, shopkeepers in particular, have said to me that the 20p coin, for example, has been a source of considerable disquiet and there is a great deal of complaint about it because it is much too similar to the 2p coin.  I have been shown a specimen of the £1 coin for which I am grateful to the officials.  There is no doubt about the fact that it is a very attractive piece.  I am a bit concerned again that there might be some confusion there with the 10p coin. The size is bigger certainly but not much bigger.  I have discussed the matter with a number of blind people who are concerned about it.  In some countries they have very clearly distinguished coins by having a hole in the centre.  I do not know <Col N="1229" /> whether that was ever considered but I have seen those in many countries and they certainly are a tremendous help to people who are blind or who have difficulties with their eyesight.</P>
    <P>So far as the commemorative coins are concerned I would have thought we would have been better off trying to broaden the market in that respect. There would be a much bigger market if we concentrated on silver and other less high flown metals than gold.  We would have done better out of it economically and there would be a much wider spread of these commemorative coins.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>As has been stated by the Minister and other speakers to this Bill, there are three main points in it, the proposals to issue a £1 coin, the proposal to vary the weight of the material of the 1p and 2p coins and the proposal to issue commemorative coins in ECUs to mark our Presidency of the European Council.</P>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum opens up by saying that the purpose of the Bill is to allow the Minister for Finance to issue commemorative coins denominated in European currency units.  It seems to me that a far more important provision of the Bill is the issue of the £1 coin, which is a fairly dramatic change in the currency of this State and is probably a more important aspect of what we are doing than the issue of commemorative coins.  The Bill does not confine the issue of these coins to the EC Presidency, nor does it define the coins as commemorative in any way.  It talks about the coins simply as ECU coins which will have no monetary value.  The Minister may discover a market which we are generally not aware of for the coins and if that is so then the best of luck to him and the Central Bank who presumably will bear the cost and have the benefit of whatever gain there will be.  It is curious that the memorandum describes the main purpose as the issue of commemorative coins while the Bill gives precedence to the change in our currency from £1 note to £1 coins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the proposal in relation to <Col N="1230" /> the 1p and 2p coins; I presume this change is to make them less costly to produce and less weighty to carry.  I do not know to what extent they will be of any value in a few years' time given the way the value of coins and currency generally has been declining over the years.  Maybe in a few years we will be talking about eliminating them completely because they are of very little value except as change in supermarkets and so on.</P>
    <P>The proposal for a £1 coin is following a trend which most countries seem to be pursuing presumably because coins have a longer life than paper currency.  It is obviously also because, as a result of inflation, the £1 note while not worthless, does not have the same value it had some years ago.</P>
    <P>I remember having £1 in my pocket about 30 years ago, and I could get a bus into town, take a girl friend to the pictures, get a single and a fish maybe for two afterwards and get the bus back home.  I do not know whether you could have done that in the west, but you could do it in Dublin.</P>

      <P>To realise how devalued our currency is we must look at what it can buy.  This is one reason for the proposal to change the £1 note to the £1 coin.  I have seen the sample the Minister had circulated, but it was not possible to get it out of the plastic container to test the weight or to learn what it feels like.  The £1 coin the British Treasury produced is quite heavy and bulky and will not be confused with any other coin.  Nevertheless, if you have half a dozen of them in your pocket along with other change it is quite a weight to carry. For that reason many people may be reluctant to switch over to the £1 coin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to clarify whether it is intended to withdraw the £1 note and replace it with a coin, presumably over a period of time.  I feel that for a considerable period people would prefer the <Col N="1231" /> option of one or the other.  Because the coin I saw was in a plastic container I am not sure if people who have poor sight will be at a disadvantage when handling them.  There was considerable concern when the 20p coin was introduced because it was confused easily with the 2p coin until people became accustomed to it.  Looking at the £1 coin it seems similarly sized to the 2p and 20p coins.  I wonder if sufficient thought has been given to the differentiation required.  The difficulty would not be confined to people with sight disability.  Generally when paying for items in a shop you tend to do it automatically and you need to be able to distinguish easily between one coin and another and not have to take each coin and examine it before you pay it out.</P>
    <P>I have now got the £1 coin.  I presume the Minister wants it back.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite a light coin, in terms of weight it is better than the British coin, but there seems to be a close similarity to the 20p and 2p coins. Nevertheless, I like the deer design.  I had better hand the coin back before I am tempted to put it in my pocket.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section which puzzled me most is that proposing to mint a special commemorative coin in a currency that does not exist in reality.  We are told this is proposed in order to commemorate this country's Presidency of the European Council.  A number of things need to be said about this.  I have no problem about this country marking in a special way the fact that we have the Presidency of the European Council, but it should be in proportion to the importance of the position.  It is an important role for this country to have this task, but it comes by rotation as a matter of right and we get it in the normal way when our turn comes. The largest and the smallest countries also get their turn.  It has no bearing on the competency or otherwise of the country or the State, or the persons who hold office at a particular time.  We should bear that in mind so that we do not <Col N="1232" /> became over-enthusiastic about the whole idea.</P>
    <P>There is a contrast between that and our failure last year to produce any kind of official recognition, for instance, of the French Revolution, a major event in the history of Europe.  We failed to produce even a stamp to commemorate that event which has had an impact on Europe to the present time and continues to reverberate on society in Ireland and everywhere else.  It seems extraordinary that we are capable of producing a coin or coins to mark our own Presidency of the European Council but we were not capable of producing a stamp or a coin to celebrate the French Revolution, which arguably had and will have a far greater impact on Europe than Ireland's six months Presidency of the European Council.</P>
    <P>I make these points because it appears to me that an attempt is being made to portray Ireland's Presidency of the European Council, and especially the role of the Taoiseach, as something quite out of the ordinary.  As I have said, the Government and the Taoiseach were not selected from a panel of applicants for this particular job but it came to us, quite rightly, because it was our turn.  I regret the way the Government have reacted to the Presidency with the special Presidency flags, Presidency stickers on buses and trains and at railway stations and airports and the array of press officers who, arguably are required though I am doubtful about that.  It reflects an over-reaction and a tendency towards gimmickry.  The proposal to mint this special commemorative coin is the latest in a series of gimmicks.  It has more to do with the need to boost the image of the Taioseach than with the reality of the European Council and our Presidency of it. Although it is not specified in the Bill, the way things are going, I would not be at all surprised that the commemorative coin will bear the image of our Taoiseach with the logo, Charles I of all Europe.</P>

      <P>I wonder whether reserch has been carried out to find out if there is a market for such commemorative coins particularly in the denominations as announced by the Minister where one coin is valued at as much as £250.  Given that we are already two months into the Presidency, and I presume it will be some weeks before the Bill is passed by Seanad Éireann and that it will be some weeks before the coins can actually be produced, there will be only three months remaining of our Presidency in which to sell them.  There may well be a market for them after that but it seems to me that it will be a very limited market.  The Bill states that there will be no cost to the Exchequer and that the Central Bank will carry the cost of producing the coins.  Presumably they will carry the cost of any losses as indeed they would carry any profit.  However, if there is a loss that would be an indirect cost to the Exchequer because the Central Bank return their surpluses to the Exchequer and any loss they make, whether large or small, is an indirect charge on the taxpayer because it reduces the Central Bank's contribution to Government funds.</P>
      <P>Finally, I think the cheapest coin which will cost £10 to £15 is quite expensive. Despite my criticism of what I regard as the gimmickry of this Presidency, there will be an interest among ordinary people to have a keepsake.  It seems to me that £10 to £15 is too much to expect the citizen to hand out for a commemorative coin of this type.  It would make far more sense if we had a coin costing less than £5 so that the people could purchase a keepsake of our Presidency.</P>
      <P>I would appreciate if the Minister could respond to the various points I have raised.  I hope that people will be given the option of retaining the £1 note in their purse or wallet for some considerable time and will not be forced willy-nilly to take the £1 coin on board.</P>

      <P>It is unfortunate that we have not really got enough time at our disposal to discuss this legislation because I think it has some profound significance for availing of the opportunity to take a look at our coinage and to critically examine the manner in which it has been the subject of great neglect since the foundation of the State.</P>
      <P>I welcome the legislation.  It is a great opportunity to bring into focus the need for gold coinage.  In fact, the only known gold coinage dates back to the great rebellion of 1646, a very long time ago. Our coinage has been debased over the years and has had little value if one makes a critical study from Viking through to medieval times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission set up in 1927, significantly under the chairmanship of the poet, Mr. W. B. Yeats, to examine the question of a coinage for a new emerging State published the Coinage of Saor Stát Éireann in 1928 with a foreword by the then Minister for Finance, Mr. Ernest Blythe and gives a very good account of the amount of trouble that was taken to reflect the culture and heritage of our country.  At that stage a competition was set up and artists and sculptors were invited to submit patterns and designs for the proposed coinage.  The patterns selected were, as we realise, the work of Percy Metcalfe but some other magnificant designs were also submitted, one in particular by an Italian sculptor, Mr. Publio Morbiducci.  These designs are lying dormant and have not been taken up or ever used.  Before I move on to the main point of my contribution I would like to pay tribute to Mr. Tom Ryan, the designer who, apart from being an artist of some renown, is also a keen collector of medals and has put a particular significance into marrying the design with the Metcalfe designs.  I suppose that was his brief, and he had to go along with that but he has made a great success of it.  It is a most magnificent design.  The red deer has great significance for our ecological as well as environmental protection at this time when animal life is in conflict with Homo sapiens on the planet. We are cheating on our animals to a very <Col N="1235" /> great extent.  This coin projects an animal under siege once again, an animal species that might become extinct.</P>
    <P>I think we have lost an opportunity by not grasping the significance of the total design of a new coinage for the country. Since decimalisation we tried to link in with the Metcalfe designs, or the farmyard coinage as they were called, by bringing in a large 50p coin with a very small woodcock on the front, and we also used Celtic designs, a total hotch potch of the original idea.  Let us look at the original designs.  We have seen the £1 coin this morning and I have with me a complete set of the initial designs, the Metcalfe designs with some other designs as well.  They blend in beautifully but what we have done to our coinage since 1927 at the time of decimalisation and also in other respects is wrong.  We are adding another dimension by complementing the Metcalfe designs, twisting them around and half using them to introduce other points.  This is a great mistake and the Minister for Finance should use the opportunity to introduce a totally new set of coins.  It is long overdue.</P>
    <P>I am not in any way taking from the fact that a commemorative coin is being introduced to commemorate the EC Presidency.  That represents innovative thinking; it is excellent for the country and is the right move to make.  Nevertheless, it is an isolated incident and we must think of our entire range of coinage. We are not facing up to that question the way other countries are.  We have the opportunity and I propose that the Minister for Finance should form a committee and invite Irish and overseas artists to produce designs for a whole new series of Irish coins.  This is the only way we can stop interfering with the original Metcalfe designs.</P>
    <P>The 20 pence coin is rather small which depicts the famous Goldfinder racehorse of the early 1920s which Metcalfe used for the old half crown.  This is totally out of proportion to the initial intention of that artist.  It is an insult to the artist to use his design to introduce other coins. <Col N="1236" /> It is a mistake.  It is a case of the Department of Finance not addressing themselves to the need for a new coinage and taking shortcuts.  They are not being brave about the matter and facing up to it.  We all know it is needed.  Anyone who is interested in numismatics would readily see that our nation is lagging behind other countries in that regard.</P>
    <P>On the question of philately, An Post and before them the Department of Posts and Telegraphs did grasp the nettle and became quite innovative and original in their thinking.  Although they yet have to set up a philatelic museum, nonetheless they have commemorated many important events by stamp issues.  Here we have the Department of Finance needing some kind of fillip but perhaps they are playing this one to safely.  Perhaps they feel the coinage has served us well for so many years that it should be left as it is and additions made.  That is debasing the whole principle of the original designs.</P>
    <P>This has nothing to do with the commemoration of an event and we compliment the Minister on his intention in that respect.  This is a very beautifully designed coin and will be a great international advertisement for his country. That is what coinage can do.  People will have a keepsake of this coinage and that is their prerogative.  We as Irish people like to take pride in our coinage, our art and our stamps.  The idea is good but it falls short of the need for an entirely new series of coins.  The Minister should set about bringing out a new coinage which is so long overdue.  Perhaps it would be timely to think in terms of 1992.  It would take about two years to set in place a new legal tender.  It is a pity it has been decided to issue these coins without any legal tender.  That is perhaps unfortunate, but so be it.</P>
    <P>I now refer to the collection of coins in the National Museum.  Through lack of funding, this magnificent collection which is the finest in the world is not displayed to advantage.  It is absolutely disgraceful.  There is a display which was set up 50 years ago or more from the collection of the Royal Irish Academy. We have great treasures, including gold <Col N="1237" /> ring money, Viking coins and the earliest Irish trading tokens, but these are not on display in the museum.  I request the Minister for Finance to use his good offices to set about providing funds for that purpose.  We are not talking about huge sums.  The staff are very willing and they have published many finds.  It is a huge area of neglect.  A magnificent television film was broadcast recently on the treasures of the nation, edited by Michael Ryan of the National Museum.  It is a pity we are not doing something about improving this whole area as a showcase for our nation &mdash; the coinage.</P>
    <P>W. B. Yeats was the chairman of the original commission.  Among the artists were three or four with Irish names, one with a Swedish name and an Italian. There is also the magnificent Mestrovic design which is used as a seal of the Central Bank.  It is a pity that design was not used for coinage.  There are some designs in plaster cast form in the vaults of the museum produced by Albert Power, Jerome Connor-Sheppard and some others which would still be used. Perhaps the finest of all are the Morbiducci patterns which show movement within the animal life of this country. There are many other aspects of our nation that could be depicted on our coinage. The question should be addressed immediately.</P>
    <P>I rise in protest, as I did a few years ago, on the debasing of the original designs by the attitude that our coins have served us well and we should add on a few more.  That is not the road to follow. It should not be a question of clapping ourselves on the back because we have introduced a few more coins in the Metcalfe design.  That must stop forthwith.  It is a mistake.  I cannot understand how the Department have not put the brakes on.  Looking right through the series of Irish coins and the dates and numbers one sees that most of them were issued back in 1928.  I think it was Deputy Michael Noonan who referred to the 1943 florin and he is quite right that there are other rare dates as well.  Apart from the numismatic value, it is the show case, the advertisement for the country that matter <Col N="1238" /> in coinage.  This will be much more significant within the EC.  The Minister for Finance and the Department have shown initiative.  It is a brave initiative within the context of the EC, but why not take it one step further now and avail of 1992 to bring about the necessary change.  I know from contact with artists that there is a great willingness to participate in a design of this kind.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech is very thorough and very much to the point.  I welcome the legislation.  I express my discontent quite candidly when we are talking in terms of coinage overhaul and consultation. The Government are not actually addressing that problem in the manner in which they could.  The Minister will have to take a very careful look at this whole question of coinage to see what best can be done.  The Central Bank has actually taken stands at international numismatic fairs and have been to the forefront with other countries in coinage. This shows a willingness to listen to criticism. I hope my criticism is taken to be constructive and objective and that it will be acted upon in the not too distant future.  I would like the Minister to give a commitment that he will at least examine the question of a new coinage to get away from the present hotch-potch approach. I warmly welcome the issuing of a long-overdue gold coinage.  Let us hope it will be the start of a renaissance of a rekindling of the initial spirit of W. B. Yeats when he chaired the commission for the design of our first national Irish coinage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always a great pleasure to listen to Deputy Gerard Brady, whom I have observed in this House for several years and before that on Dublin City Council.  The Deputy always makes a worthwhile contribution. He has shown his great knowledge and feeling not only for design in coinage but also in stamps.  The Deputy referred to improvements in philatelic design, in which I was glad to play a part as Minister for Communications.  That having been said, Deputy Brady has missed the central point of this legislation.  This Bill is a milestone in relation to inflation.  It <Col N="1239" /> is not a Bill we should seek to celebrate. When I first entered politics 20 years ago one could buy ten pints of Guinness for £1 but today it would scarcely buy a half a pint.  I predict that this £1 coin is a precursor of the abolition of smaller coins.  The penny coin, the 2p coin and the 10p coin will be a thing of the past before many of our children reach adulthood. That is the real significance of this Bill.  It is a regrettable memorial to the fact that our currency has lost so much of its value during the past 20 years.</P>
      <P>I am gratified to have been a member of a Government who reduced inflation from 21 per cent to 3 per cent, from twice the European average to half the European average.  Everyone knows how much our currency has lost its value. When this Bill is enacted and becomes common knowledge, depending on media coverage, the general reaction will not be an esoteric one on the merits and demerits of this design but will relate to what the £1 in the pocket will buy now and in the future.  There are international precedents for what is happening with our currency.  Not so long ago the French had to eliminate the old franc and introduce a new one several times the value of the old one.  It would be alarmist at this stage to anticipate that we will eventually have to restructure our currency unit re-value it and introduce a new punt, so weak in value has the current punt become.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the passage of the Bill but it would be wrong if Second Stage passed without us at least mourning the fact that the Bill has come about because of the inflationary spiral, a spiral brought on by ineptitude and political opportunism.  In the weeks before the 1965 general election the Taoiseach, Deputy Sean Lemass, offered the country a 12½ per cent national pay agreement, our first ever national pay agreement. This was welcomed.  That was the beginning of what was to be an inflationary spiral lasting the best part of 20 years and it was only brought under control in 1985.  The present Taoiseach, in a previous Government motored up to meet <Col N="1240" /> the national executive of the FUE, although uninvited, to twist their arms to grant more in pay increases than was justified by the economic circumstances, because another election was in the offing.  Of course it was popular because we all like to believe we will get extra money in our pay packets.  However, we were fooled because the effect of inflation is to give the impression that we have more money in our pocket but it is not good when it buys less and less.</P>
    <P>I mourn the introduction of this Bill although I suppose it is necessary because of the profligacy of the past.  It gives us an opportunity to reflect on past mistakes and to understand that in any prognosis for economic growth no progress is possible unless inflation is kept under control. I hope that this Bill will be the last to be brought into this House to adjust currency or to make changes in our coins or notes because of inflation and political opportunism in that regard.</P>
    <P>There is another significant point in connection with this proposal.  Even though we broke with sterling in 1979, this is the first time that any of our coins are distinct from the size and shape of coinage in the United Kingdom.  Perhaps the fact that our two currencies have gone their separate ways and will never again be united is the ultimate step.  I do not think that is particularly important, the fashion now is to attach ourselves to the Deutsche Mark&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Today's debate has been most constructive and useful.  I would remind Deputy Mitchell that we are dealing with reality and he should not expect miraculous changes in coinage to produce the same money as he got a few years ago for his pound.</P>
      <P>The Bill is very timely and I should like to thank the Deputies who contributed so constructively and made suggestions as to how this whole area might be dealt with in future.  It is proposed that the £1 coin will almost immediately replace the £1 note in circulation.  The reason is that if you allow the two to continue indefinitely it inhibits the changeover to the new currency.  The advice we received is that the experience in other places where similar changes were made showed that the same thing applies.  If you allow the old currency to continue the new coinage will not be acceptable.  The new £1 coin is far superior to the old £1 note and, when it is available, we will phase out the old £1 notes as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>A point was made about the necessity to facilitate the visually impaired and people who have difficulty in distinguishing coins because of their similarity. The bank have consulted the principal bodies representing the visually impaired and the coin incorporates features which will be of benefit to the blind, such an size, weight and the unique milling around the edges, in identifying coins.</P>
      <P>Deputy Taylor was critical of the fact that we concentrated on gold, which is very expensive, in relation to the commemoration coin.  He also criticised the £250 coin but there are two other denominations, the 10 ECU and 5 ECU, which will be silver and less expensive.  One will probably cost about £20 and the other £10 to £15.  It is clearly evident that we have provided for the people about whom Deputy Taylor is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unique facet of this development is that we are going into an area of coinage and commemoration which had not <Col N="1242" /> been entered into before.  This is the first step in that direction and it has been researched by the bank.  The research clearly demonstrates that there is an ever increasing market for this coin.  It has already been taken up by other countries and if we go ahead with the development it will pave the way for further developments in this area which can be a very lucrative business and provide employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>The criticism that in some respects we have over-reacted to our membership of the Community by embarking on this development is one I reject.  It is a very positive and meaningful way in which to commemorate our Presidency of the Community and it opens up an opportunity to branch into an area of activity which has not been exploited up to now and which can be very beneficial.</P>
    <P>I should like to reply to the points made by the various speakers.  Deputy De Rossa was concerned that the 1p coin and 2p coin would disappear over he next few years.  There is no intention to do away with these coins even though there have been suggestions that they are difficult to find.  However, I understand that there are about 700 million of those coins in circulation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brady made a very constructive and objective contribution, he obviously has detailed and specialist knowledge in this area and I should like to record our appreciation of the benefit of his detailed knowledge.  This is a first step and one which can be further expanded and we certainly will fully consider his views.  I do not think there is any suggestion at this stage of introducing any new coinage <i>per se.</i> However, I take his point and we will certainly have the matter examined.  His vast experience and views are worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge Tom Ryan's contribution in the design of this new coin. It is actually acknowledged on the coin itself; if your sight is good enough you can see his initials under the deer's hoofs on the left hand side.  This is in recognition and <Col N="1243" /> acknowledgement of his contribution to the design of this coin.</P>

There may be a difference of opinion about whether we should play very safely or whether we should embark on new initiatives.  We have got the advice of the Arts Council and of professional people in this area.  I would not accept that we are in any way debasing Metcalfe; in fact, it could be argued that we are acknowledging him and not only that, we are also ensuring that Metcalfe continues to dominate our coinage.  I believe that is the right thing to do because of the very valuable and worthwhile contribution he made to the original design of Irish coinage.  I would like to express our appreciation to the Deputies who contributed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide the Garda Síochána with power to take for forensic testing bodily samples such as blood, urine, saliva etc. from persons suspected of serious criminal offences. As the law stands the Garda have only very limited powers to take such samples. In the case of persons detained under the Offences against the State Act, 1939, and the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, they may take swabs from the skin or samples of hair for testing for contact with firearms or explosives.  Other than this and limited powers under the Road Traffic Acts they have no power to take bodily samples.</P>
      <P>As the value of the evidence which can be obtained by forensic tests becomes ever greater and particularly with the advent of DNA profiling, or genetic fingerprinting as it is more commonly called, I believe it is essential that the Garda should have greater powers to obtain samples from persons suspected of serious crimes for forensic testing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill will empower the taking of samples for any type of forensic test.  It does not refer to any particular test or <Col N="1245" /> tests.  However, it is undoubtedly the case that it was the recent advent of the DNA profiling test which largely highlighted the need for this legislation.  DNA profiling is considered to be the single biggest advance in the field of forensic investigation since the discovery of fingerprints at the turn of the century.  It involves a technique whereby DNA &mdash; deoxyribonucleic acid &mdash; which stores and transmits genetic information within the body, can be extracted from blood, semen, tissue or other bodily fluids and broken down into distinctive patterns or profiles which can be used to identify the individual from whom they come.  With the exception of identical twins it would seem that every person has a unique genetic code which can be used to identify that person.</P>
    <P>Since DNA is present in every part of the human body and in the blood stream, it provides a unique means for the positive identification of tissue and fluids found at the scene of a crime.  Examples of this would be semen deposited during a sex offence and blood spattered and smeared during a wide range of crimes of violence such as rape, assault, murder, house and shop breaking, crashing stolen vehicles, hit and run accidents etc.</P>
    <P>The DNA profiling test has already been used in this country in ten cases involving serious crimes, including murder and rape.  Significantly, in one of those cases the DNA test was able to establish the innocence of the person who had been identified as the rapist by the victim.  The testing in these cases was carried out in Britain under arrangements made by the Forensic Science Laboratory.</P>
    <P>DNA is still a very new technique and it has the potential for further refinement and development.  For example, I understand that work is being done on a process known as &ldquo;replication&rdquo; whereby the DNA in very small traces of human tissue or fluids which may be left at the scene of a crime and which might not now be adequate for testing can be grown to form sufficient DNA for the test.  This could mean that saliva which contains a few skin cells, now too little for DNA testing, <Col N="1246" /> could also be positively identified as to origin.  This is very significant from the point of view of criminal investigation. Saliva occurs in bite marks, sex offences, on the back of stamps, on gummed envelopes in, say, threatening letters, on cigarette ends left at crime scenes.  Similarly head and pubic hairs transferred during a crime will carry some skin cells with them and would be identifiable by this new &ldquo;replication&rdquo; technique.</P>
    <P>Our Forensic Science Laboratory expects to be in a position to undertake DNA profiling in the autumn and I am fully committed to ensuring that the laboratory is provided with the resources they need therefor.  Staff have already been trained in the technique and additional scientists are being recruited to enable DNA testing to be carried out. The specialised equipment needed for the tests is also being purchased. Negotiations have been concluded successfully with ICI, the holders of the patent, for a licence to use the vital chemical probes which form the basis of the technique.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the matter of DNA profiling I would like, however, to make one point clear.  The purpose of this Bill is to empower the Garda to obtain bodily samples for forensic testing in general. There is no reference in the Bill itself to DNA profiling or any other type of forensic test.  The value or weight which should be attached to evidence derived from such tests is a matter to be determined by the courts in the light of expert opinion.  I mention this because of the recent publicity which arose out of a case in the US throwing doubt on the accuracy of DNA testing.  I believe what happened in the United States was a result of faulty procedures and not any basic flaw in the test itself.  Be that as it may, I think it worth stating that this Bill does not represent an endorsement of any particular testing procedures.  It is the courts, as I have said, who will be sole arbiter of the value of any test.</P>
    <P>Turning to the provisions of the Bill, I do not propose to go through it section by section as it is a relatively short Bill and not, I think, overly technical.  That <Col N="1247" /> type of detailed examination can best be left to Committee Stage.  Rather, what I propose to do is to say something about the substantive issues which arise in the context of the powers being conferred on the Garda in this Bill and the manner in which these have been addressed.  I think it is important to do this because it was evident from contributions made during the passage of the Bill through the Seanad that there were certain fundamental misunderstandings about both and the purpose and the substance of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The first thing to be clear on is that this Bill is intended to give the Garda power to take samples from persons they reasonably suspect of involvement in serious crime.  Forensic evidence, particularly a test like DNA profiling, can play such an important part in establishing the guilt or indeed the innocence of a suspect that it is in the public interest that the Garda should be able to obtain samples for that purpose even if this does mean some interference with personal rights or freedoms.</P>
    <P>First, on the question of compulsion, the Bill places an obligation on suspected persons to give or allow samples to be taken.  It does not provide for persons to be given a free choice in the matter. Depending on the type of sample which is required, the Bill either empowers the Garda to take the sample using reasonable force if need to be or obliges a suspect to allow a sample to be taken if he is to avoid the possibility of an inference being drawn against him at a subsequent trial.  I am quite satisfied that if the Bill were to provide otherwise it would be very unlikely that a person suspected of a serious criminal offence, and knowing himself to be guilty, would voluntarily supply a sample to the Garda which might establish his guilt.  To be effective, therefore, there has to be this element of compulsion in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Certainly the Bill provides that an intimate or intrusive sample can only be taken with written permission from the suspect.  However, the primary purpose of this provision is not to give a suspect freedom to refuse to give a sample but <Col N="1248" /> rather is it a recognition that intimate or intrusive samples can only be taken with a suspect's co-operation if force of a degrading nature is to be avoided.  If a suspect refuses without good cause to give consent then the &ldquo;sting in the tail&rdquo; as it were is that his refusal may be taken as an inference of guilt at a subsequent trial.</P>
    <P>I agree fully that everybody, including persons suspected of criminal offences, have a right to bodily integrity and privacy and that such rights should not be lightly infringed.  However, it is an unfortunate fact that some curtailment of individual rights and freedoms has to be endured in the interests of providing society with an effective criminal justice system.  For example, many police powers with which we are familiar and which we have long accepted as necessary &mdash; such as powers of arrest, search and detention for questioning &mdash; curtail to some extent rights of privacy and freedom. The powers proposed in this Bill, in my view, to the extent that they may impinge on individual rights do so in a relatively minor way, and, to counterbalance this, the Bill contains very strict safeguards to ensure that a suspect's interest are protected and that the powers conferred on the gardaí in the Bill are not abused.  I will outline these briefly.</P>
    <P>First, the Bill provides that the taking of samples which would involve a significant interference with bodily integrity such as blood, urine, saliva, pubic hair or swabs from the mouth or other body orifices or from a genital region or a dental impression will require the written consent of the person from whom they are to be taken which, as I have explained, means that they cannot be taken by physical force.  In the case of persons under 17 years, written parental consent will be a prerequisite to the taking of such samples.</P>
    <P>Other safeguards provided in the Bill which ensure that the power being conferred is used only in appropriate cases and with full regard to human dignity are as follows: the taking of a sample must be authorised in writing by a superintendent or officer of higher rank; the <Col N="1249" /> suspected person must be informed before a sample is taken why it is being taken; intimate or intrusive samples may only be taken by a doctor or by a dentist in the case of a dental impression; where proceedings are not instituted within six months from the date the sample is taken or where a person is tried and acquitted or the charges against him are dismissed or withdrawn, the samples taken and any records identifying them must be destroyed.</P>
    <P>Another matter which caused some confusion and on which I would like to comment is the amendment made to the Bill on Committee Stage in the Seanad to extend its scope to persons in prison.</P>
    <P>The reason I introduced that amendment to the Bill was because I was advised that, from time to time, cases arise where a person who is in prison becomes the suspect of an offence unrelated to that for which he is in prison and where the gardaí would like to be able to obtain samples from him for forensic testing.</P>
    <P>For example, suppose a man is on remand or has been sentenced for, say, burglary and now, because of some evidence which has lately come to hand, he is suspected of a murder committed before his incarceration, a bodily sample for comparison with, say, blood stains found at the scene of the murder might provide important evidence of his guilt or, indeed, innocence.  I think it is reasonable that the gardaí should be able to obtain samples in such circumstances and this was the purpose of the amendment.</P>
    <P>The effect of that amendment is to put persons who are in prison, whether following sentence or on remand, in exactly the same position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the powers exercisable under the Bill as they would be in if they were not in prison. Suggestions made about this amendment that it was for the purpose of taking advantage of the fact that a person was in prison to obtain samples not otherwise obtainable or to give the gardaí &ldquo;a second bite of the cherry&rdquo; are totally unfounded. They have no substance whatsoever.  The purpose is, as I said, to put persons in <Col N="1250" /> prison in exactly the same position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the obligation to provide body samples as everybody else and nothing more.</P>
    <P>In summary, let me say that a great deal of care has been taken in drafting this Bill to provide only those powers which are essential for the gardaí if they are to be enabled to take full advantage of the forensic science techniques which have been developed.  The provisions of the Bill are, in my view, necessary, reasonable and balanced.  If any Deputy can show me that this is not so I will certainly listen to his views with care.</P>
    <P>Finally, I have not, as I said, dealt with the detail of the Bill because I think this can be better teased out on Committee Stage.  However, if there are points on which Deputies are not clear I will endeavour in my closing remarks to deal with any issues raised.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party I should like to welcome the Bill as reforming legislation which was promised by the Government some time ago.  It is, I believe, a direct response to the substance of a Fine Gael Private Members' Bill that was before the House in 1988.  Every right thinking member of society must agree that the Garda Síochána must have at their disposal the most modern scientific methods and techniques to deal with criminal investigation with a view to bringing the many offenders in our society to justice.  It is essential that our criminal law keeps pace with modern scientific developments and the Bill is an advance in that direction.</P>
      <P>It is not an exaggeration to say that the concept of genetic fingerprinting is the single greatest breakthrough in the fight against crime since fingerprinting was discovered at the turn of the century.  By the use of this technique it is possible that the samples of tissue such as blood, skin, hair and semen left at the scene of a crime can be analysed in order to identify the perpetrator of the crime and, on the other hand, to ensure the innocence of an accused in certain circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the fundamental thread that runs through the basis of our criminal <Col N="1251" /> law must always remain that people are innocent until they are proven guilty.  I would be concerned, therefore, at the need to take bodily samples for forensic testing from persons suspected of certain criminal offences in order to establish their innocence.  I should like to refer to an article in the issue of the <i>Garda News</i> of July/August 1988 on DNA finger-printing. That article referred to the powerful means of the process in determining a person's innocence.  It referred to two rape murders committed in England in 1983 and 1986.  Certain factors led police to believe that the murders were the work of the same person, a 21 year old youth, who was arrested after the 1986 attack.  Original tests showed that both murders could have been committed by the same person but that they also could have been perpetrated by 10 per cent of the male population.  However, the youth remained a strong suspect for quite some time.  Post-mortem liquid blood samples had been taken from both victims and stored at 5ºC until the time of the DNA analysis.  Dried bloodstains, semen stains, pubic hair and vaginal swabs were all kept at -20ºC.  Tests carried out in 1986 by Dr. Jeffreys, whom I understand was the pioneer of the whole process, on the stored samples and a blood sample taken from the suspect conclusively excluded the youth as the rapist. He was freed and investigations led to the successful conviction of another person.</P>
    <P>I would be somewhat concerned about the need for people to undergo these tests in order to prove their innocence having regard to the golden thread that runs through our system which is that a person is innocent until proven guilty.  Overall, it is very important that the gardaí are provided with the necessary facilities in legislation to deal with the increase in crime of a very serious nature.  The growing interest in genetic fingerprinting began when a man charged with rape was convicted in Wales in 1987 on the basis of evidence from the genetic tests.  The technology soon spread across the Atlantic, labelled as being the &ldquo;law enforcement tool of the future&rdquo;.  As well as aiding <Col N="1252" /> the forces of law and order in the fight against crime, as the Minister stated, DNA fingerprinting represents a major breakthrough in identification techniques and experts to date have pointed to it as carrying virtually absolute proof.</P>
    <P>Apart from cases of murder, rape and assault it is also useful in determining paternity cases and, therefore, is of tremendous importance in maintenance and family law cases.  Similarly, as far as immigration disputes are concerned, the British Home Office have recently adopted the procedure with some success where citizens wish to prove their relationship with persons living outside that jurisdiction.  In rape cases where a man claims he had nothing to do with the woman, a sample of blood or semen can be tested to give identification that the authorities state to be absolute.</P>
    <P>However, I would be quite concerned about the matter of training and I hope the Minister will elaborate on that issue when replying to the debate.  It is essential that we should have adequate training facilities to work the legislation effectively. I trust that the Minister will assure the House he is satisfied that the forensic science laboratory is sufficiently equipped with the technology and the professionalism to carry out the task having regard to the serious consequences resulting on conviction.  I should like to ask the Minister to be specific as to the nature of the training programme in which gardaí have already participated, in particular where the training took place, the number of hours involved and the number of personnel involved.</P>
    <P>I note that ICI have a patent on the technique and I would ask the Minister is he is satisfied that a sufficient detailed level of discussions have taken place with that company with a view to establishing a centre of operation in this State.  I would ask the Minister to state the exact relationship that the Garda Síochána will have with ICI, a private company, and whether or not there is any other company worldwide with a patent from which we might develop our technique in this <Col N="1253" /> country, or, are we bound to a long lasting relationship with ICI on this technique?</P>
    <P>Experts in DNA fingerprinting maintain that the tests are practically foolproof and with the exception of identical twins, no two genetic fingerprints are the same.  The chances of science being wrong are scores of millions to one.  Dr. Alec Jeffreys, to whom I have referred earlier, is of the opinion that blood is the key and that in criminal trials in the future the DNA molecules extracted from blood cells will decide a person's guilt or innocence. However, a contrary opinion has appeared and I would like the Minister to give the House reassurance in so far as it has been stated that specific samples of blood contain a very small amount of DNA and that perhaps conclusive evidence is best achieved by matching samples other than blood, such as urine, pubic hair, saliva, hair or material found under fingernails or dental impressions. It would appear that in fact blood would be the least reliable of sources on which to base a conviction.  This being the case, I would counsel caution that, perhaps, the breakthrough in murder investigations that we feel this legislation will lead to, may not be as real in practice as we would hope.  There is a difficulty as far as that is concerned, I know it is very technical and I do not profess to have a monopoly of wisdom or knowledge in that regard and perhaps the Minister does not have either.  Perhaps it is a matter which we could deal with at greater length on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Further, I would be concerned about the speed with which the samples having been taken are processed.  How long can a particular sample remain fresh&mdash; for want of a better word?  How long can the sample be regarded as useable?  These are matters that, perhaps, would be more applicable to the regulations, which I understand the Minister is empowered to make under section 5 of the Bill.  I believe these regulations are of extreme importance and it is a pity that we do not appear to have an opportunity of discussing them prior to the enactment of this Bill.  I note that section 5 (3) states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1254" /> Every regulation made under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the regulation is passed by either such House within the next twenty-one days on which that House has sat after the regulation has been laid before it, the regulation shall be annulled...</P>
    <P>I accept that this is, perhaps, the practice of the Executive in many items of legislation but in dealing with legislation which has such far-reaching consequences I would hope that the Minister might consider placing the regulations by means of affirmative resolution and that we would have an opportunity of discussing the very important aspects of the legislation.</P>
    <P>I referred at the outset to a Fine Gael Bill along the lines of what we have here today.  It must be noted that it was envisaged that the regulations would have been taken at the same time as the Bill rather than passing the Bill first and then allowing the regulations to go through without adequate and detailed discussion.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will elaborate on the matter of medical supervision in respect of all examinations, but my particular concern would be on the question of time.  How soon would the sample go? Where would the sample go?  How long would it take for the sample to be processed? Does the Minister envisage a situation that while this timescale is elapsing the accused would remain in custody if that is the case?  It is probably fair to say that that will be the case.  In that event it is very important that the sample process would take place with the minimum amount of delay.  Scientists and other experts who have commented on the technique over the last couple of years have formed the opinion that the evidence produced by matching the genetic material is indisputable.  The chances of many matchings occurring at random, may be one in 100 millon.  However, while we might accept that the technology is foolproof, we must certainly <Col N="1255" /> question the proficiency and expertise of the tester.  I note that the Minister referred to a case in the United States, involving one Joseph Castro, a 38 year old janitor, accused of killing a neighbour and her two year old daughter.  Perhaps the Chair would permit me to quote from an article in the international magazine <i>Time</i> of June 1989&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The quotation from <i>Time</i> of June 1989 is as follows:</P>
      <P>According to the prosecutors, a portion of DNA extracted from a spot of blood on Castro's watch matched DNA taken from the murdered mother.  The chance of such a match occurring at random, said scientists called by the prosecution, was 1 in 100 million.</P>
      <P>But the defense enlisted scientists of its own to review the evidence.  A panel of experts from both sides eventually agreed that the evidence presented was &ldquo;not scientifically reliable enough.&rdquo; They did not say the DNA analysis was invalid but asserted that in this case it was not nearly so precise as the prosecution claimed.  One expert calculated that there was a 1 in 78 chance that the blood on Castro's watch was not from the victim.  That may be a small chance, but to the defense it constituted a distinct shadow of a doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unlike traditional finger-printing which is done by police experts in official laboratories DNA testing is carried out by many private firms who specialise in the <Col N="1256" /> technique and the courts have no direct control over the quality of their work. The tests in the Castro case were performed in 1987 by the oldest and largest company in the business, Lifecodes of Valhalla, New York.  The techniques envisaged by the Minister in this legislation are broadly similar in so far as the determining process will be undertaken by a private company.  Because of that we may have some justifiable fears.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the famous Australian case in 1989 where a member of the police force was brought up on a number of charges: violent rapes and assaults in the Sydney area.  He was submitted to a number of blood sampling tests.  I am looking at an article, not in <i>Time magazine</i> but in the <i>Garda Review</i> about which I hope Deputy McCartan would not harbour the same reservations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is improving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as this particular case was concerned the prosecution did not proceed and it was noted that the evidence on which they were originally relying was not sufficient to warrant a conclusion.  I understand that all charges were dropped.  While I would say that the experts are telling us on the one hand that the evidence is indisputable and conclusive, nevertheless, I feel, as the Minister has stated in the course of his contribution, that the accuracy is still advancing.  I quote from the Minister's contributions as follows:</P>
      <P>The DNA is still a very new technique and it has potential for further refinement and development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that we keep a close eye on this further refinement and development and that we would still have some reservations in that regard.  Both the United States case and the Australian case raise a number of questions.  There is a need for an official set of regulations and strict standards in respect of laboratory procedures. I hope that these strict standards would apply to ICI and other private companies with which our Government would be dealing.  I ask the Minister, <Col N="1257" /> therefore before concluding the debate, to provide us with his views on whether or not these regulations provide for satisfactory standards.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister tell us if provison will be made to enable an accused to have an independent laboratory test carried out and if such a test would have to be paid for by the accused?  I wish to refer to a document which has come into my possession entitled &ldquo;Genetic Fingerprinting &mdash; Republic of Ireland&rdquo; produced by Cellmark Diagnostics and ICI dated 1 January 1989 which outlines the fees payable for this service.  For example, it will cost £165 to have a blood sample tested in a paternity case and in forensic cases a fee of £115 will be charged for the extraction of DNA from each specimen of forensic evidence other than a standard blood sample.  Expert witness fees for any court appearances that may be required will be charged at £350 per day and scientific examination of genetic fingerprints produced by other laboratories will be charged at £65 per hour.  What relevance can be attached to this?  I also ask the Minister to tell us if provision will be made to allow for an independent laboratory test to be carried out and, if so, dare I bring in this process and if the accused is in receipt of legal aid, which is quite common, will there be a responsibility on the Government to extend the scheme so as to allow the accused to have an independent test carried out?</P>
    <P>This legislation grants considerable powers to the Garda Síochána which I have no doubt will be exercised with extreme care and caution.  I am glad to note that human rights groups, such as the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, are not opposed to this legislation.  I hope that samples, allowable under subsections (1), (5), (6) and (7) of section 2, will only be taken in connection with very serious crimes.  The legislation does not make provision for this but I hope in practice that such samples will only be taken in cases involving murder or rape.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the manner in which an interview might take place with an accused with a view to taking a sample under section 2.  I again refer to <Col N="1258" /> the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 and to the importance of providing video and taperecording facilities in all Garda stations not only to protect an accused but also the Garda.  We have been somewhat tardy in providing the necessary facilities in Garda stations as envisaged under the Criminal Justice Act.  Unfortunately, the Government have not addressed this matter.</P>
    <P>I welcome the safeguards which have been included in the Bill.  A sample may only be taken if a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent authorises it to be taken.  In certain circumstances samples may only be taken with the appropriate written consent and in others only by a doctor or a dentist in the case of dental impressions. These safeguards are to be welcomed. Section 3 (1) relates to the inferences that may be drawn from a refusal to give a sample.  Without this section the legislation would be flawed.</P>
    <P>Overall, I welcome this legislation and am confident that the Garda Síochána will be able to avail of modern scientific techniques in criminal investigations to identify perpetrators of serious criminal acts.  It is essential that not only do the Garda Síochána have the necessary backup facilities but that, in addition, our criminal law reflects and keeps pace with modern scientific developments.  My one major reservation relates to the regulations which will be made.  I would like the Minister to comment before this Bill completes its passage through this House on the detailed procedures which must be followed in the taking of a sample having regard to the fact that criminal law will never be the same again and juries will convict solely on the basis of scientific evidence.  It would not be good if the House were to allow regulations to be put in place without debating them.  I hope the Minister will have a re-think and lay the regulations before the House when we would have an opportunity to debate them to ensure that the best interests of all parties are taken into consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party support this Bill and the other initiatives taken by the Minister in his fight to apprehend wrongdoers.  Since I have become Labour Party spokesperson on Justice a large amount of legislation has been brought before the House by the Minister. While we may have some reservations we welcome the initiatives he is taking to ensure that the Garda Síochána have the necessary powers to apprehend criminals.  There has been a huge increase in crime in recent years, particularly in the Dublin metropolitan area which takes in, as I have said on several occasions, not only the Dublin area but areas along the east coast.  The rise in crime in my constituency is a source of concern for all of us.  There is an obligation on us to support any Government who take steps to deal with the most difficult problem.</P>
      <P>As I said, this legislation is welcome. It was the subject of a very detailed and excellent debate when introduced in the Seanad last year.  Many of the concerns voiced there have been answered by the Minister today.  It is not necessary to express those concerns again today as the Minister has widened the section dealing with safeguards to ensure that the need to protect civil rights is uppermost in the minds of Ministers when introducing legislation.  In the fight against the perpetrators of serious crime the Garda Síochána should be able to avail of all the modern scientific technology and be in possession of the most modern equipment in order to apprehend criminals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the debate on the Larceny Bill, 1989 a short time ago I complained that the Minister was not attacking the modern criminal who is able to avail of the most modern up-to-date advances in technology to such a degree that the Garda Síochána are not able to cope as they lag behind.  The Minister is obviously accepting that there is a need to keep pace with developments in technology in supporting the Garda Síochána.  When fingerprinting was introduced back at the turn of the century and accepted by the courts many questions were asked.  I am sure that in the debate which took place in the House of Commons at that time <Col N="1260" />&mdash;some of us found ourselves back there this week &mdash; the same concerns were brought forward about safeguards as we will repeat here today.  The acceptance of fingerprinting has advanced the capability of solving serious crime over the last century.  There is now a more modern, more acceptable, more foolproof way than has been in practice, in other countries around the world and is now being introduced here.  Genetic fingerprinting is something that should and must be introduced because it takes the advantages of modern technology into the area of crime detection.  Its introduction in this Bill as being acceptable as proof before our courts is something we all welcome.  It is very timely.</P>
    <P>The facilities which I am sure are scarce, if not totally absent, at the moment in this country for processing this method of fingerprinting are being provided by the Minister in his estimate and there will, of course, be a cost.  There are always costs involved when new methods are introduced.  I am glad to see that the Minister is making provision for them so that these facilities can be provided as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Each individual is genetically unique. With the possible exception of twins, triplets and the like, this uniqueness means that the methods that are being introduced in the fight against crime are far ahead in their accuracy than the slightly cruder normal fingerprinting.  Nevertheless regulations must be there for the taking of samples whether of blood, semen, hair or whatever.  This introduces problems for the individuals who may be suspected of a crime.  The Minister has endeavoured to answer this problem.  He said that the refusal of consent of a person might compromise their case.  That caused me a little bit of concern because there are individuals who despite being in sufficient pain may feel it an indignity to present themselves for inspection to a dentist or a medical practitioner, and with regard to giving samples in a Garda station, such individuals might find themselves prejudicing their case by refusing to give such samples.  There are other individuals like haemophiliacs, who <Col N="1261" /> might want their doctor to be present before any type of sample is taken.  I hope the Minister will provide for exceptional cases that are well founded.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the spread of AIDS throughout the world and this country in particular.  I did not hear the Minister make any mention of it.  I hope the Minister would be aware that members of the force and the staff that have to carry out the taking of samples in their investigations are at particular risk where AIDS might be transferred through the taking of these samples.  I hope the Minister can assure the House that nobody will be at risk due to lack of knowledge of whether or not people are HIV positive, because this new technique might accidentally involve people who are totally innocent in contracting the AIDS virus.  It is a point that the Minister might refer to when he is replying.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that all of us in this House want to see modern advances being introduced to apprehend criminals.  I welcome the Bill on behalf of the Labour Party. Because of the level of debate in the Seanad I, as a layman, do not need to explain why I accept the Bill or go into all the concerns we might have, but I believe that after several years of use this method will be accepted as fingerprinting was accepted in the past as the safest, most accurate method of identification.</P>
    <P>In the past, clever legal brains have managed to get offenders off charges of drunken driving and the like on a technicality. It would seem that this area will be a whole minefield of technicalities for our clever legal people to latch on to in an effort to beat the new technology.  I hope the Minister will be able to reduce that possibility when new technology, which will obviously depend on scientific evidence to a great extent, is introduced. It would be pointless to introduce this if there were methods to frustrate the whole concept.  I would ask the Minister to comment on that.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of this.  It is a development that is not overdue but necessary.  It has been proved and accepted in civilised and democratic countries.  Its introduction here is timely.  I commend the <Col N="1262" /> Minister for introducing it and I can assure him of our support with perhaps a few queries on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise on behalf of The Workers' Party to welcome the debate on this important issue not just of genetic fingerprinting but the whole question of enabling the Garda with better and more comprehensive powers to deal with the taking of genetic samples.  In the context of developments of science and technology it is obviously a timely and important debate to undertake.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I want to indicate that The Workers' Party have very grave reservations about the structure and provisions of the Bill and I hope that the Minister will have regard to the points we have to make and seriously address them.  In the event that there are no improvements introduced into the structure of the legislation in the context of the wider powers for the Garda in the taking of samples and also in regard to genetic fingerprinting as a process of identification, I regret to say that The Workers' Party will have no hesitation in opposing the Bill on Second Stage and, indeed, on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is general agreement with the principle that the Garda should have powers to detain in certain circumstances and to obtain samples for the purposes of forensic testing.  There is no difficulty with that as a principle.  It already exists and there are many areas of Garda investigation where under the law they have done so and will continue to do so.  A topical area, which will perhaps be far more topical by the time the day is out, is that of blood testing and the taking of samples of blood from persons who drive cars when they should not.  Fraud is another area where there is clearly a need for the expansion of our law to keep abreast of developments so that the Garda can equip themselves to deal with crime as it emerges and develops in a modern society.  A glaring example is that of the Bailieborough Co-op investigation where a squad of Garda sat in there for many long months investigating the records and goings-on in that co-op and <Col N="1263" /> came out with nothing; yet within weeks of their investigation the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme could illustrate it to us all on the screen.  The big question is, are we equipping the Garda to keep abreast of developments, with the devices to deal with the computerised, technological society in which we live so that they can address the more sophisticated criminal of the modern day.  The &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme on Gallagher again illustrates this difficulty for us, when in one jurisdiction that arch criminal was brought before the courts, prosecuted and made to answer for the huge fraud that he visited upon many people in this community, yet he can walk the streets in Dublin and elsewhere free from any imposition of justice after a long period of time; and when that programme could illustrate vividly the extent of his crimes and frauds.  It is a great pity. In any event in this legislation we are beginning to recognise that society is becoming much more technically sophisticated and that the means available to the Garda, not just in the area of genetic fingerprinting but elsewhere, are expanding daily.  It is proper that we address the central issue and codify, bring under one Act, the powers available.  In general therefore, there are no difficulties.</P>
    <P>However, I am concerned about some other aspects.  First there is the question of inferences.  My worries here are very much exemplified in the Minister's comment when describing the sting in the tail phenomenon it represents.  He said a refusal may be taken &ldquo;as an inference of guilt&rdquo;.  I am concerned that we are going too far when we say the only inference to take from a refusal or a failure is one of guilt.  That is the difficulty I see in legislating into our law the right to draw inferences from certain events.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh has mentioned the problem of haemophiliacs.  We have the problem of people who, perhaps, have reservations for religious or other reasons about submitting themselves to certain examinations.  The Bill as circulated does not suggest that the only inference we can draw in those circumstances is one of <Col N="1264" /> guilt.  The Bill is drawn wider and suggests it is a matter for the judge at the return for trial order or the jury or judge at the trial stage, to drawn an inference and that is all, but it is the Minister's declaration that that inference is one of guilt that worries me and helps to illustrate the problems that can arise about relying upon this type of legislative approach to inferences.  We should consider whether it is not better simply to leave it for the jury to consider and adduce it in evidence. Tell the jury that when the person in the police station was confronted with the request he or she refused, and leave it there.  Why then go to the next step of trying to impose a diktat on the jury, by telling them they can draw an inference? They can do that on all facts presented to them.  Their duty is to try the issue of guilt or innocence according to the evidence and the facts.  I wonder whether we want to legislate for this at all.  The sanction or sting in the tail is there.  In this context where we have legislated for this kind of inference to be drawn under the 1984 Act, has the Minister any information what extent the drawing of inference, refusing to give information or failing to comply with certain inquiries have been relied upon in subsequent criminal prosecutions?  My impression &mdash; it is only that &mdash; is that it has not been relied upon very often because it is considered at times to be an effort to direct and juries often tend to recoil from the diktat being imposed.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that has to be addressed but maybe it cannot be dealt with in a Bill.  There is a clear pattern in the use of section 30 &mdash; and I have no doubt in time section 4, once the Garda have come to grips with the full complexities under the 1984 Act &mdash; for detention purposes as an information gathering exercise.  That is the only inference that can be drawn from the statistics which show that a very small proportion of people detained under section 30 are subsequently charged.  It is clearly an indication that time and time again the powers available to the Garda, coupled with powers to take samples or to seek account of movements, have been used <Col N="1265" /> merely as information gathering exercises.</P>
    <P>There is a very important civil liberty issue here.  It arose in the Charles Self murder investigation where the Garda had a very explicit and absolute &mdash; if one can use that term in the area of evidence &mdash; piece of evidence, that of the thumbprint left at the scene in the blood of the victim and the only person who could have left that there was the person who perpetrated the horrible murder. Subsequently the line of investigation followed included assembling all those persons in the Dublin and wider community who were considered by the Garda to fit into a general category, the gay community.  That example is illustrated by the very high flown brochures presented by Cellmark Limited, a subsidiary of ICI, when they talked about the Leicestershire case where the police, in order to conclude their investigations, required over 5,000 male members of the two villages in the area where two girls had been brutally murdered to submit to DNA sampling and examination.  It is a point.  To what extent will these technological facilities and powers be an invitation and an opportunity for the gardaí to engage in information gathering as opposed to serious crime investigation?</P>
    <P>The authorisation for the taking of samples is another matter of concern and it works into the consideration of existing experiences under section 30 where again the extension order can be signed by the Superintendent of the Garda Síochána and certain samples can be taken from the person in detention at the authorisation or direction of the superintendent or higher officer.  Again I have reservations about that power being exercised within the remit of the Garda.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider whether the power of direction or authorisation should emanate from a member of the Judiciary, that is, a member of the District Court.  That is the position at the moment with regard to the taking of fingerprints in many cases, such as fraud; the same applies to writing samples.  The Garda officer must resort to the court on <Col N="1266" /> sworn information for the power to get the warrant to take the sample.  The Garda must go to the court when it is time to seek a search warrant to enter and search a person's house.  Indeed, to arrest in some instances the officer must on sworn information, put on written record his or her belief or reasons for acting or seeking the power to proceed. There is no reason that we cannot rely on this.</P>
    <P>There is a general availability of judges of the District Court.  The person who is to be challenged with the request for the sample will be in Garda custody under section 30, if needed, for 24 hours at the start and 48 hours subsequently.  Under section 4 the person can be detained in certain circumstances for longer than the six hour period.  Therefore, in terms of opportunity or convenience, there is no reason the officer could not and should not be asked to go to the District Justice on sworn information for authority to take the sample.  The importance of that is that the record will be lodged with a court; a judge will have the opportunity to supervise the issuing and can ask questions of the officer if necessary &mdash; in practice it does not happen &mdash; but even the simple procedure of going to an independent authority in open court or indeed in the office of a judge, lodging information sworn on oath and explaining the reasons that the powers need to be exercised and then lodging the document as a matter of record, is an important safeguard of civil liberties not provided for in the Bill.  The concept that the authorisation can be given orally as provided for and subsequently and as soon as possible after ratified in writing is a disaster. It will simply be retrospective authorisation. The officer will proceed for convenience or speed and with the assistance of the superintendent get the written record subsequently.  Who is to say whether the superintendent had been contacted to give oral authorisation in the first place?  If they are not prepared to go to the District Court for the authority the notion that the authority can be given orally and subsequently ratified in writing <Col N="1267" /> does not have regard to or respect for the notion of safeguarding or protecting the individual.  I urge the Minister to look at that matter before Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The question of the destruction of records is also raised in the Bill.  I am curious to know why the records of a person who is made answerable to the courts for an offence and found under the 1907 Probation of Offenders Act to have committed the offence in such circumstances as not to warrant a conviction but marking the fact that the person is placed on probation will be retained for three years whereas the records of a person who is arrested and detained on suspicion of a serious offence will be destroyed in a far shorter period if there is no charge within six months and the court proceedings are completed within 21 days &mdash; if my memory serves me right. I wonder why an extraordinary lengthy period is retained for somebody dealt with under the 1907 Probation of Offenders Act?</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan dealt with the question of regulations and I wholeheartedly support him on the idea that regulations should be in the affirmative form requiring action by the Houses of the Oireachtas before they are passed into law.  It is important that we have a debate on the regulations before they are put in place because they are important issues.  I know there is the omnibus introductory clause to the regulations but they should be expanded to deal specifically with the reception, retention and storage of samples taken and their ultimate destruction when that has been decided on.  On Committee Stage I will be asking the Minister to expand the regulations to cover grounds that are not covered but more particularly to allow this House to play an active role in reviewing the regulations once drafted as was the experience in the 1984 legislation when the regulations of 1986 were circulated and were made available for comment not just in this House but generally.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides us with the opportunity to debate again the whole question of police station oriented investigation. <Col N="1268" /> There is absolutely no doubt that as we make advances in technology and enable the Garda to take samples right across the board to assist them in their investigations of crime, there will be an inevitable drift towards the police station becoming, if it has not already done so, the centre of criminal investigation generally. The idea of gardaí out on the street knocking on doors interviewing members of the public, being footsore and weary, is a concept of the past.  We are moving towards the process of investigation that is concentrated in the police station. Again this forces us to address the issue of the rights of persons once detained in Garda custody on suspicion of crime.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the Labour Party's Private Members' Bill dealing with the need to review those rights I made the point, and I want to repeat it again, that as we move towards the concentration of investigations at the police station, we must invade the same place with protections and rights for the person detained.  Let us remember that he or she is at all of those stages an innocent person and should remain so until otherwise proven.  Consequently it is essential that video and tape recordings of all transactions involving suspects in police stations be established.  We provided for this in the legislation of 1984. The Barra Ó Briain committee recommended it in the seventies and I understand this matter is under active consideration by the Martin committee. While not seeking in any way to anticipate the final recommendations of that committee, if video and tape recordings are re-emphasised by them in their recommendations it is essential that those recommendations be acted on without delay and that they be instituted and established as early as possible throughout the country.  All samples taken by the Garda from persons in custody must be recorded on video and audio tape. We must extend the obligations on the Garda under regulations not simply to questioning and answering but to the taking of samples under this Bill or indeed any other legislation and that should be done in full view of a video <Col N="1269" /> tape and within the reception of an audio tape recorder.  That is the basic requirement.</P>
    <P>We are currently considering the video recording and video taping of interviews and questions as a means of addressing the potential for a dishonest garda.  Look at the opportunities that must be available to that person if he or she is thwarted in questioning procedures to then interfere, meddle or abuse any samples that may be taken or relied upon in subsequent prosecutions.  What is to stop the officer, having taken the samples, from stepping out of the interview room out of the view of the detained suspect and do whatever is necessary to infect the sample, exhibit or interfere or tamper with the evidence?  Not only should the sample be taken in full view of the video recording and in the full reception of audio recording but the sealing of the sample should take place in the same circumstances so that whatever is taken should be put into bags or other receptacles and then sealed there.  Again I recommended to the Martin committee that evidence taken outside of these standards should not be relied on or allowed in evidence unless the prosecution can establish extraordinary circumstances or excuse.  If there are technical or other reasons or problems arising that we cannot agree on in this procedure, I contend that a sample should not be taken from the suspect detained other than in the presence of his or her solicitor.  Again there is no reason that this cannot be achieved, given the availability of lawyers and modern communications and the fact that the suspect may be detained for any number of hours necessary under the provisions of section 30 and section 4 of the 1984 Act.  I do not see any difficulty with this provision.  I have been present in Garda stations many times over the years when samples were taken from suspects. It is far different from being present when a suspect is being questioned.  I do not argue that a solicitor should be present during questioning.  It is an invidious task to be there because of the likelihood or potential of interrupting or interfering with the line of questioning or inquiry but <Col N="1270" /> that does not arise where the issue is the taking of sample or a swab and observing that they are put into a sealed receptacle where they cannot be subsequently interfered with.  Equally it should be provided for in the legislation as under the Road Traffic Acts that, where possible, a sample should be divided and made available to the suspect's representative, guardian or legal adviser.  I acknowledge and respect that in many instances this may not be possible, for example, the taking of a sample of saliva is difficult to do but in virtually all other instances, for example, the taking of a dental impression, two should be taken and one handed to the defence.  Likewise, in relation to a sample of hair, adequate should be taken and some handed to the defence.  A sample taken of blood or any other matter should be divided and handed to the defence or his representative.  That should be the standard provided for in legislation.</P>
    <P>The second major issue is the security and safeguarding of samples once taken and who should retain them.  It should be a thing of the past that a police officer would put samples into the locker in the police station or bring them home or, like the unfortunate Professor Harbison, given the circumstances and pressures under which he has to work, carry them around in his motor car for days or even weeks, as emerged in the Kerry babies inquiry.  The sample, once sealed in the presence of the suspect under scrutiny of the video recording or of the suspect's legal representative, should as soon as possible be conveyed and stored in a central registry of exhibits which should be established at the State Forensic Laboratory. That should be a prerequisite to the introduction of any of these powers. There the samples should be logged and held in a registry.  Access to them by officers for the purpose of further examination should be logged and the exhibit should be supervised by a designated person of the laboratory who is to be considered the examination officer for that case.  This is a basic requirement for proper procedures in this area.</P>
    <P>These proposals are eminently sensible <Col N="1271" /> and reasonable, having regard to the fact that we have a small island population. We are not dealing with a vast range of requirements.  We have one police force, not multiple police authorities which might make the establishment of a central registry complicated.  We have a single State Laboratory centrally located in Dublin.  I see no difficulty in the implementation of these proposals, which are essential if not indispensable. The more we develop forensic science in the process of criminal investigations, the more essential it is to ensure a clinically controlled and safeguarded procedure for all persons subjected to these processes.</P>
    <P>In the context of genetic finger printing it becomes more essential.  Often a court will be asked to accept the findings of a forensic scientist in regard to genetic finger printing and in other contexts where the evidence is practically incomprehensible, not only to the judge and jurors but to the lawyers employed in the prosecution and defence of the case. Often the evidence will be invisible for all practical purposes because of the minuteness of the sample involved.  In many instances the evidence will be based upon a sample which was effectively destroyed in the process of its examination in the laboratory.  In those circumstances it is essential that whatever is taken from the suspect be delivered, sealed and uninterfered with, to the forensic science laboratory, where it then comes under the control of forensic experts.</P>
    <P>Currently in the criminal courts there are investigations into such matters as firearm residue.  Policemen in the course of their duties may handle their firearms and often discharge them.  They then take swabs from the hands of suspects to establish whether they may have had contact with firearms.  While they use plastic gloves while taking these swabs, the subsequent handling of the samples can cause huge problems of cross-contamination. We must guard against that with the greatest diligence.</P>
    <P>The proposals I am making as essential prerequisites to the implementation of <Col N="1272" /> this legislation are practicable and will not involve any great expense.  Even if some expense is involved, it will be a cheap price to pay in the cause of fair procedure and ultimately fair trial. Unless there are some assurances from the Minister that the Government and the Minister, in consultation with the Garda and the State Laboratory, are working towards this type of clinical, fair procedure, The Workers' Party will not be happy to allow this kind of law to be put in place and we will oppose it.</P>
    <P>A related question concerns the destruction of the sample.  Very important issues arise.  We would argue that a store must be established at the Central State Laboratory for all samples taken in the course of criminal investigation by the police and that the people in charge of the laboratory should in good time be charged with the destruction of the record.  This raises the issue: who has the property of the sample once taken?  This is not an unreal argument.  Under the 1984 Act there is provision for the destruction of fingerprint photographs and other records.  I have been involved as a practitioner in a row between a district superíntendent's office and the special detective unit in Dublin Castle. The district superintendent's office were quite happy to abide by the law and destroy the records if necessary but the special detective unit said they wanted to keep them for their records and ongoing investigations.  The issue of ownership and control of samples is crucial.  It is vital that the law should not be thwarted in regard to destruction by inter-unit rivalries within the Garda Síochána and by people who think they are above and beyond the law simply because they are called the special detective unit or some other crack name.</P>
    <P>The question is whether we are to endorse in the long term, if not sooner, a central bank of information.  Is there an argument from the Garda, as is the case in Britain, that we should be building up a deoxyribonucleic acid profile of our population?  I am utterly opposed to that concept.  We should not even contemplate it.  I have no doubt the Garda <Col N="1273" /> will be arguing that this is an effective way of keeping records and tabs on the so-called criminal community.  It is a dangerous invasion of civil liberty if that is the road we are to go down.  Unless we have a centrally appointed responsible person for the reception of these exhibits who is equally charged with their destruction in due course the samples can ultimately be abused.  That brings in the question of duplication of results and their retention.  There is a general suspicion that even where samples are destroyed, copies are available in sections of the Garda for ongoing investigations. This situation can be strongly guarded against if my proposals are implemented in some shape or form.  For that reason it is important that the Minister gives some response to this before we pass the Second Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In relation to authorisation, I made the point that it must only be a judge of the District Court who can authorise the taking of these samples, recognising that there needs to be a balance between the needs of the Garda to investigate and the rights of an innocent person in custody to be protected.  That formula is important in the context of the amendment introduced by the Minister in the Seanad on powers to deal with a person in prison. A person in prison is there under order of the court and is technically in the custody of the court through the authority of the High Court handed down in the Constitution.  That is a way of drawing the balance.  Currently a member of the Garda Síochána cannot have access to a person in prison without order of the court in certain circumstances or without the authority of the Governor and the consent of the person.  Often a garda goes to see a prisoner and as soon as the prisoner realises he is to be investigated by a member of the Garda he walks out. It is important to empower the Garda to take samples from persons in custody. There is nothing wrong with that in principle but the way to respect the legal status of the person who is technically still in the custody of the court is to go to the judge of the District Court and ask for authority to proceed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1274" /> I do not accept as central what is perceived to be the central issue of this Bill. I have dealt with some of the more important issues in relation to taking samples. The other great issue relates to genetic fingerprinting.  We have given far too much regard to the deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA process.  It has been heraided by ICI and its subsidiary, Cellmark Diagnostics as the breakthrough of the century.  It is far too soon to give it that great plaudit.</P>
    <P>I was concerned when I heard a Deputy refer to the thumbprint impression as being slightly crude, something much less sophisticated than the DNA process.  As things stand the thumb impression is a far more sophisticated identifying process than the DNA process.  The thumbprint is and has been proved to be unique to every individual.  In the history of police investigation two people have never been found to have identical fingerprints.  The fingerprint can be photographed <i>in situ</i> before it is lifted.  The process is clearly understood by lawyers, defendants, jurors and judges.  The thumbprint can be presented in the form of an enlarged photograph with comparison charts and it is clearly understood. The fingerprint is eminently challengeable.  It is open to the defendant to come to court and, through and expert, at least have an opinion on what is being presented.  The fingerprint is the benchmark of the approach we should take to forensic evidence and its reception into trial procedures in our jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>We must try to achieve the same balance in the DNA process.  Balance is singularly absent in the current procedures presented to us from the DNA process. In this regard I acknowledge the assistance I had from practitioners in England and the US who have worked the DNA process and the few in Dublin who have been involved in cases where DNA evidence has been presented.  In January the <i>Garda News</i> talked about five cases where it has been used.  The number of cases has now increased to ten and the number where it is being used is rapidly increasing.  I also acknowledge assistance from academics in Nottingham <Col N="1275" /> and from the National Council for Civil Liberites in London who have investigated generally in this area.</P>
    <P>There is nothing wrong with the idea of progressing the DNA process.  We are close to accepting that we all have genetic uniquenesses which can be detected in the DNA process.  However, we have not yet established the scientific process to deliver absolutely certain results that can be relied on.  That is the basic problem. Sticking one's thumb into ink and putting it onto paper is a very simple and straightforward process.  Photographing the print, enlarging it and putting it up on a chart leaves little room for error.  That is nothing like the process involved in genetic fingerprinting which is an incredibly intricate and often unchallengeable process.  For that reason it is perhaps a little too early for us to give the huge plaudits that have been inherent in some of the earlier remarks made by Deputies here and by Cellmark diagnostics in their hugely vaunted procedure and documentation.</P>
    <P>The fallibility of the process is identified by the Leicestershire double murder case where the suspect realising that he was in trouble, because the community was being press ganged into submitting a sample, contrived to deliver a fasle sample subsitituted by a workmate. The suspect got away with it until the workmate let it slip in a public house and the person to whom he let it slip relayed the story to the police.  It was after that, that the suspect was apprehended.  That case helps to illustrate that unless there are strict standards of application in the use of the DNA process, even at the investigative stage, things can go radically wrong.  Initial tests in that investigation had exonerated the perpetrator of the crimes simply because he had been skilfull enough to substitute samples from a workmate.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that in their document &ldquo;DNA Profiling &mdash; A Guide For Use in Criminal Investigation&rdquo; published by Cellmark Diagnostics, they say on page 9:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1276" /> It is important to note that such screening should be carried out in conjunction with other forensic investigations.</P>
    <P>Even in their literature, trying to sell this process worldwide, they accept that there are fallibilities in the process and that Garda and police investigators should not simply rely on DNA but that it must be fitted into a broad investigation.  It must also be recognised that the first patent in the DNA process was taken out in 1987 in England.  They are now establishing a worldwide patent for the process.  It is a relatively new concept and we have a long way to go before we are satisfied that we have an infallible process which can give us the results they claim.  For example, it is estimated that between brother and brother and brother and father 62.5 per cent of the bands that can appear in the process are shared.  It is suggested that in paternity cases it is important to test the brother and/or the father in certain instances to ensure that there is no possibility of error.  How does that apply to the suspect defendant who is detained for the purposes of criminal investigation?  Are we also to detain his brother and father to ensure that there is no risk of an error arising, given the high rate of the share of banding that can arise in close relationships?</P>
    <P>It is also thought in the single and multi-probe investigation tests that the probability of similarity arising run to odds as low as 250:1 where there are only four bands and to one in one million against with more bands.  There can be instances where the genetic finger-printing will establish very few bands on the sample available where the odds are that much more reduced.</P>
    <P>It is also suggested &mdash; and this is best put in an article by the leader of the attack on the system &mdash; in <i>The Sciences,</i> the journal of the United States National Academy of Sciences.  The molecular biologist, Simon Ford, attached to the University of California and Irvine, in the issue in January said:</P>
    <P>Laboratories have a vested interest in one finding &mdash; guilt &mdash; and their <Col N="1277" /> reports, like all other evidence, should be considered suspect.</P>
    <P>That is a very dramatic statement from a scientist who recognises a problem which is peculiar to the DNA examination process and it simply cannot be ignored.  The issue has been raised time and again by scientists in the field who say that there are huge question marks over the whole issue.  It has been pointed out, for example, in an article written by Robin McKie, science correspondent with the <i>Sunday Observer,</i> on Sunday, 28 January last, that questions remain.  He said:</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, some nagging questions remain, such as how genetic fingerprint bands among various populations and groups differ.  In some areas, certain bands may be more common, perhaps due to slight inbreeding over centuries, or because of racial variation in a village or town. In such cases, there could be a higher than expected occurrence of two samples being identical purely by chance. False convictions might then result.</P>
    <P>That highlights the need for sample examination to establish a proper statistical probability basis for the introduction of the test to our courts.  Will the Minister say to what extent our forensic science personnel carried out those tests from a sample of our population?  To what extent have we satisfied ourselves on issues of probability because it is not just a question of carrying out the process and indicating the bands?  There is a further statistical base indicating probability opportunities contained in this whole process that must be satisfied before we can implement it.  We must acknowledge that we are an island community and because of that &mdash; and the drop in our population since the 1840s &mdash; there is a far more significant, closer inbreeding process in this island than there would be, for example, in Britain, mainland Europe or America.  It is a problem that must be fully addressed before we can process the matter further.</P>
    <P>As a general principle, problematic issues may arise.  I want to deal with the <Col N="1278" /> concept of when or at what stage we accept that a scientific process is no longer in the investigative stage and has developed to being accepted as a given principle.  This has been dealt with in American law since the 1923 case of the District of Columbia Frye <i>v.</i> The United States.  The court held in that case that proof of the general acceptance of the scientific technique is a condition precedent to the admission of scientific testimony. Have we yet arrived at the stage in our law that allows us to proceed with the use of the DNA process on the basis that there is general acceptance of the scientific technique?  I do not believe that we have because of particular reservations imposed by the Cellmark organisation on the independent testing and evaluation of the genetic fingerprint process.  It was said in that case:</P>
    <P>Just when a scientific principle or discovery crosses the line between the experimental and demonstrable stages is difficult to define.  Somewhere in this twilight zone the evidential force of the principle must be recognised and, while the courts will go a long way in admitting expert testimony deduced from a well recognised scientific principle or discovery, the thing from which the deduction is made must be sufficiently established to have gained general acceptance in the particular field to which it belongs.</P>
    <P>I adopt that quotation as a basic principle of approach in our review of the law.</P>
    <P>There is no difficulty in the whole area of civil investigation if couples in paternity or emigration issues wish to submit themselves to DNA fingerprint genetic examination an are happy to bind themselves to the outcome.  If that is the case let the process proceed but it is a vastly different thing to incorporate it in our criminal law in the circumstances in which it is currently being introduced and to say that it is an acceptable standard in the way it is being administered and made available because so much debate and controversy have arisen in recent times about the process.  It is too early to put <Col N="1279" /> all our eggs into the DNA process and to say that that is the end of the matter.</P>
    <P>In this regard the point has been illustrated by the history of the Greiss test in relation to establishing traces of nitroglycerine on a person's hands or body. That is a very important point in the context of what is acceptable.  We all know about the Greiss test because it was employed by the British authorities at the time of the Birmingham Six bomb investigation.  That test led to charges being laid against the six people playing cards on their way to a funeral in Belfast, having been taken from the boat-train.</P>
    <P>Subsequent investigation and debate has shown that the Greiss test, which was unchallenged in 1976 and 1977 when those people were put in prison for life, has become extremely suspect if not entirely discredited.  It is a good illustration of the point that has to be made that we are very much in the infancy of genetic fingerprinting.  Unless it is available to us to ensure the strictest of standards, access to all information available and independent challenge, we have a long way to go before we can be entirely happy that we have a process that can be universally accepted here.</P>
    <P>I would end my reservations in general about the process by quoting from an article entitled &ldquo;DNA Fingerprints &mdash; black box or black hole&rdquo;, written by Andrew Hall in the new law journal of 16 February.  Mr. Hall is a person of good standing in the area and understands the issues involved.  I will quote from him as a person who best puts the issue once and for all.  Under the paragraph entitled Evidential black box, he states:</P>
    <P>Despite these problems,</P>
    <P>Problems of the procedure over the years, some of which I have referred to&mdash;</P>
    <P>the technique appears to have been embraced with enthusiasm by those charged with investigating crime and the number of cases in which DNA analysis is applied seems ever increasing. In a limited but important number <Col N="1280" /> of cases, the identification of a perpetrator by DNA finger-printing may be the sole evidence in the possession of the Crown.  That in itself may not present a threat to civil liberty so long as the scientific basis of the technique, and the rigour of its application in the laboratory, is subject to informed scrutiny and stringent controls.  The question is whether the technique has gained its scientific credentials in this way or, indeed, whether its application is subject to proper control.</P>
    <P>He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>The uniqueness of the procedure, I would argue, may hold unique dangers in the absence of a critical approach by both lawyers and forensic scientists. The risk is that it becomes a black box into which the scientific evidence is placed at one end and the verdict in a criminal case is produced at the other.</P>
    <P>We have to explore the area of the black box and ensure that we are dealing with a process at the end of the day that is sound, universally understood and universally challengeable in the balance of adversarial jurisprudence that is the hallmark of our criminal law procedure and jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>There are issues even more damning of the process as it currently stands than the problems of whether it represents a single area of darkness for us, that is the whole regime and administration of the process at the moment.  Again, in the same article Mr. Hall deals with the matter succinctly.  He says:</P>
    <P>Another unique feature of the technique is the virtual monopoly over testing procedures.  The Jeffreys testing system is subject to patent and, so far as the writer is able to discover, only the police scientific laboratories and Cellmark Diagnostics, a private company, are able to apply the procedure in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>While we have relied on the process for ten cases in this jurisdiction, it is exclusively to the Cellmark Laboratories in <Col N="1281" /> Abingdon in England that we have had recourse.  Mr. Hall continues:</P>
    <P>Blood testing using traditional techniques, by contrast, is a procedure which is universally available and any number of independent experts are available to the defence who wish to examine or to challenge prosecution scientific testimony.  Since the same procedures are used by the police forensic laboratories and by Cellmark, if laboratory techniques are less than perfect, or if the underlying science is flawed, there may simply be a replication of the same inaccurate result. Where a scientific process is unregulated, and the procedure is essentially a &ldquo;trade secret&rdquo;, what protection is there in this vitally important area?</P>
    <P>There is no forensic or other proof relied upon in the prosecution of cases standing in the unique position in which genetic fingerprinting is currently standing.  The process discovered by Professor Jeffreys in the mid-eighties, as I have said, is subject to worldwide patent, first taken out in Britain in 1987.  All tests are controlled directly by Cellmark, a subsidiary of ICI, for good commercial reasons. They do not want competitors in the field; they want a worldwide network of revenue creating profit enterprise and the best of luck to them but I do not want that process to be incorporated into the investigation of serious crime that will decide issues such as whether a person is guilty of the most heinous murders or rape.</P>
    <P>It is a remarkable feature that you cannot get an independent agent to carry out an examination of the results achieved by Cellmark or their agents in the different laboratories.  They hold a patent and they hold direct control of the examination, a condition of which is no independent outside investigation.  There is no other area of the forensic law in which this exists.  As a defence lawyer one can have recourse to a ballistics expert, a chemistry expert, to all the range of experts in the field of forensic testing and one can send them into the laboratory of the testing authority.  The Forensic <Col N="1282" /> Science Laboratory in Dublin on a weekly, if not more frequent, basis is visited by forensic experts, professors of chemistry and of all the sciences in the different universities to examine, test and if necessary, take samples either within the control of the laboratory or elsewhere, and carry out independent tests to see if the same results are achieved.</P>
    <P>Genetic fingerprinting is the one area where this cannot be done.  We are told that this is the breakthrough of the century in terms of criminal investigation, that it will cut out so much other time-consuming work of the police investigating authorities, that it will be a short cut and an easy access to identifying the perpetrators of crime and that it will be an absolute answer to the question of who commits the crime.  If that is so, it is all the more reason it should be susceptible to independent scrutiny and examination.  It is not acceptable that the company who are trading worldwide with the process are maintaining such secretive control of the tests.</P>
    <P>This is a problem that must be addressed.  The standards of justice and fair play in this jurisdiction require that. There must be access to independent challenge by experts on behalf of defence if needed.  The case may arise where the accused will say &ldquo;I accept the results&rdquo;, as has been instanced here in regard to the five cases reported in the January issue of the <i>Garda News.</i> Two of the defendants pleaded guilty, one was exonerated, one withdrew an appeal in the interim process and the other probably has come to hearing by now.  There are many more cases where a defendant will want to query or challenge and everything must be available to him or her in those circumstances to act.  The position is completely unacceptable.</P>
    <P>There are major problems surrounding the introduction of the testing here.  The difficulty is illustrated in part by the fact that in May last year when Minister of State, Deputy Leyden, was introducing the Bill into the Seanad he forecast that the State Laboratory in Dublin would be carrying out genetic fingerprinting testing in the autumn of last year.  That has not <Col N="1283" /> happened and today the Minister told us that that will not take place until the coming autumn.  The problem is related in part to the trouble of negotiating the terms upon which Cellmark will make the process available and the probes usable by the State Forensic Laboratory in Dublin.  I am asking the Minister to indicate the terms of the contract and the restrictions placed upon the State Laboratory in Dublin against allowing independent forensic scientists employed by defendants access to the tests and the process on the one hand, and the availability of the techniques to carry out their own examinations or tests where that is advised, appropriate and necessary.</P>
    <P>I have referred to Mr. Hall's comment on this monopoly as being unique.  It is not only unique, it is invidious and has to be addressed because it will prove to be unconstitutional in any defence.  I cannot see how the prosecution could ask a judge to receive evidence in a criminal trial where the defence have effectively been denied the opportunity to independently challenge, assess or understand what is being presented.  I foresee great difficulties in regard to that.  In discussions with practitioners, and members of the Bar, on the matter my fears have been confirmed.  That must be investigated and dealt with.</P>
    <P>Equally, the whole question of the standards to be applied raise important issues.  If we are to continue to rely on the standards by relying on Abingdon as the source of our tests then we will have problems of evidential proof.  If, on the other hand, we successfully establish a DNA laboratory here the problem may not arise.  Again, we must ask what terms or requirements have been written into the Cellmark contract with the State Laboratory in regard to the process and standards to be applied.</P>
    <P>The chain of evidence is an important concept in our criminal law.  It is certainly not so forceful a concept in the British legal system.  Any person who was ever involved in or watched any of the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act cases where <Col N="1284" /> policemen from our neighbouring jurisdiction came here to present evidence will have noticed that they were completely confounded by the fact that they would have to bring experts or witnesses to indicate what happened the sample once taken or the exhibit once received and taken into police custody, how they were cared for and who had control over them during the time they were retained in police custody before being presented to court.  Those issues will have to be addressed in the context of this evidence.</P>
    <P>The qualification of the person carrying out the test is another matter that will have to be dealt with.  In regard to the Greiss test in the Birmingham Six case it emerged in evidence that those tests were carried out by a junior member of the staff who had just qualified and who was unsupervised.  It emerged that the samples were subsequently destroyed.  Will those standards be applied by direction of Cellmark under the contract that has been ironed out between the Forensic Science Laboratory here and the parent multinational company in England?  That is a matter of immense importance.</P>
    <P>The process involved is illustrated in the documents produced by Cellmark and circulated to the legal professions worldwide.  Those documents explain briefly what is involved in the profiling process.  The sample, blood in this instance, is taken and the DNA component must be extracted.  The DNA component, by a chemical process, is cut into fragments by a restriction enzyme. The DNA fragments are then separated into bands during electrophoresis in an agarose gel.  The DNA band so extracted is then placed in a gel and is transferred to a nylon membrane by a technique known as Southern Blotting.  The radioactive DNA probe is then prepared for examining.  The DNA probe binds to specific DNA sequences on the membrane and the excess DNA probe is washed off.  At this stage the radioactive probe is bound to the DNA pattern on the membrane.  The X-ray film is then placed next to the membrane to detect the radioactive pattern.  At the end of it all, the eleventh stage of the process, one <Col N="1285" /> begins to get the pattern that is used for comparative purposes between the samples in question.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the process in all its complexity can take up to three to four weeks in any one case to be completed. We are not just talking about a simple lifting of a hair and looking at it through a microscope or looking at a fabric strand or at a finger mark lifted in ink.  We are talking about an incredibly intricate process that takes weeks to complete.  In any one case there could be multiples of samples to be investigated before conclusions can be drawn.  Are we equipping our laboratory to deal with the complexities of this process?  Are we training our policemen in all of the important intricacies about how to preserve samples once taken?</P>
    <P>A whole range of guides must be followed. The kinds of substances, solutions and containers are crucial to the proper reception and retention of the exhibit. The temperature varies depending on the time the exhibit must be retained, anything ranging from 4º Centigrade for something dealt with within a matter of hours to &mdash;20º Centigrade for something that has to be retained for days.  How does Professor Harbison hope to maintain a &mdash;20º condition in the boot of his motor car as he shoots around the country from one crime investigation to the other before he returns to his laboratory or the State Laboratory at John's Road?</P>
    <P>The complexity has been mentioned in the documentation I have referred to.  It was mentioned in many commentaries by scientists in the field underscoring that, again, DNA fingerprinting is almost unique in the complexity and intricacies involved.  We must deal with the concept of trial by expert.  We have to guard against simply presenting the black box testimony and expecting the verdict to emerge automatically at the other end. That is something that must be fought against.  Consequently, the introduction of the independent assessor, and the facilities for that assessor, are essential and must be respected.</P>
    <P>The cases involved in this process that have introduced debate illustrate the <Col N="1286" /> worries we have.  The Leicestershire case, the Crown <i>V.</i> Pitchfork, the name of the unfortunate defendant, disclosed that the taking of samples was not properly supervised at police investigation level.  As a result the perpetrator of those two horrendous murders was exonerated in the process of investigation.</P>
    <P>There is no point in relying upon the notion that DNA is infallible; it is not if the proper standards are not applied and if the proper policing process is not relied upon.  The Joseph Castro case referred to by Deputy Flanagan is another example of where, in a pre-trial ruling, under the principle in Frye, to which I have already referred, the court not being satisfied then set up a tribunal of inquiry of experts appointed by both prosecution and defence.  It was only at that stage it emerged that the company involved&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in America at the time had not applied the proper standards. The same company, Lifecodes emerged subsequently in a second case in South Portland, in Maine in 1988.  The facts in that case are related in an article in the English newspapers as follows:</P>
      <P>In 1988 a five-year-old girl was sexually assaulted in South Portland, Maine, USA.  The police identified a suspect within hours.  He matched the description of the attacker, he was in the vicinity at the time and carried paper tissues similar to one left at the scene.  To support this circumstantial evidence, genetic fingerprinting, was conducted to see whether the genetic profile of a semen sample was identical with that of the suspect's blood.  To everybody's dismay, the tests appeared to show that the suspect was not the source of the semen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, blood from a second suspect, a well-known child molester living in South Portland, was also compared with the semen and found to match.  This was surprising, since he did not fit the description of the <Col N="1287" /> attacker.  Nevertheless, on the basis of the genetic evidence, prosecution procedures against him were set in motion.  Last December [that was 1989] in a pre-trial hearing to consider the admissibility of various lines of evidence, the prosecution dropped all charges because of doubts about techniques used by the Lifecodes Corporation, the company which did the fingerprinting.</P>
    <P>The failures of the South Portland case, the Maine case and the Castro case in New York have been commented on in the article which was written by a senior lecturer in the Department of Life Sciences at the Bromley College of Technology in England.  His comment was as follows:</P>
    <P>These two failures point to the need to regulate the organisations carrying out these tests.  Genetic, or DNA, fingerprinting is barely five years old. The term &ldquo;fingerprinting&rdquo; was an unfortunate choice.  The technique is good at exluding a suspect from association with a crime, if DNA patterns do not match, but less conclusive in proving a suspect positively linked, because of the possibility that two or more people share DNA &ldquo;fingerprints&rdquo;. The procedure has been renamed &ldquo;DNA profiling&rdquo; to try to avoid the confusion with traditional fingerprinting which can always positively identify a suspect.</P>
    <P>That passage raises questions for us in this House and for the Minister to respond to at the conclusion of this debate.  Does the Minister's Department intend introducing standards of regulations to control the people carrying out the tests?  Will those regulations provide for access by independent forensic scientists employed by defence where necessary?  Will the cost of such forensic examinations be fully covered and provided for under the legal aid schemes as exists.  Deputy Flanagan's figures are more up to date than those which I have.  The figures I have from Cellmark range back to 1988 and are <Col N="1288" /> not as costly.  Obviously, they have been updated.  The indications are that to involve an expert from Abingdon &mdash; which will be the only place available to us if the State laboratory is the only authority working here &mdash; would cost in a trial running for some days in our criminal courts several thousands of pounds.  The 1988 figures for attendance of an expert witness at court would be £304, including VAT.  I have no doubt that with the reliance on inflation we must now be talking about a figure in the region of £400 to £450 at this stage plus travel and subsistence. We are talking about bringing in an expert from England at a cost of several thousands of pounds.  Is the State prepared to stand over such expenses and allow for it?  I note in an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> dated 17 January 1990 entitled &ldquo;Costs limit to genetic fingerprint testing&rdquo;.  Noirin Hegarty indicated that there was little likelihood that we would continue to rely on bringing in experts from abroad and that it was unlikely that the State would advance the cause of developing a relationship with laboratories in England because of the costs involved.  The related worry arises as to what the State will do even if they do establish a unit here to enable defence lawyers and defendants to seek the assistance of experts who will, of necessity, have to come from abroad &mdash; Abingdon apparently to be the one final and only source of court jurisdiction in this area.</P>
    <P>These are reservations I have, having listened to the debate which is now taking place.  While genetic fingerprinting may, in time, prove to be the discovery of the century and prove to be an effective and useful mechanism for debate for crime investigation it is far too early to make such a declaration or plaudit to the process. This process is no longer than five years in operation.  It is working and being used under circumstances of control and secrecy that are unique for that process only.  It is a process that will not receive the benediction of our courts, where challenged actively in a trial.  From our own point of view as safe keepers of the common good and as custodians of the rights and liberties of the individual we <Col N="1289" /> cannot allow a regime that is being presented as so absolute and infallible to be introduced into our criminal investigative process without proper safeguards being built in, in the way I have described.  Those are the remarks I wish to make in the context of this very important legislation about genetic fingerprints. Many more questions have to be answered before we can be ultimately satisfied that we have everything that Cellmarks want us to believe they have put more importantly in the wider context of the Bill, because the Bill can progress whether we rely on DNA finger-printing. In the wider context I urge a favourable consideration from the Minister of very important issues of control and development of security of forensic samples generally, not just of DNA.  With those assurances our party will certainly support the provision of this Bill; without such assurances we intend to be less co-operative than we might otherwise have been.</P>

      <P>Is áthas liom deis a bheith agam labhairt ar an ábhar tábhachtach seo, an Bille um Cheartas Coiriúil (Fianaise Dlí-Eolaíochta), 1989.</P>
      <P>I thank you for allowing me the opportunity of a short intervention on this very important Bill.  I see this Bill as part of the whole concept of civil liberties and almost under the heading of &ldquo;human rights&rdquo;.  There is an almost unchallenged view abroad that people brought into custody for alleged offences are guilty even before a trial is held and that anything is good enough for them.  It is that kind of loose thinking that we as Members of this House must protect against.  No matter how bad a man or woman appear to be democracy demands that they be given the right, which they may not understand, to have their bodily integrity protected. The Minister in his speech said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certainly the Bill provides that an intimate or intrusive sample can only be taken with written permission from the suspect.  However, the primary purpose of this provision is not to give a suspect freedom to refuse to give a <Col N="1290" /> sample but rather is it a recognition that intimate or intrusive samples can only be taken with a suspect's co-operation.</P>
    <P>&mdash;this is the part that concerns me &mdash;</P>
    <P>if force of a degrading nature is to be avoided.</P>
    <P>I may be reading it entirely wrong and if I am I apologise to the author of the script but I understand this to mean that, if in the event, certain conditions are not fulfilled force of a degrading nature, no matter how minimal, may be used.  I would entirely reject the principle or concept that any prisoner, no matter how bad, evil or heinous they may be should be taken into custody by servants of the State, the Garda Síochána who have my very strongest support, and subjected to ill-treatment.  I would be most grateful if the Minister could console and assure me and clarify to my satisfaction what appears to be an ambiguous statement, in advance of Committee Stage.  It is on the foot of that assurance that I will adopt my position.</P>
    <P>One other matter in relation to the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Bill, 1989 which concerns me is the cosy assurance given by the Minister in his speech that everything in the DNA profiling or genetic garden is rosy.  In the long number of years I have had the privilege and honour to be a Member of this House it has been brought to my attention, if not in this jurisdiction, in another, that assurances had been given that forensic tests, such as the Greiss test which was referred to by the previous speaker, were infallible.  However, it has been proved that it is less than fallible, is in fact flawed and unsatisfactory and no longer an acceptable forensic test. Another test which, with that cosy warmness which their masters are inclined to assure us from time to time was infallible, was the TLC test which again was used in another jurisdiction.  That of course is the thin layer chromatography test which has been proved to be fallible to say the least.  That is the response I would like to hear from the Minister for whom I have <Col N="1291" /> the greatest respect.  He has distinguished himself as Minister for Justice.  I ask him when responding to give us the assurances which, as a backbencher on the Government side I see as being necessary.</P>
    <P>If the catechism which has been handed to us is to be believed and the test is as good as it is meant to be it should be accepted.  However, it is an acid test in the real meaning of the word.  It is a test dealing with the acidity of various parts of the body and as such if it is everything it is meant to be everything will be all right.  However, we should bear in mind that it is going to be used in this country for the first time and, therefore, I urge the Minister when he comes to set up the laboratory where this profiling test will be carried out that he be very careful with the equipment.  I do not think any money should be spared in providing the best equipment in this laboratory to ensure that the test proves as infallible as human kind can make it.  I also appeal to him to ensure that individuals employed in the laboratory have the highest qualifications and integrity.  I have no doubt about the latter but I am not fully competent to engage in any testing examination of the former.</P>
    <P>I have the greatest respect for the Garda Síochána who have a dreadful job to do but which they do well.  As I have often said to the point of cliché, they have never been found wanting in the service of this State.  At the same time, like this or any other institution, there are certain weaknesses in the system brought about by its structure and the fallibility of the personalities who operate it.  For that reason I am pleased that the Minister has given an assurance that when this Bill becomes law the judges will be the final arbiters. That is as it should be.  I hope that when reports are given on the test or tests, &mdash; DNA is not specifically referred to in the Bill, other aspects of the test are also dealt with &mdash; the chain of evidence and the link with the taking of the swab, hair, skin and so on, will be very carefully monitored from the moment it is taken <Col N="1292" /> to the time it is produced in court in evidence against the individual charged with an offence.</P>
    <P>Having expressed those concerns I would like to be a little more positive in the sense that the safeguards in the Bill serve to ensure that, while the taking of samples of blood, urine, saliva, public hair or swabs from the mouth or other bodily orifices or from the genital region or the taking of a dental impression would involve a significant interference with bodily integrity, they would require the written consent of the person from whom they are to be taken which, as the Minister explains, means that they cannot be taken by physical force.  That may be the answer to the first query I raised.  I presume then that if written permission is not given the failure to give it must be persuasive before a judge in the prosecution of that individual.  It is rather like the breathalyser test or the urine test under the road traffic legislation where, if one refuses to give samples, there is a presumption of guilt and the burden of proof shifts from the prosecution to the defence; I do not altogether disagree with that.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes on to mention other safeguards provided in the Bill which ensure that the powers being conferred are used only in appropriate cases and with full regard to human dignity and are as follows: the taking of a sample must be authorised in writing by a superintendent or officer of higher rank; the suspect must be informed before a sample is taken and while it is being taken; intimate or intrusive samples may only be taken by a doctor or by a dentist in the case of dental impression; where proceedings are not instituted within six months of the date the sample is taken to where a person is tried and acquitted or the charges against him are dismissed or withdrawn, the sample taken and any records identifying them must be destroyed.  The last of those provisions is fundamental, that if proceedings are not taken within six months the samples or records are destroyed.  I hope there will be safeguards to ensure even that that happens and that the person to whom <Col N="1293" /> that particular safeguard is directed understands that what is being said there has taken place.</P>
    <P>Like all tests intended to be introduced here, I would ask the Minister to introduce the test slowly, to ensure that there are qualified persons to operate laboratories and that they are people of proven merit.</P>
    <P>The other side of DNA and other tests is that in some cases the DNA test specifically was able to establish the innocence of the person who had been identified as the rapist by the victim.  That was a case where the victim identified a rapist, obviously mistakenly, on the basis of the DNA test.  That is the reverse.  My only concern, and I have no doubt the Minister will answer this, is that there should be no element of compulsory physical force being used in obtaining samples.  If the failure to give a sample is seen, as it is under the relevant Road Traffic Act, as almost an admission of guilt, so be it.</P>
    <P>They are my concerns.  I look forward to the Minister's response and to any amendments he may propose on Committee Stage arising from the various contributions that have been made to the Bill.  It is a Bill that could go wrong if improperly operated, but I always take a positive view of life.  I think that people are good until they prove themselves to be less than good.  Probably I am naive in that regard but I see the better side of human nature rather than the bad. Human nature can be fallible and for that reason we should have a concern for human life and civil liberties and must see a Bill of this nature with a concern that should be articulated here in the full light of day.  For the opportunity to do so, a Cheann Comhairle, I would like to thank you.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the opportunity to join with other Members of the House in generally welcoming this Bill. It will make an enormous impact on the investigation of serious crimes.  It is a good example of the best scientific and most up to date methods being used by <Col N="1294" /> the Garda in their quest to catch criminals, detect crime and prosecute those guilty.  From that point of view I certainly give it a very warm welcome.  It will make the chances of prosecutions and conviction of criminals much more likely and it is an extra weapon in the fight against crime.</P>
      <P>My legal friends who have so far spoken on this Bill have been very concerned about the person who may or may not be charged with an offence and the evidence that might be produced in support of the case.  However, I would have to look at the other side of the coin. There is very little consideration given to the victims of crime in many cases.  There is a general belief among the public that the law is more on the side of the criminal than the victim.  This Bill will help to restore the balance in favour of the victim.</P>
      <P>Recent statistics that I received in regard to cases of rape, for instance, showed that there was a very low rate of conviction for that crime.  In many of the Garda districts from which I got figures there was no conviction in about two thirds of such cases.  I have spoken to doctors, one of whom is a Member of this House, who do the medicals on alleged rape victims and they said that one would want 125 per cent proof to be able to convict a person.  That certainly seems true from the conviction rate in this part of the country.  What I am basically saying is that I welcome anything that helps the Garda to detect and prosecute crimes and bring people to justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far there has been an emphasis on the negative side of the method of convicting criminals by the use of DNA fingerprinting or profiling as it is called but there are positive aspects.  The last speaker mentioned a case across the water where a person was able to clear himself of a crime by the use of this system.  That is the positive side of what we are discussing; it is not all negative. Another positive example is in the US where some states have set up civil files containing voluntary furnished samples from individual citizens which can be and <Col N="1295" /> are used to identify human remains at sites of disaster and so on.  They can be very useful in paternity and incest cases in the legal arena, so this is more than just trying to get criminal convictions from DNA profiling.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers have raised questions about the validity of the test. There are some very well established, well documented cases and the <i>Garda Review</i> of November 1988 gives quite a number which I will not go into in detail. There are cases which have proved this method very positive and successful.  The Bill contains the safeguard, and I welcome the Minister's commitment that the forensic science laboratory will be given the resources necessary to use this facility to the full, and that in regard to criminals and those under prosecution, the process will be monitored properly. In the US some doubt has been cast on the validity of DNA profiling, but from the investigations I have read about, it is not so much a question about DNA profiling but about the laboratory procedures used in each case.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the safeguards the Minister outlines in this Bill will protect fully the civil rights of all our citizens.  The Bill will enhance the chances of prosecution very substantially. It would be wrong for the message to go out from this House, as some people seem to be implying, that this is a risky method of convicting people and we should wait another eight or ten years before we put it into force.  One of the criticisms of this House is that it has always done too little too late.  In this case the House is responding to the most advanced techniques and introducing them in a Bill so that the Garda will have adequate powers to pursue cases and investigate them fully, and increase the number of convictions they secure.  Over a long period we have all been critical in this House about the levels of crime detection by the Garda.  This Bill will redress that, but I have one concern.  If at this early stage we make DNA profiling an absolute proof of some person's alleged guilt, methods of investigation <Col N="1296" /> which are less then thorough may be used by the Garda and they will depend solely on DNA profiling.  For that reason I counsel caution in that area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is a great step forward.  It is an extra tool in the machinery that the Garda need in dealing with crime.  I wish the Bill a speedy passage.</P>

      <P>The housing of the elderly is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment.  Officials of my Department have had discussions with officials of the Department of the Environment about the provision of health board services to residents of housing schemes for the elderly.  The local authorities and the health boards have cooperated in the installation of emergency communication systems for the elderly to enable them to live at home independently but with adequate support in an emergency.  It is the policy of my Department to encourage health boards to expand care services to the elderly, including those resident in local authority and voluntary housing schemes.  The additional allocation of £5 million to expand services for the elderly announced earlier this year will enable health boards to improve the range of home and community support available to elderly people, including those resident in sheltered housing schemes.</P>

Let me ask the Minister if the type of project in Morton Street, Clonmel, which was built by the Minister's Department through the health board, has been followed through in other areas to meet a very special need.

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, of course the Department are assuming their responsibilities in these matters.  A number of organisations are providing services for the disabled and in doing so have made use of the grant scheme of £20,000 per unit which is available towards the provision of housing for disadvantaged persons. For example, the Irish Wheelchair Association in Clontarf provided such accommodation.  The Cheshire Foundation propose to make use of the scheme to build units in Sligo and Letterkenny with support services provided by the North-Western Health Board.  The scheme is also being availed of to a significant degree by the mental handicap agencies.  Five year plans for the development of day and residential mental handicap services are being produced by regional co-ordinating committees at the moment.

Of course, as the Deputy knows, it is the policy of the Government and the Department to ensure that adequate and proper housing is provided for those who are handicapped and to ensure that the handicapped and the elderly can live in their own homes and in the community as long as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied with the level of neurosurgical services available at present in the State.</P>
      <P>I am also satisfied that recent developments involving the centralisation of neurosurgery at Beaumont Hospital, which has one of the most excellent neurosurgical facilities in Western Europe, will be of benefit to patients in need of the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to raise two issues with the Minister, the number of neurosurgical facilities and the quality of these facilities.  Was it not the Minister's intention to have a neurosurgery centre of excellence in Beaumont Hospital? Why has that not been achieved?  I know <Col N="1300" /> the Minister wants to achieve it, but he has not achieved it.  Is the Minister satisfied that the expertise in paediatric neurosurgery is available there, especially in the light of the recent cases that have arisen and of the information arising out of parliamentary complaints?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that there is a centre of excellence in Beaumont Hospital, following on the great tradition of the centre of excellence that was established many years ago in the Richmond Hospital which was in the forefront of modern neurosurgery in Europe.</P>
      <P>I do not understand the Deputy's assertion that a centre of excellence has not been achieved because I believe it has.  The Deputy referred to the fact that a paediatric neurosurgeon who was on the staff of Beaumont hospital is no longer there but I would like to let the Deputy know, if he is not already so aware, that an advertisement was placed for a replacement for Mr. O'Neill.  I understand interviews will be taking place shortly for that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the deep dissatisfaction in St. Vincent's Hospital in relation to the transfer of their neurosurgical facilities?  Will the Minister ensure that all the patients who were previously treated in St. Vincent's Hospital will be adequately catered for and that in fact facilities will be expanded in Beaumont Hospital?  Can he say when that will be done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that Comhairle na nOspidéal have recommended, and this is what we have accepted in the Department as the correct course to follow&mdash;that neurosurgery services should be centralised in Beaumont Hospital to the benefit of patients generally.  I am unaware of dissatisfaction in St.  Vincent's Hospital other than the case of one surgeon who has been circulating letters, a matter I brought up with the hospital and I am glad to say the <Col N="1301" /> hospital authorities agree with my view on such matters.</P>

      <P>I am quite surprised that the Minister did not take Question No. 50 with Question No. 2 which deals also with the question of neurosurgeons and neurosurgical services. I understand that some years ago there were four neurosurgeons available for public patients on the north side and four also on the south side but that there are now only three neurosurgeons for the whole of Dublin.  Can the Minister comment on that and can he give the figures for the number of neurosurgeons available in public hospitals on both the north and south side of Dublin and compare them with the numbers available some years ago?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has agreed that Beaumont will be the centre of excellence for neurosurgery.  Is it not true that because it is understaffed, due to circumstances the Minister is aware of, it cannot be the centre of excellence becasue there is a vacancy which is shrouded in controversy &mdash; not that I have received letters from the consultant but from the parents of children in need of neurosurgery which they cannot get? The Minister has admitted that there is a vacancy.</P>

      <Quest>if it is his intention to provide money for St. Michael's House, Dublin 11 to increase its present complement of residential places; the number on the waiting list for admission; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Between 1986 and 1988 the number of places for people with mental handicap in the eastern region was increased by almost 900.  It is a matter for the Eastern Health Board central planning committee, which is representative of the various service agencies, including St. Michael's House, to agree on the priorities to be accorded in the distribution of additional moneys for services for the mentally handicapped.  Of the £1 million which was recently allocated to the Eastern Health Board area for the development of this service, £235,000 was allocated to St. Michael's House to provide for six additional residential places, 93 day places and additional family support for 46 people.  The total additional amount of £1 million which was allocated to a number of service providers in the Eastern Health Board will provide for a minimum of 91 additional residential places, 184 additional day places and a significant number <Col N="1304" /> of additional respite cases.  These additional services will have a significant impact on the waiting lists for services. The co-ordinating committee are at present identifying the future needs of the service with a view to meeting these in a co-ordinated planned way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says he is satisfied with the proposals to increase the number of places in St. Michael's House which will have a significant effect on the waiting list.  Does he not accept that the recent case of Samantha Webb was only resolved because of the death of an existing resident and that there are 22 other cases just like Samantha Webb waiting to get into St. Michael's House as a top priority and 90 other urgent cases on the waiting list?  Has the Minister discussed these figures with the health board and has he achieved any priority apart from the provision of the half dozen extra places that have been provided? These are some of the crisis cases we have spoken of before.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is raising some specific aspects of this matter which I believe have been the subject of consideration in this House in recent times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must not have been listening to the answer.  In fact I did not use the term &ldquo;I was satisfied&rdquo; because, as Minister, I am never satisfied until the services that are necessary for everybody are in place.  I accept that is not the case at present.</P>
      <P>The Samantha Webb case was the subject of an Adjournment debate.  In reply to the question, I read out that St. Michael's House received £235,000 to provide new services, including six additional residential places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether Samantha Webb got a place because, unfortunately, one of the persons with mental handicap died or because of the almost £250,000 <Col N="1305" /> extra which was provided is a moot question. Extra money was provided in the budget for extra places and a place was available for Samantha Webb.  I do not know if what the Deputy is saying is correct.  All I know is that money was given to St. Michael's House to provide extra places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>How many extra places will be provide in St. Michael's House with the extra fortune they have been given?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>It was £250,000 and an extra £2 million was allocated for the mentally handicapped in the budget. There have been developments in the service over the past three years which have included St. Michael's House.  It is important to remember that St. Michael's House are not the only providers of services for the mentally handicapped in the Dublin area or the rest of the country.  A sum of £130 million is being spent for persons with mental handicap in the current year and of the extra £2 million, £1 million is being spent in the Dublin area and almost £250,000 is going to St. Michael's House.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of a recent statement by the manager of St. Michael's House that it used to be the case that when the parents of an adult mentally handicapped person died they were guaranteed a place, but this is no longer the case?  Will the Minister give an assurance that with the allocation of this money every person requiring residential care will be given the explicit guarantee that such a place will be available?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">

      <P>Yes, I will give an explicit guarantee that a place will be available but I will not give a guarantee that a place will be available in St. Michael's House.  They are only a part of the service in the Dublin area.  In the case of Samantha Webb, the Eastern Health Board had a place available for her when her mother unfortunately died.</P>

      <P>She did not have to go to Monasterevin.  There was a place for her in Dublin.  It was the decision of those looking after her to keep her in the day service in St. Michael's House, that she would go home at night and that she would be kept in respite care on other nights.  There was a place available.  It would be most unfortunate if parents of mentally handicapped children throughout the country were to feel, because of the way this has been hyped by Members of the Opposition, that when they die those children will not be provided for. They will be provided for.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health</askee>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Drug prices in Ireland are governed at present by an agreement between the Department of Health and the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries. The current agreement permits either party to give one year's notice of intention to renegotiate or terminate the agreement after its expiry on 31 July 1990.  My Department have served 12 months' notice to this effect.</P>
      <P>In this regard, an inter-departmental committee, representative of the Departments of Health, Finance and Industry and Commerce, are currently examining a number of options for containing the State's total drugs bill, and will finalise their report shortly.  I intend to bring forward proposals for Government in this area in the very near future.</P>
      <P>It has always been my view that in the interest of patients generally and of the economy generics should be prescribed as much as possible and that Irish-branded generics should also be used, all things being equal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has obviously done some research into this.  Is he aware of estimates that £20 million could be saved to the health services and the taxpayer by the wider use of generic drugs? In the short term this would be a definite advantage for the Minister's Department and for the taxpayer.  Is the Minister aware of the amount of production of generic drugs in my constituency and of the total import cost of non-generic drugs, even drugs that are off patent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly there are <Col N="1308" /> savings to be made by using generic products. We are governed by an agreement with the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries &mdash; an agreement originally entered into by my predecessor, the then Minister for Health, Deputy Barry Desmond.  At the time the cost of drugs here was so far ahead of the cost of drugs in the UK that it was a good agreement in its day.  We have given notice that we intend to terminate the agreement.  Certainly I encourage doctors who are responsible for prescribing drugs to use generic drugs. They have a responsibility to prescribe what they believe is in the best interest of the patient.  One consoling word I can say to Deputy Ferris is that when I was in general practice I was a great user of Clonmel products.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that of the £165 million spent on drugs last year, some £80 million worth of those drugs are off patent and substitutable by branded equivalents?  Will the Minister give a commitment to the House that this agreement with FICI will be terminated at the end of July or, if renegotiated, the exclusion clause for the systematic use of generics will be arranged so that generics can be substituted where they are off patent?  Will he give a commitment either to terminate the deal altogether to ensure better value for money or will he ensure that the element in relation to generics will not be repeated?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>

      <P>As well as sending pressing letters to GPs to prescribe generic drugs, will the Minister prescribe regulations now or at the appropriate time to ensure that under the GMS scheme at any rate it would be obligatory on doctors <Col N="1309" /> to prescribe generic drugs?  Is the Minister aware of the incredible inducements and pressures brought to bear on doctors by the manufacturing drug companies? They send them free gifts and all manner of inducements.  Does the Minister intend to do anything about that and to put restraints on the unfair inducements and pressures put on doctors?</P>

      <P>The question of whether we should have a legal instrument to insist that only generic drugs are used is always under consideration. We want to ensure that the State get the best value in relation to the £140 million spent on drugs each year.  As I said, we are bound by an agreement until 31 July but I should like the doctors to use branded generic products, preferably Irish ones.  If that is not satisfactory we must look at the question of regulations along the lines which Deputy Taylor has outlined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister quoted a figure of £140 million for drugs.  Is that figure up to date?  Our figure in this area is £165 million for total drug usage, £125 million of which is in the area of general practitioners.  This is the area over which the Minister has the most opportunity for control because the hospital services obviously use as many generics as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>In common with other health boards, the Western Health Board have been requested to prepare a multi-annual plan to meet the future requirements of the mental handicap service in a planned co-ordinated way.  There are at present 1,020 persons in County Mayo on the register for the mentally handicapped.  All these persons who require services are getting a service.  The recent budget allocation for mental handicap has provided for an additional 45 residential/day places in County Mayo.</P>
      <P>Because of the size and complexity of the Áras Attracta Centre, and the need for regard to other priorities in mental handicap provision, the development of the centre has had to proceed on a phased basis.  At the moment there are 39 residents in the centre and this will increase to a minimum of 54 by May with a staff complement of 54.  The future phased opening of the remaining residential facilities will form part of the co-ordinated multi-annual plan mentioned above.  The centre was designed to provide accommodation ultimately for 186 residents. The staff complement required to cater for this number of residents will be a matter for decision in the light of the needs of persons to be catered for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 25 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the report on the Working Party on Dental Services it was decided that 6 posts of consultant orthodontists would be created in order to fulfil the national requirement.  Only one post, located in the Mid-Western Health Board, has been filled to date.  I have made inquiries of the Local Appointments Commission and am informed that the five vacant posts have been advertised on a number of occasions since 1984, both in the national press and in international professional journals.  The dates on which the posts were advertised are as follows: Western, 11-12-85, 28-10-87; NorthWestern, 23-1-85, 17-9-86; Southern, 23-1-85, 11-12-85, 17-9-86; South-Eastern, <Col N="1316" /> 18-4-84, 13-6-84, 23-1-85, 11-12-85, 17-9-86; Eastern, 13-6-84, 23-1-85.</P>
    <P>In some cases, candidates were offered appointment but declined the posts.</P>
    <P>My Department have been reviewing the terms and conditions that apply to the posts of consultant orthodontist with a view to making them more attractive to suitable candidates.  Following this review I would expect that the health boards including the Western Health Board will request the Local Appointments Commission to readvertise the vacant posts.</P>
    <P>The health boards have made alternative arrangements for the provision of orthodontic treatment and have been able to expand the level of treatment provided as a result of the special allocations made by the Government before Christmas and again in the budget.  Those additional moneys will bring about a significant improvement in orthodontic services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State agree that the reason why these posts cannot be filled is that there is no scope for private practice, which is normal with other consultant posts, and will he include some small element of that or change the post from that of consultant to specialist?  This has been known for two years to be the problem.  Why has the Minister not taken action to alter the posts in this way and re-advertise them and fill them?</P>

      <P>The question of the establishment of a satellite renal dialysis unit is a matter for the North-Eastern Health Board in the first instance.  I understand from the board that this issue is under consideration at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that there are a substantial number of people travelling from his constituency to Dublin for dialysis on a regular basis?  Does the Minister not agree that this is crowding the system in Dublin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I agree that at the moment there are 21 people from the <Col N="1319" /> Cavan-Monaghan area travelling to Beaumont for dialysis.  While the North Eastern Health Board are considering the establishment of such a unit in Cavan, it depends on having suitable staffing available in Cavan.  The first post that needs to be filled is the post of physician. That post has been approved.  We will be in touch with the North Eastern Health Board about this.</P>
      <P>My policy is that dialysis units should be available where they can be sustained on medical grounds, as it is very important that patients should have a quality service.  If we are to take the service out to the hospitals in the country we want to ensure that it is a quality service that will be available to patients.  That depends on a number of factors.  Funding is not really a major issue because the service has to be provided somewhere. The Deputy is right in that if all the patients were congregating in Beaumont that hospital would probably not be able to deal with them.  A number of such satellite units have been established around the country over the last few years.</P>

Somebody tells me that she is not adequately qualified for a mobility allowance.  This lady has to be carried if she wants to move more than four feet.  Her case was appealed and the administrative officer made the decision. <Col N="1323" /> I do not think she was examined thereafter. Nobody bothered to go near her.

      <P>There is no post of medical referee as such in the health services as there is in the social welfare area.  The director of community care has responsibility for assessing patients who apply for such benefits as the mobility allowance.  He is medically qualified and he may designate the job to the area medical officer who is also medically qualified.  They would do the assessment on the medical need of the patient whereas if the case was means tested a lay person would investigate it.</P>

The director of community care who is medically qualified is responsible for assessing the medical condition of a person who applies for any of the personal income allowances or indeed schemes such as the mobility scheme referred to.  The director of community <Col N="1324" /> care who is medically qualified or the area medical officer who works along with him and who is also medically qualified will assess the medical condition of the person.  I am not aware, nor do I think it is possible, that anyone other than these people do the work.</P>

      <Quest>if he will report on a vacancy for a surgeon at the National Eye and Ear Hospital, Dublin 2; and the advice which he would give to patients on the waiting list for tonsillectomy operations, some of whom have been waiting two years.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to inform the Deputy that the remaining vacancy for an ENT surgeon at the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital arose because of the unusual pattern of retirements in this specialty over the past few years.  Three ENT consultant posts became vacant at the Royal Victoria Hospital over the two year period between 1987 and 1989.  Two of these posts are in the process of being filled.  The third post has been approved by the Department and will be submitted to Comhairle na nOspidéal in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also wish to inform the Deputy that the waiting list for ENT procedures, including tonsillectomy operations, is constantly being monitored by my Department in consultation with the Royal Victoria Hospital.  The waiting list for ENT admissions at the Eye and Ear <Col N="1329" /> Hospital in 1988 was 1,249.  It now stands at 480 patients which indicates a commitment by the hospital and its staff to reducing this waiting list quickly.  In keeping with this current trend I expect the ENT waiting list at this hospital to be reduced considerably over the next six to 12 months.</P>
    <P>Of the 480 patients remaining on the ENT waiting list approximately 40 are waiting for two years.  Any patient who is concerned about their condition should contact his/her general practitioner who will take the matter up with the consultant. I should point out that the admission of any patient is a matter for the consultant in the first instance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out to the Minister that the problem at the hospital is even more severe than he realises.  Is he aware that in many cases medical card holders are being advised to go to private consultants at huge expense to themselves?  Is he aware that the consultants are not there to look after medical card patients?  I can assure the Minister that in one extreme case, which I referred to the Department, a patient who was two years on the waiting list for attention by those consultants was advised to go private?  The Minister's reply is a little less than serious.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always concerned when there are people on waiting lists but, as I pointed out in the House on a previous occasion, waiting lists are not new.  For example, in the Eye and Ear Hospital in 1986, when the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition were in power, there were 964 people awaiting ear, nose and throat service.  At present there are 480. I accept that 480 people on the waiting list are too many.  We are dealing with that problem.  In fact, out of the £15 million provided last year money was targeted for ear, nose and throat treatment <Col N="1330" /> and cataract operations.  I should like to tell Deputy Kavanagh that I would be glad to hear of any evidence that people on public waiting lists have been told by consultants that if they pay they will be brought into the hospital sooner.  I have stated on many occasions, in the House and outside, that admission to a public hospital bed must be on the basis of need.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that a person (details supplied) in County Cork has to wait up to one year before he can be seen by a doctor at the Mercy Hospital, Cork and then a further one and a half years before he can have a tonsillectomy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I am aware that there are long waiting lists for ear, nose and throat services at the Mercy Hospital.  A limited ear, nose and throat service is provided by a consultant employed in a private capacity by the Mercy Hospital. The hospital is examining ways in which inroads can be made on both out-patient and in-patient waiting lists.</P>
      <P>The regional centre for ear, nose and throat services in the Southern Health Board area is the South Infirmary &mdash; Victoria Hospital.  Following the allocation of extra funding for ear, nose and throat services in August last year, six extra beds were opened at the hospital and I am glad to report that considerable progress has been made in reducing waiting lists. Two additional out-patient clinics will be provided at the hospital each week from 8 March 1990 for new patients and by August of this year an average waiting time for new out-patients will be about three to four months.  Waiting lists for surgery are also being reviewed and the average waiting time should also be reduced to three to four months by September 1990.  In addition, the South Infirmary Victoria has advertised for a second consultant ear, nose and throat surgeon.  If this post is filled it will contribute further to reducing waiting times for ear, nose and throat treatment in the Southern Health Board area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am anxious that there should be closer co-operation between the Mercy and South Infirmary &mdash; Victoria Hospitals in <Col N="1332" /> the provision of ear, nose and throat services in Cork to avoid situations such as that referred to by the Deputy.  I am therefore having this matter examined.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister's reply on this issue.  Is the Minister aware that the person named would not even be accepted on the waiting list due to the length of that waiting list?

      <P>The question of referral to a hospital is generally a matter for the general practitioner and, perhaps, general practitioners might be made aware of where the shorter waiting time is so that they would be able to send the patient, if appropriate, to that area.  This problem occurs in cities and towns where there are a large number of hospitals as is the case in Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The general practitioner in this case did indicate that a certain consultant in the Mercy Hospital was the proper consultant to go to.  The Minister must now be aware of the fact that that hospital will not now accept the person's name because of the long waiting list.  They stated that it was pointless accepting the name.  Is the Minister aware of anything that can be done urgently to reduce that waiting list with that consultant?</P>

      <P>Where urgent treatment is necessary, urgent treatment is provided.  Where treatment is not considered urgent people are put on a waiting list.  The waiting list is unacceptably long in the area of tonsils and adenoids but I am glad to say that there has been a tremendous reduction in the waiting list over the last couple of months, since the injection of money from the £15 million. For example, in Temple Street the waiting list was reduced from 1,800 to 900.  I will bring up the case again with the Deputy to see what can be done.  It would not be for us to refer a patient from one hospital to another.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 24, 28 and 85 together.  I am aware of wide public interest in the question of food irradiation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no food operators licensed to carry out food irradiation on a commercial basis in this country. However, food irradiation is carried out in 21 countries and it is possible that some <Col N="1334" /> imported foods, for example, most likely herbs and spices, may have been subject to irradiation treatment in their country of origin.</P>
    <P>The Food Safety Advisory Committee recently reported to me and my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, on food irradiation.  The committee did not carry out independent studies but reviewed international scientific data and studies on the issue.  In view of the wide range of scientific information available going back many years this was the most appropriate approach.</P>
    <P>The committee concluded that the technology presents no hazard to the health of the consumer when applied in an approved manner to specified categories of food.</P>
    <P>Any proposal to set up a food irradiation plant in this country would, in the first instance, be subject to the provisions of the Nuclear Energy (General Control of Fissile Fuels, Radioactive Substances and Irradiating Apparatus) Order, 1977 (S.I. No. 166 of 1977) which prohibits any activities including custody and use of radioactive substances, radioactive devices, irradiating apparatus and radioactive waste products save under licence issued by the Nuclear Energy Board.  The Nuclear Energy Board attaches to each licence such conditions as are considered necessary for safety.</P>
    <P>The construction and operation of such a facility would, if licensed by the board, be closely monitored by the board, to ensure that the level of external radiation due to the normal operation of the facility is extremely low and indistinguishable from natural background radiation.</P>
    <P>There are proposals at present with the Council of the European Communities for the adoption of a Directive on foods and food ingredients treated with ionizing radiation.  The Food Safety Advisory Committee in its report recommended that because of the potential to reduce foodborne diseases and to prevent food wastage without any risk to public health these proposals should be accepted in principle.  By strictly regulating the irradiation treatment of food, and by <Col N="1335" /> requiring labelling informing the consumer, a Directive would afford the consumer safeguards, and the right of choice, which he does not enjoy in the absence of Community Rules.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for dealing with the Commission's proposals on the release of genetically modified micro-organisms into the environment is shared between my colleagues the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not reassured by the Minister's reply.  He talks about independent studies done by other groups.  It is an old story where we do not seem to be able to monitor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>To what extent is the Minister assured that the irradiation of food does not, as claimed by some sources, destroy up to 70 per cent of the vitamins in the food, that it denatures the protein in food and that there is a loss of taste &mdash; which for some foods may not be a bad thing &mdash; but nevertheless there are serious claims with regard to the effects which irradiation has on food?  Can he indicate if he is satisfied that irradiation can be up to 300,000 times the strength of a chest X-ray?  Would he agree that that dosage is not acceptable?  Is he aware that the proposed Directive from the Commission proposes that there will be no labelling of individual food items on sale to the consumer if these are delivered <Col N="1336" /> in bulk; in other words the consumer will not know that they are buying irradiated food if these products are delivered in bulk?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied on the basis of the advice given to me by the Food Safety Advisory Committee that there is no risk in irradiation.  I am satisfied on the evidence presented to me that that was a correct decision.  On the question of how the irradiation works in regard to different elements in the food I do not have the detailed information here.  In relation to the consumer, what I feel is very important about the Directive &mdash; indeed it was in the last part of my reply &mdash; is that by strictly regulating the irradiation treatment of food, and by requiring labelling informing the consumer, it would afford the consumer safeguards. It is vitally important that the consumer would be informed, and then the consumer has the right of choice which they do not enjoy in the absence of some rule or regulation.</P>

Ceapaim gur féidir a rá gur glacadh go ginearálta leis an Dara Céim, agus beidh seans againn é a phlé níos mine ar Chéim an Choiste amach anseo.  I thank all the Deputies who contributed to the debate on the Bill.  It is fair to say that Members on all sides of the House have in general welcomed the Bill on which a number of points and questions were raised. Obviously some of these can be carefully teased out on Committee Stage. However, I will try to reply to some of the more general points made.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan made a number of points on the DNA test.  This test will be done at our own forensic science laboratory which operates to the very highest standards.  If an accused wants to have a sample independently tested he may do so and, if he is in receipt of legal aid, then the cost of the test will be met from that source.  With regard to the regulations, all the important safeguards&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Let me repeat the last point I made.  If an accused wants to have a sample independently tested he may do so and if he is in receipt of legal aid then the cost of the test will be met from that source.  With regard to the regulations, all the important safeguards are included in the Bill.  The regulations will outline the detailed procedures.</P>
      <P>The DNA test will be introduced as soon as possible.  I can assure Deputy Kavanagh that this will be the case.  The dangers posed by AIDS have to be taken into account.  The Deputy was right to highlight this point.  He also stated that the legal technicalities will be used to thwart the provisions of the Bill.  This is always a danger but I believe the Bill is carefully drafted.  I hope this will not be a problem.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCartan raised quite a number of points.  He expressed concern at the use of inferences.  It should be pointed out that an inference will only arise if consent is refused without good cause.  It will not be enough on its own to secure a conviction.  Other corroborative evidence must be produced.  He also expressed concern about possible abuses such as the use of the power for information gathering.  The very exacting safeguards in the Bill rule out this possibility.</P>

      <P>Deputy McCartan recommended the use of district justices in the making of authorisations.  This simply is not practical.  When we come to Committee Stage I will be able to give the Deputy very detailed reasons why this is so.  The Deputy also referred to the retention of records.  This is in line with what is contained in the 1984 Criminal Justice Act in relation to fingerprints, photographs and swabs.  He also mentioned video and audio-taping.  This matter can best be considered when the report of the Martin Committee becomes available.  The Deputy made a number of points on the way samples should be treated and stored.  These points have been noted and the regulations will deal with these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1386" /> The Deputy referred in detail to the methodology used on the DNA test and its evidential value.  As the Minister said, this Bill does not represent an endorsement of the DNA or any other test.  The value of the test is a matter for the courts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews mentioned the use of force in the taking of samples.  The position is that the Garda can use reasonable force to take non-intimate and non-intrusive samples such as head hair, fingernail scrapings or a swab from the hand.  What we are talking about is forcefully taking or holding the suspect's hand. The force employed must be reasonable. Nothing would be justified which would cause injury.  What is involved is simply the same power which exists in relation to the taking of fingerprints.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews raised the question of the reliability of the DNA test.  I have already dealt with this matter and the Bill makes no claims for any test.  The powers provided in the Bill are necessary even if there were no DNA test.  The value or the weight to be given to evidence procured for any forensic test is a matter for the courts to decide.  I think the Deputy accepts this.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dempsey mentioned the value of tests like DNA profiling in securing convictions in rape cases.  I very much agree with the Deputy.  Evidence may be thus provided which would not otherwise be available.</P>
    <P>This is an important Bill which when enacted it will provide the Garda Siochána with a vital weapon in the fight against serious crime.  The Bill will enable the Garda to take advantage of modern developments in forensic testing procedures, including the DNA profiling and genetic finger printing test which can provide extremely accurate and reliable information for the purpose of identification.  It also must not be forgotten that the powers which are provided for in the Bill currently before the House are not there for the benefit of the prosecuting authorities alone but are just as capable of establishing that a particular person did not commit an <Col N="1387" /> offence of which he may have been suspected.</P>
    <P>I accept that where important new powers are given to the Garda it is necessary to provide adequate safeguards for persons who may be subjected to these powers.  This has been done in the Bill.  I do not propose to go over old ground in this respect but it is worth mentioning that no sample could be taken under the Bill without the specific authorisation of a Garda officer of at least superintendent rank, and that officer would have to be satisfied that a sample would help to establish whether a suspect was involved in a particular case.  In addition, where intimate samples are required, it will be necessary for the Garda to obtain the consent of the suspect.</P>

      <P>Last Wednesday night I referred to a strike which is taking place in my city, Cork, in a computer components company with a total workforce of over 200 people at present on official strike.  We are talking today about labour relations, establishing goodwill and understanding within the labour field. So I am making a very special appeal from this House to the workers on strike, the trade union and the employers to come together at this stage to talk and establish goodwill and understanding which eventually should lead to a compromise to the satisfaction of all.  I know of the hardship that exists among the workers and their families.  I know, too, of the risk involved in losing a very viable industry in the Cork city area. Therefore, I am making this very special appeal this evening to all concerned to get together to establish that goodwill and eventually to return to work with the re-establishment of the good relations that existed in that industry down through the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent disputes in essential service areas are of concern to us all.  The frequency of disputes in such services, as we have seen over the years, has been a major feature of poor industrial relations. Electricity supplies have been interrupted; transport and communications have been disrupted; hospital services are being curtailed and food and food supplies have been threatened on various occasions.  Because of the hardship and inconvenience caused to the general public and the harm inflicted on the economy by such disputes there have been demands for action to prevent them or minimise their effects.  The trade union movement has a basic responsibility to ensure that vital requirements such as public health and safety are not threatened by industrial action in essential services. It must be recognised that essential services concern more than simply employers and union; the public interest must be regarded and should be a vital consideration in disputes in such services. I would suggest that specific arrangements be worked out between employers, unions and Government <Col N="1390" /> either on a national or industrial level which would provide that, in essential services and public utilities, sufficient workers would remain available to provide an agreed minimum level of services during the period of industrial action.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a labour relations commission incorporating the Labour Court and the present conciliation services will be a major improvement.  The provision that the Rights Commissioners will operate under the aegis of the labour relations commission will also add greatly to our present industrial relations structures. These reforms will offer an excellent basis for the development of a more rational industrial relations culture and, as we move to the Single European Market, we must be sure that our practices, procedures and laws in all areas are up to European standards.</P>
    <P>The power and influence of the trade union movement as a valued social partner in the development of our economy are both recognised and appreciated.  The trade union movement and employers have at their disposal vast educational facilities to develop their members' understanding of their role and responsibility within the industrial relations framework.  Good industrial relations is a factor high on the agenda of most multinational organisations looking for investment locations.  We must invest in our industrial relations support system, the Labour Court and the conciliation services. This is an investment in our future prosperity and that of all our citizens if we are to become and remain credible competitors in the industrial and commercial Europe of 1992 and beyond.</P>
    <P>All Members contributing to this very important legislation must understand the Minister's position in the matter.  We are talking about not alone workers, employees or employers but about all the partners in the industrial field, and we can make no exceptions.  We have to walk in the middle of the road to ensure that this legislation meets with the approval of the three partners.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on bringing this legislation to the House.  I know of his consultation work with the trade <Col N="1391" /> unions and the employers' federations trying to bring in legislation to satisfy all the requirements as far as possible.  That is all a Minister can do.  He has acted in a most responsible way.  As Labour spokesman, I want to compliment him on the work he has carried out with such efficiency and dedication in the Department of Labour, a Department very important for any community who look to them for advice, guidance and co-operation to build up a viable, efficient workforce.</P>
    <P>I dealt with a number of points previously. I do not wish to repeat myself but Deputies must understand the Minister's position in trying to satisfy the social partners working within labour relations.  Rather than singling out one in this legislation he is trying to bring about this kind of co-operation for the benefit of this nation.  We are approaching 1992 when competition will be great and more and more pressure will be put on our labour force.  Again I compliment the Minister and ask that he and his Department ensure that he gets co-operation to ensure this legislation will be helpful above all to our workforce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Industrial Relations Bill, 1989, is over cautious and over subtle.  The fact that it offends nobody, while an achievement in itself, merely highlights the fact that the Bill only skirts several issues and totally avoids many more.  I suppose in a way it reflects the endearing personality of the Minister for Labour, who I acknowledge cannot be here for this debate this afternoon. I welcome in his place the Minister for Education and express the hope that for her this is a learning experience in industrial relations which may be called into play in future years.  Certainly I would welcome her at any time as an opposite number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill so far as it goes is welcome. Its standing as a landmark Bill, though diminished by its omissions, is assured.  It is probably the most significant industrial relations legislation since 1906 and, therefore, in the history of the State.  Its <Col N="1392" /> timing is also excellent, coming as it does at a time of unparallelled industrial peace.  Yet in a strange way these facts serve to make the Bill's omissions all the more grievous.  The rare opportunity to put right many of the most glaring causes of industrial strife in our troubled past has been missed.</P>
    <P>Let us reflect on the principal causes and then compare the Bill's provisions with these causes and how, if at all, it addresses them.  First, the thorniest and most costly cause of strikes in the past have been inter-union disputes, where one union was not a member of Congress. The Bill makes no provision for the resolution of such disputes.  Secondly, the Bill makes no provision regarding picketing at multi-employer locations, for example, ports where many employers are based, airports, industrial estates or shopping centres.  Many Members will recall a small group of workers of one employer in Dublin port who closed the port and in the process, because of the strategic nature of the port, strangled the entire country.  With this Bill the present position remains unchanged.  Third, while making provision for secret balloting &mdash; a very welcome provision &mdash; it does not adequately address the question of who is entitled to vote in any particular ballot.  Is it only members of one union in a multi-union employment because only one union is in dispute, even though all trade unions could be affected by any picket?  Is it only members of a particular union in a section of employment, even though all members of all unions in all sections could be affected by the picket? Fourth, the Bill omits any requirement on employers for an adequately trained and resourced personnel function.  Yet anyone who knows anything about the history of industrial relations in the Republic will know that in employment where there have been repeated strikes over the years there has been one consistent factor, that is, bad management. The Bill does not address the question of the personnel function of employers.</P>
    <P>It funks the issue of essential public utilities other than in the health area and mandatory cooling-off periods are not <Col N="1393" /> provided for.  It does not deal with strikes in the sewerage or waterworks, the ESB or public Departments of State.  This is one of the five serious omissions in the Bill.  These are the areas which have given rise to most trouble in the past and they will again.  We cannot ignore the impact the recession has had on expectations in the past few years.  This in turn has brought about industrial peace but we cannot ignore the probability that as economic recovery continues&mdash;if it continues &mdash; it is likely that expectations will rise and that the incidence of strikes will rise also.  Now is the time, unsullied by the rancour or bitterness of any individual dispute, that essential if thorny reforms should have been embraced.  The Minister's failure in this regard may not be evident to many just now but, in the fullness of time, people will look back to this time and this debate and ask why the Minister did not anticipate the industrial storms which will inevitably brew up from time to time in the future.  The Bill in that respect has been a serious mistake, not in anything it does but in what it omits to do.</P>
    <P>I recall another serious mistake when I was shadowing a previous Fianna Fáil Minister for Labour, a former Member of this House, Gene Fitzgerald.  It was proposed in the seventies that a commission on industrial relations be set up composed of an equal number of representatives of the social partners, the employers and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The then Minister very unwisely decided to announce his own chairman of the commission, his parliamentary colleague, then Senator, now Deputy Brian Hillery, a very fine man, a professor of industrial relations and very competent.  The Minister broke the basic rule of industrial relations&mdash; prior consultation &mdash; and of course the nomination of Professor Hillery was rejected.  Thus the commission got off to a very bad start.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a second mistake. He nominated another chairman of the commission and drew up terms of reference which were not acceptable to one of the social partners, the Congress, who <Col N="1394" /> withdrew from the commission.  The Minister unwisely decided to proceed with only one side at the table.  As I foretold, he delayed by more than a decade necessary industrial relations reforms.  It was obvious that no matter how good the recommendations of that one-sided commission would be, the non-participating side would have to reject them.  I debated with that Minister in this House.  Here we are 12 years later with the Industrial Relations Bill before us.  That mistake by the then Minister for Labour delayed reform as I predicted it would, with disastrous consequences in the meantime.</P>
    <P>While I welcome this Bill, 12 years late as it is, I regret that it has major omissions.  The Minister, the Government and the State will rue the day before many years have elapsed.  This was the time for tackling the thorny issues.  Not alone are the social partners better positioned to tolerate reform than every before, free from the heat of battle, but the political climate is right as never before and possibly as never again.  It would be absurd to think that all past, present and future industrial relations difficulties can be legislated for &mdash; they cannot&mdash;but if procedures, institutions and regulations are well designed many a heated battle will be defused and many a thorny issue excised.</P>
    <P>Our written Constitution and its explicit and implicit provisions adds an additional constraint which is not present in other jurisdictions and that is mostly a good thing.  It grants a right to associate and a consequent right to dissociate. This has major implications for the closed shop and, therefore, for the potential number of unions in any one workplace. It is forbidden under our Constitution and under successive rulings of the Supreme Court to legislate that one union only may represent workers of any category in any one workplace.  Hence the importance of clear provisions for the resolution of inter-union disputes and for balloting etc. in multi-union employments. This Bill does not deal with any of the questions on balloting that arise.  It does not provide for inter-union disputes and their resolution.  It does not provide <Col N="1395" /> for balloting in multi-union employment, though in practice where there are several unions belonging to congress in one employment, the congress rules, which are normally very good, will sort out the problem.</P>
    <P>The most grievous problems in the past have been, as they will be again, where some of the unions in the workplace are not congress unions.  These problems greatly diminish where all the unions are members of the ICTU due to their very elaborate and very effective inter-union dispute procedures and their all-out picket procedures.  Our Constitution does not allow, nor should it, for legislation requiring compulsory membership of congress and almost by definition the non-congress unions leave congress or never join it in the first place because of a desire to be more militant than congress permits or to poach members from other unions.  In a sense this is the biggest gap in the Bill.  I would like to have seen clear provisions in the Bill for inter-unions disputes but, where only congress unions were involved, to subordinate the legislative provisions to the congress ones.  I am not sure if such legislative provisions would be possible under the Constitution but I intend to explore this on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In the Fine Gael policy document on industrial relations published in 1979 we proposed a scheme whereby any group of unions operating together with a minimum number of members, say 300,000, would be granted a general licensing warrant which would exempt those unions covered by that general warrant from the provisions which followed.  We then made provison for an individual licensing warrant which had more detailed provisions and requirements.  I regret that the present Bill does not adopt the approach proposed then in the Fine Gael industrial relations document.</P>
    <P>No debate on industrial relations can be allowed pass without paying warm tribute to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and their constituent members. They, above all other vested interest groups, have shown over the years a <Col N="1396" /> greater regard for the national interest over their own sectional interests.  The present <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> is a clear case in point.  I can only hope that this regard for the national interest will also transpire as enlightened self interest.  The regard of Congress for the national interest is something that we ought to appreciate.  It is not new, and at this time it has played a very significant part in bringing about the turnaround in our economic affairs.  The present <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> is unique in that it is of three years duration and the annual pay rises provided under it are sub-inflationary.  Fine Gael urge an advance and welcome the congress decision earlier this month to continue with the agreement.  While acknowleding the difficulties, it is Fine Gael's view that there is no fundamental reason that the three year format should not be continued in the next agreement and possibly thereafter.  Indeed the three year pay format should be extended to include three year Exchequer budgeting on a rolling basis.  This would be a giant leap forward in managing the nation's finances and would overcome many of the pitfalls of annual budgeting, as I am sure the Minister for Education will agree.</P>

      <P>Any Minister who has had the job of presiding over a spending Department will know how frustrating it is to save money only to find it clawed back by the Minister for Finance at the end of the year and then to have to fight the battle to get it back again.  It makes for very bad planning, inefficient spending and frequently forces Departments into over speedy spending of money that they might not want to spend but they know that if they do not spend it by 31 December they will not be able to roll it over into the next year.  They have to fight for it again and, very frequently, lose it.  As a result the decision in respect of many projects that has been approved, and the approval notified to the people concerned, is reversed in the following <Col N="1397" /> year.  In my view the three year period of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> should be extended to the annual budgeting of the Department of Finance and of the Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Labour has been playing down the possibility of another three year agreement and playing up the difficulties. I do not blame him for that, that is his job.  There will be difficulties.  I would like to make it clear that we in this party, the main Opposition party, feel that the three year format is very good for the country, for the people generally and for trade union members.  It helps to bring certainty and to eliminate a lot of difficulties.  It helps industry and it will help job creation provided that the parameters of the agreement are right.  The format accepted in 1987 involving all the partners in the NESC should be further developed so that key matters not possible by way of plant bargaining should be taken into account.  I have in mind income tax and PRSI which can directly affect take home pay and also the question of means testing and other post-pay packet State interventions which can affect the relative value of take home pay, for instance, differential rent, mortgage assistance, etc., State interventions that happen after you get your pay packet and which can affect the actual disposable income of a worker.  I hope that in future agreements in the NESC format these factors can also be taken into account.</P>
      <P>The national agreement format, however, also has serious dangers and pitfalls which must at all costs be avoided. National agreements have been used before by at least three Taoisigh, including Mr. Seán Lemass and the present Taoiseach, to hike up national pay offers in order to bring electoral popularity in advance of general elections.  National agreements of that kind have been disastrous for the economy and for jobs.  We would be better off with no agreement than one of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next agreement must continue to be sub-inflationary with improvements in living standards and take home pay coming from tax concessions and from <Col N="1398" /> social insurance contribution adjustments. Only through low inflation can we be competitive and set the scene for job creation.  Job creation must have a higher priority in the next national agreement than in the present one.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I know there will be difficulties.  The last agreement was reached in an atmosphere of crisis and that induced all the social partners to sit down together &mdash; farmers, employers, the unions and the Government &mdash; and come up with a plan to help cement economic recovery.  It is defeatist to say that because the crisis has eased it has completely disappeared.  It has not.  It is defeatist to say that because the crisis has eased it is still not possible, not alone essential, that we have another national agreement of that sort which would equally serve the national interest as well as the interests of trade union members.</P>
    <P>I had the privilege of being a shop steward in what was then the Workers' Union of Ireland and subsequently the Federated Workers' Union of Ireland, now merged with the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union and known as SIPTU.  I have already welcomed the reemergence of OBU &mdash; one big union &mdash; and I am very glad to see the reunification of the union of Larkin and Connolly.  Not only have I had a life long connection with the union and very direct personal involvement but my family's connection with the union goes back a long time. I am not saying necessarily that big is beautiful but I want to re-echo what was said in the Minister's speech, that frequently trade unions do not have the resources to provide themselves with adequate research, adequate education and adequate training.  Indeed the same, if not more, could be said in that respect about political parties which are totally inadequately funded to do proper research and proper training and to engage in proper education of their people.  That lack in both political parties and the trade unions can be very costly economically if people are making policy proposals or negotiating agreements, the end result of which they do not understand. For that reason and given the <Col N="1399" /> highly constructive role of the trade union movement, I have for long held the view that the amount of funds put at the disposal of the trade union movement by the State for research, training and education should be greatly increased.  It would be a very wise investment and no more than enlightened self-interest on the part of the State.</P>
    <P>My contribution to date has been a general reflection on the contents and omissions of the Bill.  The purpose of the Bill according to the explanatory memorandum is to bring about a better framework for collective bargaining and dispute settlement by making a number of important changes in trade union law and in industrial relations law generally.</P>
    <P>The memorandum says that the proposed changes in trade union law will tighten and clarify the law in relation to picketing, especially secondary picketing. There are different definitions of secondary picketing.  I know that employers want secondary picketing banned.  The Minister rejects that categoric step on the basis that workers cannot be restricted from placing a picket on any employer who would seek to deliberately subvert a strike.  The whole question of secondary picketing will have to be teased out on Committee Stage.  A form of secondary picketing, although not covered by the definition here, is a picket which affects employers who have no connection with the strike.  That too will have to be teased out on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not deal with the case where there is a common entrance to more than one employer, for instance, in industrial estates, airports, shopping centres and so on.  The Bill does not give employees the right of access to private property in order to allow them to picket the premises of their own employer in these cases.  The Bill specifically says &ldquo;or on approaches to.&rdquo;  That seems to cement in law the notion that the proper place to picket any multi-employer locations is at the entrance to these locations.  Therefore, a small percentage <Col N="1400" /> of the total workforce in a multi-employer location could picket and keep people out of work.  This problem is more acute where the union concerned is a non-congress union.  Where there is a congress union, at least the all out picket procedures of the congress are effective.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum says that the Bill hopes to build on existing good practice in the area of pre-strike secret ballots by providing that unions must have a rule requiring the holding of such ballots.  Nobody will say that is other than a wise provision.  It is a global provision that does not go into the sort of detail I would like.  Nor has the Minister in his introductory speech elaborated on what he would envisage would be in codes of practice in this respect to be drawn up by the proposed commission.</P>
    <P>There are very complex issues as to who is entitled to vote in any dispute. Take, for instance, Guinness where there are different categories of staff.  Let us say that laboratory technicians belong to a small union and have a grading disput with the company and after exhaustive negotiations decide to strike. These workers represent 2 per cent of the workforce and are not members of congress.  Should that picket have the same protection as a picket with the support of the majority of the workforce? These questions are not addressed in the Bill or in the Minister's introductory speech.</P>
    <P>These issues are complex.  It would be easy to say that a majority at that workplace could be expected to vote for a picket in a strike relating to their interests, but what about the rights of minorities?  Minorities have rights regardless of the size of the majority. These questions have not been addressed and we will have to tease them out on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions which prohibit <i>ex parte</i> injunctions &mdash; these are injunctions which are often granted in the dead of night by a High Court Judge in chambers or at home to senior counsel for the employer, without counsel for the trade unions being present.  I welcome the change in that respect but I would <Col N="1401" /> have gone much further.  I am not convinced that the High Court is the right place to resolve industrial relations disputes. In the past there have been rigid interpretations of the law by High Court judges.  We have seen workers in dispute ending up in jail, seen them sent home in taxis at the expense of the State.</P>
    <P>Any basic reform of the industrial relations institutions proposed in this Bill or the formation of a labour relations commission and, to a certain extent, the reform of the Labour Court, should have included a mechanism whereby a legal member of the Labour Court, perhaps with the status of a High Court judge, could sit with industrial relations assessors at the appropriate tribunal or forum for dealing with injunctions or other judicial aspects of industrial relations disputes.  The Bill is somewhat disppointing and unadventurous in that regard although, admittedly, they are very complex areas.  In the present lull in the industrial relations storm, an opportunity has been missed to deal with these complex problems.  It is very difficult to envisage times arising again which would enable these thorny issues to be grasped.</P>
    <P>Under the trade union law provisions the Bill deals further with the rationalisation of the trade union movement. I welcome those provisions.  The second part of the Bill deals with the setting up of a labour relations commission with general responsibility for the promotion of good industrial relations. The function of the commission will be to encourage and facilitate a more active approach to dispute prevention and resolution and, as a result, the original purpose and status of Labour Court investigation and recommendations will be restored.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal to create a labour relations commission.  However, we must be careful to lay down very clear rules and guidelines as to how the labour relations commission, the Rights Commissioners and the equality tribunal under it relate to the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>While these provisions are very <Col N="1402" /> clearcut, it is vitally important that the relationships laid down are sufficiently flexible to deal with the sorts of problems which will arise from time to time.  The Minister sees the Labour Court as a court of last resort rather than a court of first resort.  On the other hand, the social partners &mdash; the unions and the employers &mdash; say that that should be the case except where they agree between them to go to the Labour Court.  The Minister said he will not allow that even where two parties to a dispute agree to go to the Labour Court and be bound in advance by their findings.  On Committee Stage we will need to further reflect on the nuances of the argument, as to whether the Minister or the social partners are right or if something in between would be more appropriate.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not innovative in the sense that it does not look at alternative methods of dispute settlement.  Very often the opening demands made by trade unions are inflated as a negotiating ploy; similarly, the opening offers of employers are reduced as an opening ploy.  Very often a lot of time is wasted and bad blood is created from the hassling negotiations which then ensue.</P>
    <P>There is an alternative way.  In Canada they have a different arbitration system where, if both sides agree, the matter can go to arbitration on the basis that the finding of the arbitrator is accepted in advance.  There is an additional condition that the arbitrator can decide only to adopt in full the offer of the employers or the trade union claim.  The starkness of that approach induces reality from an early stage into discussions between employers and trade unions; it very often avoids the necessity for protracted and heated negotiations which often lead to bad will and sourness which can continue for a considerable time after the dispute has been resolved.  Of course that would be a very major change here but it serves to highlight that there are alternative methods and options which maybe we should provide in this area of industrial relations.  The Minister has chosen not to be adventurous in this respect.  Perhaps on reflection it is the wiser course. I <Col N="1403" /> mention it in passing because it works extremely well in Canada which has a very proud industrial development record and has managed to provide for its workforce &mdash; and people generally &mdash; great prosperity.</P>
    <P>I very much look forward to Committee Stage of the Industrial Relations Bill.  I hope the Minister will be open to constructive and significant amendments because all Members have a joint interest and, generally, a joint approach to it.  We do not have in this House &mdash; or in the country &mdash; the ideological split that exists in the United Kingdom.  We do not have any party interested in merely promoting the interests of employers or in bashing trade unions.  There is a widespread consensus that this is an area where we can do things not by ideology or heated exchanges but by discussion and negotiation.</P>
    <P>I hope that will be the atmosphere in which Committee and Report Stages will be considered.  It will certainly be my approach to the remaining Stages.  I intend to table a number of substantive amendments to the Bill and to go into much greater detail as to its provisions.  I hope that in the final analysis the Bill that will emerge from this House and from the Seanad, and which will be ultimately brought into law by the President, will stand the test of time, that it will improve our industrial relations on a permanent basis and, above all&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>He is now representing the milk producers of the Monaghan area.  The proposals of the Minister for Agriculture and Food for the distribution of the milk quota reserve among small producers &mdash; the extra eight million gallons becoming available for this purpose &mdash; are grossly unfair and inequitable to all small producers in the west but they are monstrously unfair to the small producers in the north Connaught farmer co-operative area.  The proposals are a travesty of justice.  They are also contrary to the spirit, if not the letter, of the EC Regulation which provided the extra supply and envisaged that all eligible producers would be treated equally and even-handedly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will give two simple figures to illustrate this injustice.  There is no need to garnish or embellish the message from these figures; they speak for themselves. The eligible producer in a southern co-operative area, which the Minister of State knows very well, will get 833 extra gallons of milk; the eligible producer in the north Connaught farmer co-operative will get 189 extra gallons, the product of one blind teat.  The story in the other western co-operative areas is much the same.  This is unfair treatment of the small producer in the west.  It derives, I regret to say, from the Machiavellian formula devised by the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, to limit allocation to any co-operative to 1.25 per cent of its existing quota level, irrespective of the percentage of the suppliers of that co-operative who might be eligible &mdash; I understand eligible suppliers are those <Col N="1405" /> supplying 12,800 gallons or less.  This is not a formula based on fairness, justice or need; it is simply a craven cave-in to what I might call the Golden Vale lobby.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows the facts better than I do but I have an obligation to put them on the record of this House because I certainly believe he will not do so.  The small milk producer is defined as the man supplying 12,800 gallons or less.  The average supply of farmers in the north Connaught co-operative area is 10,000 gallons; for Golden Vale it is 20,000 gallons; for Mitchelstown it is 30,400 gallons and for Avonmore and Waterford it is 33,600 gallons.  Therefore, roughly two-thirds, or 2,300 producers in north Connaught will share about 450,000 gallons whereas in a southern co-operative 1,200 producers will share one million gallons.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in the paper that all this has been done in the interest of balance.  That is some balance.  How can the Minister for Agriculture and Food preside over this injustice?  How can Commissioner MacSharry, who knows the position intimately, tolerate this injustice where one man, who happens to be surrounded by big farmers will get 833 gallons while another man, who happens to be surrounded by small farmers, will get 189 gallons?  I am not asking for a special case for the west; I am simply looking for equality all round, for the same even-handed treatment for the small producer wherever he is, and, at that, he would only be getting about 500 gallons which is not great but is important to the people for whom I speak.  This formula came as a huge surprise to the entire agricultural community.  If the Minister perpetuates this injustice he will be remembered, I regret to say, not with fond memories as long as cows are milked in the west.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cotter</NameTxt>
      <P>That is more than adequate for what I want to say.  I want to straight away condemn the decision of <Col N="1406" /> the Minister in this matter.  In everybody's view &mdash; and I have just received a letter from some of the parties involved &mdash; it is thought to be a ludicrous decision. It discriminates against farmers in the western counties in a very blatant fashion.  It is unfair in the extreme.  There is something quite sinister behind the decision.  Since the original announcement that 11 million gallons were available, various pressure groups have been working on the Minister &mdash; it is normal practice that people will make representations &mdash; people who wanted the division carried out in a particular way. As decision day approached, my information and that of the Front Bench personnel who act on my behalf was that all the pressure groups, including the Minster's people in the Department, accepted that the extra quota would be divided equally between all the qualifying applicants.  Two days later the Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy, made what was considered to be a very surprising decision.</P>
      <P>The Department officials had no idea how this scheme was to operate and they are still not sure.  The average supplier in my county produces about 12,000 gallons of milk.  When the eight million gallons available for this purpose are divided, the suppliers in my county and in the western counties generally will get about 200 gallons and, in some cases, way below that. That in itself is not a big problem, except in so far as people in the south will get at least four times that amount.  This is where the inequity arises.  Surely anybody with a fair-minded approach will realise that it is grossly unfair.  The western counties, and my county in particular, are the areas of greatest need.  In those areas there is a very high proportion of farmers in dairying who are finding it very difficult to make a living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I particularly detest about this decision is the precedent that seems to be involved.  Are we to expect that in future when a further quota becomes available, the same kind of approach will be taken by the Minister?  Are we to expect that the heavies, as we have to call them, in the southern counties will be able to twist the arm again and ensure <Col N="1407" /> that the quota goes to their area rather than to areas of greatest need?  This is one of my great concerns.  I implore the Minister of State, Deputy Walsh, to prevail upon the senior Minister to change his mind even at this late stage because there is a great furore across the western counties about this.</P>
    <P>A meeting was held yesterday with some people from the Connacht region. They were flabbergasted that this had happened in the first place.  I have a letter from the Cavan-Monaghan area, which was delivered to me by hand a few minutes ago, telling me the people there cannot understand how this came about. The underlying problem is, of course, that the officials still do not know how the division is to be carried out.  The Minister acted in a way that is completely outside the norm.  Surely he should have taken advice from the people in the Department.  Surely he should have first tried to figure out if it was possible to do what I am suggesting so that the day after he made his announcement the decision would not be looked upon as asinine. That is what is being considered.  We are angry about that and we will continue to draw attention to it whenever possible.  I hope the decision will be reversed immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I do not accept that there was any inequity contained in the decisions I announced recently for the allocation of the 11 million gallons of quota.  In the <Col N="1408" /> distribution of this quota, my first priority was to ensure that the additional quotas are allocated to those producers most severely affected by the quota system.  In fact, the only real problem I had was that the additional quota was not sufficient.  If we had 111 million gallons we would have been able to do a lot more for deserving producers in the north-west and the south-west.  For that reason, I decided to allocate eight million gallons to small scale milk producers whose quotas do not exceed 12,800 gallons, a further two million gallons to young farmers under 35 years of age with appropriate training and educational qualifications and one million gallons to other special category producers who have suffered hardship because of inadequate quotas.</P>
      <P>I was also concerned to ensure that the additional quotas would be divided as evenly as possible and that the co-ops and dairies in any area should not gain to an unfair extent over those in other areas. For that reason, I decided that, in relation to the total of ten million gallons to be allocated to small scale milk producers and to young farmers, a limit would apply so that no individual co-operative or dairy will obtain an allocation in excess of 1.25 per cent of their quota level.  I consider this approach to be the fairest and most equitable in order to achieve a reasonable balance.  I am satisfied now that I have set it at about the right level as I have the western and north-eastern co-ops complaining that it is not high enough while those in the south and east have stated that it is too high.  There are complaints from both areas.  It is difficult to please everybody when there is not enough to go around.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should point out to Deputies Nealon and Cotter that I have already taken similar steps in the past to ensure that the western and north-eastern co-operatives would not suffer disproportionate losses of quota in comparison to the south and east.  In particular, in relation to the Community milk cessation scheme, I succeeded in negotiating an amendment to the Community regulations specifically to ensure that excessive amounts of quota would not be lost <Col N="1409" /> to the western areas of this country.  As a result of my endeavours, the amount of quota leaving the western and north-eastern areas on a voluntary basis was restricted even though this meant that compulsory cuts had to be made in the quotas of producers in other parts of the country, principally in the southern and eastern areas.  We do not want all of the milk or a disproportionate amount of it produced in any single area.</P>
    <P>It is evident that without my taking action and fixing a maximum limit for loss from any area at 3.25 per cent of a co-operative's quota, the losses of quota from western and northern areas would have been significantly higher.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, in 1984 in the original distribution of the national quota, because of the favourable treatment bestowed on co-operatives or daires with a large number of small scale milk producers, those in the west and north-east received 6 per cent to 8 per cent above their 1983 levels of deliveries, while those in the south and east received approximately 4 per cent above those levels. Small scale producers in the west and north-east have also generally fared better than their southern counterparts in other quota schemes such as restructuring, temporary leasing and flexi-milk allocations.</P>
    <P>In deciding on the allocation of the additional 11 million gallons, I had to have regard to the various arrangements made under the quota system since its introduction in 1984 and to maintain as far as possible a reasonable balance in all parts of the country.  I considered that imposing a limit on the overall amount of quota to go to any co-operative or dairy was the best way to achieve this.  I therefore included this condition in the proposals I submitted for the approval of the EC before making my announcement on these matters.  The Commission's prior approval was required under the scheme and they accepted the validity of the case for an upper limit to prevent unfair losses of quotas from certain areas.  So I consider the decisions that I have announced for the allocation of this 11 million gallons <Col N="1410" /> of quota&mdash;which incidentally was introduced in response to a joint initiative from the French Minister for Agriculture and our Minister, Deputy O'Kennedy last year &mdash; are the fairest and most equitable, taking into account the varied needs of producers, co-operatives and dairies in all parts of the country.</P>
    <P>Those regulations and conditions were prepared in conjunction with the milk quota review group who are representative of all the farming organisations and the ICOS, the co-operatives' governing body.  Deputy Ferris asked why herd numbers were required.  In many cases farmers, with an existing quota who had one member of the family with an outside portion of land, were operating the farm as one unit.  This move was in order to prevent farmers with a sizeable quota getting an additional quota.  We wanted to ensure that new entrants were bona fide farmers in their own right with their own milking parlours, equipment and herd numbers.  We want the most deserving to get the little milk that is available.  Perhaps some of those in the north-west and south-west, with small milk producers in their co-operative area, are a little alarmed because they are taking the average of all the small farmers in such an area.  For example, in Drinagh Co-operative they serve a considerable number of small farmers.  The qualifying criteria will include only those who produce at least 90 per cent of their eligible milk, those whose quotas were not leased or a part of them leased and farmers who had not purchased in excess of 2,000 gallons under any previous scheme.</P>

      <P>Concerned environmentalists might have rejoiced at the announcement of the Minister for the Environment that from 1 October next the marketing, sale and distribution of coal is to be banned in the Dublin built-up area.  However, those of us in Crumlin, Drimnagh, the Bluebell areas and Neilstown recognised that the Minister was engaging in a game of publicity-seeking <Col N="1411" /> for himself at the expense of those people who live in areas that had been declared smoke control zones by their representative local authorities, for example, Dublin Corporation for Crumlin areas A and B and Dublin County Council for Neilstown areas 1 and 2. CDL, having stupidly obstructed Dublin Corporation with their perpetual whingeing and objections about the declaration of smoke control zones, and with the timely demand by our parliamentary colleague, Deputy Quinn, who first led a chorus, &ldquo;ban the burning of bituminous coal&rdquo;, combined to give the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, and the Minister of State, Deputy Harney, their golden opportunity to appear to be reasonable and progressive in announcing that they would bow to the pressure that something must be done.  They outlawed the burning of coal from 1 October next.</P>
      <P>While those theatricals were taking place in the Dáil a different agenda was being worked out on the streets of Crumlin, Drimnagh and Bluebell where Dublin Corporation's environmental health officers were diligently pursuing the objective as laid down in the Air Pollution Act, 1987.  They were knocking on doors, assessing and monitoring the areas' consumption of coal and the effect of the burning of coal on the filters based in the Eastern Health Board's clinic on the Old County Road, Crumlin.  To effectively outlaw the burning of coal with one clean sweep of his Ministerial he has instructed the environmental health officers who are half way through the the public image of the Taoiseach whom marketing and public relations people, like Carr Communications, decided to market as an environmentally friendly President of the European Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at how environment-friendly he is to the residents of Crumlin and Bluebell.  He has given £4 million in grant assistance to the people of Ballyfermot to change over from the burning of bituminous coal to smokeless fuels and appliances.  The scheme has been very popular in Ballyfermot as indicated by the number of grant applications processed by Dublin Corporation to date. <Col N="1412" /> For example, in area A, of the 840 eligible applications, 664 have been processed; in area B of the 894 applications that were eligible, grant assistance will be given in 513 cases and, in area C, of the 3,000 that were eligible, 1,760 have been processed for grant assistance to date.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the people of Ballyfermot and, in particular, my party colleague, Deputy Mac Giolla, and the people on the ground led by Miss Linda Kavanagh who diligently campaigned that Ballyfermot, areas A, B, C and D be ratified by the Minister as smoke control zones.  The people of Drimnagh, Crumlin and Bluebell have suffered just as badly as the people of Ballyfermot from some of the highest levels of smoke pollution ever recorded in Dublin.  Is the Minister not aware that the monitor on the Old County Road in Crumlin recorded one of the highest ever recorded levels of pollution in any of the 12 Dublin Corporation monitors?  How does the Minister propose to help the people there in this situation?  He slaps them in the face and says: &ldquo;You are not to burn any more coal, you will have to buy more expensive coals.&rdquo;  He is treating them as second class citizens.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that coalite costs £57 a tonne more than coal.  He is punishing my constituents on two counts. First, he is forcing them to burn a fuel which is vastly more expensive and, second, he is depriving them of the grants to which they would be entitled if the Minister would sign the orders, agreed by Dublin City Council, for areas A and B of Crumlin.  All I am doing is asking the Minister for his signature.  I am not asking him for money out of his own pocket.  I am asking him to reverse the decision and his directive to Dublin Corporation instructing them to stop any further work on surveys to create further smoke control zones.  It is a disgrace that he has instructed the environmental health officers who are half way through the Cabra area to cease this activity and get back to their desks.  I am asking the Minister to do exactly as has been done in England&mdash;and continues to be done to this day&mdash;and in Belfast and Northern Ireland where 20 years later they are still <Col N="1413" /> continuing to create smoke control zones and grant-assisting the residents concerned.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to give in an orderly and planned manner grant assistance to people in this city to enable them to change to smokeless fuel.  The Minister's strategy to date has been to apply the whip to all outside the Ballyfermot area, to apply the full force of legislation at his disposal, to threaten, to penalise, to punish, to fine or to jail those who would break the law.  It is all whip and no carrot.  There are no enticements by way of grants available outside the area of Ballyfermot.  I am asking the Minister to allow Dublin Corporation to continue in a planned and orderly manner to create slowly and systematically smoke control zones, throught Dublin city and, after he has ratified areas A and B of Crumlin, to allow area C to be proceeded with at Dublin City Council level.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister not know or care about the effect his arbitrary ban will have on the vast majority of low income families in this city?  Does he think they are like himself, that they can afford central heating without assistance?  Does he not realise that for hundreds of thousands of people coal, at its present price, is dear enough and outside the reach of many people without forcing them to pay £57 a tonne more for smokeless fuel?</P>
    <P>In the Minister's eagerness to portray an environment friendly image of the Taoiseach to the world, he has stabbed in the back the ordinary man and woman in Dublin.  I should like to ask the Minister why he has not warned the people of Dublin of the dangers involved in burning certain alternative smokeless fuels, for example, calco and wondercoal, in fireplaces that have backboilers.  I am sure the Minister is aware of tests carried out in England on both the fireplaces and chimneys which have used these petrocoke products.  I suggest the Minister issue a statement after tonight's debate in the House and declare what he or she knows about the dangers involved in the burning of these products.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, all I am looking for here is fair play for the people of Crumlin and Drimnagh who believed, by virtue of the fact that their doors had been knocked <Col N="1414" /> on by Dublin Corporation, they would be treated in like manner with those of Ballyfermot and that they would be entitled to grant assistance if they wished to move away from the burning of bituminous coals to alternative fuels or to the use of other appliances.  I am afraid that what the Minister intends doing from 1 October is a money saving exercise, a PR gimmick that will penalise the least well off in this city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Deputy Byrne for raising this matter on the Adjournment but to say how disappointed I am that the steps that were taken by the Government do not have the support of the Deputy. Clean air, as the Deputy is aware, is a fundamental necessity in a healthy environment.  The Government were anxious that the smog in Dublin should be brought to an end, once and for all, and in the quickest possible time. Eighty per cent of the problem in Dublin was being caused by the burning of bituminous coal in the homes of Dublin.  The Government decided, therefore, to go directly to the heart of the matter in order to ensure that clean air prevailed throughout Dublin without further delay. Accordingly, from 1 October next the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal is being banned.  I should like to emphasise that the penalties will concentrate on the distributors, on those who market or sell coal, and will not be, concentrated on householders, as the Deputy seemed to suggest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a comprehensive citywide approach to improve air quality in all areas of Dublin and meets with the public demand for strong, remedial action.  As the elimination of bituminous coal goes directly to the source of the problem and will improve the situation in the built up area of Dublin as a whole from next winter, the need to create further special control area orders does not arise. Accordingly, it is not the intention nor is <Col N="1415" /> it necessary to confirm any more special control area orders.</P>
    <P>Once in operation, a special control area order imposes direct requirements on householders as to heating arrangements. They are obliged to convert their home heating systems, as necessary, to comply with the order.  Accordingly, provision has been made for grant assistance to help meet the cost of the requirements that are put on householders when area orders are made.  To date 7,000 or so householders have been involved in the areas confirmed in Ballyfermot.  No special control area orders have been confirmed in relation to any part of Dublin other than Ballyfermot.  It follows, therefore, that no grant assistance in respect of such areas arise.  We are satisfied that a range of suitable fuels will be available for householders next winter in place of coal.</P>
    <P>We are committed to ensure that any extra costs arising from the need to use smokeless or low smoke fuels are minimised for low income earners and social welfare recipients.  A sum of £3 million &mdash;£1 million per month &mdash; is being provided by the Government for the winter months of 1990 alone.  Details of the arrangements in relation to how this money will be paid will be announced as soon as possible.  I can say, however, that this money will not be made available in any form of grant assistance for heating conversions.</P>
    <P>We expect that Board Gáis Éireann and the ESB, in particular, will continue to make substantial inroads into the home heating market with or without conversion grants.  Both offer attractive, highly competitive conversion packages which provide cost-effective alternatives for those who wish to convert.  Between 1987 and 1989, for instance, these concerns sold well over 50,000 heating units in the Dublin area without grant assistance.</P>
    <P>We are confident that the measures taken by the Government will have the <Col N="1416" /> full support of the citizens of Dublin.  If we were to take the route suggested by Deputy Byrne and continue to survey houses and operate the Air Pollution Act&mdash;there are 200,000 houses in Dublin where coal is burned &mdash; it would take us at least ten years to comply with the requirements of the European Directive to have clean air in Dublin.  It would cost in the region of £150 million.  I believe it is too expensive, would take too long and is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>In relation to the dangers of the fuels mentioned by the Deputy I would mention that this is a matter for the Department of Energy.  I will discuss the matter with the Minister for Energy.  I, too, would be concerned that any fuel would be marketed or burned in an open fire if it was not suitable or if there were any dangers involved.  Householders in Dublin can get phoning the Eolas hotline this matter by phoning the Eolas hotline where information will be made available on fuels and so on.</P>

      <P>I will speak to the Minister for Energy who has responsibility for fuels being sold in this country.  I can give that guarantee to the Deputy.  I am sorry we cannot accede to the Deputy's request.  There are now 20,000 applications for grants and the Deputy must be aware of that.  It is not possible to comply with the European Directive It would be too slow, would take too long, is not good enough and would not be acceptable to the Government.  We have done the ultimate: we are banning from next October the sale, distribution and marketing of bituminous coal.  I believe that is the most effective way of combating the dreadful smog we have had to endure for too long.</P>

      <P>Last year the North-Eastern Health Board were allocated £30,000 from the additional £300,000 which was made available for priority orthodontic cases and the board will also benefit from the additional £3 million which is being provided in the current year for the improvement of health board orthodontic and adult dental services.</P>

I hope to circulate, shortly, a discussion document concerning the organisation of physiotherapy service and manpower issues in relation to the elderly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>Early in 1989 allegations of sexual abuse of a child were made against a worker employed in a children's home in south Dublin.  The employee concerned was suspended from duty by the authorities of the home &mdash; a religious community &mdash; and the gardaí were notified.  As the gardaí have not yet completed their inquiries into the matter, the Deputy will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to make any further comment on this aspect of the question.</P>
      <P>Towards the end of 1989 the authorities of the home decided to close the home and the children residing there were moved to other accommodation.</P>
      <P>On the broader issue raised by the Deputy, I should explain that my Department have from time to time issued guidance on various matters to the managements of children's homes, e.g. staff recruitment, financing, review of placements in the homes and the supervision of admissions and discharges. Guidelines have also been issued to health boards and children's homes on procedures for the identification, investigation and management of all forms of child abuse.</P>
      <P>Unlike the Garda investigations, the primary objective of these procedures is not the prosecution of the alleged offender but the early determination of the best course of action to protect and provide for the future well-being of the child concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to this, it is standard practice for each child in a children's home to have a named social worker who liaises on an on-going basis between the children's home, the child and his family. <Col N="1349" /> Social work teams regularly review progress and future plans for children placed in homes.  These reviews often incorporate case conferences involving all health and social service staff working with the child and the family and, where appropriate, the parents.  This close and regular contact between health board personnel and individual children provides the boards with an effective method of monitoring and supervising children in children's homes.</P>
    <P>For the last few years, the children's homes have been funded by way of annual budgets from the local health boards.  Previously, they were funded on a capitation basis.  The new financing arrangements have resulted in closer working relationships between the authorities of the homes and the health boards, giving boards and their staff a greater knowledge of the running of the homes, their staffing and their care programmes.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to say that I am conscious of the need to update the law in this area.  As the Deputy will be aware the Child Care Bill, 1988, which is currently before a Special Committee of the House, provides in section 28 and Part VII &mdash; sections 44-50 &mdash; for a new system governing the conduct and operation of children's residential centres.</P>

      <P>I was aware when I came into office that some of the health boards were not fully implementing section 67 of the Health Act in so far as it relates to dental services and I established a small working group to review the situation.  The working group concluded that it would be necessary to provide additional funds to enable the health board to provide routine dental services for adults.  There have also been problems with the orthodontic service.  The Government made £300,000 available for the orthodontic service late in 1989 and have made £3 million available in the 1990 budget specifically for both the adult dental services and for orthodontics.  I am confident that this injection of resources will lead to a significant improvement in dental and orthodontic services.</P>

      <P>I wish to inform the Deputy that I am aware of statements attributed to spokespersons at the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital regarding the matters mentioned. I wish to point out that statements such as these cause unnecessary worry and stress to patients and their relatives. The impression given by the statement on deafness is quite incorrect.  Children waiting for treatment of &ldquo;glue ears&rdquo;, of <Col N="1351" /> which there are only 20 at this hospital and not 200 as claimed, generally only suffer from minor hearing impairment. The Deputy will also probably be aware that before a patient is ready for a cataract operation it is necessary in most cases to allow the cataract to ripen or mature to a stage where it is ready for surgery.</P>
      <P>On the issue of funding for the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital I would like to inform the Deputy that as part of the allocation of an additional £15 million to health services in August 1989, £200,000 was made available to this hospital. This money allowed for an additional 250 cataract operations to be undertaken before the end of the last year.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the fund allocated to the Eye and Ear Hospital for 1990 have increased by £0.4 million from the original 1989 allocation of £3.6 million. Officers from my Department are monitoring the financial situation at the hospital on an on-going basis.  I am glad to report that the hospital is maintaining the high level of surgical activity achieved in the second half of 1989.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The safety of Irish vessels at sea is a <Col N="1355" /> matter of serious concern to the Government and in 1987 Ireland launched an initiative at the International Maritime Organisation, aimed at focusing attention on the problem of the dangers which submarines pose to fishing and to other vessels.  The inititive culminated in our sponsorship of a resolution which highlighted the dangers.  This resolution was adopted unanimously.  Since then the Government have availed of every opportunity to raise the subject in the appropriate international fora, including at the United Nations, where the Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, referred to the matter as one of considerable concern, in the course of his address to the Third Special Session on Disarmament in June 1988.  I recently raised the matter again at the 44th UN General Assembly in New York where I called for a new sense of international responsibility on the part of those who operate submarines.  The Government intend to continue to focus international attention on the problem.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that it is estimated that the number of proprietary directors who are excluded from receiving the employee allowance is about 50,000 and that the relevant number of spouses and children of such directors is of the order of 62,000.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The average increase in the consumer price index (CPI) in each of these years was as follows: 1983, 10.4 per cent; 1984, 8.6 per cent; 1985, 5.4 per cent; 1986, 3.9 per cent; 1987, 3.2 per cent; 1988, 2.1 per cent; 1989, 4.0 per cent.  The statistics show that, over the past three years, the rate of inflation averaged only a shade above 3 per cent.  This was a marked improvement on price trends in preceding years.  Slower domestic inflation, in terms of costs as well as prices, was a key factor in the economic recovery, and, in particular, in the real increase in consumer spending.  Though there was a pick-up in the price trend through last year, this essentially related to external and temporary influences.  All the indications are that the increase in the consumer price index has peaked, and that it will abate progressively through this year.</P>
      <P>As indicated in <i>Economic Background to the Budget,</i> the outlook for 1990 is for a continuation of the low inflation pattern of the past few years.  The average increase in consumer prices this year should be little more than 3 per cent, with the rate falling below 2½ per cent by end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year's budget gave a high priority <Col N="1358" /> to bringing down inflation.  The reductions in indirect taxation will directly lower the CPI by about ½ per cent on average.  The reliefs of income tax will also help to underpin continued moderation in costs and to preserve living standards.  Nevertheless, even with this action, restraint in all domestic incomes and charges is vital to preserving a low inflation environment.  The Government are fully committed to the continued implementation of the strategy contained in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which to date has been so successful in providing a framework for containing inflationary pressures and, through the resultant improvement in competitiveness, has brought about a substantial increase in sustainable employment.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, following the 1990 Budget Statement by the Minister for Finance, excise duty on gramophone records, as well as on compact discs, was abolished. No excise duty was previously payable on prerecorded cassettes.  The standard rate of VAT is reduced today from 25 per cent to 23 per cent.</P>
      <P>My Department have not received any claims that retail prices of gramophone records have not been reduced to reflect the excise reductions.  Since prerecorded cassettes were already free of excise duty, their retail prices would only be affected by the reduction in the standard rate of VAT which is effective today.  The lower rate of VAT also applies today to gramophone records.</P>
      <P>I have already indicated in this House that my Department have arranged that a retail price monitoring exercise is carried out to establish the consumer benefits from these VAT and excise reductions by way of lower retail prices.  Inspectors under the control of the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trade have already completed the first phase of the exercise, noting the retail prices of a wide selection of products in a range of outlets countrywide.  The second phase will proceed shortly.</P>

      <P>Persons who participate in FÁS non-craft courses and receive a training allowance in their own right are not considered to be dependants of their spouse. Accordingly, the adult dependant's allowance which is payable as part of unemployment payments is withdrawn. In most cases where the spouse &mdash; usually the wife &mdash; is participating in a FÁS course, the overall family income is increased because the training allowance of £47 payable to the FÁS participant is higher than the adult dependant's allowance of £29 formerly payable.  Nevertheless, the reduction in their husband's payment is a cause of concern to some travelling women and I undestand that it is affecting their willingness to take up the training places on offer to them.</P>

      <P>Road authorities are liable for damages in respect of misfeasance, i.e. where they negligently undertake work on a public road.  They are not, however, liable in respect of non-feasance, i.e. where they fail to maintain a road or to maintain it adequately.  Section 60 of the Civil Liability Act, 1961, provided for the abolition of the immunity in respect of non-feasance.  However, this section only comes into force when an order has been made by the Government.</P>
      <P>The Government have considered the matter and decided that section 60 should not be brought into operation at present because our road network is not yet sufficiently developed to justify the imposition of the additional obligation on road authorities.  If section 60 were brought into force, it would place an additional financial burden on road authorities in defending and meeting claims for damages for non-feasance.  This would divert resources from road development and simply result in a further deterioration in road conditions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1367" /> The Road Traffic Acts provide a comprehensive range of controls, including parking controls on vehicles generally and the power to remove vehicles which are left on a public road in such a manner as to cause danger or inconvenience or obstruct traffic.  Responsibility for the enforcement of these controls rests with the gardaí.</P>
    <P>While the above controls are generally adequate, it seems to me that additional by-law controls relating specifically to the parking of large vehicles may be warranted. Such extra controls can be introduced under existing legislation.  Since the problem relates in the main to the Dublin area, proposals have been developed by my Department in conjunction with Dublin Corporation and the gardaí with a view to applying special controls in that area.</P>
    <P>The corporation have prepared a list of suitable sites for alternative overnight parking on-street for large vehicles in their functional area where this may be required.  Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation have been asked to prepare corresponding lists for their functional areas.</P>
    <P>The making of the necessary by-laws to implement the proposed controls is in the first instance a matter for the Garda Commissioner.</P>

      <Quest>, in relation to the Western Parkway Motorway Project, whether the scheme approved by his Department in December 1986 provided for adequate landscaping on the outside of the boundary wall at Park Drive, Castleknock, Dublin 15; if so, who has responsibility for having the work carried out; when it will be carried out; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the approval, in December 1987, of the proposal of Dublin County Council to appoint a contractor for the west link section of the Western Parkway which adjoins Park Drive.  The contract did not provide for landscaping work which is being carried out by the local authority in association with West Link Toll Bridge Ltd.  This company is financing the project.</P>
      <P>A significant part of the landscaping has now been completed.  I understand that landscaping work at the location mentioned will be carried out later this year.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government allocated an additional £15 million to the health services last year. Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, received £385,000 from this allocation which was to be used, <i>inter alia,</i> for the provision of additional ENT in-patient public beds and this has been successful in reducing access time for in-patient facilities particularly for urgent cases.</P>
      <P>The figures quoted by the Deputy are incorrect.  There are approximately 450 patients on the in-patient waiting list the majority of which are non-urgent cases. The waiting period for new out-patient appointments is approximately ten months but general practitioners are in a position to contact the consultants directly if they feel that a particular case is urgent.  These patients are always given priority.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that in accordance with the Programme for Government and the <Col N="1381" /> current <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> the Government have given consideration to improvements in the pupil/teacher ratio at post-primary level in the context of demographic decline.</P>
    <P>I have informed the Teachers' Union of Ireland that arising from such decline the Government have decided that, where there are teachers over quota by reference to a 20:1 pupil/teacher ratio, teachers may be retained to the extent that such retention would be justified by the application of a pupil/teacher ratio of 19:1.  This arrangement will not apply to fee-paying post-primary schools.</P>
    <P>The Government's intention is that the resource being provided by this concession should be used to make available additional remedial/guidance teaching to the pupils.</P>
    <P>Extra resources will be made available to provide additional teachers in specific disadvantaged areas.  The question of defining specific criteria to be applied in determining disadvantaged areas is under consideration in consultation with the teacher unions.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to keep the pupil teacher ratio at post-primary level under review and, in particular, will consider it in the context of any negotiations on a further programme for national recovery.</P>
    <P>My Department have made no agreement with the Teachers' Union of Ireland in relation to the posts of vice-principal in community schools.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 93 and 94 together.</P>
      <P>There are three pre-fabricated classrooms at Scoil Íde Naofa, Kilmeade, Athy, County Kildare.  The question of the provision of an appropriate permanent extension to the school is being considered in my Department and it is proposed to discuss the whole matter with the school authorities at an early date. My attention has not been drawn to the possibility of a fire hazard at the school but, in the light of the Deputy's question I have arranged for an immediate inspection by a member of my Department's professional staff with a view to carrying out any necessary works.</P>
      <P>My Department's engineers have not yet been able to complete tender documents for the electrical and heating works at the school.  This is due to the large volume of drawing work on hands.  Every effort will be made to complete the necessary documents so that the works can be carried out at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position at this stage to say precisely when the works will be carried out.</P>
