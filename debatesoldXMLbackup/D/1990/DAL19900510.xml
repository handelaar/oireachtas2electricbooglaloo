      <P>I want to seek clarification from the Taoiseach in relation to a matter discussed in the House, and outside it, last week, that is, whether the Government will be presenting a paper to represent the views of the Irish Government on political union as opposed to the views of the Presidency.  Last week it was reported that the view of the Minister for Foreign Affairs was that the Irish Government would be presenting a paper on political union.  I want to ask the Taoiseach if the Government will be preparing a paper?</P>

    <Title>Marine Institute Bill, 1989 [Seanad]: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Noonan, Limerick West) Michael J. (Limerick West) Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick West):</i> A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, when I introduced this Bill on Tuesday evening <Col N="1330" /> I outlined to the House that the purpose of the Bill was to address the necessity, in a maritime nation like ours, for co-ordination of Government policy for the development of marine resources.  I further stated that the promotion of the Marine Institute Bill marks another decisive step in putting in place the structures envisaged in the policy document entitled <i>Roinn na Mara</i> and published in 1985.</P>
      <P>I further outlined the many problems currently affecting the development of our maritime economy and marine resources which can be attributed to the absence of a clearly defined policy, accompanied by a fragmentation of administrative structures.  We want to get the structures right so that the latent marine potential of the State can be fully realised in everyone's interest.</P>
      <P>I further stated that in the three years since its inception, Roinn na Mara sought to tackle some of the problems indicated in the document <i>Roinn na Mara</i> to which I have referred.  As stated, those items include: the wasteful utilisation of Government, financial and human resources; demarcation overlaps in policy between Government Departments and agencies operating both within and outside the marine field; the absence of forward development planning relating to existing established marine resources and those with development potential; the lack of cohesion in approach to international maritime developments which impinge on national interests.  I concluded by stating there was inadequate investment in research and development.</P>
      <P>I pointed out some of the reasons that we need a marine institute.  I said that the oceans are the last frontier, the least known part of our planet, that they cover 70 per cent of its surface area and have been used by man for a long time to reach other continents and to supply him with food and other resources.  Yet it is only recently that their very many roles have been fully comprehended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot, however, exploit the tremendous resource potential of the oceans without knowledge of what is out there, without the capacity to measure <Col N="1331" /> these resources, having identified them, and without the capacity to develop the necessary related tools and instruments. We must at the same time ensure the protection of the environment in all its aspects.  It is in providing this information that marine research plays a vital role.</P>
    <P>The sea and sea-bed resources, and the technologies related to their exploitation, represent a new and important trend in economic and industrial development on a global scale.  In future decades, the resources of the sea will account for an increasing share of the world economy. Control of such resources and the ability to explore and exploit them, will play a significant part in the economic growth and development of many nations.  It also means that competition for the use of new resources will be intense.</P>
    <P>In the case of Ireland, the marine area constitutes a major but underdeveloped natural resource and offers significant opportunities in terms of wealth and employment creation for a broad range of industries.</P>
    <P>As an island nation every aspect of our daily lives is in some way influenced by the sea that surrounds us, whether it be the effect of the sea on our climate or the distance from mainland export markets. Yet as a nation we do not perceive ourselves as a maritime people and worse, the sea continues to be regarded as a barrier to development rather than a natural resource to be utilised and developed for the benefit of the nation.</P>
    <P>Ireland's marine area is very large in comparison with that of other European nations.  In fact, the Irish continental shelf is usually wide by internatonal standards. It covers an area many times the size of the national land territory.  It is likely that this vast area of the continental shelf contains tremendous resources.</P>
    <P>In order to capitalise on our marine and fisheries resources, it is essential that we measure these resources, understand how they behave and devise the most effective exploitation methods.  Only then can we systematically start to exploit these resources commercially.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1332" /> The successful commercial development of all natural resources, whether they be marine or terrestrial, depends on a well co-ordinated, directed and supportive research and development effort. Thus the growing worldwide investment in marine science and technology arises from an awareness that the oceans can be one of mankind's major future sources of new food, energy, mineral and chemical supplies.</P>
    <P>Marine science and technology has a vital role to play in the understanding, identification, location and mapping of marine resources, with developing and supporting marine related industries, and providing the fundamental information on which to base development strategies. The lack of some of the most elementary knowledge of our marine environment and resource base is crucial.  The Marine Institute will fill this gap, providing the vehicle to promote the development of marine resources across a wide number of sectors &mdash; fisheries, aquaculture, non-living resources, marine engineering and electronics etc.</P>
    <P>Ireland's investment in marine research and technology is small in European terms.  For example, our level of operation of research vessels is only a small fraction of that maintained by comparable small countries, such as the Netherlands, Denmark and Norway. Conversely, many foreign vessels conduct research in Irish waters.  This means that other European countries know more about certain aspects of Irish waters than we do ourselves.</P>
    <P>Our lack of knowledge of our marine environment means that we are losing potential benefits and opportunities under a range of headings, which include fishing, aquaculture, tourism and amenity, seabed resources together with spin-off industries such as marine equipment, offshore engineering and coastal engineering.</P>
    <P>Areas which currently need to be addressed include: the need for a source of economic analysis to assist Irish organisations in the marine area to seek out and optimise economic opportunities, and to <Col N="1333" /> assist them when they experience difficulties; and the lack of coherent marine research and development policy puts us at a disadvantage in the EC fora where we have the opportunity to ensure the inclusion of marine research and developments in EC research support programmes such as the fisheries and aquaculture research programme and the marine science and technology programme. The scale and the variety of these needs and the related benefits add up to a convincing case for meeting the requirement for an early, rapid and wide scale development of structures, mechanisms and programmes for marine and fisheries research and technology leading, in turn, to what could be a spectacular development of related national resources.</P>
    <P>A wide range of organisations is involved in marine research in Ireland. Many of these organisations are small and poorly equipped.  They are physically and institutionally separated from each other.  A fundamental problem is that the work of the various organisations is unco-ordinated. There are both gaps and overlaps between Government Departments and agencies operating both within and outside the field.  In some areas, important programmes are not being undertaken at all.  Important research programmes in oceanography are not being undertaken.</P>
    <P>The question of the delimitation of the Irish continental shelf is unresolved.  Only through a co-ordinated administrative structure based on clearly defined policy can we create the momentum necessary to attract technology and human resources to translate potential into reality.  Furthermore, many activities are sub-functions of Departments or sections of Departments whose main responsibilities are remote from marine or aquatic affairs.  Many of the research personnel involved are either civil servants who are inspectoral and have other duties or university personnel, again with other duties or on short term contracts.  There is an inadequate professional corps of expertise devoted solely to research and mandated to liaise actively with the industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1334" /> It is clear, therefore, that the present institutional structures for the conduct of marine research in Ireland are inadequate or inappropriate.  Lack of co-ordination is inhibiting the development of resources.  Furthermore there is a strong need to clarify the relationship between the roles and responsibilities of the bodies already involved.  Apart from fragmentation, a key consideration is that, to be successful, scientific and technological activities have to become intensely interdisciplinary. The success or failure of programmes will be dependent to a marked degree on the level of interdisciplinary communication and co-operation achieved.</P>
    <P>There is general agreement that the information dealing with the economic and social aspects of marine industries needs to be up-graded.  In particular, there is a considerable lack of information available on the stock levels of many species of fish in Irish waters, particularly on the non-traditional species which offer potential for development in the future &mdash; ling, megrim, turbot, brill, dogfish, monkfish and sprat. Such information is vital if we are to achieve the objectives set out for the fishing industry in current Government policy.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a Marine Institute is as necessary now as it was in 1985 when the idea was first mooted.  Indeed, the urgency of establishing the institute is, if anything, even greater now than it was then.  I believe that investigation of single aspects of marine science in isolation from one another is inefficient and ineffective.  Such investigation is also potentially dangerous in the sense that wrong decisions can result from incomplete information.  If we look at the experience of other countries we see the development of a marked tendency in many of these to integrate previously separate marine and marine related research operations.</P>
    <P>There are obvious adminstrative benefits to be derived from having all marine research and marine related research co-ordinated by a single marine institute.  A <Col N="1335" /> centrally controlled approach is justifiable, and indeed desirable, on the grounds of administrative cost-effectiveness. A properly co-ordinated and effective organisational structure will provide authoritative technical input to resource development and, underpinning this, to the formulation of policy and programmes for marine and marine related research.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a marine institute is, moreover, justifiable on grounds other than those related to administrative cost effectiveness.  It is justifiable on the basis that the sea represents a national resource with development potential as yet only partially realised.  The establishment of the Marine Institute will result in real synergy and economy.  It will seek to end the current disorganised, splintered approach to marine research and eliminate the fragmentation of the marine research and marine related research activities currently located in different Government Departments, State agencies and other bodies.  It will ease the situation in which current research and technology programmes tend to become, of necessity, <i>ad hoc</i> and short-term.  It will work towards the provision of an adequate data base for all organisations and firms working in the marine area.</P>
    <P>In sum, there will be a major improvement in efficiency and technical input resulting from the conduct of all marine and marine related research under a single direction mechanism, which will, at the same time, take account of sectoral concerns and considerations.</P>
    <P>Externally, of course, the establishment of the Marine Institute will enable this country to compete more effectively with other countries by having an effective control of operations.  In particular, it will develop to the optimum the functions of co-ordinating Irish participation in European related activities. This will not, of course, happen overnight. The Bill is the vehicle to enable a framework to be put in place within which <Col N="1336" /> we can seek to achieve the objectives which I have outlined.</P>
    <P>I would now like to address some of the particular issues in which I feel the Institute, when established, will involve itself.  Opportunities for development of our main resources exist in fisheries, aquaculture, non-living seabed resources, amenity recreation, ocean engineering, and marine electronics and instrumentation.  The successful and economic development of these activities requires the ability to identify and quantify potential resources and to develop the technology necessary to exploit them. In carrying out these developments it is vital to ensure that the marine environment is not damaged or polluted.</P>
    <P>The Institute will further research in the areas of living resources, including fish stocks, aquaculture, and salmonid resources; non-living resources, including the delimitation of the continental shelf; oceanography and marine environmental studies; and ocean engineering and electronics technology, and would provide specialist services for marine research, including computer facilities, research vessels and equipment.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> a projection was made of 2,000 new full-time and 2,000 new part-time jobs in the seafish industry in the period to 1991. The establishment of a Marine Institute was seen in the programme as an essential element in the development of the seafish industry and in the achievement of the projected targets.</P>
    <P>Our valuable fishing and fish farming resources must be exploited to best satisfy the requirements of the international marketplace.  International markets for seafood are generally buoyant and are likely to remain so.  Ireland, with the right products and marketing strategies, can gain a better foothold in these markets, building on the health image of seafood and the fact that Irish fish is produced in clear unpolluted waters.  To ensure development in this area, research is needed.  This research will be provided by the Marine Institute.</P>
    <P>We must strengthen the industry <Col N="1337" /> supply base through the efficient exploitation of new fishing grounds and stocks and species which are currently under-exploited. An increase in the supply of fish as raw material for processing and greater continuity of supply are essential for further development.  Research is the key here.  This research will be provided by the Marine Institute.</P>
    <P>We must improve the supply of our aquaculture products by promoting the production of priority species, by encouraging research and development into new species and by achieving self-sufficiency in smolt and seed supplies.  Research into all these areas is vital.  This research will be provided by the Marine Institute.</P>
    <P>The identification, quantification and exploitation of non-living marine resources depends on a detailed knowledge of the geological structure and evolution of the seabed.</P>
    <P>Under the United Nations Law of the Sea Convention, Ireland can extend its jurisdiction over an extensive continental shelf area.  The limits of the Irish continental shelf will require to be outlined. The definition of the Irish shelf area will require a major investment, both in terms of shiptime and scientific effort.  Already there are a number of conflicting claim-ants for vast tracts of the shelf which experts consider should rightly belong to Ireland.  The areas under contention could amount to over 40 per cent of our continental shelf.  In order to ensure that the Irish claim to this area is vindicated, we will need access to the best scientific and technical data which, in turn, will involve conducting a major survey programme of these remote areas.  Following the outline of the limits, and the surveying of the areas within those limits, further exploratory work will be required so as to underpin adequately the economic exploitation of these areas.</P>
    <P>Given our maritime status, we must look to the sea as a resource and develop opportunities in the other areas referred to &mdash; coastal engineering, electronics, instrumentation, amenity and environmental protection.  These activities are not only vital to our national development, but, given that 70 per cent of the <Col N="1338" /> earth's surface is covered by the sea, are very marketable commodities worldwide.</P>
    <P>The Government recognised these problems and realised that the solution lay in the establishment of a Marine Institute. As a first step towards the establishment of such an institute, the Government considered the report of a marine science and technology task force on the options for a marine institute.</P>
    <P>The task force, which consisted of representatives of Government Departments, other State bodies, universities and private industry, considered the scope, size, structures, location and costing of a marine institute appropriate to national requirements.  As a basis for comparison, the task force considered what other maritime nations have achieved and how they have structured their research and technological activities.</P>
    <P>Options which were examined ranged from the simple co-ordination of various elements by means of a central liaising mechanism, through a marine institute within a university, to a new single agency.  The arguments emerged strongly in favour of the last of these.  Various models of a single agency were considered, such as an executive office, a limited company or a State-sponsored agency.  The task force recommended the last of these.</P>
    <P>The Marine Institute will have the general function to undertake, co-ordinate, promote and assist in marine research and development.  The institute will provide services related to marine research and development that will promote economic development and create employment. The institute will, in particular, provide advice on policy relating to marine research and development; carry out Government policy on marine research and development; undertake, develop, promote and market marine research and development services; promote and assist the improvement, development and application of technical and other processes for the exploitation and development of the marine resource; <Col N="1339" /> collect, maintain and disseminate information relating to marine matters; co-ordinate proposals for marine research and development requiring funding for the Exchequer or from any State owned or controlled body; evaluate proposals for marine research and development requiring funding from the Exchequer or from any State owned or controlled body; and advise on proposals for marine research and development requiring funding from the Exchequer or from any State owned or controlled body.</P>
    <P>The institute may, in addition: represent the State in European Community programmes of marine research and development; commission from other persons work to be caried out under the direction of the institute; enter into joint-ventures so as to undertake or further the application of marine research and development; promote and organise seminars, conference, lectures or demonstrations relating to marine research and development; and engage in international activities in relation to marine research and development.</P>
    <P>It is important to stress that the intention is not to set up a new institute in the sense of a physical bricks-and-mortar structure.  Rather what is in mind is a new institutional arrangement.  Thus, the Marine Institute &mdash; for the foreseeable future at any rate &mdash; will not be a single campus organisation.  This is not essential in the short to medium term and in the present economic climate the construction of such a campus would be a waste of scarce financial resources.</P>
    <P>The component agencies making up the new institute will, for the most part, continue at their present locations but the overall direction and funding of their research programmes will be under the control of the Marine Institute.  Client Departments and other &ldquo;customers&rdquo; will retain an input to the institute's activities through representation at board level or on advisory committees of the institute. The institute will be governed by a board, who will consist of a chairman and eight ordinary members.  The members of the board will be appointed by virtue of their <Col N="1340" /> experience in fields of expertise relevant to the functions of the institute.</P>
    <P>Eleven State-funded organisations, with a staff of about 250 persons, are currently involved in marine research or marine-related research within the State. A number of these organisations are under the direct control of Government Departments.  Following the establishment of the institute, the persons involved may be transferred from their parent Departments to the Department of the Marine and thence to the Marine Institute.  In the case of the organisations not under the direct control of Government Departments, these will be involved in the work of the institute through work commissioned from them. The institute will have a chief executive officer and a support staff to carry on and manage and control generally the administration and business of the institute.</P>
    <P>I consider it important that all funding which was previously allocated to marine research and marine-related research should continue to be so allocated, following the establishment of the institute. I would envisage that this funding will be allocated to the Marine Institute, and, through the institute, to the other State-funded organisations involved in marine research or marine-related research.  This allocation will be made in line with the priorities and work programme decided by the board, and approved by me. Because of the universally agreed priority attaching to marine research I envisage that the funding allocated to the Marine Institute, both from the Exchequer and EC sources, will increase in the future.  I am in addition anxious that many of the institute's activities can be carried out on a commercial basis.  For example, diagnostic and advisory services provided by the institute could be charged for, if no fee is levied already.  The level of the fees charged would be a matter for the board of the institute to determine.</P>
    <P>The additional costs of establishing the Marine Institute are minimal.  Existing salaries and operational expenses of persons currently involved in marine research or marine-related research, and <Col N="1341" /> transferred to the Marine Institute, will, as I mentioned before, be transferred to the institute.</P>
    <P>Extra provision has been made in the Estimates of the Department of the Marine for the expenses of the board, the salaries and expenses of the chief executive of the institute and his support staff, and for other miscellaneous expenses.  In relation to expenditure on marine research programmes proper during 1990, an earnest of the Government's commitment to this area is that the direct allocation to marine development contained in my Department's Vote has been increased by 13 per cent from £800,000 to £900,000.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and it is good to see it before the House. The Minister has made a long, wide-ranging speech, very well researched, I suggest, and in it are aspirations and wishes far greater than are provided for in the Bill.  I appreciate the goodwill of the Minister and the Department and their hopes and aspirations, but unfortunately much of what the Minister stated in his speech is not reflected in the Bill and I am somewhat concerned about that.  On examining the Bill one has to see immediately that it is enabling legislation.  In one sense it is very plastic in the way it can be used.  It can be twisted or turned in any direction, therefore there is an onus on the Minister to make sure it is pulled in the right direction.  The success of the Marine Institute will depend very largely on the ability of the Minister and his Department to take this on board in a positive manner and give the institute the leeway, freedom and power to do things without too much supervision or control by the Minister.  The one reservation I have about the Bill is the level of control that still remains with the Minister and the Department and the institute's lack of ability to take the initiative themselves. In the interests of a good working institute this needs to be addressed and I hope the Minister will take the matter into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has outlined all the hopes <Col N="1342" /> he has for the institute.  He hopes they will have the capacity to measure, develop, research all our marine resources and at the same time ensure protection of our environment.  He has outlined how at present a number of bodies, groups and sections of the Department are involved in research at various levels.  In some cases considerable research is being done in one area with much overlapping while in other areas there are stark omissions and no research taking place.  I hope the institute will address this in a positive way.</P>
    <P>The idea of establishing this institute is very good.  We in the Fine Gael Party proposed this prior to the last election; it was part of our election programme because we believed it was vital that there be co-ordinated development and research and that one monitoring group or body have control and supervise, see exactly where the omissions are, identify the needs and see where urgent research is required.  It is important that the new institute should investigate how similar bodies in Europe, and elsewhere, operate. We should learn from their mistakes and experience.  It is important that the new institute works for the benefit of our marine life and for the protection of the environment.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that we are at a disadvantage compared with other member states in that they have long established marine scientific facilities. For instance, the French research facilities are well advanced.  It is important that I should compliment those involved in marine research in Ireland who have done an excellent job on a very limited budget.  They work under difficult circumstances and it is unfortunate that the Government have not seen fit to make more resources available to them.</P>
    <P>In 1987 Fianna Fáil made a big issue of establishing a Department of the Marine and they pointed to the importance of marine research to the country.  They highlighted the potential of a proper development of marine resources but they did not back their aspirations by providing the necessary finance.  I hope the new institute will not go the way of <Col N="1343" /> other Fianna Fáil promises, that after it is established following the passing of a Bill it will be allowed to die due to a lack of funding.  I am thinking of An Foras Forbartha and the Agricultural Institute which were allowed to die by Fianna Fáil due to a lack of funding.  I hope there is a brighter future in store for the Marine Institute.</P>
    <P>The Bill arises out of the recommendations of the task force established in 1985 to consider the need for a Marine Institute to examine our marine resources, the need for research and new techniques for fishing.  The task force who reported in 1987 should be complimented on the research they carried out.  It is unfortunate that it took the Government so long to act on the recommendations contained in their report.  As a result of the delay we have many problems to overcome.  We have very limited knowledge about the marine resources in Irish waters.  Irish fishermen are annoyed when they meet in our fishing grounds boats from other nations carrying out research. It is no wonder that our fishermen are working at a disadvantage.</P>
    <P>It is important that extensive research is carried out before we get involved in negotiations about fish quotas and so on. After 1992 we will be at a disadvantage to other members states because we do not have basic information about fish life in our waters.  At negotiations other nations skilfully direct their research carried out in our waters to their advantage. That is unfortunate.  Other countries have laid claim to sections of our continental shelf and that is to our disadvantage. Under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea we have rights as far as the continental shelf is concerned and it is unfortunate that our knowledge of the resources there is nil in comparison to our European friends.  That leaves us in a difficult position at negotiations.  We are ignorant of the extent of the resources in the continental shelf.  The new institute should address that problem and be given the resources to carry out the necessary research.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to hear the Minister say <Col N="1344" /> that the small sum of £100,000 had been set aside this year for the new institute. That is a pittance.  The Minister has nodded his head and I wonder if he is trying to indicate that he did not mention that figure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount is not adequate if the institute are to deal with the problems that urgently need to be addressed.  It is important that we carry out research on the continental shelf particularly in view of the diminished sovereignty we will have after 1992.  We should have research carried out before that year and our negotiations concluded.</P>
      <P>The information we have on our fish stocks is very limited when compared with that available to other countries.  As a result our negotiations on fish quotas are always at a disadvantage.  I am referring in particular to negotiations on mackerel and herring quotas.  The Commission make their decision on the basis of research supplied by other member states and our quotas are based on the scientific evidence produced by other countries.  In many respects that is to our disadvantage.  We have lost out substantially as a result of not having carried out scientific research on our fish stocks. We should be in a position to put forward a scientific argument to ensure that we are given an increased fish quota.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been extremely fortunate that little damage has been done to our environment in recent years.  However, the <Col N="1345" /> number of disasters that have occurred in Irish waters is quite high.  I am concerned about the number of vessels carrying what could be described as lethal cargo that use our waters.  In many instances the vessels used are substandard.  We are all aware of the damage caused by the <i>Kowloon Bridge.</i>  At that time we had very little information to help us deal with that disaster.  We depended on information and assistance from other countries.  But for the will of God, and changes in wind direction, we would have had to deal with many disasters off our coast.  It is important that we should have the expertise to monitor the movement of ships in our waters and to have experts on hand to deal with any disasters.  We should be vigilant and prepared to deal with any problems that may arise.  I hope the new institute will address themselves to those problems, the Minister should see to it that they do.</P>
    <P>The EC make extensive funds available for various marine programmes. There is a lot of money available for marine scientific research but due to the fact that we have not had an administrative structure in place we were not in a position to avail of the first allocation from the MAST programme last year. That was unfortunate.  It is important that we should be in a position to avail of European funding for research.  We should establish the institute as quickly as possible to avail of the support grants which are available from Europe for such research.</P>
    <P>The other area in which we have not done any great research is in relation to the non-quota species.  About 18 months ago the Government announced a major programme in relation to the creation of 4,400 jobs up to 1991.  They based many of their calculations on fishing non-quota species.  However, my information suggests that very little non-quota species are being fished, and the information in that regard is minimal.</P>
    <P>There are applications for a few exploratory licences and although one was granted last year it was not used.  It is very important that the Marine Institute should have the funding and support to <Col N="1346" /> become involved in research into the non-quota species because, until it has been proved that there is a viable, commercial non-quota species available, very few people will commit themselves financially in this regard.</P>
    <P>It is important to undertake scientific research to establish the facts.  Aspirations and pious hopes expressed by the Government are not sufficient when it comes to raising loans and making sure that there is a definite income available from fishing non-quota species.  If it could be proved that there are sufficient stocks of non-quota species to make commercial fishing viable, it would be a matter of great importance to our costal communities. Employment could be provided in remote parts of the country where it is extremely difficult to provide it at present and this must be seen as a priority.  At present, remote communities &mdash; particularly in the West &mdash; are being denuded by emigration because of the lack of job opportunities.</P>
    <P>There are great difficulties in aquaculture development.  This type of development shot into prominence over the past five or six years and many people now see its great potential.  However, it is important that development takes place in an orderly, supervised manner instead of in a haphazard fashion which is the case at present.  It is also important to have a system in place through which proper research is done into the suitability of setting up fish farms in certain areas.  It is important that the institute or the Department of the Marine would identify suitable locations right round our coasts for different types of fish farming. It is also important that those areas are not congested or that there is not an overloading in any particular area.</P>
    <P>Fears have been expressed in this regard by communities round our coasts but many of them emanate from lack of knowledge and &mdash; in some instances &mdash; scaremongering.  It is vital to have proper research into the effects of fish farming on the environment.  It is also important to research the different type of chemicals used in this area because we know that some of them are unacceptable.  I <Col N="1347" /> hope that the Marine Institute will ensure that such research is done.</P>
    <P>It is also important that the institute should put in place a planning procedure in regard to fish farms.  We are very conscious of the need for proper planning in relation to building and we have a very strict, supervised system of planning permission and appeals.  It is equally important to put in place a system which will monitor the development of our waters and to have a proper procedure and appeals system.  We have not given sufficient thought to this matter; we have a tremendous resource which must be monitored in a civilised and thoughtful way.  If this is not done it will have a detrimental effect on the community, which would be most unfortuante.  This has happened in other countries but I hope it will not be the case here.  I hope the institute will take this matter on board urgently and put in place a system of planning which will lend itself to proper, orderly development of the aquaculture industry.</P>
    <P>In 1992 the second allocation of the MAST research programme is due to come on-stream and the institute must have a programme for research at that time which they can present to Europe to secure the type of funding necessary.  It is also important that the institute should be poised to put in contracts for various research that needs to be done and which will be commissioned from Europe.</P>
    <P>The other matter which comes up for review is the Common Fisheries Policy. As I said, there are difficulties in so far as our scientific knowledge in relation to fishing is concerned.  We need to put forward a very well constructed case for the Common Fisheries Policy review, otherwise, there will be grave difficulties for our fishing industry in 1992.  Work in this regard needs to start now and the institute can be very positive in preparing our case for this review in 1992 because an awful lot will depend on the outcome.</P>
    <P>Another area which gives cause for concern is the gross registered tonnage and the difficulties in relation to it.  I am very concerned about Ireland's position <Col N="1348" /> in relation to Europe in this regard.  It is common knowledge that Irish fishermen who buy boats from other countries find, when they bring a boat home, that it is &mdash; in some cases &mdash; maybe one-third to 50 per cent greater tonnage than that registered in the home country.  If a person sells a boat from Ireland to another member state it suddenly loses a lot of weight in another jurisdiction.  This is serious and frightening in view of the registration of gross registered tonnage in Europe.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need for the Minister to have the situation in this regard reviewed immediately and to ensure that there is a common measurement procedure right across Europe because at the moment it is so haphazard that Ireland is at a very serious disadvantage in relation to gross registered tonnage.  This means that there are 300 applicants waiting to be issued with fishing licences.  Nobody knows what exactly is happening and many people who want to get involved in fishing cannot do so.  Worse still, many people involved in fishing who want to transfer their licences to other boats cannot do so, even in cases where they are proposing a reduced tonnage.  This is totally unacceptable and the Government stand condemned on their attitude to this issue.</P>
    <P>If the Department of the Marine do not address this matter urgently, the Marine Institute will have to do so.  The fishing industry is in chaos because of the crazy situation which has been allowed to develop.  It is unbelievable that we in Ireland are suffering because of a lack of Government initiative on this matter. The Government are allowing boats from other countries to be registered at a much lower gross registered tonnage than similar boats in Ireland.  This is unacceptable. Obviously the Department of the Marine are going around blindfolded when it comes to dealing with the gross registered tonnage.  I am vexed about this and the Irish fishing community condemn it out of hand.</P>
    <P>I have reservations about the Bill because of the manner in which the Minister and the Department will interpret it <Col N="1349" /> and the scope they will actually give to the Marine Institute.  As I have said, the Bill can go two ways &mdash; it will be either very successful or an absolute failure. This will depend very much on the initiative of the Minister and his Department. It is important for the Minister to get involved in consultations with the people who have a particular interest in fishing in the various areas.  It is not enough for him to limit himself to consultation with the people within the Department.  All sectors involved, for example, the universities, BIM, research bodies, private enterprises which are carrying out research, etc., must be consulted.  It is vitally important that when the Minister appoints the board he does not go down the road Fianna Fáil Ministers have traditionally gone, that is, to appoint a local Fianna Fáil cumann member to a board just because he happens to have the cumann membership card.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That would not be to the advantage of the fishing industry. I hope the Government and the Minister will take a very broad view of this issue, will throw the policital shield aside and put the national interest and the interests of our marine resources before the interests of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I appeal to the Minister to do this.  I hope he will be able to rise above politics and do the decent thing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to the proposed structure of the Marine Institute.  The Minister said that it was important to stress that the intention was not to set up a new institute in the sense of a physical bricks-and-mortar structure, rather what was in mind was a new institutional arrangement.  I find that remark particularly interesting considering that his predecessor announced, about 18 months or two years ago, that the Marine Institute would be located in Galway. That announcement was welcomed and greeted with great applause at that time. I am a little concerned at that statement <Col N="1350" /> by the Minister today and I hope it was included in his speech to fill up a few paragraphs rather than meaning anything in particular.  A commitment was given by the previous Fianna Fáil administration to locate the Marine Institute in Galway.</P>
      <P>The Minister went on to say that the Marine Institute, for the foreseeable future at any rate, would not be a single campus organisation.  I wonder why the Minister felt obliged to put that on the record of the House.  I have reservations about this because I believe it is very important for the institute to be located somewhere where there is an active interest in fishing.  Galway would be an ideal location for this institute because it is in the west of Ireland, is half way between south-west Cork and the tip of Donegal and there is a large fishing community all along the coast.  A marine institute in Galway would be accessible to those people.  In addition, there is a good research unit in UCG where scientific research programmes are being carried out.  I hope that very shortly substantial developments will take place in UCG in the area of marine science.</P>
      <P>It is equally important for similar skills to be located in the one area.  I ask the Minister to seriously consider locating the Marine Institute in Galway which is an ideal location both from the point of view of the fishing industry and academic and scientific research.  I appeal to the Minister to consider locating the institute in Galway, as a major marine scientific information data base will be available shortly in UCG.  It is important for these data bases to be located side by side rather than away from each other.  I ask the Minister to take that matter into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is equally important for a whole system of information to be set up.  For example, fishermen could have computers attached to a main computer in Galway where they could get all the necessary information.  In addition, a data base in Galway could get information on the research being carried out in other member states, Canada and the United States.  One centre based in <Col N="1351" /> Galway would be very valuable and good use would be made of it, with the assistance of UCG.  I ask the Minister to take this matter into consideration.  Perhaps when he is replying the Minister will allay my fears about the issue.</P>
    <P>Section 1 defines the word &ldquo;marine&rdquo;. I do not consider this definition to be very detailed and a broader definition is needed.  Who will deal with marine pollution?  Will it be the Department of the Environment, the Department of the Marine, or both?  There is a grey area there and there needs to be a clearer definition as to who will have responsibility for what is in that area.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (2) (f) deals with the functions of the Marine Institute.  A very broad range of functions are covered in this section.  A question arises in regard to funding.  At present funding comes from both national and international sources.  Will other organistions be able to apply to Europe for funding or will all applications for funding in relation to marine research have to be processed in Ireland through the Marine Institute?  It is very difficult to asssess what exactly is involved here and the section could be interpreted in a number of ways.  What will be the role of Eolas under sections 4 (2) (f) and (g) in relation to funding? At present Eolas distribute funding to the different university faculties for research.  Will Eolas still be in a position to secure funding for marine research or will all applications have to be made by the Marine Institute?  It would be unfortunate if that were to happen.  It is very important that the Minister talk to all the bodies already involved in research, particularly those who secure funding from other sources, and have this matter clarified before the passage of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I note that An Bord Iascaigh Mhara have not been referred to either in the Bill or in the course of the Minister's introductory remarks.  It is important that they be consulted and their co-operation sought.  It is equally important that all of the universities and third level institutions be consulted on this matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1352" /> The role of the chief executive is also extremely important.  In this respect I would appeal to the Minister to leave aside party or parochial interests, to strive to appoint a person of immense initiative and vision, somebody with a very keen interest in this whole area.  We must realise that the future role and the future of the institute will be dependent on the degree of energy, initiative and vision of its chief executive.  Therefore, there should be much consultation before the appointment of the chief executive.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 8 dealing with the staff of the institute, there appears to be an enormous degree of vagueness; nothing becomes clear from a reading of this section.  For example, there is a vagueness in relation to the transfer of staff.  That raises the question: is there a danger that the institute could become, as it were, a resurrected Department of Fisheries?  That is something about which I would be concerned because, if such were to happen, it would be unfortunate. There is need for initiative, impetus and drive within the new institute.  I hope the Minister will clarify that matter also when replying.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections are the usual enabling-type ones.  In relation to section 20 and the transfer of property, I have heard fears expressed.  There are people worried about the transfer of property. Is there a danger that all property at present being used for research could come within the provisions of this section? There is a need for the Minister to clarify that matter also in order to put people's minds at ease.</P>
    <P>Another area I want to deal with relates to discoveries and inventions.  It is extremely important to encourage people with the ability to invent and to conduct that type of research, to involve themselves in the dedicated work needed to be undertaken because they are a tremendous asset to any nation.  They are people we should value extremely highly. For example section 22 (1) states:</P>
    <P>Every discovery and invention resulting from researches or investigations undertaken by or on behalf of <Col N="1353" /> the Institute except those discoveries or inventions referred to in subsection (2) shall be the property of the Minister. </P>
    <P>It is important that that subsection be modified to ensure that an inventor, a person with the brains, skills and creative ability, be compensated in some way for his time and work.  It is also important that such people be provided with incentives. Otherwise we will not get involved in the institute the type of people who would be of benefit to it.  The Minister must consider including in this section a sharing arrangement as an incentive to such creative people.  Otherwise we might as well forget it because people of enormous creative ability will not be drawn to or remain with the institute, or indeed with any other State-sponsored body, if they are not given some type of personal perquisite.  There is need for a more liberal interpretation of intellectual property rights which is basically what is at issue here.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will reply to some of my queries.  I have one other query relating to the proposed environmental protection agency.  What will be the relationship between the proposed Marine Institute and the environmental protection agency we hope will soon be established?  Both have a huge role to play in the overall protection of our environment. The Minister in his introductory remarks referred repeatedly to the environment and the need for its protection. There is a need for him to clarify the role of the Marine Institute and that of the environmental protection agency in relation to the marine environment.  That is extremely important and has not been clarified in the Bill or by the Minister in the course of his remarks.</P>
    <P>Another question that springs to mind is: what will be the relationship between the Marine Institute and the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas, a body based in Europe?  In putting my case for Galway I should say there is an opportunity provided for an institute based there to liaise with this institute, feeding all of the information <Col N="1354" /> available there into a data base in Galway, disseminating it from Galway to the marine community in general.  Those are just some of the questions I should like clarified by the Minister when replying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to have this opportunity on behalf of the Labour Party to make a few brief comments on this important Bill.  At the outset let me say that it is unfortunate that our spokesman on the Marine, Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan, cannot be here today as he is attending a meeting outside Dublin.</P>
      <P>It is important that initially we all underscore the importance of the Bill before us.  The Minister, in the course of his remarks, if you like, painted a picture of a disregard for the marine that seems to be endemic in our people &mdash; that we have, as an island people, a peculiar ambivalence toward the sea.  I must say I do not share the Minister's opinion that that view prevails in every part of the country.</P>
      <P>I come from a part of the country with a long maritime tradition, from a street in which every second or third house would be occupied by a sea captain or somebody connected with the sea, going back many generations.  There are many such communities across this nation who have traditionally looked to the sea.  It is not confined to those of us who were fortunate enough to be descended from the Vikings who probably left their indelible mark in the genetic pool.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, it is fair to say we have not utilised the sea to its maximum potential.  If we look at comparable maritime nations like the Japanese, the Phillippinos or indeed some of our European neighbours, such as the Danes, we find that they have looked to the sea in a more real way, they sought always to derive therefrom maximum advantage in terms of food supply, transport and development in a manner we did not do over many generations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill seeks to establish a marine institute.  It is something that has been thought about, researched, an idea that has been floated for many years.  We all <Col N="1355" /> looked with a certain positive feeling to this development.  Clearly, if we are to take a more realistic, more exploitative view of the sea, to harness the sea and all its potential for the benefit economically, socially and culturally of our people, we need some central co-ordinating body. For that reason many of us sought over many years to have an institute established such as the one proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is with a great sense of regret I note that the scope of the provisions of this Bill is so inadequate. The potential to do something historic, to constitute a milestone year in the development of our marine culture, as I perceive it, has been substantially missed in this Bill.  Certainly it seeks to establish a marine institute but one which really lacks the teeth and the co-ordinating role most of us sought and would like to have seen put in place.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to listen to the Minister of State's remarks in the course of which he referred to the potential of the sea and of this proposed institute.  Many people, however, are now beginning to realise that in the series of battles fought at the Cabinet table, where one has the conflicting interests of the mini-empires of Energy and Environment, the Minister did not come out all that well.  This has been decribed as an enabling Bill and substantially that is what it is.  We had hoped it would concentrate power and responsibility in one dynamic institute which would have teeth, power, resources and funding, but we see no mention of these things in either the Minister of State's script or in the Bill before us.</P>
    <P>It has been said that our waters are an important resource and certainly this is true.  At the beginning of 1988 there were some 3,800 full-time fishermen, 3,950 part-time fishermen along with another 4,300 people employed either full-time or part-time in aquaculture and fish processing. At almost 13,000, this is a significant level of employment but is small when compared to its potential.  When <Col N="1356" /> talking about the dreadful problem of unemployment many of us hope that our natural resources, both on land and in the sea, will be used as a catalyst in securing dynamic development and that agencies such as the National Development Corporation will take on a dynamic role and fund marine and acquaculture-related projects leading to a substantial increase in the number employed in the processing and catching of fish and other sea creatures.</P>
    <P>In recent years we have developed a new taste for fish, including fin fish and shellfish.  There was a time when the abundance of the sea was regarded as famine food and a substantial meal had to include meat.  The notion of eating fish carried a certain second class quality but in recent years the position has been reversed.  There is now a snob value attached to seafood as a source of nutrition, not least because it is a very healthy source of nutrition carrying none of the potential dangers for cholesterol levels which many processed meat products carry.  Therefore, there is a growing market within this country for quality seafood.</P>
    <P>We are teetering on the brink of this huge potential but unclear as to how we can maximise it.  We had hoped the Minister of State would have come into the House today with a clear plan and to indicate what the targets and objectives are.  There was much hoo-ha and ballyhoo surrounding the establishment of the Department of the Marine some years ago when we were led to believe it was going to be a primary Department of State, and would no longer be a sub-compartment in an amalgam of functions comprising tourism, forestry and fisheries in one Department with fisheries tagged on at the end and tourism taking the primary role.  Roinn an Mara were going to be the flagship and the primary agency who would develop the necessary infrastructure for the creation of jobs and maximise the potential of aquaculture and mariculture for the benefit of the people.  We have not benefited very much thus far.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1357" /> When Roinn na Mara was first established I rang Leeson Lane and inquired if that was the Department of the Marine. The civil servant who answered hesitated for a moment and was not quite sure.  She replied &ldquo;we are not sure yet, some of us are going to remain in this Department, others are going elsewhere, and a few are to arrive but we will let you know in due course&rdquo;.  It is clear that someone had a good idea for the establishment of a dynamic Department of State and sold this idea to the Governnment but forgot to fill in the blanks.  I have to say a more plodding Department was established. They did not do what we had all hoped they would and did not become the flagship concentrating all the scattered elements in one force to bring forward a development plan which would impact tremendously on the job potential of the industry.  That was a disappointment.</P>
    <P>We had hoped the establishment of the Marine Institute, which has been long promised, would have an ameliorating effect and act as a catalyst in pulling together the fragmented sections of the marine sector but even this will not happen.  It will not be a dynamic institute with real force and power.  It is clear that the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Energy want to hold on to every last vestige of their individual fiefdoms and are reluctant, even if this is in the national interest, to shed anything from their mini-empires.  This is a sad reflection &mdash; but not unique to this Government &mdash; on the way the Cabinet conduct their business with the strength of the Minister &mdash; how broad his chest can be &mdash; related to the number of personnel employed in his Department, the number of subheads in his Estimate and the number of pounds in his budget.</P>
    <P>It is about time we jettisoned this approach and brought ourselves into the latter part of the 20th century and prepared ourselves for the next century when there will be a very competitive single market in Europe.  We start from a very low base as the level of research and development in this country is grossly inadequate when compared with that of any of our European partners.  We hope that <Col N="1358" /> we will not continue in this plodding way and that some bold initiatives will be taken by the Government, as promised. Sadly, it does not look as if this will be the case.  There were positive and good things mentioned by the Minister of State which should be included in legislation by a Minister who wants to bring the development of the marine industry into the forefront of our economic life.  Therefore, I am disappointed by the scope of the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is impossible for us to look on the oceans as separate compartments.  From the seabed to the sky is one entity which cannot be divided as between the Department of the Environment, the Department of Energy, the Department of the Marine and others.  We need to adopt a comprehensive programme of research and development on the oceans.</P>
    <P>There is the prospect, as has been said already, of a Bill coming before the House in the not too distant future to establish another agency, that is the Environmental Protection Agency.  I am anxious to see the form of that agency when the legislation comes before this House and how the agency will interact with this new Marine Institute we are about to establish.  Obviously there would be some overlap of responsibilities in relation to the quality of the seas around our coast and in relation to research on accidents and accident prevention.  The most serious one we have had to deal with here in recent years was the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> incident which could have been disastrous.  I am not convinced that we have the wherewithal to deal with another <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> or a situation that could be infinitely worse should it, by act of God, arrive on our coastline. We have lived by the skin of our teeth year on year without an adequate plan, without adequate resources and with totally inadequate research.</P>
    <P>The location of this new agency has been referred to and a case has been made for the institute to be sited in Galway.  The first issue that must be resolved &mdash; and what the Minister had to say about it this morning filled me with dismay &mdash; is that it is not envisaged having <Col N="1359" /> a single campus agency.  The reason given is not that it does not make sense to have it but that it would cost money and the Minister is not prepared to spend money on that initiative.  He said: &ldquo;this is not essential in the short to medium term and in the present economic climate the construction of such a campus would be a waste of scarce financial resources&rdquo;. What is proposed?  The existing agencies which the Minister described as fragmented, dissipated around the country and unco-ordinated, are to be renamed, repainted and launched with a new logo. There is to be no significant funding made available.  In fact the Minister, with a certain degree of audacity, said &ldquo;I consider it important that all funding which was previously allocated to marine research and to marine related research should continue to be allocated following the establishment of the institute&rdquo;.  Is that supposed to be a big deal?  He is going to let them have the money they were to get anyway.  What we had hoped was that there would be some dynamic bust of energy funded in real terms.  Deputy Taylor-Quinn mentioned £110,000 but was at a loss as to where she had got the figure.  The Minister did not help her. That figure was in the explanatory and financial memorandum to the Bill circulated by the Minister.  In that memorandum, under financial implications, it is stated &ldquo;No additional Exchequer costs will arise in the current year&rdquo;.  There will be no great input of brilliance and research and funding.  A provision of £110,000 has been made for the Marine Institute in the Estimate for 1990. According to the Minister those are the financial implications and that is where Deputy Taylor-Quinn got her £110,000. What the Minister had done is to come before the House with a long script of 19 pages showing all the potential, spelling out in great detail what could be done, and let it all fall flat on its face because it can not be done in the present economic climate.  That will come as a great disappointment to many people who had great faith in this Government to actually do something about an area which has <Col N="1360" /> been absolutely neglected for generations by Governments of every political hue. At least they did not raise expectations. The Government have raised expectations only to shatter them with a totally inadequate resource package and a disappointing Bill which does not do even what he would like to do himself as he spelled out clearly on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>I want to talk briefly about another issue, that is, the issue of our territorial rights.  The Minister mentioned briefly the potential for expanding the territorial rights of this nation but he did not make any clear statement of interest in our territorial rights.  The rights that we have established under UN law, which could extend to one million square kilometres of seabed the influence and sphere of control of Ireland's mariculture, were not explored.  What is the Minister's view? What are the views of the Government in relation to this most important issue? Will the Minister spell it out and state the actions he proposes to take to maximise the area that will be brought into Irish sovereignty?  What action plan does he have to vindicate the rights that are clearly ours and to fend off what he describes as the conflicting claims of others?  It is not good enough to say that we might have rights out there.  The Minister should say what our rights are and what the Government intend to claim and win for Ireland.  He should indicate the path we will follow to bring those rights to fulfilment and to vindicate them in international law.  I hope the Minister will not leave that area up in the air as it is now and will do something to clarify that issue.</P>
    <P>The Bill states that with this new institute people and property may be transferred. Will the Minister spell out what his intentions are?  Is it to be a fisheries research centre repainted and nothing else?  Are all the expectations that were built up to be dashed, or is the Minister serious about the business that he pretends to be about?  Is he serious about achieving for Ireland all that he spelled out on Second Stage?</P>
    <P>He has acknowledged that the marine is a totally underdeveloped resource.  He <Col N="1361" /> has acknowledged that Ireland has a huge marine area much of it yet to be formally acknowledged as Irish influenced.  He has acknowledged that the various agencies and units in the research end of his Department in the universities are scattered and fragmented.  He has acknowledged that there is an inadequate corps of specialist researchers, that we do not have the information we require to maximise the potential of the marine.  More seriously, he has acknowledged that foreigners have a better knowledge and understanding of our marine situation than we do ourselves.  How can he stand over and accept that as Minister for the Marine when he must go to Brussels to fight the case of Ireland with information provided by the very people who argue against our case and who clearly have their own vested interests?  That is not an acceptable way for any Minister for the Marine to go to the negotiating table.</P>
    <P>Having acknowledged that, we would have hoped that the Minister would at least have said that is unacceptable to him as Minister for the Marine and that he intends to do something about it.  He should be telling us that he will provide a certain number of extra research vessels, undertake so much additional manning and provide so much cash to really provide him and his Department with information that is crucial to our national interest.  If we were to wait for the Minister to say that we would have been waiting in vain, because that did not happen.</P>
    <P>It is true that traditionally there has been a lack of interest by successive Governments in the area of the marine, as evidenced by the lack of a proper coastal radio network for VHF transmission which is slowly crawling into place year by year.  It is evidenced by the lack of a proper shipbuilding programme that would give us an independent maritime facility.  It is evidenced by what the Minister has accepted today as a totally inadequate pool of research or corps of researchers available to this country.  It is evidenced in every coastal resort in the country, where we have fabulous bays <Col N="1362" /> but no developed aquatic sports or recreation facilities.  A comparable location anywhere in Europe would have fabulous facilities, but we have neglected them.  It is not only this Minister's responsibility but has been the responsibility of all of us going back for generations.  That is the past but the Minister has responsibility for the future.  However, he has shirked that responsibility, as is evidenced by this legislation today and by the performance of his Department in recent years.</P>
    <P>I will get in a plug for my area as a possible location for the institute.  Apparently, it will not be a single location centre for some time, but when it is to be located in one place let me request that the Minister consider the south east, and particularly Wexford, in that regard.  I have already talked about the seafaring tradition of that county.  There is a huge pool of expertise available and there are several significant mariculture developments. Already there is shell fish culture, development and processing there while significant sea fishing is carried on from the excellent port of Kilmore.  Unfortunately, that port was battered recently by the storms &mdash; the Minister is familiar with this because he kindly visited it shortly after the disaster.  We are grateful for the help given by his Department and indeed by the Minister since that tragedy overtook Kilmore and other coastal regions in December of last year and January of this year.  We have the infrastructure, the tradition and the knowledge and no finer or better location can be found for the location of this institute than County Wexford.  Let me politicise the issue slightly by saying that much has been promised to that county but very little has been delivered especially in the area of decentralisation.  The Minister for Finance in the not too distant past promised that there would be decentralisation to County Wexford and I suggest that this is an opportunity to do something concrete on that promise and give the county a resource that can be used for the benefit of the country at large.  County Wexford has the tradition, and the skill and the background work <Col N="1363" /> has already been undertaken in the culturing of fish and in deep sea fishing.  It is all there within striking distance.</P>
    <P>There is great public anxiety about the type of chemicals used now in fish farming.  Public anxiety will eventually make it unviable to have sea fish farming unless stringent controls are not only put into operation but are seen to be put into operation.  Thankfully, we are acutely aware of the dangers to the environment from a great many activities.  Indeed a great many processes that would have been nodded through in years past now come under close scrutiny.  That is only right and proper because uniquely we have a great head start on the rest of Europe.  For all the negative points about our lack of development, the one positive point is that it has allowed us the potential to preserve our environment.  The Minister has to ensure that the marine environment is as pure as the land environment should be.</P>
    <P>In recent days some people have expressed the fear that the use of sonar devices to protect sea fish farming activities may have been responsible for the killing of a number of dolphins that have been washed up on the west coast in recent years.  I do not know very much about it but I know that some people fear this is the case.  I ask the Minister to look into this matter and to assure both us and himself that no sonar devices or devices of any kind designed to protect fish farming would have such a traumatic effect on the wonderful sea mammals such as dolphins.</P>
    <P>In essence, the Bill is welcome in broad strokes because it is at least the start of something.  It is unfortunate that the opportunity to do something dramatic has been lost and that instead of a far-reaching bringing together of the disparate elements involved in aquaculture and the marine, we have flimsy enabling legislation, full of promise but short on teeth.  It is clearly going to be under-funded and undermanned to meet the real needs of this country.  I hope the Minister will renew his battles in Cabinet to put the issue of marine development <Col N="1364" /> and the role of his Department to the forefront of our economic plans for the creation of jobs.  As a nation we have been devastated by unemployment and hurt to the core by emigration.  Marine development can play a significant role in redressing that horrendous deficit balance. Quite frankly I had hoped that the Minister would do better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Bill was circulated I welcomed it on behalf of The Workers' Party.  We are all in agreement that a marine institute should be established. This is something that my own party have been demanding for some time.  However, the more I have studied this Bill and examined the background to it, the more I am coming to the conclusion that perhaps I was a little over-hasty in my initial welcome for it.  The Bill falls very far short of what is required. It also falls very far short of the claims made for it by the Minister and it falls far short of the recommendations made by the task force which recommended in 1987 the establishment of a marine institute.</P>
      <P>My party will not be opposing the Second Reading of this Bill but we will be tabling a number of amendments on Committee Stage.  If the Bill is not substantially amended on Committee Stage then we will have to give serious consideration as to whether to oppose it at a later stage.  As it stands, this Bill proposes to establish a body which will do little more than provide a new layer of bureaucracy between those who are already engaged in marine research and development in many different agencies and the Department of the Marine who hold the purse strings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Howlin referred to the question of ambivalence to the sea and quite rightly pointed out that ambivalence is not generally held by the people of this country, particularly those who live along our coasts and whose working lives are bound up with the sea; but it is an ambivalence that was to be found very frequently in Government action, or inaction over the past number of years. It is probably fair to say that not only this <Col N="1365" /> Government's but their predecessor's relationaship with the sea can be described more as one of neglect than ambivalence.</P>
    <P>We are now addressing this issue, to establish a marine institute at the end of the century, the first century this country got its independence after 800 years of British domination.  This is a time when not just in this country but in other countries people are beginning to look at their political performance to examine how well they have governed themselves. As we approach the end of this century it is perhaps worth reflecting on how successful Irish Governments have been during the period of independence. Whatever yardstick you use, whether it is the level of unemployment or the fact that &mdash; if I may use the late President de Valera's phrase &mdash; we are still exporting our people like cattle, the period of self-Government has not been distinguished by success.  That is probably to be found as much in the area of maritime affairs as anywhere else.</P>
    <P>Only now, 70 years after achieving independence, are we establishing a marine institute to research and co-ordinate the development of our maritime affairs.  Only three years ago the first Department of the Marine was established. While I would be among the first to compliment the Government of the day on establishing the Department of the Marine, we also have to reflect on the fact that it was the very same political party who held office over most of the period of our independence when affairs of the sea and the development of our marine resources were neglected.  It is a sad reflection that, during our period of independence, in many respects the performance of Irish Governments in relation to the sea far worse than while this country was under British rule.</P>
    <P>In many respects our attitude to the sea has been dominated by a kind of fish on Friday attitude, that the sea is not central to economic development but is peripheral and, at worst, dangerous either physically or because of what it could bring this insular thinking country into contact with.  Throughout this period <Col N="1366" /> of our independence there are several examples of the Government's failure to develop marine resources.  For example, in the early eighties there was a shameful sell-out by an Irish Government in their negotiations at EC level which limited our fish quotas.  Despite the fact that Ireland has 25 per cent of European fishing waters, we got a miserly fish quota and that, in turn, has frustrated the development of a proper fishing industry.</P>
    <P>We can blame tradition and ambivalent attitudes and if we go back far enough, we can blame the British for many things, but we cannot blame them for the neglect of the sea.  Dr. John de Courcy Ireland in his book <i>Ireland and the Irish in Maritime Affairs</i> documents the remarkable contribution of the Irish to maritime affairs over many centuries and the fact that this country had a great maritime tradition going back to early times and throughout the centuries.  I will quote from his book to illustrate the point.  He says:</P>
    <P>While other nations were building frigates, clippers, iron-clads and submarines, Irishmen at home were keeping alive the traditional Irish skills in ship and boat-building.  The Galway and Kinsale hooker, the Wexford cot, the Greencastle yawl, the Dublin Bay herring boat and many other craft, all unique, which are for the most part represented by excellent models in the Irish Maritime Museum in Dún Laoghaire, took on their final form during the last century.  During that century the remarkable Tyrrell boat-yard at Arklow was established, which has produced a succession of famous vessels, culminating with the lovely sail-training wooden brigantine <i>Asgard II</i> of 1981. </P>
    <P>Throughout the centuries and right up to the time of independence, there was a great maritime tradition in this country. What went wrong when we got independence? The story of Irish Shipping is probably the best example to give of what went wrong.  Again I will quote from Dr. de Courcy Ireland's book because the story of Irish Shipping is, perhaps, the <Col N="1367" /> saddest reflection of the disgraceful and shameful way in which Irish Governments have treated the sea and the people who have worked on the sea.  He says:</P>
    <P>When statehood was at last achieved here the people of Ireland had a right to expect their great maritime tradition to be capitalised upon for their benefit and as a contribution from Ireland to the everlasting struggle of all mankind to harness the sea and its sciences for one universal good.  The people's expectations were disappointed.  It was only when dire want was upon us that the government of the time, the same one that had been warned before the 1939 war broke out by a few who had foresight, and had not heeded, set up Irish Shipping Ltd.  This company's ships saved us in wartime, and, when peace came, brought millions of pounds into the country, saved millions more that would otherwise have gone to foreign shipowners, gave employment to hundreds and showed the Irish flag and raised the prestige of Ireland even in far-off places where the name of Ireland was barely known.</P>
    <P>Now, since this book was completed, Irish Shipping Ltd. has been liquidated, and the Irish people have been betrayed again.  Who was responsible for the mismanagement that led to liquidation, and for what motive or motives, time may perhaps tell.  But the ultimate blame unquestionably lies with successive Governments which, after that of 1941 had been driven by desperate events to found the company, never took any genuine interest in what it was doing and what it stood for, in its personnel whose loyalty and readiness to make sacrifices for their employers must be almost unexampled in the annals of merchant shipping.  No effort was made to arouse, through the national education system, that interest in maritime affairs by the general public which could have prevented apathy and complacency in high places.</P>
    <P>Today we are reduced to a merchant <Col N="1368" /> fleet of 92,401 tons 30,908 tons of which are owned outside the state &mdash; a merchant fleet one-third the size of land-locked Switzerland's leaving our seaborne trade largely at the mercy of outside shipowners.  Worse there are now dozens of Irish seafarers with no hope but to offer their services to foreign-flag companies (probably dubious &ldquo;flag of convenience&rdquo; ones) which make no provision for pension and social welfare payments, life insurance cover or disability insurance.  And, even more disgraceful, seamen who gave the country a lifetime in service, and widows of some who served through the hazards of wars, have had their pensions mercilessly cut &mdash; in the typical case of a retired master mariner who was at sea in the wartime fleet from £184 a month, hardly generous to start with, to only £29. </P>

      <P>Deputy Gilmore, will appreciate that that is some distance from marine research.  You can argue that you cannot have marine research without ships, but it was never the intention of the company in question to exploit them in this fashion.  I would ask that he would not dwell too long on the particular aspects of Irish Shipping which would be more appropriate to other legislation.</P>

The last occasion on which I sought to raise it I was told it was <i>sub judice</i> and that the Minister was not in a position to reply to me.  As you know, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the present Government or at least their immediate predecessor &mdash; when they were a single party &mdash; gave an under-taking to the former employees of Irish Shipping that their pensions and their redundancy entitlements would be attended to.  It is a disgrace that people <Col N="1369" /> who served this country well, who found their company liquidated, who provided this company with a shipping service&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In respect of Second Stage contributions, while Deputies have certain freedom, that freedom is confined to referring to what is proposed in the legislation or what might more correctly be proposed in it.  In so far as the Deputy&mdash;on his own admission &mdash; is not anxious to pursue either of those then he would be precluded from pursuing what is not allowable for discussion under this Bill.

      <P>It is my intention to show that in fact Irish Shipping is relevant to this Bill, that the functions of the Marine Institute, whenever it is established, will have a bearing, and the research it will carry out will not be confined to matters which will preclude it from research into the whole area of shipping.  I am surprised that previous speakers had the latitude to raise everything from the fishing industry to the provision of leisure facilities in bays.  I find it strange that again on this occasion my efforts to speak about what has been the greatest tragedy in Irish maritime affairs this last quarter of the century is leading to frustration on the part of the Chair.

      <P>All will be revealed.  I will return to the point when I am a addressing the issue of the functions of the Marine Institute and at that stage you will not find any reason to quibble with it.  It is important to have put it in perspective because it shows the extent to which maritime affairs in Ireland have been neglected by successive Governments. We now have a Bill dealing with a marine institute.  We have to examine what contribution that will make to maritime affairs.  As I mentioned earlier, my party welcome the establishment of a marine institute.  It is being established 15 years after it was first recommended by the OECD.  It is now three years since the task force reported.  I doubt whether its establishment will be on time either to address the serious research that needs to be carried out and the co-ordination of it in advance of the review of our fish quotas in 1992 or to enable us benefit from funds which may be available from the European Community for marine research.</P>
      <P>Deputy Taylor-Quinn mentioned the case of EC funds and referred in particular to the MAST programme.  We have already missed out on the first phase of that programme because we did not have a marine institute established.  We may yet miss out on the next phase of it.  In addition there is the question of whether we will benefit from funds from the STRIDE programme which deals with Regional Funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course we did not have to wait for <Col N="1371" /> the establishment of a Marine Institute for research and development of marine resources to be carried out.  There are many bodies already working in this area. Those are documented in the task force report.  In preparation for the debate on this Bill I asked the Minister to send me a copy of the task force report.  I regret to say I did not receive one from him though I did manage to lay my hands on a copy elsewhere.  The task force report spells out the number of Government Departments which are already engaged in marine research.  It lists the universities which are carrying out marine research, the various State bodies, semi-State companies etc. who are carrying out extensive research into the sea and the various areas connected with it.  The problem is not that there has not been research, it is more a case that there has not been a policy or a strategy.  There has been no political direction and there has been a great shortage of resources available to those bodies to carry out the kind of research and development they are capable of.</P>
    <P>If we were to judge the institute that is to be established from the speech made by the Minister, we would be reasonably happy with it.  His speech was very broad and showed a great understanding of the issues of the sea and of what was required; obviously, the Minister borrowed very heavily from the task force report in the preparation of his speech. The problem is that the Bill presented to us bears little or no relationship to the task force report and the claims which are made for it by the Minister.  This Bill could be establishing anything.  It could be establishing any State agency related to any Department of Government.  It is a Bill which is straight out of the word processor.  It is a standard Bill.  The sections are standard sections to be found in any Bill establishing a State agency.  The Bill makes very little concession to the topics it is dealing with and in particular to the sea.  A study of some of the individual sections of the Bill will make that clear.  Look, for example, at the definition of &ldquo;marine&rdquo; which, as I read it, is <Col N="1372" /> about the narrowest definition of &ldquo;marine&rdquo; you can get.  It is continuing the fallacy that you treat the sea as a body of water, that you do not treat it in its totality.  The Nordic Council dealing with the definition of the sea and its relationship with air and land, state: &ldquo;The volume of water in the ocean is admittedly enormous but this water is one component of a continuous cycle and is involved in a continuous exchange of different substances between land, air and sea&rdquo;.  I can see no reference in the definition to the seabed, which is a very important element of what is to be researched.  Any definition of &ldquo;marine&rdquo; has to take account of the single system to which the sea belongs.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with what the functions of the institute are to be.  Previous speakers have referred to this, and it really reads as if the Minister is behaving like a parent who is faced with a grown up child and does not want to let go.  Virtually every function in the Bill can be performed only by the express permission of the Minister.  The institute will &ldquo;advise the Minister&rdquo;.  They will carry out policy XX &ldquo;as may be specified by the Minister&rdquo;. They can co-ordinate proposals for research &ldquo;as the Minister may from time to time direct&rdquo;.  They can evaluate for the Minister proposals for marine research etc. &ldquo;as the Minister may from time to time direct&rdquo;.  They may advise the Minister on proposals for marine research &ldquo;as the Minister may from time to time direct&rdquo;.  They may &ldquo;at the request of the Minister&rdquo; represent the State in various respects.  They may engage in international activities &ldquo;(where appropriate after consultation with the Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs)&rdquo;. They can engage in activities relating to marine research &ldquo;as may be approved by the Minister&rdquo;.  The institute may, subject to compliance with conditions &ldquo;as the Minister may from time to time direct&rdquo; do all other such things etc.  Virtually every function that is identified for the institute in the Bill can be performed only with the expressed permission of the Minister.  I wonder if, when this institute are established, the Minister will find <Col N="1373" /> time to do anything other than reply to requests from them for permission to do work which they need to do.</P>
    <P>I agree that any institute of State established need to be accountable to this House through the Minister, but really what is being proposed here is little more than an extension of the Department of the Marine themselves.  They are certainly not any kind of independent or quasi-independent body who could function properly.  We know from previous experience that State bodies who are established with that kind of umbilical cord still attached to the Minister simply do not work.  There is always a tension between the parent Department and a body in the first place, and in those circumstances the Department invariably win.</P>
    <P>When we look at the functions proposed for the institute, it is quite clear that what is provided for in this Bill is far short of what was recommended by the task force.  They stated that the institute should have a clear focus and clearly defined responsibilities.  That task force were established in 1986 by the then Government and were called the Marine Science and Technology Task Force. They were established to make recommendations, and they did so in 1987. They recommended the establishment of a marine institute and made recommendations as to what the marine institute should do, how it should be composed and so on.  It is quite clear from the Bill that the task force recommendations, even though the Minister used them as script material for his speech, have been ignored.  They go much further in terms of the functions that would be appropriate to the institute than is contained in the Bill.  They talk about the provision of advice to the Minister for Fisheries and the Minister for Industry and Commerce as being responsible for science and technology at national level, and other Ministers as appropriate, on any matter relating to research and technological development on which their advice is requested.  They say the institute have responsibility to prepare long term projections and a <Col N="1374" /> national programme for their area of responsibility, to organise the delineation, mapping and quantification of Ireland's marine and fisheries resources.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers in this debate have referred to the fact that this country to date has failed to delineate its claim on the Continental Shelf.  It is a disgrace. Iceland and even the Faroe Islands have delineated already and lodged their claim at the United Nations for a share of the Continental Shelf which in some cases is overlapping the share of the Continental Shelf which should properly be claimed by this country, and the Irish Government are behaving absurdly.  It is almost like giving a farmer a piece of land and he does not go out to stake and claim it and allows anyone to come and use it. We have the possibility now &mdash; it will not remain there forever &mdash; of claiming and delineating a share of the Continental Shelf with all that involves in terms of potential for future development and preventing others from abusing it for either military or other purposes, yet it has not been done.  Although the Minister referred to it obliquely in his speech, he has not stated when it is going to be done. The task force recommended that the Marine Institute they were recommending be established would be the body who would do it, yet quite significantly that function has been left out of the functions which are to be given to the Marine Institute.  I would like the Minister to answer why there is no reference in the Bill establishing the Marine Institute to the function recommended for them by the task force, that they should be responsible for the delineation, mapping and quantification of Ireland's marine and fishery resources and the delineation of the Continental Shelf.</P>
    <P>The task force go on to talk about how the co-ordination of research is to be carried out.  As I mentioned, many bodies are involved in marine research and development and this Bill talks in a very general way about co-ordination.  The Minister said that in terms of location it will not be a single campus.  I understand the logic of it not being a single campus location because of the nature of the work <Col N="1375" /> to be carried out and co-ordinated by the Marine Institute.</P>
    <P>We are talking about a coastal activity for a start; we are talking about different functions some of which are already being undertaken by other bodies.  By its very nature the institute would not be a single campus organisation but it is a total cop-out to avoid addressing the question of whether the bodies already engaged in marine research will be brought into the new institute.  That is not clear from the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill refers to the new institute as having some kind of umbrella co-ordinating role.  For example, the task force recommended that different bodies should be brought into the institute.  They recommended that the institute should as a minimum incorporate the research and technology functions currently undertaken by the following institutions, or parts of institutions &mdash; the Fisheries Research Centre, the Salmon Research Trust, the Central Fisheries Board, BIM, the Shellfish Laboratory at Carna, the NBST marine activities, the marine research vessel, <i>Lough Beltra,</i> the IIRS Ocean Services Department, the marine geology section of the Geological Survey Office, and the hydrodraulics research laboratory at UCC.  They went on to propose a relationship between the institute and the universities engaged in research but the Bill ducks the question, it avoids saying whether those bodies will be incorporated into the new institute.  The Bill does not say if the functions of those bodies will be transferred to the Marine Institute.  If the functions of those bodies who are already carrying out the research are not to be transferred to the new institute, what will be the function of that body other than establishing a new layer of bureaucracy between the staff who are working in those bodies and the Department of the Marine who will control the purse strings?  The Minister should address that question in the course of his reply.</P>
    <P>This amounts to the Government fulfilling, at least on paper, an election <Col N="1376" /> promise to establish a marine institute They are not doing so in a way that was recommended either by the task force or by those who are engaged in this work. What should the Marine Institute be doing?  To answer that question I should like to return to the issue of shipping. After the Channel Tunnel opens we will be the only island member state of the Community.  I accept that raising the issue of shipping in the Chamber is not the most welcome act but it is something that has some relevance when we are talking about establishing an institute that will research our maritime affairs. The new body will have to consider how people and goods will be transported between Ireland and the remainder of the European Community.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the institute addressing the whole question of shipping because of the many developments that have taken place elsewhere.  For example, Sealink have put a new 35,000 tonne ship on the English Channel and P &amp; O have put two modern vessels on the Enlish Channel which can cover the journey between Dover and Boulogne in 40 minutes.  What are we doing about providing modern ships that will give us an efficient means of transport between this country and the rest of the Community post-1992?  The new institute should address that matter.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the institute should address what is happening generally in regard to shipping.  That is relevant when one considers what happened to Irish Shipping.  That perfectly good shipping company was sunk and we are likely to get in its place a dependence on the kind of cheap labour on Panamanian and Third World ships which are increasingly common in European waters.  They fly flags of convenience and we have already seen the results of them getting involved in shipping.  There have been many serious accidents, such as the recent tragedy in Norway, and a number of oil-spills. Underpaid and under-trained crews operate those ships flying flags of convenience.  In some cases the crews do not understand the basic safety precautions to be taken on ships.  The <Col N="1377" /> issue of shipping, and the provision of labour on ships, should be addressed by the new institute.</P>
    <P>In my view, the new institute will have to address the question of fish quotas. That will have to be undertaken before the review of the quotas in 1992.  They will have to consider the type of trawlers we need to maximise our fishing potential. The French equivalent of the new institute are planning a new model of trawler for the next century.  The new body will have to address the issue of fish farming and ensure that we develop a form of fish farming which is economically efficient and environmentally sensitive.  They will have to consider the question of employment.  We have never considered seriously the potential of the sea for employment.  Many Members have referred to fishing and the leisure industry, the obvious sources from which employment could be obtained from the sea, but employment could be obtained in marine research.  As the land based resources of many countries become exhausted people are turning more and more to the sea.  In my view people will be turning to the sea but not in an exploitative fashion.  They will be anxious to see how the resource can be developed and conserved in order to provide food and energy resources for people.</P>
    <P>How will the new institute inter-relate with the proposed environmental protection agency?  At what point will responsibility for environmental protection cease to be the responsibility of the new agency?  Will the Marine Institute have any responsibility in that area? Much of the legislation dealing with the sea is seriously out of date and it will be a matter for the new institute to up-date it.</P>
    <P>Other speakers referred to the location of the headquarters of the new body.  I hold an opinion on this subject.  Deputy Taylor-Quinn tried to bend my ear and appeal to my filial attachment to Galway but, on reflection, the most appropriate location for the headquarters of the institute would be a place where they could inter-relate with other institutions engaged in marine work.  I am speaking <Col N="1378" /> in particular of the Maritime Museum and the headquarters of BIM both of which are located in Dún Laoghaire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>We will share it.  The Minister said it will not be a single campus institution and obviously its different aspects will be located where the research is already being carried out.  Essentially we are talking about a headquarters. There are three reasons for locating it in Dún Laoghaire; the first is because the Maritime Museum and BIM are located there with which it could integrate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, indeed. Secondly, the Minister for the Marine is currently considering proposals for the development of Dún Laoghaire Harbour and included in that are proposals for development to the rear of the West Pier. Some time ago I suggested that this would make an ideal location for the development of a marine science technology park, not just something which would perhaps be the headquarters of the Marine Institute but which could also be the location from which employment based on marine research and the development of marine technologies could be advanced.  There is a need &mdash; and it will become greater after 1992 &mdash; to identify areas where employment will be created and to carve a niche for itself in certain industries.  At this stage we may well be late in trying to imitate what other countries have done in relation to the development of the sea but there is a whole area of marine research and the development of new marine technologies in which no country has yet specialised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1379" /> Even though this country is late in establishing its Marine Institute it could become involved in it.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister's response and I hope he will take on board at least some of the criticism in regard to the Bill.  I hope it can be substantially amended on Committee Stage because, as it stands, it is inadequate and totally ignores the recommendations made by the task force.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a particular and very personal reason for welcoming the Bill. In 1984 I was invited by the Taoiseach to become involved in the preparation of a draft paper on marine policy, focusing in particular on the need for the establishment of the Department of the Marine and for an accompanying institute for marine research.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach at that time was making what I believe will prove to be one of the most important and significant policy steps taken by any Government since the foundation of the State.  I know that phrase is very frequently used but in this case it is used objectively and without any sense of hype.  As a background to the Taoiseach's initiative &mdash; it is worth stressing that it was very much the Taoiseach's personal idea and initiative &mdash; was his realisation that our marine environment is one of our most unappreciated and underdeveloped natural resources and in that he showed extraordinary foresight. There is an old saying that a good idea has many fathers and that a bad idea has none.  It is intriguing, since the Taoiseach took this initiative, to see how many people have claimed credit for it. Anyway we are generous on this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Fianna Fáil policy document &mdash;<i>Roinn na Mara</i>&mdash; produced in 1984 and published in 1985, it was recognised that since the foundation of the State there has never been a co-ordinated Government policy directed towards the development of marine resources.  The policy document suggested that the reasons for this are partly historical and, to a large extent, reflect the low priority <Col N="1380" /> attached to the establishment of a marine economy by successive Governments.</P>
    <P>The document recognised that many of the problems currently affecting marine related industries could be attributed to an absence of policy planning, accompanied by a fragmentation of administrative structures.  The absence of policy planning and the lack of administrative structures were identified as resulting in five major problems: (1) a wasteful utilisation of Government financial and human resources; (2) a wasteful demarcation and overlap in policy between Government Departments and agencies operating in and outside the marine area; (3) confusion that led to an absence of forward development planning relating to existing established marine resources and those with development potential; (4) it was felt that the existing situation resulted in a lack of cohesion in approach to international maritime developments which impinge on national interests; and (5) it was felt that the existing situation brought about inadequate investment in research and development.  I have summarised the document at some length because it was very much the father of the task force rather than the document to which Deputy Gilmore referred as being the father of the Minister's speech.  Without crowing about it I suggest that since the early eighties there has been a very specific and concentrated focus of thinking within Fianna Fáil on this important policy area which emanated from the Taoiseach's personal interest in the matter.  Do not let anybody else claim credit in this regard.</P>
    <P>We are an island nation and we have an area of coastal waters under our control which vastly exceeds the total land area of the island.  More important, not only does the sea area exceed the land-mass, we have no idea of the wealth tied up within this vast sea area under our control, nor have we begun to think how we can exploit that area for the benefit of our people.  The sea, of course, is not just an area for exploitation, it is a living eco system that must be nurtured and respected.  The effect of man's impact on <Col N="1381" /> the sea is becoming all too obvious, not just in our immediate area, but right across the globe.</P>
    <P>In the Irish Sea we have, in effect, an inland sea into which has been dumped over the generations countless billion tons of raw and semi-treated sewage and each and every year we add to that.  Billions of tons of nitrates and other chemicals are being washed through our streams and rivers to the same relatively confined sea.  We do not even begin to have an idea as to the impact of the accumulation.  To add insult to the centuries of injury of this sea, in the last 30 to 40 years a new and much more long lived menace has been dumped into those far from pristine waters.  I am referring to the siting on the west coast of Britain of a string of major nuclear research stations, nuclear generator stations and of course the recycling plant at Windscale, now Sellafield.  These stations pump their irradiated waters and waste into the Irish Sea and cause untold problems.  In effect we live on the edge of an ecological time-bomb and we do not understand what is going on in that sea.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Irish Sea is not unique in this respect and we do not want to give the impression that it is.  Across the planet there are many other horrifying examples of damaged and destroyed waters.  For example, the Aral Sea in the USSR provides the most extraordinary example of human folly.  This truly immense sea has had its water renewal resource effectively cut off for irrigation purposes to the point where the sea's mass has now declined dramatically, whole communities have been devastated and the lives of tens of thousands of people changed for the worse.  Areas of shoreline which were once fertile have been converted to deserts.</P>
    <P>We must learn from these mistakes. The Government have shown - not just in this Bill &mdash; but in other initiatives that we are learning and capable of taking on board messages coming to us from all directions.  In the document <i>An Environment Action Programme</i>&mdash; produced some time ago by the Minister for the Environment &mdash; the Government deal <Col N="1382" /> at some length with the issue of marine environment.  For example, the Government have decided to eliminate untreated discharges of sewage from major coastal towns by the year 2000.  This new programme will involve an investment of up to £400 million between now and the end of the century and provision for this will be built into future economic and social planning.  I was very pleased to learn last week from the Minister for the Environment that phase two of the Greystones sewerage scheme is to be upgraded and will include a secondary treatment plant as well as a long sea outfall.  Obviously, we are learning from our recent mistakes in this area.</P>
    <P>The problem of dumping at sea is also being addressed by the Government. They have decided, for example, that Dublin Corporation must end the dumping of sewage slug at sea by 1998 at the very latest.  Detailed studies are being undertaken to develop alternative sludge disposal arrangements.  The bed of the Irish Sea is absolutely awash with sludge, not just from Dublin but from other cities.  We cannot begin to understand the long-term impact of this.  The question of waste disposal in harbours is being dealt with by the Government as part of the environmental action programme, which deals also with such diverse issues as the upgrading of beaches and the removal of sand from foreshores.  It has been suggested that the steps the Government are taking in this direction are timid but they are not.</P>
    <P>How man treats the sea as a dumping ground is only one aspect of the problem. Unintentional dumping through accidents at sea is another aspect.  We have seen at first hand the problems caused by the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> and the <i>Betelgeuse</i> disasters.  As the memories of these disasters were beginning to fade from public consciousness the problem was brought back forcibly to mind by the recent disaster in Alaska involving the <i>Exxon Valdez.</i>  In that instance bad company practice and poor seamanship led to a super tanker devastating an area rich in marine life and fish.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1383" /> Our coastal waters are among the busiest in the world and we must be mindful of the lessons learnt from the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> and <i>Exxon Valdez</i> disasters.  The question arises: do we have the research capacity to inform policy in this area?  The answer is no.  This is why the Government are taking these steps in this Bill.  Our status as an island nation has been perceived for generations as a burden rather than an opportunity.  One of the remarkable aspects of Irish life has been our failure to develop an indigenous shipping industry.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the strictures you laid on the last speaker, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, but I should like to point out that if we had a well-informed marine research institute, knew anything of international trade developments in shipping and did anything other than look occasionally at the Lloyds list in our Department of State, the disaster of Irish Shipping would not have happened.  That disaster was the result of many years of carelessness.</P>
    <P>I have personal interest in this issue. During the war years my late father was on the <i>Kerlogue</i> and in later years moved to Irish Shipping.  I lived on a road which, as Deputy Howlin said, produced a great many sea captains.  Like many people on that road my father went to sea when he was young, came ashore and eventually moved back to shipping to end his days a pensioner at Deputy Mitchell's mercy.</P>
    <P>It is worth putting on the record that the tragedy of Irish Shipping is still with us.  It is extraordinary that we as an island nation do not have a blue water merchant shipping fleet.  We can see the results of this tragedy outside this House every budget day and each anniversary of the disastrous decisions taken by Deputy Mitchell in the protest held by Irish Shipping workers and their families.  We have a moral obligation to look after those people, and I will continue to bother Ministers about this issue until such time as it is resolved.</P>
    <P>The Irish Shipping debacle has left us as an island nation without any national deep water fleet.</P>
    <Col N="1384" />

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Roche will appreciate that he cannot develop this point now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>I promise you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that I will not develop the point further; I want to simply point out that the lack of a deep water fleet is something about which we should be concerned.  The only deep water fleet operating out of this country at present is Arklow Shipping, a progressive and adventurous medium-sized shipping company by European standards. Even Arklow Shipping would admit that they do not constitute the blue water fleet we require.</P>
      <P>One of the challenges facing the new institution is the monitoring of shipping development in a way that has never been done by State agencies.  I worked for some years in the shipping section of the Department of Transport and power and I know no on-going monitoring of shipping developments is carried out; the civil servants in that section have too much else to do.  If we want to know how shipping will develop right into the next century we must have an institution which can focus its attention on these developments. Without straining on your indulgence, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I say there is a particular need for research in this area.</P>
      <P>Like our shipping fleet &mdash; I am moving onto inland waters &mdash; our fishing fleet has for far too long been a disaster.  For years uninspired policies linked to a national &ldquo;it will do&rdquo; mentality and severe funding shortages conspired to keep down the size of Irish boats, and fleet numbers were restricted and stunted.  What could have been a great industry never reached its potential simply because we did not realise that potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been vast improvements and developments in the size of boats in recent years.  The <i>Veronica,</i> the biggest privately-owned fish factory ship in Europe, the <i>Genesus,</i> the <i>Atlantic Challenger</i> and the <i>Western Endeavour</i> all joined our fleet during the past decade. These are very welcome developments. <Col N="1385" /> However, while there has been a welcome influx of some large and medium-sized vessels on to the fishing register in recent times, the size and quality of much of the fleet still give cause for concern.  I represent a maritime county and I am very concerned about the quality and safety of some smaller vessels.  Many small vessels are poorly equipped and long past their prime, and some are clearly a danger to those who use them. This is something which must be of concern to all of us.</P>
    <P>One of the most striking reasons for establishing a marine research unit institute is to generate intelligence and research in fish movement and developments. If we want to make any impact on non-quota species we must be able to establish the exact viability of fishing in this area.  It is extraordinary that some of those fishermen who compete with our fleet in our waters have better data available to them than our fleet have.  This again highlights the need for a co-ordinated research effort in this area.</P>
    <P>We have just begun to recognise the potential of our seas in the mariculture and aquaculture areas.  There have been some modest developments in these areas over the past decade.  I want to stress that these developments have only been modest.  From listening to some people one would think we have moved to the forefront in terms of mariculture development, but we are barely scratching the surface.  For example, Wexford harbour has become a major source of mussels for French and European markets; shellfish production is being undertaken at a number of key points along the western seaboard, and fish farm pens and cages are appearing at a number of locations.  As I have said, these developments barely scratch the surface of the truly vast potential in this industry.</P>
    <P>Ireland and the Japanese island of Hokkaido are roughly comparable in terms of their sea area and coastlines. Indeed, their environmental conditions are not all that dissimilar either.  The fishermen on the island of Hokkaido catch in the region of 300 million tonnes <Col N="1386" /> of fish every year.  They produce an additional 1.7 million tonnes of fish processed in some five hundred processing plants on the island.  Total direct employment in the fishing industry amounts to 34,000 employees.  In addition there are 47,000 people employed in the fleet and in other offshore activities.</P>
    <P>Of course, Japan has by far the world's biggest marine aquaculture industry.  The Japanese currently produce 1.2 million tonnes from their aquaculture valued at £2.9 billion; 10 per cent of total fish and food production in Japan is accounted for by that industry.  The Japanese are currently growing species such as red seabream, black seabream, flat fish, kuruma prawns, blue crab, scallops, abalone, arkshell, sea urchin as well as horse mackerel, octopus, trout and salmon in the seas around their coasts.  The total number of people employed in Japanese fisheries is a staggering 400,000.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting we will ever be in the same league as the Japanese.  Indeed, we do not have to go to Japan to make comparisons which show how far behind we are in these areas.  For example, compare our efforts with Norwegian production of fish farm salmon or with Scottish production, much more modest than the Japanese.  Yet those two nations make us blush when the comparison is made.</P>
    <P>The area of shell fish production alone highlights something of the confusion we are going through.  For example, in recent times Lett and Company in Wexford decided they would expand into the production of scallops.  There are few companies here who can have a greater interest in our marine environment than that one.  While others toy around with the idea of mussel production this adventurous and far-seeing company has become, in European terms, a major player.  However, the company went further: not content with producing the raw product, as do so many of our native companies, Letts decided to invest heavily in value-added, producing a range of high quality, high value-added products which merit a premium price. From humble beginnings the Lett <Col N="1387" /> brothers built up not just a family firm but an entire industry.  On fields around Batt Lane in Wexford where I, the Lett brothers and occasionally Deputy Howlin played as lads, they have built up a multi-million pound plant, giving good employment in the area.  They put money into the local economy, adding value to a native product.  They have established Irish shellfish as a premium product on the United Kingdom and continental markets, in particular on the French market.  They have penetrated the United States market and have opened major trade links with Japan.  By any yardstick that amounts to a successful company.  In brief, Lett and Company, Tuskar Rock Seafood Products Limited, know their business well.</P>
    <P>When that firm established the potential for scallop production, having invested heavily in terms of onshore plant and offshore facilities, they began not to get praise for their efforts as one might have expected.  Indeed one would have expected they would have received not just praise but would be the object of some sense of national pride.  Rather they began to encounter problems more readily identifiable not with pride but with the great Irish tradition of begrudgery. The problem in this case, as in so many others, was that opposition was based not on knowledge but on a lack thereof.  If anybody was to risk damaging the Irish shellfish industry or the marine environment most decidedly they would not be the major player in that industry. Mindless opposition to positive developments derive from a lack of knowledge.</P>
    <P>At present aquaculture and mariculture are in their infancy here.  All too often lack of knowledge to make informed decisions can lead people to taking entrenched positions &mdash; people with vested interests or with an axe to grind can too easily don a &ldquo;green mantle&rdquo;.  Lack of knowledge can also contribute to developments which we may have cause to regret in the future. Knowledge serves the environmentalist, the policy-maker and the developer in equal proportion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1388" /> In the area of mariculture it is vital that we have greater knowledge of what we are about, where we are going and what effect decisions now being taken will have in the long term.  Again this underscores the vital need for a Marine Institute.  In our case, lack of knowledge and of appreciation of potential have led us to fail to develop our marine resources.</P>
    <P>Three years ago when Fianna Fáil were returned to power a start was made to redress the balance with the establishment of a Department of the Marine. That Department drew together bits and pieces from many other Departments previously responsible for marine policy. For the first time a Government Ministry focused on marine policy and elevated it to the Cabinet table.  From the foundation of the State the contribution of the Departments concerned was fragmented and unco-ordinated, but with the advent of a Department of the Marine there was for the first time the possibility of a focused approach.</P>
    <P>One of the most innovative moves by Government since the foundation of the State was the establishment of a Department of the Marine.  Great credit is due to its first Minister, Deputy Brendan Daly, who became Minister in difficult times. When he came into that Ministry it was difficult to assemble an administrative structure because of the strictures obtaining throughout the public service and its personnel.  One of the great tragedies in recent times in Irish politics has been the over-clouding of the achievements of that Minister by the rod licence affair.  Vested interests and, I have to say, craven politicians to their shame, conspired to delay progress in this area.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us today constitutes the second structural element proposed in the policy document drawn up by Fianna Fáil in 1985.  Frankly I am somewhat surprised it has taken so long for it to be introduced.  In the 1985 policy document and in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> the establishment of a Marine Institute was seen as an essential ingredient in the long-term development of our marine resources.  In our 1985 policy document it was suggested that a marine <Col N="1389" /> institute would have the following objectives: to develop and promote a national policy for marine research and development; to co-ordinate all existing marine research activities and to direct marine research in universities and other institutes; to organise oceanographic, hydrographic, fisheries and aquaculture research, marine geological and environmental studies; to research and develop ocean engineering and to provide a data bank on all marine research developments; and to liaise with international marine research institutes.  In that policy document the Marine Institute was envisaged as integrating the work being done by bodies such as the Fishery Research Centre and Salmon Research Trust then under the aegis of the Department of Fisheries and Forestry, the Marine Geological Unit of the Geological Survey Office under the aegis of the Department of Industry and Energy, the marine division of the National Board for Science and Technology and other services then provided by the IIRS.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding what has been said here today, I might point out that this Bill provides the potential to fulfil all of those objectives.  It is obvious that its provisions follow very closely the proposals outlined by our party in 1985.  A very important point in those proposals is that there will not be a single campus organisation.  I welcome that decision.  In the past all too often the birth of a new institute has meant nothing more than the cobbling together of existing functions accompanied by an explosion of top level appointments.</P>
    <P>I might refer Deputies who may have some doubts about this to the birth of the extinct but not much lamented Department of the Public Service in 1973 which resulted in a massive explosion of top level appointments and, at the end of the day, did not bring a great deal of improvement.  I am puzzled at the response to this point by Fine Gael, in particular by their spokesperson.  She does not seem to understand that the whole aim and intention here is to provide an organisation which can best be <Col N="1390" /> described as catalytic rather than administrative. All too frequently in the past we have focused on the birth of organisations great at administration which do not catalyse anything.  We must pose the question: if we take the route she suggested, dragging the fisheries research people from Abbotstown, somebody else from Wexford, and pulling all of these people together in one location in Galway, will we achieve anything?  I think not.</P>
    <P>To be fair to Deputy Gilmore he saw the dangers in taking this route and pointed out there was not much logic in the proposition that we opt for an organisation situated in a single campus. This is not to say the organisation being established by the Bill will not have a head office.  It will but I dearly hope it will be a modest one and we will not be surrounded by battalions of people seeking to promote their interests rather than the interests the institute should promote.</P>
    <P>I am equally puzzled by the response of the Labour Party.  This is an enabling Bill.  I see nothing wrong with that.  It sets us on a new course but not one which is entirely unexplored.  It is worth pointing out that the idea behind the establishment of the Agricultural Institute many years ago was that there would be a small central corps who would buy or initiate research in other institutions.  In this way the brainpower of those institutions would be focused on agricultural research.  It was not the intention that there would be one major agency carrying out all this research.  I suggest to the Minister that he should stick to his guns on this issue as there is no way that he will ever be able to bring all the available brainpower together in one cental location.  It would be far better to create an institute who would act as a liaison body and catalyst and who would co-ordinate the activity of all the other diverse agencies involved in research.</P>
    <P>The arrangements the Minister is putting in place will allow for the co-ordination of marine research and provide for the first time an agency or institute who will focus and co-ordinate marine research and ensure that the priorities of <Col N="1391" /> the researchers in the marine research area are those of the nation.  The institute being established under the Bill will provide a direct linkage with State Departments. Therefore far from criticising the approach being adopted in the Bill anyone who has seriously considered the issue or has a serious interest in the way public administration operates should take the view that this is an innovation we should welcome.</P>
    <P>This institute will prevent the wasteful overlapping of research which occurs at present and ensure that gaps in research will be avoided.  There is no doubt that there are gaps in research and I have referred to one or two.  It should also prevent unhelpful competition between different publicly funded operations and between public and private research.  It is worth bearing in mind that at present a number of State agencies are involved in marine activity.  To suggest that we remove responsibility for those activities from those agencies and hand it to an institute under one roof is to avoid the reality that if we do this the vacuums will be filled and those agencies for whatever reasons will seek to continue at least some of this activity.  Therefore if we were to take the route suggested by Deputy Taylor-Quinn we would produce precisely the opposite effect.</P>
    <P>I hope the new arrangements will encourage us to see how cost-effective marine research is.  We have to bear in mind that there are limits to the amount of money we can spend, we all have to live with that fact.  What we have to ensure is that research is well focused and that we do not end up reinventing the wheel.  The whole purpose of the institute should be to focus and direct activity not necessarily to carry out activity themselves.</P>
    <P>There is a number of other points I would like to make.  A case can be made for looking at a variety of locations for the head office.  In the cross-Chamber banter between Deputy Gilmore and me, I suggested Bray but if the Minister does not opt for Bray I would be quite happy that he settle for Arklow.  However that <Col N="1392" /> is one of the minor issues to be resolved at this time.  Instead of being parochial what we should be doing is combining our efforts and talents.  People on all sides of the House have a contribution to make and instead of arguing over where the institute should be located we should focus our minds on the way in which the new institute should operate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor-Quinn in her contribution, and I am sorry she is not present in the House, referred to her concerns about section 22 of the Bill which deals with discoveries and innovations. I apologise if I mispresent her but she seemed to suggest that it would be a good thing if intellectual property rights, that is, the right to patent and develop a patent, rather than being vested in the institute were vested in those researchers involved in the institute's activities.  The Deputy seemed to suggest that this would be a very good perk for some of those researchers.  As a taxpayer I would have to take a different view.  If the institute or any other Government agency initiate and pay for research the people are entitled to reap the benefits which should not be regarded as a perk for any public servant.  That may be an unpopular thought but the taxpayers, if paying for the research, should reap the profits which may accrue.</P>
    <P>While the Bill before us obviously has my enthusiastic and wholehearted support, in closing I would like to put the thought in the Minister's mind that he should see this as the beginning rather than the end of the process.  It should be the Minister's intention to trawl for new activities for the institute and the Department of the Marine.  I was struck when researching the Fianna Fáil policy document on the marine in 1984 by the number of State Departments and agencies with marine related functions. Equally, marine research is secreted away in some odd nooks and crannies in various Government and non-governmental institutions.</P>
    <P>A good deal of research is now being undertaken by the private sector and, despite the arrival on the scene of the Department of the Marine, research <Col N="1393" /> which clearly has a marine connotation is initiated by other Ministries.  For example, to take an area I did not cover in my contribution, marine leisure activities still find a home in either the Department of the Environment or the Department of Tourism and Transport, mainly because the functions of one Department overlap the functions of another quite frequently. Inevitably this will also prove to be the case when it comes to research.  While some overlapping is inevitable too much can prove to be wasteful and will lead to the emergence of a grey area which may be ignored by everybody.  I hope the Minister touches on this aspect when replying.</P>
    <P>I believe very strongly that the flexible institutional approach adopted in the Bill will facilitate the expansion of the activities of the Marine Institute in the future. It will also set up an institute which will be devoid of the territoriality of existing institutions.  If we can set up a marine institute which can establish for itself the right to dip in and out of what is being done in the various parts of the Government machine we will be doing a very good day's work indeed because we will be creating an institution which is sufficiently flexible to respond to any new need that arises.  Take, for example, the problem of coastal erosion we had in County Wicklow.  Thankfully in recent times the matter of coastal erosion has been transferred from the Office of Public Works, where it was largely ignored, to the Department of the Marine where there exists only a very small budget for dealing with this problem. There are ongoing experiments right around the world as to how to address the issue of coastal erosion.  I would see the Marine Institute as being able to produce researched documentation as to what is being done elsewhere so that we could address our own problems in the most cost effective way.  By dipping into that research we may come up with other things in terms of marine development, of what would be useful and provide a catalyst for the private sector too.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to question the bona fides of the contributions made by others here <Col N="1394" /> today but I believe that if they reflect on what they said they will see that the institutional arrangements being adopted here, while they are new, should be welcomed. The only thing I have to say to the Minister is that he see this as a beginning, not as an end.  The overall aims of this Bill are admirable.  The approach on the institutional side I see as very welcome.  All in all any fairminded observer would come to the same conclusion as I have done, that this Bill is a job well done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Representing a maritime constituency and coming from a family whose members have given a lifetime in the service of Irish Lights, it is appropriate that I should offer for the benefit of the nation a few thoughts on this fundamentally important Bill.</P>
      <P>I have no great difficulty in accepting the proposals of the Minister in regard to the Marine Institute.  In theory the Bill is correct.  But it is over-ruled by the Minister for Finance of the day.  Much will depend on the clout of the Minister for the Marine and his ability to persuade the Department of Finance to provide the resources for the Marine Institute so that it can sometimes do its work.</P>
      <P>What the Minister said in introducing the Bill is very broad in content and does not differ radically from what he said in the Seanad.  Probably some paragraphs have been rearranged on the word processor. The Minister said &ldquo;the oceans are the last frontier, the least known part of our planet&rdquo; but went on to say &ldquo;it is only recently that their multifarious role has been fully comprehended&rdquo;.  It seems contradictory to say that their role is fully comprehended but that they are still the least known part of our planet.  If the Minister had made these two statements together in the Seanad they would not have emerged again for the benefit of the Members of this House here.  It is one of the least known areas of the planet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister went on to say that Ireland's marine area is very large in comparison with that of other European nations.  That is a wise statement indeed. Vice President Quayle, when he was put <Col N="1395" /> in charge of space research said that we generally think space is very big, that in fact we think it is infinite.  That was a wise statement, too.</P>
    <P>What the Minister said covered a wide area and was very general in content.  He set out the aspirations for the Marine Institute over the next decades in an attempt to envisage what the institute could become.  He outlined the main areas of work the institute will involve itself in.  One wonders what the role of Roinn na Mara will be when these areas of work are passed to the institute for marine research.  The Minister says that the institute will provide advice on policy relating to marine research and development. That is fundamental.  It is to carry out policy on marine research and development but what is Government policy on marine research and development? That is a largely unknown area at present.  I suppose it was to find out what Government policy should be that the Department of the Marine were set up in the first place.  The institute, we understand, is to undertake, develop, promote and market marine research and development services &mdash; that is fair &mdash; and it is to promote and assist the improvement, development and application of technical and other processes for the exploitation and development of marine resources.  That is critical and I will refer to it later in the context of the developments taking place around our coasts.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to tell us that the institute will collect, maintain and disseminate information in relation to marine matters.  That is very important for people who might be interested in providing finance for people to go into the marine business under joint ventures, private enterprise and so on.  The production of data bases and that kind of information is very worthy.  The institute, too, is to co-ordinate proposals for marine research and development requiring funding from the Exchequer or from any State owned or controlled body. Does that mean that the chief executive officer of the Marine Institute, a very important person to be appointed in <Col N="1396" /> charge of this body, will merely become a lobbyist continuously scrounging for moneys both from the Minister for the Marine and ultimately from the Minister for Finance?</P>
    <P>We have had a great tendency here over the years to set up committees, task forces and other organisations, appoint chief executive officers and various staff, administrative and otherwise, who invariably end up producing very fine documents but have not a scintilla of money to implement their recommendations. One finds a continuous stream of chief executive officers passing through the corridors of this House, lobbying representatives of the parties in power for funding to implement their programmes.  The reference to the amount of money for this institute is a clear indication that it is not to be given the priority that is warranted.  We are now three quarters of the way through the Green Presidency of the EC.  Every speech covering every country in the world refers to the green Presidency and the necessity to develop our resources. What the Minister said goes beyond that and is very broad, but the reference to money for the Marine Institute is minimal.</P>
    <P>I note that the institute may, in addition, represent the State in European Community programmes of marine research and development, that it may commission from other persons work to be carried out under the direction of the institute, enter into joint ventures so as to undertake or further the application of marine research and development, promote and organise seminars, conferences, lectures or demonstrations relating to marine research and development &mdash; I assume these would not be the kind that take place in the street.  That is very important for the provision of information for people so that the confusion that abounds at present with regard to fish farming and so on would be cleared up and people's minds put at ease.</P>
    <P>The institute is to engage in international activities in marine research and development.  I understand that under <Col N="1397" /> section 4 the institute may represent the Government abroad on the instructions of the Minister and with the co-operation of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>Over the years I have listened to speakers complaining about the emissions from Sellafield into the Irish Sea. Obviously, if the Marine Institute are engaged in international marine research and development, with the permission of the Minister and with the co-operation of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, they could consider this subject too.  On 12 March 1986, when the Taoiseach was speaking on nuclear energy and Sellafield he said:</P>
    <P>The dispersal of plutonim into the atmosphere or into the sea could have widespread catastrophic consequences would for all intents and purposes last forever. </P>
    <P>I think this is fundamentally critical to the work the institute may carry out in conjunction with the other agencies.  The Taoiseach said it was very necessary that the Government would directly confront the British Government on Sellafield and demand its closure.  If we are true to the &ldquo;Green&rdquo; Presidency as we say, we should be using the power and the prestige of this office to ensure that we make some advances in preventing the discharge of plutonium into the Irish Sea.  My constituency colleague, the Minister for the Environment, said in the Hague on 7 March 1990: &ldquo;Radioactive waste disposal in the maritime environment had been a cause of considerable public concern in recent years and the 1987 North Sea Quality Status Report indicated that the Sellafield plant was a major source of radioactive pollution in the North Sea.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He then asked how much more was the impact on the Irish sea.  The Minister then said: &ldquo;We acknowledge that there has been a reduction in discharges in recent years.  Notwithstanding this decrease, the Irish Government believe that the only real solution to the threat presented by Sellafield is the closure of the plant.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Indeed the Minister for the Environment said at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis <Col N="1398" /> that &ldquo;Our seas are going to be clean.  As never before...&rdquo; I wonder whether he had a vision of what the Marine Institute would be able to do in this regard?  He also said: &ldquo;We want Sellafield closed, and we won't stop until we see it closed.  For good...&rdquo; '</P>
    <P>The Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, said that &ldquo;Nuclear countries must recognise the legitimate concerns of their non-nuclear neighbour&rdquo;.  Carrying as he does the very important portfolio in this temporary little arrangement that runs the country at present, I think that is critical to this aspect of the Marine Institute's development.  In a <i>Sunday Press</i> interview of September 1978, Deputy O'Malley, the leader of the Progressive Democrats and Minister for Industry and Commerce, said: &ldquo;A nuclear station will in fact be safer than a coal fired station and will be better in terms of cleanliness...for health and for the environment&rdquo;. He also said that in Britain experts had established that radiation from nuclear power plants was smaller than that created by medical appliances. He finished by saying in relation to the proposal at that time to provide a nuclear plant in this country, &ldquo;I cannot defer decisions, the effect of which would leave this country short of electricity in ten years time&rdquo;.  That speaks for itself.  If the Marine Institute is to have the capacity to represent the country in international activities, we need a co-ordinated policy.</P>
    <P>In the course of his address the Minister referred to the staffing of the institute. He said: &ldquo;Following the establishment of the institute, the persons involved may be transferred from their parent Departments to the Department of the Marine and thence to the Marine Institute&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; means there have to be negotiation and consultation with the personnel involved. This differs from what the Minister said in the Seanad, Official Report at column 1555 of 5 April 1990:</P>
    <P>Following the establishment of the institute the persons involved will be <Col N="1399" /> transferred from their parent Departments to the Department of the Marine and then to the Marine Institute. </P>
    <P>It appears that a decision had been taken on 5 April that people would be transferred from their parent Departments to the Marine Institute.</P>
    <P>I accept the theory behind the formation of the Marine Institute.  The theory, as stated in the Minister's address, is correct.  However, we are a long way from achieving the practicalities of the objective outlined in his address. The ability of the institute to carry out research and development in both technology and construction is important.</P>
    <P>The Irish fishing fleet is very much out of line with the fishing fleets in other countries and in the context of the size of our coastal area, it is completely under-funded and unable to compete with our economically stronger neighbours.  The number of currachs, hookers and yawls has diminished over the past 50 years, except for specialised courses or people with a specific interest in these types of boats.  There has been a small revival of interest in them in recent years.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that some of the regional colleges conduct courses in marine activities.  BIM, for instance, regularly advertise courses for deck hands and other marine jobs.  One has to have a respect for the smaller fishermen how have to compete for their livelihood off our coasts.  The inshore fishermen on half deckers on the west coast have to deal with swells and Atlantic storms.  It would be impossible for anyone except those who have worked with them to understand the dangers they meet in making a living.</P>
    <P>The task force set up under the Inland Fisheries Board recommended that a certain length of monofilament net would be legalised for inshore fishermen.  This issue should be addressed by the Department of the Marine.  It has been put on the famous backburner, which is a bit crowded.  If it is legal to buy monfilament net and mount it on the deck and use it to fish around the rocks for white fish, <Col N="1400" /> then a decision should be taken by the Department to legalise the length recommended in the report or a length acceptable to the Department.  Something should be done about it rather than have the inshore fishermen fighing among themselves year in year out and having to deal with the fishery protection vessels and larger trawlers cutting across their nets.  It is grossly unfair that fishermen in one part of the country can legally use several thousand metres of monofilament nets during a longer season whereas in other locations it is illegal and they can be dealt with by the fisheries protection vessels.</P>
    <P>It is up to the Department of the Marine to make a decision in this regard. They should legalise the net at a particular length and should not allow the law to be flouted as regularly as are the litter laws.  Offshore fishing has been neglected for decades.  Apart from involvement by private enterprise &mdash; some of the larger trawlers have been mentioned by other Deputies &mdash; nothing much has been brought about by Government action over the years.  I hope the institute will be given the resources to help develop the potential that is there.</P>
    <P>Obviously fish quotas are fundamental to the livelihood of every fisherman.  This matter depends upon the ability of the Minister for the Marine of the day to deal with his counterparts in Brussels.  We have always spoken about acting to our strengths and working on our best resoruces. The Minister points out that we have a huge area of water around our coasts in comparison with out European neighbours, and therefore there is no reason why this area of development should not be given a much higher priority by successive Governments.  As the Minister said, other countries have much more information avaialble to them about our waters than we have ourselves.</P>
    <P>Blacksod at eveningtime can look like New York harbour, with the lights of foreign trawlers from ouside the territorial limit.  The Minister for the Marine should be in a position, on account of our natural geographical advantage in terms of location and in terms of water available <Col N="1401" /> to us, to get a better deal for our fishermen. If resources are not provided to develop our fishing fleet, those with a better catching capacity will move in, and have moved in on our waters to our detriment. As a community, we must fight for our rights.  I would like to think that the Government would give far greater priority to this matter in the context of the potential that is there and of the livelihoods of the people who fish off our coasts on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>Will the Marine Institute carry out research in the area of wave power?  We are in the Green Presidency and there is much talk about controlling pollution. There are several locations on the west coast in particular, some of which have four tides per day, with extremely strong currents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Two going in and two going out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to think that the institute would have the capacity to carry out research into wave power. Other countries are much more advanced in this regard.  It would be a very difficult job but it would be of advantage to us economically and would provide clean, efficient and everlasting power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other Deputies have referred to the effects of coastal erosion.  A report from Mayo County Council issued recently to the Departments of the Marine and the Environment states that it would cost over £6 million to carry out the necessary work to prevent sections of the county from being washed away.  In theory, we are talking about the creation and the development of the Marine Institute. What studies have been made on the effects of tides on and the silting up of harbours, which 70 years ago could carry quite extensive fleets of ships?  Many of the harbours have now silted up completely. One may blame the British for many of the things that have happened in this country over the centuries but many of the stone harbours which they built, after carrying out research on tidal effects, still stand and are in better condition than many of the newer piers and <Col N="1402" /> slipways built from funding by various Governments.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that it will cost over £1 million to carry out work on a road and a retaining wall in the Blacksod area of County Mayo.  I am sure there is not a snowball's chance in hell of anything like that sum being made available either to the county at large or to the specific location.  If something is not done within a few years, there will be a new island off the coast of Ireland.  If the Marine Institute are to deal with these matters, they should be given the resources to carry out studies into tidal effects, silting up of harbours, coastal erosion and so on rather than a mere floppy disc of words, which is often the case.</P>
    <P>I would like to think that the question of the Continental Shelf will be dealt with urgently by the Government.  We are in control of the EC at present, or at least some of our Ministers seem to think that is the case while they hold the chairmanships of the various ministries.  No application has yet been lodged in relation to the Continental Shelf and other countries are moving in on our areas.  The land is certainly an emotional issue in this country.  Try to split two patches of ground between two people and see what happens: it ends up in the High Court.  Yet, without standing up for what is legitimately ours, we seem to be handing over vast stretches of the Continental Shelf.  I would like to think that the Department of the Marine, the Cabinet and the Government will decide to do something about this and make their case for Ireland, as have other countries who have not the same resources in terms of sea quality or sea expanse.</P>
    <P>I hope the institute, in terms of research and development, will consider the question that has arisen over the last number of years on the west coast, that of seals.  Rogue seals in particular can devastate salmon catches caught legitimately by fishermen and create a great deal of nuisance and inconvenience.  I put down a question recently to the Minister for the Marine in regard to a supervised seal cull but he refused the cull on the basis that it was not feasible.  I do not <Col N="1403" /> want the situation to arise whereby the remains of seals that have either been shot or dealt with by people involved in the fishing industry are washed up on various parts of the shore.  That happened before and it may well happen again.  It is possible for fishermen to apply to the Department of the Marine for a licence to deal with rogue seals.  We cannot have every half-decker off the west coast loaded with shotguns and rifles to deal with rogue seals in the Atlantic.</P>
    <P>People interested in this matter carried out a vigil on the Inishkea Islands a number of years ago during the seal mating season.  If the Marine Institute are to deal with this matter they should communicate with their counterparts in Scotland because apparently many thousands of seals migrate from the Scottish coastline to the west coast on a yearly basis.  They cause disruption to nets and can devastate salmon catches which are the basis of the livelihoods of many of the smaller half-deck fishermen off the coast.</P>

I do not want to see fishermen dealing with the Department of the Marine for the remains of seals washed up on our shores, as happened a number of years ago.  Perhaps the Minister would take that into account.  I hope the institute would deal with their counterparts in Scotland and if Miss Bardot wants to give us any advice in that regard I would certainly be willing to listen to her.</P>

    <P>Deputies have referred to the billions of tonnes of sludge that have been <Col N="1404" /> pumped indiscriminately into our seas over the years &mdash; industrial waste, chemical waste and so on.  The farmers should be commended for their increased awareness of the effects of pollution in our rivers and seas.  Co-ordination is necessary between the Department of Agriculture and Food, the Department of the Marine and the Marine Institute.</P>
    <P>In relation to the headquarters, if the Minister is to deal &mdash; as in the case of the loaves and fishes &mdash; with every Deputy who has raised this issue then he should not be here.  Deputies want the headquarters to be situated in Bray, Dún Laoghaire, Arklow, Galway and Killybegs. When the next group of Deputies come in Cork, Kerr, Waterford, Dungarvan, and Dunmore East will no doubt be suggested.  I do not mind where the headquarters are situated provided it is not a gigantic structure of glass and steel where one gets lost around its corridors in search of the chief executive officers or any of his staff when making complaints about salmon licences, seal culls, pollution, Sellafield or whatever.  I would prefer if it was sited on the west coast but that is a decision which we on this side of the House cannot take at least not until this temporary arrangement ceases.</P>
    <P>I hope the institute would have the capacity to deal with the report, which is not before the Government, dealing with the claim of the West Coast Action Group for marine rescue services.  I am not sure that the institute would have a direct role in this but if it is dealing with amenity and tourist developments, then accidents are bound to happen.  The first priority should be to bring that report before the Cabinet and the Minister for the Marine should forcefully present these recommendations to the Taoiseach and see that they are carried out.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the decision to site a Dauphin helicopter at Shannon is welcome. If other long range craft are bought one should be sited at the Horan International Airport which has the necessary navigational facilities and being located midway between Donegal and Kerry can deal with off-shore long distance rescue activities.  If the money is made available, <Col N="1405" /> a second Dauphin helicopter should be stationed at Finner Camp to cater for the fishermen on the north coast.  As I said, that report should be brought before the Cabinet and decisions should be taken so that the institute would be in a position to do something about it.</P>
    <P>Various Deputies have referred to pollution and development of sea resources. The west coast is wide open to the power of the Atlantic Ocean.  Recently the Minister for Energy announced the Connemara oil field &mdash; I have referred to this previously in the House.  Whatever happened to the captain of the <i>Exxon Valdez</i> who destroyed more pristine coastline than any other maritime accident?</P>
    <P>If the Connemara oil field is developed and if a major accident involving a super tanker happens off the west coast, at present there is not one single local authority which has the ability to deal with any kind of spillage.  The institute, the Department of the Environment and the Department of the Marine together with the organisations in other countries that have dealt with oil spillages and clearances should have the basic technology and resources to cope with an accident which, thankfully has not yet happened, but which could happen at some future date.  Obviously that would take into account the destruction of thousands of beaches on the west coast, which would seriously impair the tourism and leisure areas referred to in the institute's brief for development.  It would seriously disrupt our challenge for doubling the number of tourists within the next five years and decrease the number of beaches where we have blue flags under the European Directives.</P>
    <P>These things are all very important but we are only tinkering around with the system and piling layers of words upon volumes of words without actually doing anything about it.  It is all very well to give a £2,000 grant to put a roof on a thatched cottage, and it looks very well but if the local authorities from Malin Head to Mizen Head are unable to deal with the thousands of gallons of oil that may spill on to our shores this institute <Col N="1406" /> will not deal with these problems.  That is not why this institute is being set up. These are not the objectives outlined in the Minister's speech.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have referred to fish farming development.  As this is the responsibility of the Department of the Marine a clear statement of where we stand in this regard should be made for the benefit of everybody.  There are too many people travelling to too many meetings who are misinformed, uninformed or make statements that cannot be substantiated. If it is the policy of the Government on the one hand to develop resources in fish farming then so be it but if it is the policy of the Government on the other hand to develop tourism so be it.  However, there must be a common denominator where the development of a resource, such as fish farming, will not impair unduly the environment and the quality of life our people enjoy.</P>
    <P>In an article in <i>The Irish Skipper,</i> May 1990, it is stated that next year the Norwegians intend to moor ten kilometres off their coast a salmon farm which will have a yearly output larger than the total Irish catch of wild salmon. The Norwegians have been involved in salmon research and fish research for years longer than Ireland.  Their facility will have a capacity of 282,000 cubic metres, and will be up to 35 times larger than any existing Norwegian fish farm.</P>
    <P>In Ireland we are in our infancy in terms of fish farming development. Unfortunately, it got off to a very bad start because there are series of meetings around the country where aspects of fish farming have been raised that are unclear.  It is very necessary that a clear statement of where the Government stand in this regard be issued for the benefit of everyone.  Do the Government intend to consider fish farming?  If so, let them say so.  If it is going to impinge unduly on tourism potential or the lives of ordinary people this has to be dealt with.  In the <i>New Scientist</i> of 26 August 1989 the issue of the chemical pesticide Nuvan 500 was dealt with.  I have to say to the Minister for the Marine that fish farming will be seriously impaired in <Col N="1407" /> terms of Government objectives if matters are not cleared up in relation to this pesticide.  The article states that biologists have found that an increasing number of wild salmon and other fish are developing cataracts, and they link the epidemic of eye disease with the use of the pesticide.</P>

      <P>The Central Bank is primarily responsible for the operation of monetary policy including the regulation of credit and interest rates.  Its monetary policy statement for 1990 dated 28 February does not impose any credit restrictions. It indicates that overall credit growth of around 10 per cent seems likely this year and that slow growth of resources is an important issue for banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the latest banking statistics published on 3 May show that during the first quarter of 1990 the balance between bank resources and the demand for credit improved significantly.  During the year to 30 March 1990 private sector credit grew by marginally less than in 1989 while non-Government bank deposits grew by 10.6 per cent, over four times the 1989 growth rate of 2.5 per cent.  During the same period shares and deposits with building societies grew by 7 per cent compared with 5.9 per cent in 1989.  The March banking statistics also show that private sector credit is growing at almost <Col N="1408" /> twice the annual rate projected for nominal GNP this year and that during March the banks added further to their excess holdings of secondary liquid assets.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the latest banking statistics published by the Central Bank suggest that liquidity improved significantly during the first three months of this year and that the banks and building societies have adequate scope to finance lending to the private sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of that.  I would be surprised if there is any shortage of credit because bank credit is growing at almost twice the growth rate projected for nominal GNP this year, that is 14.4 per cent compared with 7.4 per cent.  More than adequate liquidity was available in the first quarter of this year and it has improved significantly.  It is not marginal.  It is, quite significantly, four times the 1989 growth rate, 10.6 per <Col N="1409" /> cent this year as against 2.5 per cent last year.  The banks themselves are holding liquid assets over and above what is required, so there is no justification for what the Deputy is saying as far as the evidence available to me suggests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take Questions Nos. 2 and 13 together.</P>
      <P>As I said in my budget speech the Government's aim in 1990 is to consolidate the reduction in staff numbers achieved in recent years and to effect further economies through improved efficency and better management.</P>
      <P>As a result of the restrictions on recruitment to the Civil Service and wider public service which have been in force since the 1987 budget, as well as the availability of voluntary early retirement, numbers employed in the public service &mdash; including local authorities &mdash; have fallen by about 20,000 from 1987 levels to the present level of approximately 196,000.</P>
      <P>While the fall in numbers has had the desired effect of containing the cost of the public service pay bill, the Government still consider it essential to maintain for a further period the policy of containment. Within this framework.  I see some scope for the filling of certain vacancies which may arise where so doing will lead to benefits to the Exchequer which are immediate, significant and continuing and which cannot be otherwise attained.  Limited recruitment may, therefore, be permitted to fill key vacancies in areas of particular need subject to the approval of the Minister for Finance in the case of Civil Service vacancies and subject to the approval of the relevant Minister and the Minister for Finance in the remainder of the public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the scope of the career break scheme has been extended and future vacancies under this scheme can be filled where this is required by the needs of the work.  These elements should generate significant employment opportunities. Any recruitment will, of course, be at much more junior levels than those <Col N="1411" /> at which persons took early retirement. Therefore there is not, and there will not be, any question of replacement of staff who were paid enhanced terms to leave the service.  There can be no question of undermining the savings already achieved.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, it is the responsibility of the Commission to bring forward proposals in this area.  Last year the Commission revised its earlier 1987 proposals on harmonisation of VAT and excises and submitted a new set of proposals which have been the basis for discussion in the Council of Ministers and in the various groups reporting to the Council.</P>
      <P>As a result a broad framework agreement on VAT was reached last December. This agreement was designed to achieve some convergence in VAT rates while leaving open the precise rates to apply in 1993 and the classification of items which would be subject to the standard and reduced rates.</P>
      <P>While the timetable does not provide for decisions until end-1991, the Irish Presidency has been pressing ahead with the follow-up work on such matters as coverage of the reduced VAT rates.  We have also undertaken detailed discussions on the new excise proposals on mineral oils, alcohols and tobacco.</P>
      <P>Progress on settling the shape of the detailed VAT regime for exports and imports has been hindered by the absence of Commission proposals on the necessary technical controls which will be required to be implemented following the abolition of fiscal frontiers.  These have just been finalised and will be presented formally to the June ECOFIN Council meeting.</P>
      <P>While progress has been slow, the Deputy will appreciate the sensitive economic and budgetary issues involved for all member states and the need, at the end of the day, for a unanimous agreement.  We will continue to do everything possible to advance matters during the remainder of our Presidency, because of the importance of tax approximation for the completion of the internal market.</P>

      <P>Relief from income <Col N="1415" /> tax and corporation tax for investment in urban renewal was introduced by sections 41 to 45 of the Finance Act, 1986.  The specific reliefs consist of (1) capital allowances for commercial buildings, (2) a double rent allowance for lessees and (3) an allowance for owner occupiers equal to half of the cost of construction or refurbishment of private dwellings.</P>
      <P>It is in the nature of these reliefs that there will be a time-lag between their introduction and the incurring of a cost to the Exchequer.  Accordingly, no relief was allowed in the tax year 1986-87 and one claim for relief was allowed in the tax year 1987-88 at an insignificant cost to the Exchequer.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that corresponding figures for claims in later years are not available.</P>
      <P>However, using information supplied by the Department of the Environment on the construction costs of 158 new commercial projects completed at 30 January 1990, the Revenue Commissioners tentatively estimate that, viewed in isolation, the cost over time in tax foregone could ultimately be of the order of £25 million in respect of the capital allowances associated with the construction costs of those projects.  This cost will rise as developments currently in progress are completed, and as projects are undertaken in the recently announced newly designated areas.</P>
      <P>No information is available on the likely cost of the other elements in the urban renewal package, that is, the double rent allowance and the owner-occupier allowance.  Statistics could not be obtained without incurring disproportionate cost.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister saying that the Government have gone blind into this project without giving any thought to what is involved?  Taking into account that the scheme is so broadly based, it may be that virtually all the development that will take place will be confined to those areas alone at a massive cost to the Exchequer.  It should be remembered that that cost will have to be picked up by the taxpayer.  Will the Minister explain to taxpayers how some open-ended figure which has not been calculated even in approximate terms will be lost to the Exchequer?  Will he explain the implications of that for Exchequer funding over the next three, five and seven years?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is living in an unreal world if he thinks that one can put an accurate cost on something that may or may not happen.  If one was to interpret the scheme the way he has, every area that has been designated would be developed to its full potential but that has not been the experience to date.  Many of the areas that were designated have not been developed.  The whole purpose behind this scheme was to get derelict parts of our cities and urban areas improved and encourage people to return to live there.  The scheme has been successful in some areas but not in others. New areas have been chosen to try to give an impetus to the scheme.  The only reliable estimate available from the Revenue Commissioners so far from the 158 projects which I mentioned in my reply is £25 million approximately.  The payoff for the Government, the Exchequer and <Col N="1417" /> the taxpayer will come from the number of jobs that can be put on a permanent footing in the areas which have been developed.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>the reason for the 33 per cent increase in Exchequer borrowing for the first three months of this year compared to the same period in 1989.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase in Exchequer borrowing for the first three months of this year compared to the same period in 1989 was due to a number of special factors.  These were as follows: delays in European Social Fund receipts; higher than anticipated health expenditure due to the impact of the increased incidence of influenza in the early part of the year and to a greater than usual run-down in health board overdraft facilities; and a disruption in the flow of revenues from training and employment levy, due to an industrial dispute which has since been resolved.</P>
      <P>As I explained in the press release which accompanied the end-March Exchequer returns and again in my Second Stage Finance Bill speech, the timing factors should correct themselves as the year progresses.  When they are discounted, the underlying picture shows that Exchequer borrowing for the first three months of 1990 was broadly in line with the budget forecast.</P>
      <P>However, there is no room for complacency in regard to the public finances and, as I have already said, the Government will be monitoring trends closely over the remainder of the year in the light of developments at home and abroad to ensure that the budget targets are achieved again in this year.</P>

      <P>How can the Minister say that the returns for the first quarter &mdash; which appear to be 89 per cent of the annual target &mdash; are on target when at the same stage last year they were only 66 per cent of the annual target?  These figures show that the Minister is running way ahead of himself.  Does he not agree that there could be another 'flu epidemic or some other problem in the health service, which can arise at any time, and that the best course of action is for him to give proper funding to the health service at the beginning of the year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to give the <Col N="1424" /> Deputy and the House information which will help to bring the figures closer together.  The misalignment between expenditure and revenue during the first three months arose in part because of the delay involved in the pay-over of training and employment receipts due to an industrial dispute in the Department of Labour.  This dispute gave rise to arrears of £17 million which should have been in during that quarter but were not.  These receipts have now been received into the Exchequer.  That item has been corrected.</P>
      <P>On the expenditure side, two main factors affected the first quarter supply issues: a delay in European Social Fund receipts amounting to £33.5 million relating to third level education &mdash; which were expected and budgeted for in the March quarter, and these receipts are expected in the next week or so &mdash; this is another self-correcting item &mdash; higher than anticipated expenditure on health, reflecting the impact of the 'flu epidemic at the beginning of 1990, and the financing operations of the health agencies in the first quarter.  They ran down their over-drafts to an exceptional degree of £30 million more than normal to put themselves in a stronger position negotiating with the banks and transferring some of their interest charges from the health boards back onto the Exchequer.  This too will correct itself throughout the year.</P>
      <P>The end of April figures show a recovery from the position at the end of March. If the Deputy adds up all the figures I have given him and then looks at the April figures he will see that the EBR at the end of April amounted to £379 million as against £429 million for the first four months of 1989.  The correcting measures are there, and I can assure the Deputy and the House that if any corrective action is required during the year it will be taken.</P>

      <P>In November 1989 applications were invited from those members of the staff of the office of the Revenue Commissioners who were interested in transferring to the Collector General's Office with a view to relocating in Limerick and a number of officers volunteered. There was a shortfall in the total number required and, as is the practice in the case of all centres included in <Col N="1427" /> the decentralisation programme, applications for transfer have been sought from other Departments or offices.  This request issued in early April and applications are currently being processed by the personnel branch, Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  It is not possible to say at this stage how many will transfer but given that this is the centre receiving the largest section of the Civil Service, a shortfall in the number required is likely. When all applications have been processed steps will be taken to make up any shortfall, as was done in the case of locations included in the earlier stages of the programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that, with the increasing demand for venison, many poachers are killing to order for restaurants or hotels, finding outlets through wildlife game dealers who pay in the region of £60 to £70 per car-case; that the lamping of the deer is carried out mainly by hunters in possession of licences provided by the State?  Would the Minister agree that the Wildlife Act, 1976, warrants amendment and strengthening in a number of ways including increased penalty clauses?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly I am aware of the many illegal practices at present in this area.  As the Deputy will be aware, there are some wildlife rangers also in the Wicklow area.  However, that is not adequate to deal with the position which is steadily getting out of hand.  We are examining the overall position to ascertain whether it would be possible to obtain greater co-operation from all the authorities and agencies with responsibility in this area.  In regard to revision of the Wildlife Act, 1976, I should say we are at present drafting amendments which would substantially strengthen many of its provisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed that the Minister, in recognising the degree of poaching taking place and his concern about it, still reckons he can contain it with present staffing levels.  Is the Minister not concerned that there is no limit to the deer that can be bagged by licensed hunters who can then offload their surpluses for £60 to £70, converting what was formerly a sport into a business? Futhermore, would he agree that there is no control over the various species killed, that is the red deer, the Sika deer or the hybrids on the mountains?  Would the Minister agree that the red deer species is now threatened, should be protected, and that a quota system by way of tagging should be introduced for hunters?  Is the Minister aware that red deer can be killed and bagged by hunters just as easily as the Sika deer, an endangered species which should be protected, which could best be done by issuing tags to hunters when their kills can be monitored?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>We are at present carrying out a thorough examination of the whole area to ascertain how we can tighten the legislation and relevant regulations to deal with this issue.  One matter in need of examination is how we can deploy staff to ensure that the regulations &mdash; strictly covered under the provisions of the Wildlife Act, 1976 &mdash; can be fully implemented.  In relation to tagging, I <Col N="1432" /> should say we need the back-up of legislation. But it is almost impossible to reach agreement generally to have this type of legislation passed.  All Members will have had experience of how difficult it is to pass legislation or regulations here which will adequately deal with poachers.</P>

      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works originally proposed to demolish the north and south wings, to restore the castle and open it to the public.  Dublin County Council, who own the north wing and some surrounding land, withheld their agreement to these proposals as they considered that it would be possible for them to formulate a joint proposal with Bord Fáilte for an appropriate use of the castle and two wings.  This proposal has not yet been received by the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to comments made by various delegates at the annual conference of the Tax Officials' Branch of UPTCS at their conference in Tralee on 3/4 March on the continuing extent of tax evasion and particularly the lack of adequate staff and resources in the Revenue Commissioners to ensure adequate audits of return from the self-employed; the measures, if any, he intends to take to deal with tax evasion; if it is intended to provide additional staff for the Revenue Commissioners; and if he will make a statment on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the allegations regarding tax evasion made by speakers at the recent conference of the Tax Officials Branch of UPTCS in Tralee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, and always has been, a fundamental objective of the Revenue Commissioners to collect the proper amount of tax due at the least cost to the public. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that measures to combat tax evasion are kept under continuous review and that there has been a significant redeployment of Revenue resources in recent years into areas directly concerned <Col N="1434" /> with combating evasion and other forms of non-compliance with the tax code.</P>
    <P>Self-assessment is progressively releasing resources to concentrate on non-compliant taxpayers.  Immediately after the introduction of self-assessment and the tax incentive scheme, the Revenue Commissioners gave priority, in using their new resources, to a programme designed to assist the Collector-General to tackle taxpayers who had not availed of the amnesty and also to clear the backlog of appeals and other work for years up to the introduction of self-assessment.</P>
    <P>Progress in these areas was sufficiently advanced to enable the Revenue Commissioners to commence a revenue audit programme in late 1989.  Audits commenced in Dublin in the week beginning 6 November, in Cork and Limerick in the week beginning 21 November and in all other country tax districts in the week beginning 27 November or 4 December. Initially, 17 inspectors were involved in carrying out audits.  The number of adult inspectors was increased to 32 in January 1990.  It is intended that the number will be further significantly increased in the course of the year.  The Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that they have the staff resources necessary to ensure the implementation of a successful revenue audit programme.</P>
    <P>In addition to the audit programme, a compliance programme, to ensure that all persons in receipt of taxable income file a return of income, is now operational in all districts.  In recent weeks in Dublin, 22 officers have been nominated for this purpose making a total of 68 officers involved in compliance work.</P>
    <P>The return of income is one of the cornerstones of a self-assessment system. In consequence, those taxpayers who do not meet their statutory obligation in this respect are being vigorously pursued and will, if necessary, be prosecuted.</P>
    <P>I have recently sanctioned the filling of some key posts in the taxes inspectorate in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that self assessment is allowing <Col N="1435" /> him release resources to concentrate on non-compliant taxpayers.  While I am concerned about the level of non-compliance I am also worried about self assessment.  Only about 2 per cent of accounts are audited.  Is the Minister satisfied that this figure will be considerably increased following the introduction of self assessment which it has been alleged provides a safe haven for tax evaders given the failure to carry out audits?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the release of the resources made possible following the introduction of self assessment I have also sanctioned the filling of 18 key posts in the inspectorate and office of the Revenue Commissioners as follows: ten inspectors, six inspectors on a higher grade, one senior inspector and a principal inspector.  I am satisfied that the level of audits undertaken will be increased substantially as the year goes on.  For the information of the Deputy and the House, as of 31 March 153 audits had been finalised which yielded an additional liability of £1,057,000 and a further four cases had been referred to the investigations branch for detailed examination. In one of these cases a payment on account of £200,000 has been made and in another 77 cases an inspector had completed his or her audit and was awaiting the taxpayer's agreement on counter proposals to the audit findings.  A further 85 audits have been initiated.  The number of audits completed to date is too small relative to the entire amount to permit any definitive conclusions to be drawn as regards the general level of compliance. It should also be borne in mind that the investigations branch, the special inquiry branch, the PAYE-employers inspection section, the VAT inspection unit, the construction industry section and the joint Revenue-Social Welfare investigation branch all make an impact in combating tax evasion and avoidance.</P>

      <P>The investigations branch is staffed by inspectors and accountants who specialise in anti-evasion work.  I have no doubt the Revenue Commissioners keep very close to their chest the manner in which they carry out special investigations and the criteria they employ.  They employ accountants to help inspectors in carrying out the work the Deputy has referred to.</P>

      <P>Interest rates are influenced by a variety of factors, including domestic economic conditions and movements internationally in interest and exchange rates.  In the circumstances, it is not the practice to provide forecasts of future trends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The economic and monetary terms of the draft treaty on the creation of a <Col N="1437" /> common German economic and monetary area were finalised only last week and remain to be ratified.  Commentators vary their assessments of the implications of these terms for Germany and the rest of the EC.  However, the German Government, supported by the Bundesbank, is confident that German economic and monetary union will not have adverse repercussions on interest rates in Germany nor, by implication, the EC.</P>
    <P>I share the confidence of my German colleagues and would add that, in current circumstances, there is no reason to believe that, if there were an unexpected increase in German interest rates, it would lead to a corresponding increase in other EMS countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to make forecasts.  The Minister in his reply stated that the German Government are confident that the progress towards German unity will not affect interest rates.  One would expect the German Government to say this to allay fears but would the Minister inform the House, apart from the statements of the German Government, what he has to go on trying to forecast what effect German unity will have on interest rates?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just returned from Washington where I attended a meeting of the World Bank and the IMF at which various views were expressed and discussions took place on the question the Deputy has just raised.  It transpired that the spokespersons for the Bundesbank were surprised and rather annoyed that such pessimistic forecasts have been appearing consistently in various sections of the media in recent months.  In their view there are no foundations for these.  The Deputy will have noticed that in recent weeks some of our partners in the EMS, including the French and Belgian Governments, have begun to reduce their interest rates, albeit by small amounts, and this would not indicate that they expect the Germans to increase their interest rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not <Col N="1438" /> agree that we should set about reducing our interest rates which are altogether too high in real terms, that the differential between the rate of inflation and the rate of interest at 8 per cent or 9 per cent is way above what it ought to be and that this has resulted in real hardship being caused?  What does the Minister intend to do about this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy and the House will appreciate, monetary policy is the responsibility of the Central Bank but I can inform the House that there have been much more favourable capital inflows in recent months and that reserves are in a much stronger position than they were.  I, as well as every other Member in this House, would like to see interest rates being reduced but the instrument of interest rates seems to have a slightly different use to the one it used to have some years ago when it was used to bring down inflation.  It now appears to have a dual purpose in that it is used to stop the flow of capital from one country to another.  Therefore the sooner everybody we trade with within the Community are within the EMS the better as this will lead to stability.</P>

      <P>The subregional advisory and working groups were established by the Government to assist in the preparation of the National Development Plan.

The Community Support Framework subsequently adopted by the EC Commission, to govern the provision of Structural Fund aid to Ireland, specifically provides for the establishment of subregional review committees.  The subregional review committees will broadly comprise the previous subregional advisory and working groups.  The subregional review committees will be regularly informed and consulted about the implementation of Structural Fund aided measures in, or significantly affecting, the subregions concerned.

      <P>Discussions on economic and monetary union within the European Community are centred on the Delors report which envisages a three stage transition towards union.  The first stage, which is due to begin on 1 July, will involve completion of the Single Market, improved economic and social cohesion, greater monetary co-operation, improved surveillance of economic and budgetary policies and participation of all currencies in the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discussion has started on the timing and content of the later stages, which will lead ultimately to full union and an intergovernmental conference to prepare for this is due to convene in December. <Col N="1443" /> There are differing opinions about the best approach to full integration and the structures that will be needed to achieve this objective.  It is too early to predict the likely outcome of the conference. There is strong majority support, however, for the general approach put forward in the Delors report, including the establishment of a European central bank, permanently fixed exchange rates and convergence of economic policies.</P>
    <P>As there are no proposals on the later stages of EMU, nor on its final shape, before Council as yet, the question of a study of their implications does not arise.

An intergovernmental conference will be called in December to look at the ways and means by which it will be approached by member states.  There is more than one aspect of EMU around at the moment.  It is even suggested that Britain may have another alternative paper to <Col N="1444" /> put to Council or maybe the intergovernmental conference in relation to what they see as their approach.</P>
      <P>There is little doubt in any of our minds but that we will benefit from stage one because it brings with it improved economic and social cohesion, greater monetary co-operation, improved surveillance of economic and budgetary policies and participation of all currencies in the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS. That is part of stage one and to complete stage one Britain must join the ERM. We would all welcome that because that would bring stability.</P>
      <P>In relation to stages two and three, it is premature to talk about evaluating what the repercussions might be until it becomes more clear what people are really talking about in relation to stages two and three and some member states have different views from others in relation to it.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer's tax free allowances for 1989-90 were reduced because he had originally been given relief in respect of life assurance premiums in excess of the maximum allowable.</P>
      <P>The taxpayer called to the office on 9 October 1989 to query the reduction. Due to an oversight the officer on duty initially considered that the taxpayer's allowances should not have been reduced.  On further investigation after the taxpayer had left the office, it became clear that the reduced allowances were correct.  The taxpayer was advised that the reduced allowances were correct by letter on 13 October 1989.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>There are several aspects to the Government's strategy to accelerate job creation and increase employment.  Responsible macroeconomic management has been, and remains, a central element of that strategy. It is being complemented by continuing structural reforms and a comprehensive set of sectoral development plans.  The programmes being implemented with the support of the European Community's Structural Funds will also contribute to that objective.</P>
      <P>The Government's macroeconomic policies are designed to secure sustainable economic growth, which is the key to faster job-creation.  Exchequer borrowing has been kept well within the targets established in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the 1990 budget emphasises the Government's commitment to adhere to responsible fiscal policies over the medium-term.  In parallel, we are seeking to improve the competitiveness of the economy and to promote the expansion of its productive capacity.  The income tax and VAT changes announced in the 1990 budget will reduce costs and inflation, further strengthen our competitiveness and help to underpin the pay moderation which is of such vital importance for job creation and the avoidance of job losses.  The Public Capital Programme for 1990 is up by 20 per cent, which will help reinforce the strong recovery in private investment already under way, and contribute to a more efficient and competitive economy over the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The success of the Government's economic strategy can be seen in the strong growth in output, in exports and in investment. These, in turn, have underpinned a recovery in domestic demand which <Col N="1446" /> also contributed to the improved employment trend.  The substantial increase in the number of self-sustaining jobs is clear evidence that the Government's policies are working.</P>
    <P>The progress report by the Central Review Committee on the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> published last February, shows that, to date, job-creation targets have been met.  Over 60,000 jobs were created in the two years 1988 and 1989 and, as the report also indicates, the pace of job creation accelerated in 1989.</P>
    <P>The Government, nevertheless, are ready to initiate additional measures, as appropriate, to complement their macroeconomic and sectoral policies, provided that they are within the framework of the present strategy.  In 1989 and in this year's budget, a series of special measures was introduced, aimed in particular at stimulating recruitment and enhancing the employment prospects of the long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that we have, in the Programme for Government, an economic strategy which is consistent with the objective of accelerating job creation and securing increased employment on a sustainable basis in the medium term.</P>

Will he comment on the fact that 60,000 jobs were created in the two years, 1988 and 1989, and that 60,000 people emigrated in those two years whereas the unemployment figure fell by only 6,000 to 8,000?  Where have all the unknown people come from to fill the 60,000 jobs?</P>
      <P>Can the Minister state how many of the 35,000 jobs promised for this year will be incorporated in training schemes and how many will be part-time jobs?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The latter part of the Deputy's question is a separate one and I would not have the information available to me.  In response to the first part of the Deputy's question, I refer him to the 20 per cent increase in the Public <Col N="1447" /> Capital Programme this year and to the new PRSI exemption scheme where employers will not be charged any PRSI if they take on extra employees.  This has already yielded 1,000 jobs but the target is 5,000 jobs.  There has been an expansion in the number of CERT places and we have set a target of 350 jobs.  We have improved allowances under the enterprise scheme and expanded the social employment scheme.  We have set a target of 1,000 jobs in the disadvantaged areas and we expect to meet the target of 5,000 jobs in 1990 in the country as a whole.  We have introduced the payment of a £10 child dependant allowance under the scheme and we hope this will attract persons with families.  We have set a target of 200 for the vocational training opportunities scheme and we have a new pilot job training scheme, under which we hope to meet the target of 1,000 jobs.</P>
      <P>The creation of 60,000 jobs for the two years was a gross target.  The creation of 35,000 jobs this year is the gross target but nevertheless it does not take into account increases in service jobs in the private sector.  These gross job figures have been produced in conjunction with the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>

Does the Minister not feel ashamed that this would be the situation, given that our capital city comprises of such large numbers of people and that one of the tasks performed by wildlife rangers would be of educational service to schools?  Would the Minister not agree that there is a need for this service in our schools, particularly in urban areas and in the capital?

That is the total staff of the wildlife rangers and their work includes, as the Deputy rightly knows, enforcement of the protective provisions in the Wildlife Acts, an advisory and educational service, and participation in wildlife research survey work.  Indeed there is quite a great deal of research work ongoing on various species in various sites.  There is a huge interest in wildlife in the Dublin area and it is a priority area that warrants some immediate attention.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the adjournment of the debate I was discussing fish farming and the necessity for clarification by the Department of the Marine, which issues licences in this regard.  I referred specifically to an article in <i>The New Scientist</i> of 26 August 1989 which dealt with research carried out by biologists who had detected an increasing number of wild salmon and other fish developing cataracts in one or both eyes and this blindness in the fish was being linked to the pesticide NUVAN 500 EC, which is used to control sea lice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have their names <Col N="1475" /> but I am asking the Department to clarify the matter.  If licences are to be issued by the Department for fish farms and if their development is to be an integral part of Government policy then the confusion created by the statements which have been issued countrywide by so called experts and by qualified experts would need to be cleared up.</P>
      <P>Fish farming development should be an integral part of Government policy.  If licences are issued to particular operators or organisations who have to spend substantial sums of money in this area, it is imperative that the chemicals used in the fish farms for the control of sea lice are absolutely safe.  Various meetings take place throughout the country at which the planning conditions of such fish farms and the methods of fish stock production are discussed.  As an unqualified expert in this area, I certainly cannot answer many of the questions that are raised at these meetings.  The public become very confused when they hear stories about salmon being dumped.  This matter comes under the aegis of the Department of the Marine and should be dealt with in such a way that nobody is left in any doubt about it.</P>
      <P>The substantial decrease in the number of sea trout on the west coast has been linked in part to the development of fish farming, but I do not know whether there is any evidence to substantiate those rumours.  As I have said, this matter should be dealt with by the Department of the Marine otherwise fish farming development will be seriously impaired due to the confusion and misinformation about these matters.  Many of the county councils on the west coast have asked that this matter be dealt with.  The health boards refuse to become involved &mdash; they say it is not their responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Chemicals are used in these fish farms and it is the responsibility of the Department of the Marine to ensure that they are not harmful to people who eat these fish.  It is time to get rid of the Good Friday syndrome.  Fish was always looked on as the poor relation because it was eaten on Fridays or fast days.  The <Col N="1476" /> nutritional value of fish has also been very well determined and it is important that information be provided by the institute and the Department in that regard.</P>
    <P>I accept the thrust of this Bill.  The Minister is correct in adopting a single strategy and set of objectives for a clearly defined administrative structure.  As I said, it is not necessary to have all aspects of the Marine Institute housed in one complex.  The work is such that it has to be dissipated throughout several areas. In his reply I would like the Minister to tell us how much financial control the institute have.  The Marine Institute should have control over funds issued to them by the Government, but I am not sure the same should apply to funds raised by private organisations or through various agencies, or funds from the EC. I would like further clarification on that.</P>
    <P>There is still quite a long way to go in terms of oceanography.  We have very little information on this matter despite the fact that there is a huge expanse of water around our coasts, including a vast area of the continental shelf to which I have already referred.  We are also the first point of European contact with the Gulf Stream.  There is great potential in this area and I hope the institute will have a role in carrying out research in this regard.  We have always had problems in terms of getting sufficient fish quotas in Brussels and the Minister understands the difficulties involved.  There is no reason we should not get involved to a much greater degree in non-quota fishing the Minister referred to that matter in his speech.  I would like to think that with the setting up of the Marine Institute we would eventually have something akin to the Cousteau Oceanography Research Institute which have vast resources at their disposal and have information on all aspects on this matter.</P>
    <P>The institute will stand or fall upon the person appointed by the Minister as chief executive officer.  If that person has no interest or motivation and no real understanding of marine matters, the Marine Institute will be a nonsense.  It is of fundamental importance for the determination of the very broad objectives <Col N="1477" /> outlined in the Minister's speech that the chief executive officer should have those qualities and should be given the necessary resources.  As has been stated by others, the person appointed as chief executive officer should be able to set out a plan but you cannot satisfy everybody in this regard.  I wish the Minister luck with this appointment which is fundamentally important for the development of the industry.  I hope the Minister and his successors will provide the necessary resources to enable the Marine Institute to play their part in marine research and development.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a ghabháil leis an Aire Stáit ag Roinn na Mara as ucht an Bille tábhachtach seo a chur os ár gcomhair.</P>
      <P>This is a very progressive and decisive step in the development of the marine economy and I thank the Minister for bringing the Bill before the Dáil today. For years research into mariculture in particular has been hindered and often neglected.  It would be opportune for me to congratulate the Minister for Finance on the recent appointment of eight new scientists and five new laboratory technicians to the fisheries Research Centre at Abbotstown.  It indicates the sincerity and commitment of the Government to marine research, expecially in the area of aquaculture, the environment, fish pathology and the investigation of new stocks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming from a constituency &mdash; Donegal South-West &mdash; whose lifeline is the sea, it is apt that I should say a few words on this Bill. I hope the initiation of the Marine Institute will be of benefit to the industry.  One of my greatest wishes for the Marine Institute would be in the area of research for new stocks of fish.  This is vital because our fish quotas at present are based on historical performance and as a consequence we, as a nation, have suffered terribly with the constrictions of our existing fish quota.  One of the ways out of this strangulation is to find new stocks and new species: some of these have been referred to recently such as blue whiting, scad &mdash; which is commonly <Col N="1478" /> known as horse mackerel in my constituency &mdash; and the argentine species. These new species will hold great potential for the Irish fishing industry and will be valuable not only on the home market &mdash; we will try to change the taste of the Irish people, something which is difficult &mdash; but also on the world market where these new species are very popular because of their high protein content.</P>
    <P>Recently there was a Soviet research expedition which lasted five weeks and for the first time Irish scientists participated. The Polar Research Institute in Murmansk held a two-day conference on board recently in relation to the investigation of the population of blue whiting off our coast.  We have discovered that the source is about 4.5 million tonnes which would be of great benefit to the fishing industry here.  They have also carried out some research in relation to the make-up and serenity of our waters, and something which has been lacking in our research is samples of plankton and larvae in our waters which I hope will be brought for further evaluation.  This research holds tremendous possibilities for new species and finding out the precise nature of existing stocks off our coast.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware Irish fishermen are in the business of surviving and are also trying to establish new catches at a time when the mackerel quota has been a bone of contention for several years in the Dáil Chamber.  They are trying to obtain a reasonable catch in the non-quota species so that in the event of their coming under the quota we would be able to get a fair share.  The only way that can be done is to back up what we have by research, something which has been lacking and has hindered any possibility of progress in the fishing industry.  In my estimation the EC have forgotten about research into existing fish stocks and future stocks, and have based their quotas etc. on mathematics.  I should like to give an example.  About three years ago the Killybegs Fishermens Organisation along with the Irish fish processors undertook a study because they were of the opinion that there was more than one <Col N="1479" /> stock of mackerel off the coast.  To their delight and to the delight of the Irish people they found that there was an additional mackerel population off the coast of Ireland.  As a consequence of that research we were able to renegotiate our mackerel quotas and secure an increase. That shows that research will be our greatest asset in going to the negotiation table in future in relation to any other fish species which I hope will become popular.</P>
    <P>Under the new Marine Institute, which will be an umbrella for a plethora of institutes, I hope the Irish can participate fully in EC research and place us on a par with the other EC countries who have put a lot of resources into marine research and investigative work.  I hope that the progress that appears to have been made on a small scale by a group of people in Killybegs can also be filtered through from a national point of view in relation to our fishing industry.  I hope it will give encouragement to the industry which has often found that they were totally forgotten and the poor relation in our own economy as has been voiced in the House today.  It will give great hope and increase the job potential of the fishermen and those who participate in the processing industry and all the other ancillary industries in the area.</P>
    <P>Another very contentious issue, and one which is in the news at present, relates to aquaculture.  I welcomed the Government's role in promoting fish farming because I felt it would help what I thought was a dying art, the small inshore fishermen, the small draft-net and drift-net men.  I had hoped they would have taken up the gauntlet and set up co-operatives and fish farms but unfortunately anything that is good is often bled dry and taken advantage of and unfortunately that has been the case here.  Now we have scares in relation to pollution of our waters from the number of fish farms in the area and the fact that they are not properly looked after and investigated by the Department.  We have very little research on our own books in relation to aquaculture and how our waters could <Col N="1480" /> facilitate fish farming.  I hope the institute will take a serious look at the situation. We should learn from the Norwegian experience where they found several difficulties in the fiords from the point of view of permission and also safety in a situation where many fish escape and inter-breed with the wild stocks. Research would help those who wish to participate in fish farming.  It is an excellent initiative for this country.  I hope it will not be marred by greed and lack of respect for our pollution-free waters, and that the Marine Institute will carry out greater research into fish farming.</P>
    <P>One cannot be over-critical because one is giving only one side of the story. Fish farming is a great source of employment. In my constituency we have a very successful fish farming co-operative which has good relations with the Department.  Because of that it has progressed and a number of jobs have been created especially for the small fisherman who participates only in the seasonal aspect of fishing, mainly inshore fishing for salmon.  I know there has been consternation in relation to salmon stocks. Many of the inshore fishermen or the drift-net and draft-net men claim that our fish stocks of salmon are not as low as we think.  They are asking that research be carried out as to the exact cause of a reduction in our salmon stocks.  They are of the opinion that given a fair chance the inshore fishermen are not to blame. Enough breeding stock make their way up into the rivers but are not given a chance to spawn mainly because they are poached.  Another problem may be pollution in the rivers.  Research should be undertaken into that.  One cannot contradict facts and this matter is of vital importance to the smaller fishermen many of whom I seem to represent.</P>
    <P>The institute will be welcomed by many educationalists in regard to mariculture and oceanography because they find themselves almost in a limbo where there is very little co-ordination between different research units and there is overlapping in research.  By pooling our resources under this Marine Institute we will benefit greatly from any research that <Col N="1481" /> can be carried out.  I hope the Minister will indicate to the House the position of smaller research units which are under the auspices of RTCs or the Department of Education and whether they will be incorporated in the Marine Institute.  Will they be under that umbrella or will they be used as a resource by the institute?  I know the smaller research units do their best to be as economic and self-sufficient as possible, but I ask that they be incorporated or at least linked in some way with the Marine Institute wherever the headquarters will be.  The institute will be of great benefit.</P>
    <P>Let me refer to a small project we have in Killybegs, the Quality Assurance Laboratory, which was set up on a pilot basis and has been an excellent resource to the fishing industry in Killybegs.  I hope some liaison will be established between the Marine Institute and this body because they have done tremendous work in relation to fat content and disease. People on the ground know the position and they can help a larger organisation in any studies.</P>
    <P>We have a great deal of catching up to do if we are to compare with the Norwegians and the Dutch in regard to research.  As the Minister said, we have an untapped resource which has tremendous potential.  Perhaps we do not realise the asset our maritime island is to us. It is unfortunate that so few Members participate in the processing of legislation dealng with marine matters.  That seems to be left to people like myself who represent an area in which there is a fishing industry or a related industry.  I hope this debate will engender greater interest in marine related activities and will encourage greater participation by other industries.</P>
    <P>We have an excellent resource in our fishing industry.  I hope the institute will be well co-ordinated, directed and supported by everyone interested, by the Departments and the industries, and that they will take their place particularly within the EC in regard to research.  I trust that the delay does not mean we are too far behind, especially in regard to new stocks and new breeds of fish, in <Col N="1482" /> going to the negotiating table and in trying to realise the full potential of the industry.  I trust, too, that my appeal to people who are interested in marine activities will not fall on deaf ears, that there will be co-ordinated progress, that the institute will go from strength to strength and that we will have an industry which can claim to be one of the greater industries, on a par with agriculture, in the Community and here in the country.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well.  I trust the Bill will be passed without much difficulty and that the institute will be initiated as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which proposes to set up an institute which will carry out research and development of our marine resources.  That is very welcome, assuming they do that job but I am sceptical.  It has been stated over the years that no other maritime nation in the world has as little knowledge of the waters around it as Ireland.  This is quite likely to be correct.  We have shown an astonishing ability to neglect what could have been our greatest natural resource. As things stand it is probably 59th in the pecking order of our exploitation of natural resources.  We have never really sought to do what should have been done in this regard since the foundation of the State.  Primarily, we depend on charts from the British Admiralty dating back two or three centuries to find out where our ships are travelling.  We depend on piers and harbours built by the British in the last century when it comes to bringing boats and cargoes ashore.  We made a right hames, if I may use that word, of claiming mineral rights and, for that matter, territorial rights in respect of Rockall and the surrounding seabed.  We let the British get there first.  Although geographically we are closer to Rockall than is Britain, the Faroes or any part of Denmark, we still have not won the right to exploit the mineral wealth of that area. The matter is still in the melting pot and I have not heard in recent years of any serious attempt to further our claim to that massive area of potential wealth.  We depend on the British primarily to finance <Col N="1483" /> the upkeep of our lighthouses and our lifeboats.  We do not have the decency to acknowledge the assistance they are giving us.  I accept that the general public made a contribution and that the Government in recent years have increased their contribution towards the maintenance of lighthouses, but the bulk of the money comes from the British.  We begrudgingly give thanks to them or express our appreciation for the assistance the British Defence Forces give us in our efforts to save the lives of Irish citizens around our coast.  On any occasion that there has been a ship in distress off our coast in the past 30 or 40 years, we have depended on British rescue services.  Some people give the impression that they resent the British saving Irish lives but they cannot deny that we depend on their Navy and, in particular, on their Air Force and helicopter crews to rescue people off our coast.</P>
      <P>Our attitude to the sea and servicing facilities to help us combat the dangers of the sea has been disgraceful.  We have been very neglectful.  I hope that the establishment of the institute marks a change in attitude and that something useful will be done.  We have had nauseating scenes in the last seven or eight years of people from the west coast having to travel to Dublin and go on their knees begging for a proper rescue service off that coast.  Such a service should be provided without question because of the inherent dangers involved in shipping and, in particular, in commercial fishing, off the treacherous west coast which is pounded in the calmest of weather by huge Atlantic swells.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People have had to travel to Dublin pleading with the Government.  That neglect is a disgrace and it has not been dealt with despite the recommendation of a committee set up by the Minister's Department.  Those people are blue in the face waiting for the Dauphin helicopters to be placed along the west coast. We have had those helicopters for two years and I do not think they have taken part in any sea rescues.  Many people doubt if those helicopters are suitable <Col N="1484" /> because we continue to depend on the British Sea King helicopters to carry out rescue work.  As recently as a couple of months ago those helicopters snatched people from the jaws of death and our rescue service was unable to do anything. That may be due to a lack of finance or to the fact that the helicopters were not suitable.  We should not have to ask others to do that work for us.</P>
    <P>The management of our maritime resources since the foundation of the State is a litany of neglect.  In my time in politics the position has not improved.  I have heard a lot of talk and seen many changes but they amounted to no more than changes in titles.  I have not seen any progress.  It is interesting to note some of the changes in titles that have taken place in the last 15 years.  Fisheries was a minor part of the Department of Agriculture in the seventies and at a later stage it was tied up with the Department of the Gaeltacht. Later the Government established a Department of Fisheries and Forestry and, lo and behold, in the last ten years a separate ministry of Fisheries was established.  However, that title has been changed and we now have the Department of the Marine.  While those changes were taking place there was not any commitment to develop our maritime resources whether through research or by increasing the size of our fleet.  In fact, our fishing fleet has been cut.  Many of my constituents are unable to obtain a licence to purchase boats because of the decision to cut back on the tonnage.  As a result of having some super trawlers, the ordinary fisherman cannot buy a new boat from outside of the State, not even a second hand vessel.  Our fishermen are suffering as a result of that cutback in our quota.</P>
    <P>A further complication has arisen in recent times.  We have a division of responsiblities which makes it difficult to get a straight answer from any person when a problem arises around our coast. There are too many fingers in the pie and problems are passed from Billy to Jack. It appears that nobody wants to accept responsibility.  Ostensibly, the Department of the Marine have responsibility <Col N="1485" /> not just for the sea but for the foreshore, the sea walls, the embankments and the roads that lead to the sea, but that is not the position.  If one has a query about any of those matters one will find that one gets mixed up with the Department of Finance, the Department of the Environment and the Department of Tourism and Transport.  That was clearly illustrated during the terrible storms last winter.  Members who sought relief for damage caused during those storms found that nobody accepted responsibility. Queries were passed all over the place.  I have accompanied three deputations to three Ministers.  There has been a lot of messing and buck-passing.</P>
    <P>There was a little movement from 1 January last because responsibility for the designated harbours was shifted from the Office of Public Works to the Department of the Marine.  However, we continue to have a problem in that the foreshore is the responsibility of the Department of Tourism and Transport &mdash; at one time it was the responsibility of the Department of Transport and Power. The biggest problem of all is that the Department of Finance will not allow any work to be carried out until they decide whether money should be provided. More often than not they refuse to provide the money and that is why I am so sceptical about the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech is a beautiful piece of Civil Service rhetoric.  I have no doubt that an official in the Department spent three or four days embellishing that script.  The words are magnificent but the script could have been reduced to half a page.  One could have covered everything in two or three sentences by stating that the institute would deal with research and development.</P>
    <P>I should like to put a number of questions to the Minister.  As far as I am aware the last research boat we had, the Cú Feasa went to the breakers' yard some years ago; that vessel was a relic before it went to the breakers-yard.  I do not know what replaced it but, for years, we kept a boat that was past its best and it was impossible to do any worthwhile research.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1486" /> Many self-indicting statements have been made in this House from time to time and another one in this mould today said that we still have not delineated our rights in regard to the continental shelf. I though that was all finished years ago, that our argument with the British and French had been concluded but &mdash; lo and behold &mdash; the Minister said in his speech that the question of the delimitation of the Irish continental shelf is unresolved. What are we doing about Rockall and our stake in the continental shelf?</P>
    <P>The Minister made the point that if we get what we deserve our portion of sea bed under our jurisdiction will increase by as much as 40 per cent.  There is a need for a tremendous effort, ingenuity and negotiating skills in this regard because, as we discovered over the last 23 years, the sea bed is potentially as rich as the mainland in terms of exploration. It is essential that we have the resources, manpower, money and equipment to carry out the kind of investigation which is necessary and to ensure that we get our proportion of the continental shelf.  Those two matters have not yet been decided.</P>
    <P>I am not quarrelling with the Minister because this is the fault of successive Governments.  I hate using that expression because every time I go to meetings in my constituency or elsewhere I hear it and it sticks in my throat, but it is a great phrase for the hurler on the ditch who likes to tell politicians what to do.  There is no need for the Minister to be defensive, it is better to be open about these matters.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Marine are grossly under-manned, under-financed and incapable of doing the kind of work which the Bill envisages for them.  I do not want to accuse anyone of telling untruths but, on a deputation to the Minister for the Marine about three or four months ago, I heard an official say that there is only one marine engineer in the Department of the Marine.  I should like the Minister to clarify this statement. What resources are available?  Are we capable of running a Maritime Institute? Is it just another piece of paper passing <Col N="1487" /> through this House or will it work?  From my experience, I reckon it is just another piece of paper and not something which will work.</P>
    <P>Are the Department of Finance prepared to give this new institute or the Department of the Marine the money to ensure that it works?  My intuition tells me that they will not because the Department of the Marine are so far down the line that they will be shunted off the page when the sums are being done for the Estimates.  The bigger Departments will get the money but the Department of the Marine will once again be ignored.</P>
    <P>We are talking about research and development.  I want to refer to the greatest scandal in this country in recent times, the discrimination against our inshore fishermen.  One would think they were the outcasts of society because they are pursued, harassed and imprisoned year in, year out, for doing what they and their ancestors have done for centuries.  The only additional money which has been provided for the Department of the Marine is for increased surveillance of inshore fishermen by the fisheries boards. Money has not been provided for research and development, just for harassment.</P>
    <P>These people &mdash; and there are thousands of them &mdash; are the most hard working in the country and they go to sea in all types of weather in open boats.  What happens at the end of the day?  It is likely that some of them are arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned.  That happened to a number of people in my constituency. If they are not sent to prison they are savagely fined.  What was their crime? They were trying to make a living.  How did they break the law?  By catching fish, primarily salmon.  One would think that they were doing tremendous damage to the fishing stocks in this country but that is not the case.</P>
    <P>I have been listening for 25 years to people saying that, because of drift netting at sea, salmon stocks will be annihilated. The reverse is the case as catches prove.  It is the science of simple mathematics. Salmon fishing is cyclical with <Col N="1488" /> catches high in some years and low in others.  Catches in recent years have been better than those of 20 or 30 years ago despite the gloomy predictions of socalled experts.  Will someone, for God's sake, come up with something logical in regard to salmon stocks because we have heard a load of rubbish over the years? Salmon stocks have not decreased.  There are masses of salmon around our coast but because of our inability to provide a proper protection service and frame reasonable and rational laws and regulations the wrong people are catching the salmon.  It is a disgrace to the institution of government that this imprisonment of decent, good and hard working people is continuing.</P>
    <P>For the past 20 years a fleet of trawlers, which is not very big, has been operating off the west coast and using miles of monofilament net to catch salmon while on the other hand inshore fishermen who use open boats have to try to eke out a living.  These fishermen are fair game for the bailiffs, the conservationists and the fishery boards.  It is like catching goldfish in a goldfish bowl.  These fishermen fish in a harbour or creek close to shore and they do not have a hope of escaping detection.  They have to earn a living but their ability to do so has decreased tremendously since these trawlers, or half ships, off the west coast have been allowed to get away with blue murder.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Marine and the Minister for Defence should get their priorities right and apprehend the real culprits who are catching large quantities of salmon using monofilament nets.  I am not asking for an open concession for these small fishermen; I am asking that a certain amount of monofilament net be legalised so that they can earn a decent living.  People in coastal areas do not have any alternative where work is concerned. There are no factories in these areas and if people do not fish for a living they either have to emigrate or go on the dole. Therefore, it behoves the Government, on humanitarian grounds, to organise our fishing industry so that the people who have traditionally earned a living from <Col N="1489" /> fishing can continue to do so.  Small fishermen should not be penalised by these trawlers who are taking their catches of salmon.  It is a disgrace that this has been allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>Many young people along our coasts fishing illegally have drowned while trying to earn some money but little publicity has been given to such incidents.  If this happened in Dublin city or in any large city in an area for which the Government have responsibility there would be a massive outcry and this House would be in turmoil every day.  As recently as three or four months ago two young men in my constituency drowned while out fishing.  I wonder if the laws were as they should be would this have happened.  About eight years ago two young men in another part of my constituency died because they took chances they should not have taken or would not have taken if the laws were as they should be.  Those two young people went out in dangerous seas close to rocks.  That sort of activity is not advisable but it happens because of the ineptitude on the part of the Government and the could not care less attitude by this House.  It is a problem that will have to be faced up to.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question on the Adjournment six months ago, the Minister gave me a routine Civil Service answer to the case I am making here today, he read out a script that had been prepared by a civil servant.  This is no reflection on civil servants. They merely prepare material on the regulations as presented to them. These regulations and laws should be changed and the people to do it are the politicians.  In this case the politicians are the Minister and the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine.  People are dying because of a could not care less attitude by the Government.  It is bad enough that people should have to go to prison, be heavily fined and suspended from fishing without their lives being put at risk.  The Government should consider the humanitarian aspect of the question and come up with a solution.  I believe a solution can be found and I hope they come up with it sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>Other speakers referred to our paltry <Col N="1490" /> rescue service, particularly the helicopter service for the west coast.  This service needs to be re-examined.  It is time we had a service similar to the American coastguard system.  Nowadays many more people use the waters around our coast.  There has been a huge increase in the use of pleasure boats, be they motorboats or yachts, and sail boards.  The level of this type of activity has increased tenfold over the past 20 years as a result of a higher standard of living.  Nowadays there can be as many as 50 or 60 boats in some harbours where there were only five or six boats 20 years ago.  Many of the people who own these boats are not properly prepared for the elements when they go out in them.  As people from a maritime county know, a storm can spring up in a half an hour and people who are not experienced in sailing can be put in very great danger.  I have noticed that Dublin, Dún Laoghaire and Strangford Lough are particularly dangerous. This is probably because of the density of population in these areas.  Many of these people come from the city and they do not have experience of the sea.  Very often they do not have the very basics such as oars with them in case of an emergency and if an engine breaks down or the wind starts to blow off the land in a direction that endangers them, they are powerless.</P>
    <P>What we need is a certain type of coastguard service, through a combination of boats and helicopters.  One only has to observe this service in resorts abroad &mdash; in countries like Spain, Italy, the South of France or indeed the United States where their beaches are patrolled regularly not merely by boats and lifeguards but also by helicopters &mdash; to see how successful they are.  We have made no such provision.  We are not thinking sufficiently big.  We are not thinking of the inherent dangers; we are taking a chance; everything in this country is a chance. The tendency is to save the money but, in this respect, it is penny wise and pound foolish.</P>
    <P>There is indeed a need for a coastguard service for use by people at sea.  After all, we must remember that the increase <Col N="1491" /> in water related leisure activities has been tremendous without any measures what-soever having been taken to cater for their inherent dangers.  It is high time this matter was given consideration on a national basis, not leaving it to local authorities.  It is too big an issue for them. Especially from this time of the year until, say, mid-September, there is a need for a constant patrolling of our coasts. There is no doubt but that a coastguard type service would be enormously beneficial.</P>
    <P>Particularly on the east and south-east coasts such a service could be used in preventing the smuggling of drugs and arms which we suspect takes place but which we have very little chance of detecting with the facilities at present available to us.  For example, we have a Naval Service badly over-stretched looking for Spaniards fishing within our 200 mile zone; they cannot be surveilling every little harbour around our coasts. Such a coastguard service is absolutely essential for several reasons, principally for safety of life but also in detecting the smuggling of arms or drugs.  I must repeat: for God's sake, stop providing extra resources to harass good, hard-working people.  Rather we should ensure that any resources available are spent on worthwhile activities, helping to save lives.</P>
    <P>Some months ago at Question Time I raised with the Minister the compulsory wearing of life jackets or life belts by people who go to sea in small leisure boats in particular because of the danger of the type of incident to which I have just been referring, when people are unused to boating and get into difficulties. In replying the Minister said he was looking into the matter.  Perhaps he could inform the House today whether there has been any movement in that regard.</P>
    <P>Just as there are statistics of road accidents and injuries we should compile statistics on accidents, injuries and fatalities at sea.  The publication of such statistics would jolt the public into a realisation that every year several dozen people lose <Col N="1492" /> their lives around our coasts because they were not wearing lifejackets or life belts. I have never seen such statistics published. Perhaps the Minister would take the initiative in this respect.  It is my view from experience of recent events I have witnessed when fatalities occurred that, had lifejackets been worn, there would not have been loss of life.  I shall be interested to hear the results of the Minister's deliberations since I raised that matter some months ago.  It would be my hope that he would have a positive view to offer.</P>
    <P>I know it is difficult for fishermen fishing on the decks of trawlers to wear lifejackets, they are somewhat cumbersome, but there should be some method devised whereby such people would have some safety gear readily available to them.  I do know they use dinghies or lifejackets close by, though it is not feasible to use such gear when operating with nets and so on but, in the case of people going out purely for leisure type boating, or fishing with rods, they should wear a lifejacket; that should be a prerequisite of any such activity.</P>
    <P>If the provisions of this Bill are fully implemented they could do tremendous good but my fear would be that, when the Department of Finance take out their scissors at Estimates time, we will be back to square one.  Equally I would predict that the Minister's successor will then come along, promote some other idea, or another body, when he, in turn, will be thwarted in his efforts by the Department of Finance, which practice will continue until there is somebody in the Department of the Marine with the resolve and tenacity to get the necessary moneys to ensure that this is done successfully. Basically the idea is good, but, like the American expression some years ago if one did not believe something one said: &ldquo;go and tell it to the marines&rdquo;, and this will be a case of: &ldquo;go and tell it to the Department of the Marine&rdquo;.  I predict one will not get the money, but will be shoved into the background.  Unless the Minister and his Minister of State demonstrate attributes I have yet to witness, then I wager that my view will turn out <Col N="1493" /> to be correct at the end of the day much to the sorrow of our maritime community.</P>

      <P>I am glad to be given a chance to speak on this Bill.  It is an area with which I have long been concerned coming from a seafaring family very much interested in marine matters.  As the Minister will be aware &mdash; he representing the same constituency &mdash; I serve on the Foynes Harbour Board which has a certain amount of contact with his Department.</P>
      <P>Some of the difficulties to which previous speakers have referred might be more pertinent to harbour board activities. I will not go into that; that is for another day.  I am pleased that the Minister, as Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, shares my constituency.  I might place on record that we very much appreciate what he is doing for us in Foynes.  If the Minister could expedite the peripheral programme of the national development plan for transport and roads, then possibly there would be good news for the area also.  Again that will be for another day.</P>
      <P>I am very interested in the provisions of this Bill.  Indeed it should have preceded many of the developments that have taken place, particularly in aquaculture. Had it been established, when first mooted by Roinn na Mara in 1985, we might not have experienced some of our more recent difficulties in fish farming. Though the decision has been taken rather late in the day, we must welcome it as a sound one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Deasy probably put his finger on the nub of the problem when he said that probably the proposed Marine Institute will have no teeth unless it has a pivotal role to play in the overall area of research and development.  The only way that role can be properly fulfilled is through the provision of sufficient funds for that purpose.  As he rightly said in relation to the budget, the Department <Col N="1494" /> of the Marine tend to be regarded as the Cinderella Department.  This attitude will have to change.  As we are aware, there is tremendous potential with regard to developments around our coastline.</P>
    <P>I would like to dwell for a few moments on the aquaculture sector.  There are now 200 fish farm units within the country with the potential to provide up to 2,000 jobs but the most important point to bear in mind in referring to these fish farms is that they are located in areas where potential industrialists would not be prepared to locate.  Therefore it is absolutely vital that the development of this sector be controlled and co-ordinated.  The recent protests in Waterville and Connemara are understandable given the lack of a marine institute in the past and the lack of research and development.  The research and development which has taken place has been very fragmented and carried out by fish farming interests or by some learned professors in Galway University and so on.</P>
    <P>This Bill is timely.  Given that the national development plan envisages an expansion of fishing activities, particularly in the area of aquaculture, there is much scope for research to allay the genuine fears and concerns expressed by communities.  It is unfortunate such concern has been expressed as we need those valuable jobs.  It is estimated £40 million was earned by the aquaculture sector last year.  This is a substantial figure but we should also take into account the income earned by those companies which supply the equipment necessary for fish farming.</P>
    <P>This is an important sector but it has been getting a bad press in recent times. To counter this we need a marine institute with teeth comprised of people with experience.  The chemical Nuvan has been mentioned several times today and is on everybody's lips when they speak about fish farming.  While we do not know very much about the effects of this chemical, there is a necessity to replace it with something else.  I hope the Marine Institute will work in harmony with fish farming interests to create jobs and allay <Col N="1495" /> the genuine fears which have been expressed.</P>
    <P>Last year 6,200 tonnes of salmon were produced but when we contrast this with a figure for Scotland at 27,000 tonnes annually and with Norway at 140,000 tonnes we can see the scope available to us.  The one thing we have going for us is that it is accepted internationally that what we produce is of top quality.</P>
    <P>This sector is dependent on science and technology and therefore the work of the Marine Institute is imperative to its growth.  There has already been significant advances, such as genetic feeding, but, as I said earlier, we need more research.</P>
    <P>I would like to support what was said by my colleague about in-shore fishermen.  I will not dwell for too long on this matter as my colleague, Deputy Deasy, has covered all the points that need to be raised.  One of the valid points he made is that many of the fishermen who depend on fishing for their livelihoods are being harassed and penalised.  It is also true that the large trawlers prevent salmon from going up the estuary by setting nets across it.  I often wonder if the State goes after these trawlers with the same vigour as is applied in the case of our inshore fishermen.</P>
    <P>Another question the Marine Institute will have to consider and which, again, was referred to by Deputy Deasy, is that of foreshore licences.  I always find it remarkable that the Department of Tourism and Transport and the Department of Finance are so much involved in this area. One would expect the Department of the Marine to be solely concerned with this issue.  It appears also that there are considerable delays in the issuing of licences for fresh water farm fishing of fish culture. This is something the Marine Institute help to resolve.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish the institute well. The sooner we get it established and the sooner people with expertise in the area of research and development are appointed the better as we will then be able to develop what is a very important resource.  It has been stated many times <Col N="1496" /> in the past that this industry has great potential.  Let us now do something tangible. This Bill may be a step in the right direction but the institute will only be successful if sufficient finance is provided. That is where the true fight will take place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>As an island state it is appalling that successive Governments have taken so long to recognise the importance of the marine environment. In the early years of this century Ireland was ahead of many other European countries in investigating marine resources both on-shore and off-shore, including fisheries and seabed organisms. For example, in 1890 and 1891 the Royal Dublin Society undertook a survey of the fishing grounds off the west coast using the chartered yachts, <i>Fingal</i> and <i>Harlequin.</i> The Government contributed less than half the cost of this research.  Again, in 1898 the RDS re-entered the field of marine research with a project to establish a marine laboratory in order to undertake a five year study of mackerel and salmon.  The laboratory was set up in 1899 on board a 220 ton brigantine <i>The Saturn of Galway.</i></P>
      <P>Soon afterwards the fisheries branch of the new Department of Agriculture on technical instruction took over the laboratory. This work was supplemented by a fisheries protection cruiser, <i>The Helga</i>, which was built at Ayr in 1891.  A second ship, also called <i>The Helga</i> was built specially for the Department of Agriculture on technical instruction in 1908.  This ship was also fitted out for marine and fisheries research work and had a laboratory on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the years following independence marine research was seriously downgraded by successive Governments.  A Minister for Fisheries was appointed in 1922 but his function seemed to be purely administrative.  For decades the Department of Fisheries was shuffled about between the Department of Lands and the Department of Agriculture as a minor appendage to one or the other.  In 1952, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara were set up and soon began to recognise the need for <Col N="1497" /> basic marine research.  Unfortunately, very little was in progress at the time.</P>
    <P>In the sixties the Marine Research Laboratory at Carna became a major shellfish research station but it, too, was harmed seriously through inadequate and uncertain funding.  For many years there were arguments between the Department of Education and the National Science Council, later to become the National Board for Science and Technology, as to who should fund it.  During this period staff members went for months at a time without salaries.  Also during the eighties there was a Government proposal to establish a marine institute in Galway and for the Department of Fisheries to move west to a site at Galway docks.  In the eighties a marine institute task force was established with the job of reporting to the Minister for the Marine.  The report of the task force was handed to the Minister shortly after the establishment of the Department of the Marine in 1987 but nothing has since been seen either of the report or of its recommendations. This report should be published immediately and I call on the Minister to do so as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>This present Bill is very welcome in that it at least appears to recognise the importance of the marine environment and marine resources.  However, it is based on an extremely narrow definition of the purpose of a marine institute and makes no reference to the need for greater understanding of the marine environment that we may safeguard it and utilise its resources without causing damage to marine ecosystems.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains no provision for increasing public awareness of the marine environment either locally or globally. Neither are there any references to the intrinsic importance of the oceans to Ireland, to Europe and to the world. Instead we have a Bill which looks on the marine environment as something to be exploited and developed purely for financial gain.  Marine research is not regarded as something intrinsically valuable in itself but as something to be marketed as a chargeable service, in other <Col N="1498" /> words, a purely monetary or profit oriented activity.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to one of the functions of this institute as dealing with research and aquaculture.  Previous speakers, particularly Deputy Kenny, dealt at length with the grave misgivings which are being expressed all over this country about fin fish farming.  It is a pity that this institute was not put into being some years ago when adequate research could have been done in this area because people are very concerned about it.  I also attended as part of a deputation to the Department of the Marine two or three months ago and I was appalled to hear how scanty their resources are.  They admitted to me that they had inadequate resources to monitor the existing marine and inland fin fish farms.  They further admitted that even if they had sufficient resources the legislation was inadequate. In spite of these obvious drawbacks they are still continuing to issue licences for fin fish farming.  This behaviour is extremely irresponsible.  We in the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, have called for a five year moratorium on fin fish farming.  That is a very reasonable proposal and I hope it will be taken on board and that this new marine institute will make a serious effort to research the problems in this area.</P>
    <P>Let me refer briefly to what Deputy Finucane said about the quality of our farm salmon being renowned throughout the world for its quality.  I certainly deny that.  The quality of our sea salmon is undoubted but the same cannot be said about our farm salmon.</P>

      <P>Tá lúchair orm deis a bheith agam cúpla focal a rá maidir leis an mBille seo, an Bille um Fhoras na Mara, 1989.  Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimhe.  Is mór an trua nár tugadh Bille mar seo isteach i bhfad roimhe seo. Táthar ag caint ar institiúid mhara a bhunú le beagnach fiche bliain, agus is mór an trua nach raibh sé ar bun i bhfad roimhe seo.  Go díreach, le tamall ansin bhí mé ag breathnú ar roinnt nótaí agus chonaic mé go bhfuil an-chuid institiúidí sa tír seo.  Bhí mé ag breathnú ar Eolaí <Col N="1499" /> Teileafóin ansin agus chuntas mé daichead a haon institiúid: Institiúid an Ard Léinn, Institiúid Leighis, Institiúid Theangeolaíochta, agus tá institiúid ann faoi choinne beagnach gach gné de shaol na tíre.  Is mór an t-uafás ar fad nach raibh a leithéid seo ar bun faoi choinne acmhainn chomh luachmhar le hacmhainn na farraige agus acmhainn na mara agus acmhainn na hiascaireachta.  Mar a dúirt cainteoirí a chuaigh romham, tá neamart an-mhór ar fad déanta ann le cianta anuas agus má tá an institiúid ar bun anois féin, tá sé thar a bheith in am dó.</P>
      <P>Aontaíonn gach duine, gur ceann de na hacmhainní nádúrtha is luachmhaire atá againn ná an fharraige agus an méid atá ansin.  Sílim nach ndearna muid forbairt cheart air leis na blianta anuas. Ceann de na fáthanna nach ndearna muid forbairt cheart uirthi, i mo thuairim, ná nach raibh polasaí ceart forbartha mara sa tír seo.  Bhíomar ag dul ó bhliain go bliain agus ó lá go lá agus nuair a amharcann muid ar an staid ina bhfuil tionscal na hiascaireachta agus tionscal na mara i láthair na huaire, tuigimid an gá atá le polasaí fiúntach cuimsitheach a bhaineann le hiascaireacht agus leis an mhuir agus leis an aigéan atá thart orainn, agus sílim gur sin ceann de na deacrachtaí a bhí againn nach raibh foras nó institiúid mar seo againn faoi choinne polasaí a mhúnlú agus a chur inár láthair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Go deimhin, le blianta anuas, ní raibh sa Roinn Iascaireachta ach fo-roinn den Roinn Talmhaíochta, agus, ar feadh tamaill ansin, bhí sé ina fho-roinn den Roinn Foraoiseachta.  Is le cúpla bliain anuas a cuireadh roinn dá chuid féin ar fáil don iascaireacht, Roinn na Mara. Nuair a bhí an Rialtas a chuaigh romhainn ag plé leis an Eoraip bhí siad ag iarraidh ár sciar den iasc atá san fharraige a fháil nuair a cuireadh an polasaí iascaireachta ar bun ag an leibhéal Eorpach. Nuair a chuaigh ár gcuid daoine anonn ansin le margadh a dhéanamh ar ár son, sílim dá mbeadh níos mó eolais acu agus dá mbeadh institiúid mhara ansin leis an taighde uilig agus an eolas uilig a chur ar fáil dúinn, go mbeadh lámh i bhfad níos láidre le himirt againn, agus gurbh fhéidir <Col N="1500" /> go mbeadh margadh i bhfad níos fearr againn ná mar a d'éirigh linn a fháil.</P>
    <P>Tá sé ráite go mion agus go minic go bhfuil 25 faoin gcéad d'fharraige agus d'uisce an Chomhphobail thart orainne ach, mar sin féin, nach bhfuil de chead againn a thógáil amach as sin de réir an chuóta ach 4 faoin gcéad den iasc.  Dá mbeadh an t-institiúid nó an foras seo ar bun le fiche bliain nó cúig bliana déag anuas bheadh an t-eolas agus an taighde ann agus bheimis ábalta dul ansin agus margadh i bhfad níos fearr a fháil.  Tá lúcháir orm go bhfuil siad chun an institiúid a chur ar bun ansin leis an mBille seo mar, nuair a bheidh athscrúdú le déanamh ar an bpolasaí iascaireachta amach anseo i gceann bliana nó dhó eile, b'fhéidir, ar a laghad, go beidh toradh éigin ar obair na hinsititiúide agus beidh sé sin ar fáil do na daoine a chuirfimid anonn chun margadh fiúntach a fháil dár gcuid iascairí.</P>
    <P>Tagaimse ó chontae agus ó dháil-cheantar go bhfuil an iascaireacht mhara tábhachtach, agus caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil an tionscal sin in ísle bhrí ar fad anois.  Ní fhaca mé le fada riamh rudaí chomh holc agus atá anois.  Tá cúpla rud ag cur isteach ar an tionscal iascaireachta faoi láthair.  An chéad rud ná na cuotaí seo.</P>
    <P>The development of our fishing industry is badly handicapped by the imposition of quotas at EC level.  The mackerel quota is very relevant to County Donegal because a good mackerel season provides not alone employment for many hundreds of fishermen, who are fishing out of Killybegs and other ports in the west but also provides a great deal of employment for the many hundreds of people who are engaged in the processing industry on shore.  I blame the inadequate mackerel quotas for the fact that we did not have a Marine Institute at our disposal to advise our negotiators in years gone by.  As I have already said in Irish I hope we will have researchers at the Marine Institute at the disposal of our negotiators when we come to review the common fisheries policy in a year or two. We are constrained by the quotas.  Indeed the entire mackerel fishing fleet was tied <Col N="1501" /> up at the pier in Killybegs for eight weeks prior to the end of last year.  The quotas are being reduced year after year.</P>
    <P>Another reason for the difficulties we are experiencing at present is the question of licences and the fact that licences are tied to the gross registered tonnage we are allowed.  Again we are approaching this matter on a non-scientific basis. We are obliged by the EC to reduce our gross registered tonnage by 16 per cent per annum.  We are well over the limit at present and until we succeed in doing that we will be hampered by not being allowed any extra licences.  Languishing in the Department are about 300 applications, some from the many young people starting off, and they have no idea whatsoever when these licences will be issued or if they will ever be issued.  Certainly this does not lead to development in the fishing industry or the exploitation of the potential of one of our greatest natural resources.</P>
    <P>We have to use the expertise available at EC level because we have not got our own expertise.  We have not done our own research except in a limited sort of way.  However, we cannot overlook the research that has been carried out by bodies such as Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Is fíor a rá go bhfuil Údarás na Gaeltachta ina gceannródaithe ar an taighde atáthar á dhéanamh le roinnt blianta anuas, chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé le feirméireacht éisc.  Chomh maith le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta tá Coláiste na hOllscoile i nGaillimh agus an Coláiste Réigiúnach i Leitir Ceanainn i gceist freisin.  Tá cúrsa fheirméireacht éisc ar siúl ansin.</P>
    <P>We have very limited facilities available. It is very necessary to have a Marine Institute to formulate policy and to prepare our negotiators meetings at EC level and in other areas.</P>
    <P>As a result of the ban on new licences and on assistance in the purchase of new boats, we have an aging fleet.  Many of our fishing vessels range from 20 to 40 years old.  Many of the vessels are older than the crews manning them and that leads to dangers.  It certainly does not <Col N="1502" /> lend itself to safety at sea which should always be a very important aspect of the fishing industry and marine matters in general.</P>
    <P>I hope there will not be any further undue delay in establishing the Marine Institute.  The Bill was introduced in the Seanad and is now going through the Dáil.  I hope the board and chief executive of the new Marine Institute will be in place before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>The institute should give top priority to a number of areas; first, it should provide the research and information to formulate a national marine and fishing policy.  It is about time we had a five year plan for this industry.  We have not had one to date.  We need a plan based on fact, on what we can do.  It is very easy to say, &ldquo;we will develop the fishing industry, we will create 3,000 or 4,000 new jobs&rdquo; but we must take action to bring about such development.  We have had experience of such optimism in the past but nothing happened.  The new institute must have the facilities and resources to carry out research and development so that any plan or policy formulated will be based on fact and results can be achieved. Second, the institute should concern itself not alone with the fish in our seas and how we can develop that sort of industry but also with minerals, oil and the other resources available along our coasts.  It is true that we do not have the same power or control, or indeed sovereignty over our seas as we had ten to 20 years ago. We had to sacrifice this to the EC and that is another reason that it is rather late in the day to be establishing a Marine Institute.</P>
    <P>As previous speakers have mentioned, I believe the institute should devote its attention to the whole area of mariculture and fish farming.  Ten or 20 years ago no one could envisage what was possible in this area.  I have visited fish farms in Galway and in my own county and I have seen hundreds if not thousands of fine salmon in cages.  There is controversy surrounding this industry because of the use of chemicals and so on.  If fish farms, or salmon farms are in a confined area, there is a danger that they will cause <Col N="1503" /> pollution and the new institute must direct its attention to finding out the extent of pollution caused by fish farms located in enclosed areas.  It is important that the problem is solved because a clean environment is in everybody's interest.</P>
    <P>The fishing of wild salmon is now very controversial.  We are coming into the fishing season, and I am sure the Minister of State agrees with me that we can expect controversy and trouble along the coast from Donegal to Cork during the months of June, July and August.  Of course, I am referring to the methods of fishing and the use or non-use of monofilament nets.  A previous Minister, who is no longer a Member of this House, Mr. Paddy O'Toole, established the salmon review group in 1985 to examine the whole area of wild Atlantic salmon, the method of catching the fish and how the stocks could be conserved.  The report was issued.  Indeed submissions were subsequently sought from all the interested parties when the report was published. The submissions were made, but for the past two years little or nothing has been heard of the report.  Indeed many drift-net fishermen would find the recommendations of that report very acceptable. Even though there was very little representation from the drift-net fishermen on the review group, the group recommended the legalising of monofilament net of a limited length, I think of about 1,500 to 2,000 metres.  That recommendation came from the experts appointed by the Minister and the Government at that time.</P>
    <P>A number of other very good recommendations were made such as a five day week, a limited season, a limited size of boat and so on.  Deputy Coughlan, who spoke earlier, along with other Deputies including myself attended a meeting in Donegal a few weeks ago at which there were 300 to 400 fishermen who were very apprehensive as to what was going to happen with regard to wild Atlantic salmon fishing this year and in years to come.  The Minister and the Department should inform the fishermen in this regard.  The fishermen are as much in <Col N="1504" /> favour of conservation as anyone else. They know they have to depend upon renewed stocks of salmon year after year in order that they can continue fishing.  If this matter is not dealt with this year I suggest that the Marine Institute come forward with recommendations.  The trouble with the fishing industry and anything to do with the marine is that there are books and chapters of recommendations, all of which are left on shelves gathering dust, but nothing is ever implemented.  My hope for this institute is that whatever recommendations they make or whatever reports they issue will be acted upon.</P>
    <P>One of my reservations about the institute is that their powers seem to be very limited.  Perhaps they should have more teeth.  Will they be able to implement their own recommendations or will the Minister and the Department implement them?  One area to which they should direct their attention is that of coastal erosion.  It has been mentioned in the House on numerous occasions in the last few years that this problem is becoming more serious every year.  Perhaps this is due to the storms or perhaps we are not as assiduous as we were in the years gone by in building protective walls and barriers to prevent coastal erosion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is about marine research and development. I know that &mdash; especially with the Deputy's wonderful imagination &mdash; he could touch on many matters but I think he has enough competence to know precisely what will be the immediate interest and functions of the institute.  It is stretching the imagination rather far to think that the most immediate interest would be coastal erosion, a factor connected with the fishing industry which Deputy McGinley has been dealing with very comprehensively and efficiently.  We <Col N="1505" /> have to limit ourselves a little more to the purpose of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely wanted to indicate that there are various experts living in coastal areas who would suggest that if the right type of grass &mdash; bentgrass, or as you and I would call it muiríneach which was used to thatch houses in coastal areas &mdash; was growing along the coast, it would be as good as any protective wall in preventing coastal erosion. I am merely suggesting that the experts who will be employed by the institute could perhaps carry out some research into this area.  If they could come up with a type of sea grass, coastal grass or sandygrass that would be suitable for the job, it might help save millions of pounds in building walls that would be knocked down in the next storm anyway. É sin ráite is féidir liom, le do chead, dul ar aghaidh go dtí ábhar eile.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency have said they are concerned about sea pollution.  Perhaps the Marine Institute would have something to contribute in that area also.</P>
      <P>Even though we have not had an institute up to now, nevertheless there is a tradition that we are leaders in invention when it comes to matters relating to the sea.  A few nights ago I was reading a most interesting book by Dr. John de Courcy Ireland on marine history in which he said that the inventor of the submarine, John Philip Holland, was an Irishman and also that the inventor of the harpoon gun was, I am proud to say, a Donegal man.  Many other items were invented here which are of benefit to fishermen and seafaring people.  We are an island and we are interested in the seas.  We have had some great sailors going back to St. Brendan and St. Columba.  If the institute have the expertise to rationalise and co-ordinate all these matters, there is an excellent future for the industry.  I am sure there will be good results from the endeavours of this institute.</P>
      <P>I agree with most of the sections in the Bill.  Section 4 deals with the functions of the institute.  It states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1506" /> The Institute shall have the following general functions, namely, to undertake, to co-ordinate, to promote and to assist in marine research and development and to provide such services related to marine research and development, that in the opinion of the Institute will promote economic development and create employment. </P>
    <P>I think we would all agree with the sentiments expressed there.  Section 6 deals with charges for services.  We are coming around to the idea that not alone do goods not come free but services have to be paid for also.  I hope the charges will not be too high because, after all, the institute will be funded by the Irish taxpayer and the charges should not be out of the reach of most people who are interested in this matter.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with the appointment of a chief executive officer.  It is very important that this be a person with vision, commitment and expertise.  The role of the chief executive of any semi-State body is very important and the chief executive appointed to the Marine Institute could be the make or the break of the institute.  The chief executive will be subject to the conditions and the regulations that apply to the chief executive of any other State body.  Section 10 states that a Member of either House of the Oireachtas or of the European Parliament cannot be a member of the institute and I believe that applies to most semi-State bodies.  If the chief executive or a member of the board is elected to the Dáil or Seanad or to the European Parliament he will cease to function as a member or as chief executive of the board.</P>
    <P>Section 17 deals with scholarships and grants.  The institute should have the power to give scholarships and grants to people who wish to pursue a course in marine biology or the marine generally and they should use those powers.  In my constituency, as in most coastal constituencies, young men and women who are interested in the marine may wish to pursue their studies further in another country and I hope the necessary funds <Col N="1507" /> will be made available to the institute to provide grants for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Section 18 deals with reports and information to be sent to the Minister.  As I have said earlier, I hope these reports will be acted upon.</P>
    <P>There is always the danger when a Minister is empowered to appoint people to any board that he may appoint them because of their political persuasion rather than any other qualification.  I hope that people from Údarás na Gaeltachta, An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the universities, third level colleges and those who have already made a name for themselves in the marine industry, will be considered for such positions.  People with vision, expertise and commitment to this industry should be appointed to the board.  The chief executive and the board members are important and only people of the highest calibre should be selected. I hope the Minister will be able to do that when the time comes.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the Marine Institute is coming late in the day &mdash; is fearr go mall ná go breá.  There are other areas I am concerned with, namely, the powers and the authorities of the institute.  I do not know how effective they will be. There does not appear to be a commitment to site headquarters in any specific place; there will be branches all over the country.  Previous speakers asked to have the headquarters in Dublin, in the south and in the west. Coming from the constituency of Donegal South-West, where we have the major fishing port of Killybegs, there are many people there who have a great knowledge of fishing and the marine.  If the Minister is to select a place, perhaps Killybegs would also come into his reckoning.</P>
    <P>I hope adequate resources will be given to the institute when established to allow them to carry on this important work which has been neglected for so long. The future of our fishing industry and the development of this great national resource will depend on the effectiveness of the institute.  I hope for the benefit of everyone, particularly for the people I represent from coastal areas and for the <Col N="1508" /> economy in general that they will be successful in their endeavours.  If they are we will be able to thank them on behalf of all the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Noonan, Limerick West) Michael J. (Limerick West) Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick West</i>): I thank Deputies from all sides for their valuable contributions which ranged far and wide &mdash; we fished very extensively all day.  Many of the points raised were very wide of the mark, indeed, some were inaccurate.  I will reply to the pertinent points but not to the wide ranging points raised.  I will also respond to areas where inaccuracies were stated as I want to put the record straight.</P>
      <P>I agree with many Deputies that the appointment of the board and the chief executive is of paramount importance. The calibre of the board and the chief executive will determine the outcome for good or bad of the Marine Institute.  I should like to give a commitment this afternoon that the members of the board and the chief executive will be of the highest calibre and will be selected for what they can contribute to research into all areas of the marine rather than for reasons outlined by many Deputies.</P>
      <P>I have taken note of all the contributions which were in keeping with the Bill, and other contributions as well, and I will comment on a number of them in due course.  I would like to avail of the opportunity to remind Deputies of my opening remarks regarding the purpose and the main element of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill enables me to establish the Marine Institute.  In so doing it seeks to address the necessity in a maritime nation like ours for the development of marine resources.  The marine area constitutes a major but under-developed natural resource and offers significant opportunities in terms of wealth and employment creation for a broad range of industries.  We cannot, however, capitalise on these opportunities until we can measure the resources, understand how they behave and devise the most effective methods for their exploitation.  I feel that the Marine Institute will fill the gap in our knowledge.  It will provide the neccessary <Col N="1509" /> vehicle which is so important for the development of the marine resources throughout a wide range of sectors.</P>
    <P>It is my earnest hope that the Marine Institute will play a leading role in the development of marine industries in Ireland.  Indeed, the institute will be an essential element in the development of these industries.  As has been stated by many Deputies today, there are a wide range of organisations involved in marine research in Ireland and the purpose of the Marine Institute Bill is to co-ordinate and to bring together the work of these organisations.  By this co-ordination both the gaps and the overlaps which currently exist between Government Departments and other agencies operating both within and outside the marine field, will be eliminated. It will also ensure the rational development of the resources.  The establishment of the institute will lead to a major improvement in the efficiency and the effectiveness of the marine research undertaken within the State.</P>
    <P>I come now to deal with some of the points raised.  Deputy Taylor-Quinn made statements regarding the funding of the institute and the whole marine related area.  I have stated that £900,000 is included in the Estimate for all research and development activities, including the Marine Institute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>How much for the institute?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> It is £110,000, but that is all that will be required this year.  It is in 1991 that the funding will be required because at the time the board and the chief executive will be appointed.  The funding being made available this year will be adequate to meet their needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Taylor-Quinn that we should learn from other European countries.  The purpose of the task force was to examine that aspect and it has been taken into account very positively in drawing up plans for the institute.  The question of the gross registered tonnage was raised.  Of course, that does not come <Col N="1510" /> in under the Bill but, being courteous to the Deputy, as I always am&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I would not like to be victimised in that way.</P>
      <P>The increase in research manpower which has been authorised will probably be allocated to new fisheries research and various aspects of aquacultural development. I understand the first of these appointments will be made very shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The institute will have a single headquarters. Many Deputies agree that it makes no sense to relocate all marine research to this headquarters because marine research by its very nature has to be carried out in a wide range of places and at a number of coastal locations. Research in university laboratories will be associated with the work of the institute through an active programme of contract funding so that the universities can <Col N="1511" /> carry out pure research to back up the research of the institute.  The intention of section 22 (4) is to provide an incentive to discoverers and inventors to ensure that those people do not leave the institute as the Deputy feels might happen. UCG have no data on fish stocks which could form a data base.  The fisheries research centre is the only agency active in the field of scientific resource evaluation.</P>
    <P>Many Opposition Deputies raised the matter of EC funding for research and it has been suggested that opportunities of finding ways and means of utilising EC funding were not taken up.  In 1989 and 1990 a total of £1.72 million was allocated by the EC to Irish led research projects. Additional projects in which Irish scientists were involved as co-workers &mdash; not as project leaders &mdash; received £0.84 million. This gives a combined total of £2.56 million allocated directly and indirectly during those years.  Funding will continue to be allocated.  Deputy Howlin mentioned funding to EOLAS for research. That funding will be earmarked for marine research and will not be absorbed by EOLAS for general research.  I have dealt with the funding for the institute in 1990.</P>
    <P>There will be specific programmes of research.  The decision on the programmes of research will be one of the first tasks of the board of the institute.  It would not be appropriate for me to preempt what decisions will be taken by the board in that regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore raised the definition of the seabed.  That is outlined in the Bill. &ldquo;Marine&rdquo; means &ldquo;of, near, concerned with the sea and tidal waters&rdquo;.  That is the definition, so that does not preclude the seabed which is near or of the sea.  The Continental Shelf is not excluded from the functions of the institute.  I explained that in depth in my speech, it is included with a number of other areas in section 4 (1) of the Bill which defines the institute's general functions.</P>
    <P>Significant funds have already been received by Irish research agencies under EC fisheries and aquaculture research programmes.  Applications for funding <Col N="1512" /> under the EC MAST programme, which is marine, science and technology, are in the EC pipeline so there is no slip-up there so far as the Department are concerned.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out in my speech, arrangements will be made for the inclusion or association of marine research agencies with the new institute.  This is also provided in sections 4 and 8 of the Bill.  It would not be appropriate, and would be unnecessarily restrictive, to name the agencies in the Bill.  This matter also was raised by a number of Deputies.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Marine have already dealt with the question of fish quotas and work has commenced on the preparation of the case for improvement on quotas for Irish fishermen in the context of the review of the Common Fisheries Policy which will be taking place very shortly.  Moneys will be made available to the institute from many sources, including the State and outside agencies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coughlan raised a question about small research agencies and I should like to tell her that State funded research agencies which are not part of any Government Department will be associated with the institute through work commissioned by them.  This is provided for in section 4 (2) (3).</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy raised a number of points to which I should like to respond. He referred to the purchase of boats.  It is not true to say that people cannot buy new boats.  However, because of EC limitations on tonnage the size of the fleet is limited and that means that if new tonnage is added to the fleet old tonnage must go.  The Deputy referred to the old research vessel and I should like to tell him that that vessel did not go to the breakers' yard.  It was handed over to An Slua Mhuiri in 1975 and for the last four years it has been fishing out of Howth under private ownership.  I should like to tell the Deputy that Ireland has a national research vessel which has been operating since the mid-seventies.  The <i>Lough Beltra</i> is operating very successfully for the Department of the Marine, BIM, the geological survey, the universities and other agencies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1513" /> Deputy Deasy said he understood that the Department of the Marine have one engineer.  I should like to tell him that there are four marine engineers/ surveyors in the Department of the Marine, three stationed in Dublin and one stationed in Cork.  In addition, there are 16 civil engineers employed by the Department.  I should like to correct another inaccuracy by Deputy Deasy. The forehore is now under the control of the Department of the Marine and not the Office of Public Works as he stated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Garland was concerned about public awareness.  One of the aims of the Institute, as provided for in section 4 (3), will be to promote and organise seminars, conferences, lectures and so on and to collect, maintain and disseminate information. The Marine Institute will have the functions set out in section 4.  In general they will undertake to co-ordinate, promote and assist in marine research and development and provide such services related to marine research and development that, in the opinion of the institute, would promote economic development and create employment.</P>
    <P>Following the establishment of the Marine Institute the persons currently involved in marine research in State funded organisations may be transferred by agreement from their parent Department to the Department of the Marine and thence to the institute.  Those transfers will be by agreement and will be effected in consultation with all the parties concerned.  It is important that all funding which was previously allocated to marine research and marine related research should continue to be so allocated following the establishment of the institute.  It is because of the universally agreed priority attaching to marine research that it is my aim that the funding allocated to the Marine Institute from the Excherquer and EC sources will be increased in future.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies complained that the establishment of the Marine Institute is coming too late.  I cannot accept that criticism because work on the preparation of the Bill has been taking place for a long time.  We wanted to ensure that <Col N="1514" /> the Bill would cover all the issues which must be part of the Marine Institute.  I am satisfied that the work and the time taken have produced a Bill which will be a blueprint for an institute of which we can all be proud and which will satisfy all our needs in the area of marine research.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies complained that the work of agencies, such as Údarás na Gaeltachta and the universities, is not recognised in the Bill but I should like to draw their attention to sections 4 and 17 which deal with those issues.  I should like to assure members that I am fully aware of the contribution made by those agencies to marine research in Ireland and it is my intention to encourage a continuation of that contribution.  The Marine Institute will harness the expertise of those agencies in their work in the future.</P>
    <P>I agree with those who pointed out that the board of the institute and the chief executive will have a major bearing on the success of the work of the institute. It is important to emphasise that we must choose a chief executive and board members of the highest calibre.  For that reason I have provided in paragraph 2 of the Schedule that the members of the board shall be appointed by virtue of their experience in fields of expertise relevant to the functions of the institute.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the importance of the collection, maintenance and dissemination of information on marine research.  I agree that that is most important and to ensure that it will happen I have included section 4 (2) (e) which provides that the Marine Institute shall have the function to collect, maintain and disseminate information relating to marine matters.</P>
    <P>The other points raised by Members will be taken into consideration by me and the Department and, in due course, will be considered by the institute when preparing their programme of work.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That The Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to establish a comprehensive framework for the radiological protection of the public in this State.  The Bill provides for the establishment of a radiological protection institute, to be called the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, the dissolution of the Nuclear Energy Board and the transfer of the assets and liabilities of the board to the institute on the dissolution of the board.  The Bill provides for a legal and regulatory framework for the radiological protection of the public both in normal circumstances and in emergencies.  The enactment of this Bill will enable Ireland to ratify three important international conventions in the nuclear field.  Some of the provisions of the Bill derive from the requirements of these conventions.</P>
      <P>I will later outline in more detail the provisions of the Bill.  I propose to move, at the end of this Stage, motions for the approval by this House, pursuant to Article 29.5.2 of the Constitution, of the terms of these three international conventions and of an agreement between Ireland and the International Atomic Energy Agency in relation to the provision by that agency of technical assistance. I will describe these conventions and the agreement later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I would like to outline the necessity for radiological protection, the background to the Nuclear Energy Board and the institute and the Government's policy, objectives and strategy in relation to nuclear safety and radiological protection. While it has become an emotive subject in recent years, I am not sure <Col N="1516" /> if many people know very much about radiation and it might be useful to briefly run through some basic facts about this important subject.</P>
    <P>Radioactivity and the radiation which it produces have always been present in the universe and on earth.  However, we cannot see, smell or feel it and, in fact, its existence has been known for less than a century.  It is now known that people constantly receive doses of radiation from natural sources.  Radioactive materials contained in the earth's rocks, soil, air and water give rise to external radiation doses, that is, from a source outside the body, and internal doses, from radioactive substances in the food we eat and the air we breathe.  Radiation is also constantly showered on the earth from outer space.  In addition, following the discovery and invention of uses of radiation, people receive doses from man-made sources such as the various stages involved in the generation of electricity in nuclear power stations, the accidental release of radioactive meterials from nuclear facilities and equipment, the nuclear weapons tests of the fifties and sixties and the use of radiation in the medical field for diagnosing and treating diseases.  The adverse effects of radiation on human tissue were noticed shortly after its discovery.  There is still a lot which is unknown about the effects of radiation, particularly at low doses, but it is accepted that the damage which it causes to human cells depends on the level of radiation dose.  High doses can kill cells and cause death within a short period of time.  Low doses would not cause immediate death but may cause changes to human cells and lead in time to cancers or genetic damage.  However, it appears that radiation damage is not uniform.  Not everyone is similarly affected by the same dose, but what is clear is that a person receiving a dose has a greater risk of suffering adverse effects than if he did not.  There is, of course, no difference between the effects of a given amount of natural radiation and the same amount of a man-made source of radiation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1517" /> It is not possible to completely eliminate doses of radiation.  What can be done is to attempt to minimise the doses from both natural and artificial sources. General principles of radiation protection have been developed over the years and have been widely adopted. These principles are reviewed in the light of developments in relation to the understanding of the effects of radiation.  They involve a system of control by a competent national authority whereby only those activities involving radiation doses which are justified by the benefits which they produce are permitted.</P>
    <P>In addition, permitted exposures must be as low as reasonably achievable and doses received by individuals from the activity must be below specified dose limits.  These principles have been applied in international standards of radiation protection for many years in a more systematic way to some man-made uses. These international standards have been adopted in European Community laws and have been implemented and supervised up to now by the Nuclear Energy Board in their licensing system for the use of radioactive substances.  Increasingly, however, attention is being given to a more systematic application of the principles to exposure to natural sources and to other man-made uses such as medical doses and international standards may be extended in the future to these other sources of exposure.</P>
    <P>I will turn now to the Nuclear Energy Board.  The reason for the proposal to dissolve the Nuclear Energy Board and replace it with a Radiological Protection Institute is not because of any dissatisfaction with the board's ability to implement their functions, such as the licensing system or any of the board's other activities.  On the contrary, the board's expertise and performance over the years have been quite satisfactory. The reasons for this Bill are more to do with the fact that the Nuclear Energy (An Bord Fuinnimh Nuicleigh) Act, 1971, and the organisation established under that Act is no longer appropriate or sufficiently comprehensive to deal with the <Col N="1518" /> radiological protection issues which we wish to confront today.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the 1971 Act was to establish a body to regulate a nuclear power programme.  During the sixties a nuclear power station for Ireland was under consideration and Ireland's accession to the EURATOM Treaty along with the other European Community Treaties was anticipated.  There was also a growing interest in the use of radioactive substances in industry and for research as well as in the medical field. With the rapid growth worldwide in the development of this new technology, the Government were acutely aware of the need for expert advice on the subject.</P>
    <P>The Government established a committee in 1965 to advise on the composition and functions of the board and on the basis of recommendations of this committee, the Bill to establish the board was drafted.  The functions of the board, as provided for in the 1971 Act, are to advise the Government and individual Ministers on all aspects of nuclear energy and to keep themselves informed of developments in nuclear energy with particular reference to the implications for the State of such developments.  In particular they were to advise on all aspects of the acquisition, location, operation, etc. of research reactors or other nuclear devices for training or research purposes, to advise the Minister on proposals for nuclear power stations, to prepare safety codes for radioactive substances and devices, and to promote knowledge, proficiency and research in nuclear science and technology.</P>
    <P>There was a clear link between the establishment of the board and the consideration of a nuclear power station for Ireland.  This link is demonstrated in the fact that the announcement by the Government in 1973 of their approval in principle of the ESB's proposal for a nuclear power station accompanied the announcement of the coming into operation of the 1971 Act.</P>
    <P>In order to fill in the historical background of the Nuclear Energy Board I will mention briefly the considerations which led to the abandonment of the <Col N="1519" /> nuclear power project.  In February 1979 the Government authorised the ESB to complete the planning process for the project but not to enter into any commitments until the Government decided whether the project should go ahead.  The Government also decided that a public inquiry would be held to deal with all the relevant issues.  However, one month later, a very serious accident occurred at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in the USA.  This accident highlighted the safety risks that accompanied nuclear power and caused a much greater emphasis to be given everywhere to the safety issue in any decision on nuclear power.  As well as the safety issue, the economic recession which followed the oil crisis of 1979 caused a downturn in electricity demand.  By 1980 it was clear that an early decision on a nuclear power plant was not necessary from the point of view of meeting electricity demand and nuclear generation, in particular, was not appropriate until the safety implications of the Three Mile Island accident could be fully evaluated.</P>
    <P>As the risks arising from nuclear power became clearer, successive Governments decided that nuclear power would not be used for the generation of electricity in Ireland.  The ESB have expanded their natural gas and coal generation facilities and have no longer any plan for a nuclear station.  The land that the ESB acquired at Carnsore Point, County Wexford, for the nuclear power station is to be put to agricultural use and, where applicable, a portion of this land is to be used for afforestation.  The decision not to build a nuclear power station in Ireland means that a major part of the Nuclear Energy Board's original functions and the corresponding provisions in the 1971 Act are redundant.  The board have, of course, continued to carry out their other functions. These are the provision of advice to the Government and Ministers on nuclear matters, the regulation by licence of activities involving radioactive substances, the monitoring of ionising radiation in the environment and of the exposure of persons employed on work <Col N="1520" /> with radiation and the provision of library and information services.  It is now time to re-examine and refocus the functions of the board so as to express their main role as the centre for radiological protection of the public as clearly as possible.</P>
    <P>The board were the object of criticism after the Chernobyl accident in 1986 in relation to Ireland's response to that accident. However, there were very few such bodies in the countries affected by the accident which did not escape criticism. The widespread contamination arising from that accident highlighted deficiencies in the preparedness of countries, particularly those without developed nuclear technology, to deal with major radiological emergencies.  In Ireland the resources available to the board were inadequate at that time to enable them to satisfactorily provide the services required of them which were to monitor and determine the extent and location of contamination of the Irish environment, to assess the potential exposure to radiation of the Irish public and to identify the necessity for the introduction of measures to limit such exposures.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the roles of various other responsible bodies and the ability to quickly mobilise them in the event of the emergency had not been pre-planned in a systematic way.  Additional resources were allocated to the board soon after the accident and co-ordinated procedures were quickly devised.  Radiation monitoring showed that, fortunately, Ireland generally was not severely affected by the accident.  An extensive programme of monitoring levels in foodstuffs at processing plants and livestock in certain mountain areas was introduced and is still continuing four years later.  This programme shows that contamination levels monitored did not warrant the introduction of specific control measures, such as a ban on the movement of livestock or meat, and that radioactivity levels in food in Ireland are low and well within the levels determined for international trade.</P>
    <P>However, it is clear that if a similar accident happens at a plant much closer to Ireland than the Chernobyl plant the effects could be severe.  As Deputies will <Col N="1521" /> be aware, an emergency plan for nuclear accidents based on the lessons learned from the Chernobyl accident has been drawn up by an interdepartmental committee. The plan involves the deployment of a network of radiation monitoring devices around the country in order to detect any increases in radiation, and pinpoint the areas of the country seriously affected, a system to enable notification of an accident abroad to be received, the rapid calling together of a co-ordinating body, following a notification or a detection of raised radiation levels, to direct the response and the identification of the roles and functions of the various Government Departments and other bodies in response to an emergency.  The plan is now in its third year of phasing in over four years.  Much of the necessary equipment has been purchased and is operational.  No legislative measures, other than those provided for in sections 31 to 33 of this Bill, are required for the implementation of the emergency plan.</P>
    <P>The necessity for Ireland, as a non-nuclear country, to devote resources and effort to an emergency plan for nuclear accidents is regrettable but essential. However, the reality is that quite a number of countries around the world are operating nuclear power programmes involving the generation of electricity from nuclear energy and a number of others are in the process of developing nuclear power programmes.  We might not like this but we must recognise that these countries have made a choice to use nuclear energy.  However, what we can and must do is insist that those countries which have made that choice must use the best technical, regulatory and safety practices possible, must be fully open about their programmes, taking into account the concerns of other countries in relation to nuclear power, and must demonstrate to international satisfaction that they are operating these programmes according to the highest standards of safety.</P>
    <P>It follows for a country's choice of the nuclear option that while it may feel it has the sovereign right to carry out activities <Col N="1522" /> such as nuclear power within its jurisdiction or control, it must recognise that it has the responsibility to ensure that such activities do not cause damage beyond the limits of its jurisdiction.  It furthermore has the responsibility to ensure that, if damage results from those activities in another State, it must accept liability for such damage and make appropriate preparations such as compensation.</P>
    <P>There are in existence certain international conventions implementing these principles on a limited way by providing for limited compensation of victims in member states of the convention of a nuclear accident occurring in another member state.  The International Atomic Energy Agency are sponsoring work on the review of those conventions and Ireland, which is not party to these conventions, has been prominent in arguing for agreement on a comprehensive revision of those conventions along the lines of the polluter pays principle.  There are expectations that substantial improvements will be made to the conventions over the next year or two and I will continue to keep the pressure on to ensure that there is no slippage on this.</P>
    <P>We must not forget, of course, that prevention is better than cure.  As I said earlier, it is vitally important that those countries which have chosen the nuclear option must put safety before any other considerations.</P>
    <P>I believe that the best way to ensure that the highest standards of safety are being achieved and maintained is to have an independent, international inspectorate established to verify the application of such standards.  Within the European Community, we have proposed that the Commission establish such an inspectorate for the Community.  We have pointed out that the Commission has sufficient power to do this under the EURATOM Treaty and that it must remember it has a duty to protect all of the peoples of the Community.  I look to the Commission to bring forward a realistic proposal, and to nuclear member states to accept that they must be seen to be safe.  Some months ago in response <Col N="1523" /> to repeated requests from Ireland, the Commission announced a modest proposal to reintroduce inspection and verification of member states monitoring facilities for discharges of radiation. While this is welcome there is a need to go much further.</P>
    <P>The nearest nuclear installations to Ireland are, of course, those on the west coast of the United Kingdom.  Successive Irish Ministers for Energy have conveyed to the UK authorities Ireland's concerns in relation to the UK nuclear industry. These concerns have focused on Sellafield, as Deputies will be aware, but we should not forget the risks associated with the operation of the old magnox reactors, with their outdated technology and inadequate standards that would not meet current day requirements.  The UK authorities themselves admit that the magnox reactors cannot meet todays safety standards. I am arranging to meet with Mr. John Wakeham, the UK Secretary of State for Energy, in the near future, and I will be putting the Irish case about aspects of the nuclear industry strongly to him.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt in anyone's mind that the Government policy of direct contact with the UK authorities has had some success.  The significant decrease in discharges from Sellafield, the closure of two older magnox reactors, the decision not to go ahead with the proposal to store radioactive waste in caverns under the Irish sea, the cancelling of the Dounreay reprocessing plant project are all due largely to consistent opposition from Ireland, the Isle of Man, the Scandinavian countries as well as groups within the UK and public opinion generally becoming more aware of the risks to which they are exposed.  I am comitted to the continuation of this policy to achieve our aims.</P>
    <P>Ireland takes a lead role in international fora in which nuclear safety is discussed.  At the EC the International Atomic Energy Agency and International Energy Agency Ireland have consistently supported the greatest emphasis being placed on safety related <Col N="1524" /> actions whenever nuclear energy is raised.  At the London Dumping Convention, the international organisation which deals with dumping at sea, Ireland has promoted the continuation of the existing moratorium on the dumping of radioactive waste at sea.  In the context of the Paris Commission for the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Land-Based Sources, in the north-east Atlantic region, Ireland has twice called for the closure of Sellafield, and has got considerable sympathy for our concerns. Ireland has played a major part at recent meetings of the Paris Commission in reaching agreement on the elimination of radioactive discharges and the use of best available technology.  These are practical, worthwhile achievements which will contribute to the highest standards of nuclear safety.</P>
    <P>While we must give attention to the existence of nuclear risks arising from installations abroad, it is also necessary to devote energy to radiation problems occurring at home.  I referred earlier to the fact that people constantly receive doses of radiation from radioactive materials contained in the earth's rocks, soil, air and water.  One of the major natural radiation sources is radon gas which is released from radioactive materials in the earth.</P>
    <P>The concentration of the radioactive materials in the regions of the earth varies according to the geology of the region. Radon, as a gas, can accumulate in buildings and in certain regions of the world with a high incidence of radon. This can cause high radiation doses to the occupants.  Studies carried out in Ireland by UCD indicate that approximately 2 per cent of Irish dwellings &mdash; concentrated in certain regions of the country &mdash; may have indoor radon accumulations giving rise to about eight times the average natural background radiation dose in Ireland.  The Nuclear Energy Board are carrying out further studies on the question.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that the EC has recently approved a grant worth 100,000 ECUs for a research programme co-ordinated by the Geological Survey of Ireland <Col N="1525" /> and involving the NEB, Irish universities and German interests, on the geological factors contributing to the incidence of radon.  The results of this programme should help to make it easier to predict radon hazard areas.</P>
    <P>Radon in houses is a relatively recently identified problem.  There is, as yet, no international consensus on the levels at which action by householders should be considered to reduce the radon concentration. However, on the advice of the NEB and based on the most recent research into the problem, the Government decided to adopt a specific reference level &mdash; 200 becquerels per cubic metre &mdash; which we regard as very low but also achievable.  Our commitment to radiation safety is reflected in the adoption of a low reference level, and also in the fact that, even in constrained budgetary circumstances, the NEB were allocated an extra £38,000 in 1990 to enable them to carry out radon surveys.  The institute will continue this research and develop it as necessary.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the international conventions in the nuclear field we wish to ratify and which are dealt with in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Conventions on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident and on Assistance in the case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency were drawn up after the Chernobyl accident in 1986. One of the major issues hindering an effective response to the Chernobyl accident in all countries was the lack of information on the occurrence of the accident and its nature.  This issue was quickly recognised by the international community. The International Atomic Energy Agency convened a meeting after the accident to draw up international conventions to ensure the early notification of nuclear accidents and also to facilitate the provision of assistance to States affected by a radiological emergency. The result was that in September 1986 the two conventions were adopted and opened for signature.  The conventions have each been signed by over 70 countries, including Ireland, and have each been so far ratified by over 40 countries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1526" /> The Notification Convention puts in place a formal regime for the notification of nuclear accidents.  It requires a State which is party to it in which a nuclear accident covered by the convention occurs, to notify other States which are or may be physically affected by the accident, of its nature, the time of its occurrence and its location.</P>
    <P>The convention applies in the event of an accident involving civil nuclear facilities, radioisotopes used for civil purposes or for power generation in space objects. I regard the existence of this convention and its ratification by Ireland as a very positive development in relation to our emergency preparedness.  Obviously, the earlier we are notified of an accident the better we can prepare to deal with its consequences.</P>
    <P>The measures required to implement the Notification Convention include the notification of a competent authority and a point of contact.  The Bill provides that the institute will be the competent authority. Under the emergency plan, the Garda Sióchána Communications Centre is the point of contact for receiving notifications of an accident.  The International Atomic Energy Agency have arranged for the use of the World Meteorological Organisation's Global Telecommunications System &mdash; GTS &mdash; and the emergency plan provides that the Meteorological Service will immediately contact the Garda Síochána Communications Centre on receipt of a notification through the GTS.  Following notification of an accident to the Garda Síochána Communications Centre by any route, the centre will contact the institute, and the emergency plan will, if necessary, be brought into play.</P>
    <P>In order to implement the convention it is also required that Ireland be in a position to notify other countries, despite the fact that the likelihood that the use of radioisotopes in Ireland could give rise to a notifiable incident is remote.  It is also required that confidentiality of confidential information received as a result of a notification be protected.  The Bill makes provision for these requirements.</P>
    <P>The Assistance Convention provides <Col N="1527" /> for States parties to co-operate between themselves and with the IAEA to facilitate prompt assistance in the event of an accident or radiological emergency.  This convention has special importance for a small non-nuclear country like Ireland because, in the event of an emergency we would be able to call on assistance from other States party to the convention. In the event of radiological emergency a State party may request assistance in the form of personnel, equipment or materials from another State party or an international organisation. The convention provides that the assisting party may offer assistance without costs but that, if it is provided on a reimbursement basis, the requesting State must reimburse the assisting party. There are certain optional provisions relating to the granting to the assisting party by the requesting State of certain privileges, immunities and rights to compensation for death, injury or losses in relation to the assistance duties.</P>
    <P>Certain provisions of the Bill enable Ireland to ratify this convention.  The institute is to be the Irish competent authority for making and receiving requests for assistance although the making of requests for or offers of assistance is subject to the consent of the Minister because of the need for co-ordination with the nuclear accident committee established under the emergency plan. This committee is chaired by an officer of the Minister.</P>
    <P>In order not to inhibit the availability of assistance under the convention to Ireland I propose to adopt the optional provisions of the convention in relation to the privileges and immunities to be afforded to personnel providing assistance in Ireland.  The Government will make an order &mdash; under the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Acts, 1967 and 1976 &mdash; to provide for the granting of privileges and immunities.  The Bill before the House covers other privileges, immunities and compensation provisions which are referred to in the convention but which are not covered by the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Acts. <Col N="1528" /> The Bill also makes provision for the necessary confidentiality requirements of the convention.</P>
    <P>The Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material was drawn up in 1979 following concern on the part of governments about the possibility of terrorism involving uranium and plutonium, which are materials used in the nuclear power industry but also capable of being used in nuclear weapons.  The convention lays down standard protection measures for these nuclear materials while in international transport, involving notification of shipments, security escorts and surveillance.  The convention also requires states parties to make certain acts such as robbery, embezzlement, extortion or sabotage serious criminal offences and to subject offenders to prosecution or extradition.</P>
    <P>In order to implement the convention, it will be necessary to ensure that any shipments of the relevant nuclear materials to or from Ireland are protected in accordance with the requirements of the convention.  The institute will be in a position to do this under the Nuclear Energy (General Control of Fissile Fuels, Radioactive Substances and Irradiating Apparatus) Order, 1977, which will be kept in force under the Bill, when enacted.  Under this order the custody, use, manufacture, importation, distribution, transportation, exportation or other disposal of radioactive substances is prohibited except under licence from the board.  Conditions may be attached to such licences.  The institute, which will take over the operation of this licensing system, will impose licence conditions on importers, exporters or transporters as the case may be, of the nuclear materials covered by the convention obliging them to protect those materials in accordance with the requirements of the convention. In practice the transport to or from Ireland of these materials is rare.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes acts of robbery, embezzlement, etc. involving nuclear materials, as described by the convention, offences and lays down severe penalties.  The Bill also establishes the necessary extra territorial jurisdiction to <Col N="1529" /> prosecute offenders in relation to offences committed abroad, where the offender is not extradited to the relevant State.  In order to ensure that extradition may take place to another State party to the convention with which we do not already have an extradition agreement, it would be necessary for the Government to make an order under section 8 of the Extradition Act, 1965, enabling extradition to that State to take place subject to the provisions of the Extradition Act.  This will be done, if necessary, before we ratify the convention.</P>
    <P>I am taking this opportunity, while the House is debating this Bill, and being asked to approve the terms of the three conventions referred to, to seek the approval by the House, pursuant to Article 29.5.2º of the Constitution, of the terms of an agreement between Ireland and the International Atomic Energy Agency in relation to the provision by that agency of technical assistance to Ireland.  This agreement does not require any legislation to enable Ireland to sign it but because it technically may give rise to a charge on public funds the approval by Dáil Éireann of its terms is necessary.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the International Atomic Energy Agency which is an autonomous intergovernmental organisation under the aegis of the United Nations established to promote the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, to ensure that nuclear materials intended for peaceful uses are not diverted for military purposes, and to establish standards of safety in this field.  Ireland became a member of the agency in 1970.  Under its technical assistance programme the agency makes available the services of experts and provides scientific training and equipment to member states in the nuclear and radiation protection fields. This assistance is not the same as the emergency assistance covered by the assistance convention but relates to the development of member states' capacity and resources in the nuclear and radiation protection fields.  This technical assistance is made available on the basis of the agreement before the House which is a standard agreement made between the <Col N="1530" /> agency and member states wishing to obtain technical assistance.  The agreement provides that the agency's safety standards are to be applied to the operations making use of the technical assistance, that the assistance is to be applied for peaceful purposes only, that the Government of the member state is responsible for the protection of any materials or equipment provided, that title to equipment is vested in the Government and that any dispute concerning the agreement that cannot be settled by negotiation is to be submitted to arbitration.  The reason for the charge on public funds is that 8 per cent of the value of training and equipment grants provided is to be refunded to cover the agency's administrative costs.  In practice this is payable by the recipient of the assistance.  In the case of assistance to the institute, which is mainly funded by the Exchequer through the Vote of my Department, there will therefore be a charge on public funds.  However, it is clear that the benefits to be derived by the State from this arrangement far outweigh the cost to be paid.</P>
    <P>I will now outline the main features of the Bill.  Part I contains preliminary and general sections setting out the short title, definitions, provisions relating to the laying of orders and regulations before the Houses of the Oireachtas and provisions relating to expenses.  Part II deals with the establishment of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, the dissolution of the Nuclear Energy Board and the transfer of the assets and liabilities of the board to the institute.  I will appoint by order a day to be the establishment day for the establishment of the institute, the dissolution of the board and the transfer of assets and liabilities. The main functions of the institute, as set out in section 7, are to carry out monitoring of radiation in the environment, to advise the Government on radiological safety matters, to assist in emergency planning and response, to monitor developments on radiation matters in order to keep the Government <Col N="1531" /> informed, and to carry out research.  Section 8 outlines a range of particular functions and section 9 enables me to confer by order additional functions on the institute.</P>
    <P>These functions constitute a comprehensive charter for an effective radiological protection body capable of confronting and dealing with all the radiological problems facing the State and its citizens.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains certain provisions to ensure that the normal and proper controls which are exercised over noncommercial State-sponsored bodies are available in relation to the institute. These controls relate to financial, budgetary and staffing matters as well as to the provision of information to the Minister on its activities.  It is reasonable, given that most of the institute's budget will be provided from the Exchequer, that the Minister of the day should have the right to check on the expenditure of this money.  The main control provision in the Bill on this issue is section 20.  Similar provisions were included in the legislation establishing FÁS and Teagasc to take two examples.  There is no intention of applying these provisions to limit the professional freedom of the institute in the exercise of its functions and they will not be used unless it is absolutely necessary in the public interest.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that the institute will have full professional freedom to carry out these important functions and that on the basis of its scientific knowledge it will be able to freely express the facts as it sees them in the advice which it will give to the Minister and in the information which it will give to the public.</P>
    <P>While one of the main purposes of the institute will be to advise the Government and Ministers on the radiological protection of the population, the institute will be free to disseminate factual information to the public on radiation matters. This is expressly provided for in section 8 (1).  There is no question of prohibiting the institute from making available the facts on radiation matters as it sees them. I envisage a good working relationship <Col N="1532" /> between the Minister of the day and the institute and I certainly will do my best to foster such a relationship.</P>
    <P>On the basis of these considerations I have reviewed certain provisions in the Bill in relation to ministerial controls and directions and I shall move certain amendments on Committee Stage designed to more fully reflect these intentions.</P>
    <P>The institute will consist of a chairman and between six and 11 members and will be able to form committees to advise it on various issues.  The staff of the institute will be headed by a chief executive officer who, apart from the first chief executive officer will be appointed by the institute with my consent.  In order to ensure the effective operation of the institute as and from the establishment day, the first chief executive officer will be appointed by me. The other staff of the institute will be transferred from the board on the establishment day.  The institute will be fortunate to have available to it the considerable expertise and experience of a highly qualified staff.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill outlines a range of powers and controls to ensure the effective protection of the public from radiation hazards.  Section 30 empowers me to make orders regulating activities involving radioactive substances by establishing a licensing system operated by me or by the institute.  In practice, the Nuclear Energy (General Control of Fissile Fuels, Radioactive Substances and Irradiating Apparatus) Order, 1977, which was made under corresponding provisions of the 1971 Act and which will be continued in force under this Act will be the basis of the licensing system and will be operated by the institute.  This part also contains new provisions relating to the protection of the public from the effects of radiological emergencies.</P>
    <P>An important feature of the response to a radiological emergency is the ability to impose control measures to ensure that food with unacceptable levels of contamination do not reach the public or that contaminated food ingredients do not enter the food chain.  The legislative base to enable such measures to be <Col N="1533" /> implemented was not very satisfactory at the time of the Chernobyl accident. While certain measures could have been implemented if it was necessary to do so, an accident with more severe consequences could have required the urgent enactment of additional legislation.  Part III contains sections which provide for comprehensive powers to enable the various Ministers who have responsibilities in relation to the food chain to ensure that radiation doses to the public from food in a radiological emergency are minimised.  There is also provision for the obligatory immediate notification to the institute of any theft, threat of theft, accident or loss of radioactive substances or devices so that any response measures required can be put in place as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Part IV includes certain provisions which are required in order that Ireland can ratify the Notification, Assistance and Protection Conventions.  There is provision for the designation by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the countries which are parties to the Protection Convention so that importers and exporters will be aware of the physical protection requirements for imports from and exports to countries which are not parties to the convention.  There is provision for the protection of the confidentiality of confidential information received pursuant to the operation of the conventions. There is provision to ensure the immunity from customs charges or seizure of equipment sent to, from or through the State for the purposes of the Assistance Convention and also for the payment of compensation for death, injury or losses arising out of that convention.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Protection Convention, the Bill creates offences in relation to the commission of certain acts involving nuclear material and establishes jurisdiction over these offences not only when they are committed in the State but also when they are committed in a convention country and when they are committed elsewhere by an Irish citizen or by a national of a convention country.  This is to ensure that offenders <Col N="1534" /> who are present in the State can be extradited to the relevant convention country or be prosectued in the State if extradition does not take place.  In view of their seriousness, severe penalties are laid down for the offences involving these specified nuclear materials which, as I said earlier, are capable of being used in nuclear weapons and are capable of causing widespread damage.</P>
    <P>I am confident that this Bill will provide a solid and wide ranging framework for the protection of the people of Ireland from the dangers of ionising radiation and I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann declines to give the Bill a Second Reading on grounds that the independence of the proposed Radiological Protection Institute is undermined by the overbearing power over its affairs given to the Minister for Energy.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am pleased to learn of the Minister's willingness to bring forward a series of amendments on Committee Stage.  I will be listening with great interest to his summing up at the end of Second Stage to hear precisely what he has in mind.</P>
      <P>As the Bill now stands it is defective. The most fundamental objection, one with which I do not think the Minister is capable of dealing, is that it is not appropriate that the Radiological Protection Institute be controlled by the Department of Energy.  The Department quite rightly see their primary role as supplying cheap and efficient energy to the Irish people.  In the past, as the Minister noted, that Department sponsored an idea that we should have our own nuclear capacity and they still have the right in the future, if they decided so to do, to again suggest that we should have such capacity, although I think all parties now in the House would regard that as unacceptable and undesirable at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1535" /> However, to suggest that the Minister who would have the authority to introduce nuclear reactors into this country should also be the Minister who controls the safety and the public protection regarding those reactors is wholly inappropriate. If the British Government moved legislation in the Houses of Parliament tomorrow suggesting that their National Radiological Protection Board which is answerable directly to Parliament and not to Government at all &mdash; should be answerable to the Secretary for Energy, as is implied in this Bill, we on this side of the Irish Sea would be absolutely incensed.  We would rightly regard it as very inappropriate that the Secretary for Energy who is promoting the continued expansion of nuclear power in the UK should also be getting a grip on the board that is entitled to advise on the safety of these installations.  It is very hard for the public to believe that the Department have so completely changed their spots that they are no longer considering nuclear capacity and that they are now best placed to deal with the environmental and public health issues involved in radiological protection.</P>
    <P>The Minister present tonight &mdash; with great respect to his ability &mdash; is not an expert in environmental protection or public health. It is quite inappropriate that he should be taking on to himself and his Department these roles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the co-operation of the House in this matter. First, I wish to pay tribute to the management and unions in B &amp; I for their activities in the past in helping to turn around the company.  However, this was done with the help of a considerable injection of taxpayers' funds.  More recently, this House approved the recommendation of the Minister to invest yet another £6 million in this company.  The company have plans to expand their interests.  However, there are also proposals on the horizon for a take-over of B &amp; I by another Irish company. Recently we read that it will cost £5 million to modify and repair the <i>MV Munster.</i> This has to be set against the fact that the ship was leased for a portion of that amount and yet it will take an additional £5 million to make it seaworthy.  This £5 million investment has to be set against the company's performance in recent years: in 1987 the company had losses of £3.6 million; they made a profit of £2.8 million in 1989, and it is expected that they will make a profit of £6.9 million in 1990.  That is before exceptional items and interest are charged to the accounts. We have to ask ourselves what is going on in B &amp; I?  The State has been very tolerant.  This House has been tolerant. We have given them the opportunity to recover and to show their worth.  We have told them that we approve of what the unions and management have been doing and we will encourage them as long as they continue down the road.  Only three weeks ago we gave them an additional £6 million.  Now we find they have taken <Col N="1537" /> delivery of a ship which will cost £5 million to modify and that there is a strike in the company.</P>
      <P>There are 150 people out of work already with the possibility of an extra 500 people this evening if the Labour Court discussions are not satisfactory.  I think it is time this House says to B &amp; I management and unions that &ldquo;enough is enough and we will not tolerate any further disputes of this kind&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This company cannot afford those disputes. Not only were the people who expected to travel on the ship inconvenienced but there has been a dramatic loss of revenue since last Saturday when sailings were cancelled.  The passengers who have been inconvenienced may be lost to B &amp; I for ever.  They may say they will never travel with B &amp; I again as there is another carrier they can use.  Presumably a number of those people used the other carrier.</P>
      <P>B &amp; I are not operating on all fours and they are not in a position to hold anybody to ransom.  This applies to management as much as to the unions.  I cannot say why the dispute got to this stage and why the public have been so inconvenienced and the company's revenue put in danger, but I know this cannot be tolerated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view the action taken was precipitate. I do not know where the blame lies, it could be with either management or unions or on both sides, but it seems to me that the Minister should sit down with both the unions and management &mdash; whatever the outcome of the Labour Court discussions, which I welcome &mdash; and say to them that this cannot happen again.  If necessary the Minister should consult with the company which is seeking to take over or merge with B &amp; I to see whether the company can be turned around and made profitable without putting the State to further expense.  The State is out on a limb.  If this company fail all the investment by the State goes down the drain.  Nobody in the House would like to see that happening.  I want to see an end to this dispute and I hope by the end of the day we will see an end to it.  It is time that B &amp; I were told to <Col N="1538" /> get their act together, because if they do not and the Minister finds he needs to take executive action, Fine Gael will consider supporting him in that action.  It has to be made very clear to all concerned that the State or this House cannot continue to vote an endless supply of money to support B &amp; I if they do not make substantial efforts to guarantee the future of the company.</P>
    <P>I want to put down a marker that the State has made a substantial investment in the company and we need peace and good industrial relations and positive attitudes in the company as well as the support of all personnel who have a contribution to make if the company are to survive in the long term.  That marker must go down today that we want no repetition of this dispute and that an early solution to this problem must be found.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to be able to announce formally to the House that I have just heard from the Labour Court that a satisfactory resolution to the dispute has now been accepted by both parties. This will enable an immediate return of B &amp; I shipping services under full, normal working conditions and the examination of the matter in dispute by the Labour Court.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity of thanking workers, staff and management in B &amp; I for their patience in this matter.  I wish to acknowledge on the Government's behalf that the matter has been resolved. I wish to take this opportunity in the Dáil to reassure customers and the public at large that B &amp; I are back in business from tomorrow morning.  It is quite possible that they will be able to take freight tonight.  I want to make it clear that from tomorrow morning B &amp; I are back in business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While acknowledging the good work on both sides to settle the dispute, I would like to state quite clearly on the Government's behalf and on my own behalf: &ldquo;Let us have no repeat of this type of dispute&rdquo;.  I share the Opposition Deputy's concern about the dispute and the way it went.  The company carry a <Col N="1539" /> major portion of tourist and freight traffic across the Irish Sea.  They also provide important freight services to continental Europe.  The sudden withdrawal of services causes inconvenience and quite frankly our economy cannot afford these disruptions.  In particular our exporters cannot afford them.  They need certainty most of all and anything that undermines their confidence affects our export and trading abilities.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity quite openly of thanking Sealink, who stepped into the breach in recent days and were of considerable assistance.  It is clear that this strike and other disruptions in B &amp; I of late are beginning to damage the company. I am quite convinced that the company will simply not survive in today's demanding market environment if they cannot guarantee the continuity of their services.  The House will recall that earlier this year both Houses of the Oireachtas agreed to provide additional equity of up to £6 million in 1990, bringing the total Government funding over three years to £17 million.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat what I said in Cork last evening, that in the past ten years £80 million of taxpayers' money has been invested in the B &amp; I line.  It is quite clear that that type of funding could not be continued.  I have already told the company that it is my objective &mdash; and I know they share this objective &mdash; to get the company into a position where they will no longer require State funding, and the sooner that happens the better.  I have already announced in this House that I am considering that matter and that I do not rule out any option in regard to the future of the company.  Whatever direction we take, I am convinced it will be for the betterment of the company and the staff, all those who work in B &amp; I. Again I want to take this opportunity of thanking them for seeing the light, as it were, for thinking again, as I asked them to do yesterday, and for displaying in recent hours a lot of common sense.  To take any other course of action or to prolong this dispute would have been a suicide mission.  All involved in B &amp; I <Col N="1540" /> deserve our admiration for thinking again and stepping back from the brink.  I know the Deputies opposite join with me in welcoming that development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Táim-se buíoch díot, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, as an deis seo a thabhairt dom an cheist thábhactach seo a thógáil ar an Athló.</P>
      <P>Arranmore Island is one of the biggest islands off our coast, certainly the biggest off the Donegal coast.  The last census of population indicated that there are almost 800 people living there.  The island has two primary schools with a total teaching staff of five.  The campaign for a post-primary school for this island has been in progress for ten or 15 years. There were ups and downs until eventually five years ago it was decided by the Minister that a post-primary school should be established on Arranmore.  The news at that time was greeted with great joy on the island.  However, five years later very little progress has been made in this regard.</P>
      <P>Five years ago the Department instructed the VEC to purchase a site and make other arrangements so that the school could be built on the island.  The VEC purchased a site known as the Boyle site for which they paid £20,000.  Subsequently the architects from the Department found that the site was not suitable for a school and the VEC had to look for a second site, which they found in the last year, known as the Coll site.  There were difficulties with title deeds but that was sorted out a number of months ago and the site is now available.  I understand the VEC have indicated to the Department that they are anxious to go ahead with the provision of the approved post-primary school on the island but they have not yet received sanction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Sunday evening 90 children aged from between 11 and 18 leave Arranmore Island by ferry for Burtonport from where they have to take buses and other transport to various schools throughout <Col N="1541" /> Donegal, to Falcarragh, Letterkenny, Milford and other places.  Up to the last few years the position was not too bad because most of the pupils had boarding facilities, the girls in Falcarragh and Milford and the boys in St. Eunan's in Letterkenny and Falcarragh.  However, in the last few years boarding facilities for boys have been phased out in Falcarragh and are being phased out in Letterkenny while boarding facilities for girls have been completely phased out in Milford and are being phased out in Falcarragh. Very few of these children are in boarding schools now and more and more have to go into private houses on the mainland until Friday when they return to the island for the weekend.  This incurs great expense for the parents.  I do not think the Government give any remuneration towards these expenses and that is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>I have been on the island a number of weekends and indeed accompanied some of these children to the mainland.  It is a sad and sorry sight to see the parents at the pier on the island waving goodbye to their young children.  The heart is torn out of the island for the major portion of the week when those children are on the mainland.  It also establishes a pattern that leads ultimately to emigration from the island.  In the past few years a number of adults from the island have had to go abroad, to Scotland, England and other countries to earn a livelihood.</P>
    <P>What I would like to find out ón Aire Stáit &mdash; agus fáilte ar ais ón Iodáil.  Chuala mé go ndearna sé gníomh mór ansin &mdash; is the Department's attitude to the post-primary school on Arranmore.  Is the commitment still there to provide this island with this facility?  The people of the island are extremely anxious as to what will happen.  Too much time has passed since the campaign was organised and without there being any result.  Many people on the island would say &mdash; and I agree with them &mdash; that it is the constitutional right of these children to be able to avail of post-primary education at home.  At least they should have the choice.  A number of surveys have been carried out on Arranmore and the vast <Col N="1542" /> majority of parents are most anxious to have the school established on the island.</P>
    <P>I would also remind the Minister that there are post-primary schools on other islands such as Inismór where the enrolment is 50 or 60 and Inis Oírr where the enrolment is under 20.  We do not begrudge these islands their schools, they are entitled to them but at least the children there have the choice of staying on the island or going to the mainland whereas on Arranmore island, with a population of 800 people including 90 or 100 post-primary pupils there has been no visible progress on the provision of a school.  I know there are vocational schools on the mainland, in the west and other places, with fewer than 100 pupils. Therefore there is certainly the required number of pupils on this island to make the school a viable one.</P>
    <P>A suggestion has been put forward that perhaps a temporary building should be provided for at least a year until the school is built.  I understand the Department's architects visited the area recently.  They looked at the ionad pobail on the island and found it to be unsuitable. I cannot understand why because it is a fine building with plenty of space. In my opinion it would be ideal for a temporary dwelling until the permanent school is provided.  A number of other buildings were investigated last year but they were also found to be unsuitable.  In the minute remaining I would remind the Minister gur oileán fíor-Ghaeltachta é Oileán Árann Mhór.  Tá an Ghaeilge ar a dtoil ag na páistí ansin.  Is í an Ghaeilge an teanga teagaisc sa dá scoil ar an oileán. Mar a dúirt mé, tá na deacrachtaí seo acu ach tá siad ag dul ar aghaidh.  Ba mhaith le muintir an oileáin a fháil amach anois an bhfuil sé ar intinn ag an Roinn dul ar aghaidh leis an scoil.  Más rud é go bhfuil, caithfear cead a thabhairt don choiste gairmoideachais dul ar aghaidh agus an suíomh úr fóirstineach a cheannach sa dóigh is gur féidir an scoil a thógáil gan a thuilleadh ama a chur amú.</P>
    <P>An dara rud, an bhfuil aon seans go bhféadfaí áras sealadach a chur ar fáil do na daltaí atá ag fágáil na bunscoile i mbliana sa dóigh gur féidir leo a gcuid <Col N="1543" /> meánoideachais a fháil ar an oileán.  Sílim gur truamhéileach an cás é, na buachaillí agus na cailíní óga a fheiceáil lena gcuid málaí beaga ag fágáil an oileáin Dé Domhnaigh agus ag teacht ar ais Dé hAoine.  Incidentally, there were a number of weekends when they did return to Burtonport and due to the storms they had to remain on the mainland, and some of them had to sleep in boats at Burtonport until the storm was over the following morning.  This is something which should not be allowed to continue sa tír seo agus i gceantair Ghaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Iarraim ar an Aire Stáit, ar an Aire Oideachais í féin, agus ar an Taoiseach, atá ina Aire Gaeltachta, a ndícheall a dhéanamh, agus a insint dúinn an bhfuil sé ar intinn acu an scoil iarbhunoideachais a chur ar fáil ar Oileán Árann Mhór.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil ar dtús leis an Teachta as ucht an cheist seo a chur os comhair na Dála. I 1987, cheannaigh Coiste Gairmoideachais Chontae Dhún na nGall píosa talaimh don scoil nua.  Ní raibh an píosa talaimh seo oiriúnach ag an am agus d'iarr an Roinn ar an gcoiste gairmoideachais píosa talaimh eile a fháil.  Tá an píosa talaimh seo faighte anois ag Coiste Gairmoideachais Contae Dhún na nGall, <Col N="1544" /> agus tá siad ag cur iarratais isteach chuig an Roinn an talamh seo a cheannach.</P>
      <P>Mar is eol don Teachta, caithfimid scrúdú a dhéanamh ar an méid daltaí atá ar an oileán agus, ar ndóigh, ar an méid a bheidh ar an oileán sna blianta atá romhainn.  Tá a fhios agam an gearán atá ag muintir an oileáin seo agus, ar ndóigh, aontaím leis an méid atá ráite ag an Teachta ina thaobh seo.  Caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil an cheist seo pléite ag an Aire Stáit, An Teachta Gallagher.  Is eol don Teachta gurb é polasaí an Rialtais seo ná na hoileáin a chur chun cinn agus tá aidhm againn dul ar aghaidh leis an scoil seo.  Ach caithfimid, mar a dúirt mé, scrúdú a dhéanamh ar an méid daltaí atá ann, agus a bheidh ar an oileán sna blianta atá romhainn.  Ar ndóigh, tá airgead gann.  Tá a fhios ag an Teach an deacracht atá againn.  I mí Márta d'iarramar ar Choiste Gairmoideachais Chontae Dhún na nGall liosta a chur chugainn de na foirgnimh atá ar an oileán agus a bheadh oiriúnach don scoil seo faoi láthair go dtí go mbíonn scoil cheart ann.

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Houses of the Oireachtas (members) pension scheme was extensively revised in 1986.  The amending scheme provided, <i>inter alia,</i> that the definition of &ldquo;widow&rdquo; for pension purposes should be extended to cover widowers.  Accordingly the surviving spouses of deceased female members of the Oireachtas now have the same pension entitlements as the spouses of male members.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 32 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>The Wildlife Act, 1976 gave protected status to the otter and other wild birds and mammals.  The Act also provided for the continuation of traditional otter hunting under licence from the Minister (section 26).</P>
      <P>The otter is classed as an endangered animal in Europe.  Ireland is its last remaining stronghold.  Under the Berne Convention on conservation of European wildlife and natural habitats which Ireland has ratified, it receives the highest possible category of protection.  Contracting parties to the convention are obliged <i>inter alia</i> to prohibit all forms of deliberate capture and killing.</P>
      <P>The Government decided on 27 March 1990 that otter hunting licences should not be issued this year under the Wildlife Act, 1976.</P>

      <P>The Community Support Framework, which was formally adopted by the Commission of the European Communities in October 1989, sets out the assistance which Ireland is to receive from the EC Structural Funds in the period from 1989 up to 1993.  The Community Support Framework makes a commitment of £2.86 billion to Ireland for that period.  This allocation was made under the regulation adopted by the <Col N="1452" /> European Council in June 1988 to increase progressively the Structural Funds to reach a doubling by 1993 over the 1987 position.  Thus the total level of the Structural Funds and the amount to be provided to Ireland, apart from some additional allocations from the reserve to be allocated to new Community initiatives, is firmly established up to 1993. The availability of Structural Fund assistance to Ireland in that period cannot therefore be affected by the developments referred to in the question and action in the context of the Irish Presidency does not arise.</P>

      <P>The proposal for a new Bank for Eastern Europe was originally put forward by the French authorities last autumn.</P>
      <P>At the Summit meeting in December last the European Council approved the creation of a bank in which the Community would hold a majority of the shares and which would draw its membership from a wide range of countries. The Council envisaged that Community participation would be primarily through the participation of individual member states, although the Community as an institution and the European Investment Bank would also participate.  The mechanism for creating such an institution is by international agreement between all the founding members.</P>
      <P>France, as initiator, summoned an international conference and the responsibility of the Irish Presidency was to ensure, within the Conference, that the interests of the Community were served in the establishment of the bank. The Irish Presidency has taken an active role both in achieving consensus on issues of interest to the Community and subsequently safeguarding those interests in the wider negotiating forum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each member of the bank will have a <Col N="1455" /> representative on the board of governors where the ultimate responsibility for the bank lies.  The board of directors will consist of 23 members.  Eleven of these will be appointed by governors representing the member states of the Community, the Community itself and the European Investment Bank.  Each director will have an alternate and it is intended that, at any one time, Ireland will hold either a director or an alternate post.</P>

      <P>Separate data are not available for profit repatriations by foreign industry.  They are included in the debit entry for &ldquo;profits, dividends and royalties etc.&rdquo; in the balance of international payments statement published by the CSO. The latest published data refer to the fourth quarter and year 1989, and show that gross outflows of profits, dividends and royalties amounted to £2,337 million last year.</P>
      <P>These outflows, to the extent that they relate to industry, should be seen in the context of the sector's turnover, which last year amounted to around £18 billion, and of industrial exports of almost £12 billion in 1989.  The increase in outflows last year was associated with a very strong performance by manufacturing industry, with the volume of output growing by 12.7 per cent and the volume of manufactured exports increasing by an estimated 14 per cent.  Reflecting this performance, average quarterly employment in manufacturing industry increased by 2.3 per cent last year &mdash; the first such increase since 1980.  The growth of output, exports, and employment was mainly attributable to the high technology sector, which is predominantly foreign owned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ability to repatriate the profits <Col N="1456" /> earned by their Irish subsidiaries is an important factor in attracting foreign firms to locate here.  The importance of such firms is illustrated by the fact that, in 1986, the latest year for which detailed statistics are available, foreign owned enterprises accounted for 41 per cent of total manufacturing employment.  IDA data indicate that in 1989, foreign industry created 8,400 new jobs, bringing their total employment to 89,000 people; in 1988 they purchased £2.8 billion worth of goods and services in Ireland and in the period 1983 to 1989, their grant-aided investment in Ireland amounted to £1.3 billion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister for Health, I would obviously be concerned at any increase in the levels of infectious diseases.  The situation in relation to the specific diseases referred is as follows.</P>
      <P>Measles is a disease which is preventable by means of vaccination.  In 1985, some 9,903 cases were reported. However, following the introduction of vaccination this had fallen to 201 cases by 1987.  In recent years the reported incidence of measles has shown signs of increasing and this corresponds with a decline in the uptake of vaccination. However, following the introduction of the MMR vaccination against measles, mumps and rubella and with uptake figures of MMR now in excess of 80 per cent I am optimistic that the incidence of measles can be considerably reduced and eventually eliminated.</P>
      <P>Mumps only became a notifiable disease in October 1988 so that a direct comparison between the figures for 1988 and 1989 is not possible.  However, with the introduction of MMR, the incidence should also be considerably reduced.</P>
      <P>There were three significant outbreaks of salmonellosis which contributed to the increased figures for 1989.  Apart from these outbreaks it is difficult to say to what extent the increased figures for 1989 may be due to an increase in the incidence of salmonellosis generally or an improvement in notifications to my Department following on an increased public awareness to the risks of salmonellosis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the increase in the incidence of whooping cough during 1989 and this is a cause of concern to me.  Unfortunately, because of concerns felt by <Col N="1469" /> some parents arising from court proceedings alleging brain damage which it is claimed was due to whooping cough vaccine, the uptake of this vaccination falls far short of what is desirable.  The levels of immunity are therefore lower than what they might otherwise be.</P>
    <P>The increase in the reported incidence of Type A Viral Hepatitis occurred primarily as a result of an outbreak in the Westmeath community care area in the last quarter of 1989.  The situation here is being closely monitored by the director of community care for the area and by medical officers in my Department.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to again point out that vaccinations against a wide range of infectious diseases are now available as part of our primary immunisation programme.  These include vaccinations against diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, polio, measles, mumps and rubella and I would urge parents to see that their children have these vaccinations and thereby protect their children against these diseases.</P>

      <P>A detailed examination of the accident and emergency services in Cork was carried out by officers of my Department, the Southern Health Board and representatives of the Mercy and South Infirmary Victoria Hospitals.  A number of organisational changes were made to improve services including the introduction of computer facilities at the accident and emergency department at Cork Regional <Col N="1470" /> Hospital.  In addition, a grant of £335,000 was made available in 1988 to upgrade accident and emergency and outpatient accommodation at the Mercy Hospital pending the further development of the hospital which is currently being planned.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71 and 72 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there is a difficulty in relation to enrolments for the coming school year for Scoil Mochua, Aghards, Celbridge and that this difficulty lies behind the Deputy's questions.</P>
      <P>My Department's position is that the school accommodation which has been provided in Celbridge by the representatives of the Catholic religion, with State support, is adequate to meet current and foreseeable requirements.  In order to ensure that optimum use is made of the accommodation my Department insisted that a joint enrolment policy must operate between the schools in Celbridge town and Scoil Mochua.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of establishing a joint enrolment policy is a matter for the school authorities under the auspices of <Col N="1473" /> the providers of the schools whose representative in this case is the Catholic Archbishop of Dublin, the patron of the schools.  The patron in exercise of his overall responsibilities in relation to the schools in the area has sought to ensure that a common enrolment policy which would best serve the educational interests of the children in the whole Celbridge area would operate.</P>
    <P>I do not consider that it would be either appropriate or helpful to refer to specific communications with my Department in this case.</P>

      <P>The matter of teacher staffing levels in individual schools in a VEC scheme is a matter for the chief executive officer and the committee.  It would not be in accordance with normal practice to supply the information sought in respect of the staffing of individual vocational schools &mdash; in any case that information is not available in my Department.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that, in the context of the resources available for the VEC sector generally, the teaching staff resources allocated to the County Kildare VEC for the current session are sufficient to enable that committee to provide an adequate educational programme, and that that committee's teacher allocation does not compare unfavourably with the national average.</P>

      <Col N="1474" /> The matter of the allocation of teaching staff resources to VECs in respect of the next school session, 1990-91, is currently under consideration in my Department.</P>

      <P>I understand that the owners of Carysfort are having discussions with a number of interested parties regarding the property.  I understand that these discussions have not been fully finalised and therefore it would not be appropriate for me to make any statement on the matter.</P>
