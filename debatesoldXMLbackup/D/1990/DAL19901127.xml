      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps at this stage the Taoiseach has not had time to consider the possibility of giving the President <Col N="2" /> additional powers.  Will he give an undertaking to the House that he will give it some consideration, perhaps at a future date?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is something which can be considered at any time but I do not have specific proposals from anybody.  However, I will keep it in mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept, with an expanded role for the President, that Mrs. Mary Robinson would complement the work of the Taoiseach and the Government and would be invaluable in <Col N="3" /> enhancing the status of Ireland internationally? That is why I am asking the Taoiseach to give the matter some consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that listening to him last Sunday was almost as informative regarding his true intentions as reading tea leaves in a tea cup?  On a more serious note, will the Taoiseach agree that he indicated in the past he is prepared to consider the institution of a merit award or an award for distinguished service to the country? Will he agree that that might be something in which it might be appropriate to involve the President?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>I met the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland during the course of our attendance at a function yesterday for the launch of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal restoration project.  It would not be appropriate to go into the detail of confidential discussions of this nature but I can tell the House that the Government still support the initiative and are anxious that is should succeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the apparent upsurge of confidence that something will come out of the current initiative between Mr. Brooke and the Taoiseach.  Yesterday Mr. Brooke indicated that there were hurdles still to be overcome.  Will the Taoiseach indicate what those hurdles are and if the timetable for the participation of our Government in talks is one of them?  Does the Taoiseach foresee any improvement in the situation arising from the meeting between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Mr. Brooke on Friday?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would rather confine myself to broad principles at this stage in view of the long and protracted nature of the discussions.  It would be helpful, from the point of view of the process, not to go into any particular details.  However, I can say to the House that the situation is reasonably encouraging but, as the Deputy knows, it is fraught with the unexpected.  At the moment I am not pessimistic, let me put it that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully understand the Taoiseach's reticence to be more specific. I am glad that at this stage the Taoiseach is sounding, and that the noises from yesterday appear optimistic in relation to the prospects of something happening, but we must express concern at the delays that have taken place.  There have obviously been protracted attempts to bring about discussions.  Will the Taoiseach attempt to outline in some detail what is holding up the talks?  We have read about Mr. Brooke's proposals and Mr. Hume's proposals.  Are we to take it <Col N="7" /> that the Irish Government have not made proposals, because from today's newspapers it appears that there are no specific proposals from the Government?  Will the Taoiseach clarify that the Irish Government and the British Government have actually agreed a formula which is now to be agreed by the Unionists and the SDLP?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like the Deputy to think that the Irish Government have not made proposals.  We have been making proposals all along the line. Progress to date has been largely as a result of our flexibility and because we have put forward formulae and compromises to get over hurdles that had existed from the beginning.  We have had a very good record of success in that regard. Things that at the outset appeared to be insurmountable obstacles have now disappeared.  There are a number of different possibilities for progress at the moment.  I mentioned them yesterday. One is the suggestion with regard to the role of the Secretary of State, the other is John Hume's proposal that each party would come to the talks on the basis of their stated positions.  That is another sensible proposal.  Since everybody agrees that it is essential that there has to be three sets of talks and that there can be no prospect of success unless it is tri-dimensional, the difficulty, which is not insurmountable, is how the three sets of talks can be co-ordinated, both as to format and timescale.  I am reasonably satisfied that with goodwill &mdash; and certainly there is goodwill on our side and there has been goodwill all along &mdash; we can fairly soon come to a conclusion.  I do not want to be over-optimistic or to mislead the House on that score, but I believe there is a distinct possibility of success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the timing and method of involvement of the Irish Government in the internal talks between the parties in Northern Ireland the only hurdle in the way of the commencement of those internal talks? <Col N="8" /> Would the Taoiseach agree that the fact that the Irish Government are involved through the Anglo-Irish Conference anyway in all these matters, means that our involvement or non-involvement in the internal talks should not become an obstacle?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the House enough information to understand the position.  I have given what I can safely give at this stage.  The Deputy should understand that the problem is that if I start taking public attitudes, or if any of the other parties take public attitudes, that affects the whole process.  It is much better for me to explain to the House, as I have done, that the tri-dimensional aspects of the talks are the key and the problem that confronts us is to find an appropriate and satisfactory format for all concerned and an appropriate and satisfactory timescale for all concerned.</P>

      <P>I do not want a debate, but the point is that all of the other parties in this problem are quite free with their views as to what the obstacles are and have stated their views quite publicly.  It is important that the House should know what the obstacles are from the point of view of the Irish Government so that we can at least address the issues as they really are rather than on the basis of rumours and assumptions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the recent comments made by a person (details supplied) in which she estimated that it would take until the year 2060 before the 50/50 balance between the sexes was achieved on the boards of State-sponsored bodies, if current appointment practices were continued; the number of State boards which at present have no women members; if he has any specific plans to speed up the rate of appointment of women; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>At present there are 69 State boards out of a total of 200 that have no women members.  I fully accept that this position is unsatisfactory.  The Government have, however, appointed 278 women members to State boards over the past three and a half years.  This shows our determination to improve the situation steadily as opportunities to do so arise, and I wish to assure the House of my continuing personal attention to this matter.</P>

      <P>It would seem that the increase from 10 per cent to 15 per cent in the representation of women has occurred during the past three and a half years rather than over the past ten years. Does the Taoiseach have any specific plans or programme to increase the representation of women on State boards given that most of the major boards have no women representation or the number varies from either one out of 12, 14 &mdash; as is the case in relation to An Bord Gáis &mdash; or 18?  Can we be given some indication that there is some specific plan or programme to improve the situation rather than addressing it on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis?</P>

      <P>The Deputy can be assured that there is a consistent approach and that is that on all available occasions we positively seek out suitable women appointees.  That is consistent policy.  This is not always possible because as the Deputy will appreciate, in the case of some boards from time to time when a vacancy occurs and a particular type of person is needed for that appointment &mdash; someone with perhaps a technical or other type of qualification &mdash; it is not always possible to find a suitable <Col N="12" /> woman appointee but my colleagues in the Government will confirm that I constantly remind the Government and individual Ministers of the need to increase the number of women on State boards.</P>

What specific procedure is followed to ensure <Col N="13" /> that the widest possible net is thrown to get the people with the necessary qualifications? Ministers or the Government on their own cannot know every woman who may have the necessary qualification, regardless of what other people may think of your powers, but some procedure must be adopted in an effort to ensure that the women out there who are qualified are actually sought for the job.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.  As I indicated to the House on 13 November 1990, arrangements have been made to involve the National Youth Council of Ireland and the United Farmers' Association in the discussions on a new programme.  In the case of the National Youth Council, a submission by them has already been discussed with Government Departments and they have expressed their satisfaction with the arrangements made. A submission is awaited from the United Farmers' Association and this will be discussed with them when received.</P>
      <P>It is open to other organisations, including representatives of emigrant groups, to make submissions on the scope and content of the programme.

Furthermore, will he specifically invite representatives of parents associations who are interested in the educational dimension, voluntary organisations dealing with those in poverty and groups representing emigrants, <Col N="16" /> to make specific submissions so that the widest possible consensus could be achieved among the widest number of groups in support of the programme, if agreed?</P>

I assure the Deputy that those submissions will be fully considered in all the appropriate channels and in all the appropriate agencies, and if it is thought necessary, or indeed if the organisation wish, discussions on the submissions can be conducted.</P>

I have had the opportunity, <Col N="18" /> in recent months, of talking to many groups in London.  It would be deplorable if we were to forget their plight.  They are living in appalling conditions, many of them do not have housing.

I will certainly consider the Deputy's suggestion about a White Paper.  I am not sure that it is really necessary.  I am sure that all aspects of the matter have been fully gone into and elaborated and articulated on on the last occasion, but as it is a proposal from the Leader of the main Opposition party I will certainly consider it.</P>

Would he further agree that he has a responsibility not just to wait for a consensus to emerge but to try to create a consensus?  Would he further agree that some of the difficulties that existed in the past, misunderstandings that may have existed in people's minds about the consequences of the passage of the proposal which was before the people, have now <Col N="20" /> been removed by the passage of legislation on both the status of children and judicial separation?  Does he also agree that there is now a much narrower area in which misunderstanding is likely to arise as to the consequences of what one might do and that that is something that could be stated very clearly in a White Paper in a way that would allay any public fears which may exist?</P>

      <P>I do not think political parties should be arrogant in this matter. To a great extent, parties can only reflect public opinion and I think it is more important that we should try to assess and respond to public opinion.  I have given my view that if you attempt something of this nature without a reasonable degree of public consensus or a reasonable prospect of success, it would be <Col N="21" /> unnecessarily divisive, and I do not think anybody wants that.</P>

      <P>I put it to the Taoiseach on this issue that Deputies on all sides of the House acknowledge that marriage breakdown in the Republic of Ireland is a fact of life, that remarriage is also a fact of life and that this, under our present code, is leading to all sorts of difficulties for men, women and children and that we have an obligation to lead public opinion in the direction where this could be resolved.  Indeed, the proposal from Deputy Bruton for a White Paper could help to eliminate areas of fear, outline the progress that has been made in legislation since the last referendum and perhaps pinpoint areas of legislation that still need to be dealt with in order to have a successful referendum on the divorce issue.  Because I do not want to get on my feet again about this matter, will the Taoiseach indicate also if he has any plans to address the issue of Articles 2 and 3 in the foreseeable future in view of recent Supreme Court decisions?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Gaeltacht (Mr. Gallagher)</NameTxt>
      <P>Tógfaidh mé Ceisteanna a 13 agus a 14 le chéile.</P>
      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos, is mian liom go dtuigfí go soiléir nach bhfuil géarchéim airgeadais ag Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Le cúnamh Stáit de bhreis ar £13 mhilliún i mbliana le cur leis an teacht isteach a bhíonn ag an eagraíocht féin, tá dóthain airgid ag an Údarás chun feidhmiú go héifeachtach.</P>
      <P>Ar mholadh ón Údarás féin, toilíodh le uasteorainn de £6.2 mhilliún le haghaidh deontas a cheadú i 1990 agus i 1991.  Tá an uasteorainn sin sroiste le tamall anuas i leith 1990, rud a chiallaíonn nach féidir leis an Údarás, fad is atá feidhm leis an uasteorainn, tograí de bhreis ar an tsuim sin a cheadú i mbliana.  Nuair a bheidh cinneadh déanta ag an Rialtas faoin soláthar airgid a bheidh ar fáil don Údarás ón Stát i 1991, beidh ar an eagraíocht moltaí faoi uasteorainneacha leasaithe le haghaidh deontas a cheadú i 1990 agus 1991 a chur ar aghaidh chugam d'fhonn aontú an Rialtais a lorg dóibh.  Ar ndóigh, caithfidh na huasteorainneacha sin freagairt don soláthar airgid a bheidh ar fáil chun deontais a íoc i 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá iarratas déanta ag bord an Údaráis ar chruinniú leis an Aire chun ceist na <Col N="25" /> n-uasteorainneacha i leith deontas a cheadú agus soláthar airgid an Údaráis ón Stát le haghaidh 1991 a phlé.  Bím toilteanach i gcónaí bualadh leis an Údarás chun cúrsaí a bhaineann le forbairt na Gaeltachta agus cur chun cinn na Gaeilge a phlé.  Bhuail mé le cathaoirleach agus príomhfheidhmeannach an Údaráis ar 17 Deireadh Fómhair chun na ceisteanna sin a chíoradh agus bhuail an Taoiseach leis an gcathaoirleach ar 23 Samhain.  Ní léir dom go bhfuil gá le cruinniú leis an mbord iomlán chun cur le mo eolas ar an bhfadhb atá cruthaithe cuid mhaith ag an Údarás dó féin agus atáim ag iarraidh a réiteach.</P>
    <P>Is é bun agus barr an scéil go bhfuil teorainn leis an méid airgid a dtig leis an Stát a chur ar fáil don Údarás agus ní mór dóibh é sin a thuiscint go soiléir. Is maith an rud é go bhfuil borradh agus fás sa Ghaeltacht i gcaoi go bhfuil go leor tograí tionsclaíocha ag teacht chun cinn ach, leis an iliomad éileamh atá ar an Stát ar airgead le haghaidh forbartha, ní féidir iarratais ó gach eagras a shásamh go hiomlán.  Mar sin, caithfidh an tÚdarás cibé céimeanna is gá a ghlacadh feasta trí shocruithe daingne a chur i bhfeidhm le cinntiú go mbeidh ar a chumas maireachtáil leis an soláthar airgid ón Stát, móide cibé teacht isteach a ghineann sé féin.</P>
    <P>Agus é sin ráite agam, caithfear a rá, d'ainneoin deacrachtaí airgeadais an Stát Chiste, gur tugadh méadú suntasach don Údarás i mbliana i gcomparáid le 1989 agus go dtig leo bheith ag súil le méadú eile don bhliain seo chugainn.  Ní foláir dóibh, áfach, mar atá ráite agam cheana, maireachtáil leis an soláthar sin, cibé suim a bheidh ann.</P>

The increase was the largest injection of taxpayers' money into the scheme since its establishment.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, as promised by me during the course of a comprehensive debate on the scheme in this House on 20-21 February last, I have examined the position of the board in the light of the increased demand for its services due to the coming into effect of the 1989 Judicial Separation Act and these extra demands have been borne in mind in the course of the Government's deliberations on the framing of Estimates for the coming year.</P>

      <P>Obviously it is a matter for FLAC or any other organisation in relation to any part of Government administration to make their views known in any forum available to them. Regarding the work of the legal aid centres, generally I am committed to providing as much resources as the financial circumstances of the State allow.  I gave last year the largest injection of taxpayers' money to the scheme since its establishment.  We all want to see additional law centres and I am looking at that question.  The need for such centres and the substantial associated cost has been considered by the Government in the light of other demands in the context of the 1991 Estimates.  I will be making some statements on that matter when the Estimates are published.  I intend in the next session to introduce legislation to put the legal aid centres on a statutory footing.  These will be major advances.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's continued commitment and particularly the undertaking to introduce legislation to put the scheme on a statutory basis, which is long overdue. Would the Minister accept that it would be a source of great embarrassment to the country and to the Government should the applications before the European Court and elsewhere be allowed to progress a great distance?  Would he agree that it would be in the best interests of all of us internationally and at home if <Col N="30" /> the case made by FLAC was met head on?  The formula &ldquo;when finances improve&rdquo; is not a ready device in answer to the charge that people are being deprived of fundamental rights because of the paucity of the service being provided.</P>

Obviously I should like more resources to be available but they are not. As soon as I get a request from the bodies mentioned I will reply directly to them.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I remain of the view that the case for amending legislation has not <Col N="31" /> been made and I have been confirmed in that view by the decision of the High Court in the Ellis case.  The 1987 Act gives full effect to the obligations we assumed on signing the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism. The legislation accords with international norms in regard to the limitations it places on the political offence defence for extradition purposes.  We should not forget that Ireland is one of only eight countries to have acceded to the convention without entering a reservation.  The remaining 14 parties to the convention have entered reservations which have the effect of making their legislation in this area less stringent than ours.  We have had only one case &mdash; the Ellis case &mdash; in which the 1987 Act has been judicially considered and the decision in that case will, I hope, have addressed at least some of the fears that those who question the adequacy of the legislation may have had.  In those circumstances, it would be most unusual to amend the Act before it has been further and fully tested in the courts. Regarding political exemption, that matter was decided upon by the President of the High Court.</P>

      <P>I will again remove that red herring &mdash; it was not even pleaded in the Supreme Court.  Will the Minister not accept that not only my party but others including his partners in Government, are supported by informed objective commentators in the opinion that the present law is inadequate?  Does he accept the basic principle that no person charged with offences of violence against the person or offences relating to firearms or explosives should be entitled to hide behind the political offence exemption?  Will the Minister give a straight &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; answer to that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a body of legislation here in relation to extradition.  For example there is the Extradition Act of 1965; the Extradition (European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism) Act, 1987 and the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987, three Acts in operation <Col N="32" /> in relation to extradition.  The Deputy need have no doubts but that this Government, and I as Minister for Justice, will implement the provisions and decisions of those Acts.  The Deputy can take it that the manner in which the extradition was handled &mdash; once the Supreme Court decision had been taken &mdash; in relation to Ellis is an indication of the Government's determination in this area. In the future if there proves to be need for changes, then we can examine the position but as far as the legislation at present in place is concerned it is working.  We also have the extra territorial legislation.  I might add that the legislation in existence has been tried in the most recent case, that being the Ellis case, under the provisions of the 1987 Act.  If defects or deficiencies arise in the future we can then examine the legislation but the legislation in place has been tested once only.</P>

These are illegal operators providing a facility the public have requested.  For that reason there is no question of putting them off the air pending the availability of an alternative, but it would not be appropriate for me to meet such illegal operators.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 72 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware, from reports which I have received from the Garda authorities, that there was an increase in the level of recorded crime in certain rural areas in 1989 and that there are indications that 1990 figures may also show an increase. I understand from the Garda that the upward trend is mainly attributable to a rise in the number of minor larcenies committed.  The Garda authorities have assured me that the situation is being monitored by them and that divisional officers have recently prepared a programme of measures designed to address the problem.  While it might be counterproductive for me to disclose the details of these measures, I can say that, in rural areas, they include the use of additional patrols and checkpoints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also assured that Garda resources will continue to be deployed to best advantage and that the assignment of additional gardaí to meet the special requirements of any particular area will be arranged as needs dictate.  In this <Col N="35" /> connection, 47 of the new gardaí attested to the force within the past week have been assigned to areas outside of the Dublin Metropolitan area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give the House his view on the proposals &mdash; as reported in the press &mdash; on changes in rural policing which seem to me to be rather odd in the context of the now admitted increase in rural crime?  Will the Minister accept that the scheme &mdash; which I understand is to come into operation in January next &mdash; will result in the partial closure of smaller police stations, the downgrading of others, with sergeants being transferred to more central headquarters? Is it also correct that, under the Minister's proposals, small stations will be opened for a few hours only each day and that there is expected to be much greater use by the public of the little green man telephone system rather than resorting to the present Garda cover?</P>

I might add there are no plans to close, downgrade or reduce the services provided by any rural Garda station.  As I have already stated publicly, Garda management, in consultation with officials of my Department and the Garda representative associations, are engaged on a review of current policing systems to ascertain whether they meet fully public needs or whether, by reorganisation or other means, they can be rendered more efficient, modern and responsive to community needs.  No <Col N="36" /> decisions have been taken as yet on foot of that review.  I am acutely conscious of the advantages accruing to the public and the Garda Síochána from the traditionally close relationship which has existed between them.  I am determined that any changes introduced will in no way interfere with that relationship.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to allow competition in the provision of public networks or in basic voice telephony and this position is in accord with EC directives in the telecommunications area.

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Bearing in mind that in other countries there are internal meters in the homes and offices of telephone users, not provided by Telecom Éireann, that Dublin consumers are not provided with anything other than the Dublin 01 telephone directory and that, if one happens to telephone Directory Inquiries, nine times out of ten, one will be answered by way of a recorded message there is strong justification for the whole country being in the one network &mdash; 01 or whatever other network. Would the Minister agree that the best way to deal with these problems, since Telecom Éireann are not prepared to deal with them themselves, is to allow competition to get Telecom Éireann on their toes and make them become more consumer-orientated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, I believe Telecom Éireann are a fine example of the semi-State structure.  They have operated very efficiently and effectively. Their record in relation to the answering of faults and looking at the problems of the consumer is second to none.  They have an excellent record.  For example, the speed of repairs target is 85 per cent faults cleared in two working days and 100 per cent clear in five working days. It can be seen from the report that 80 per cent are being cleared within two working days and 98 per cent of faults are being cleared within five working days.  In regard to meters under the staircase, we have a much more modern arrangement where itemised accounts can be made available to any consumer, any telephone subscriber, on request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe one of the great successes of our State in the past decade has been the £1.8 billion that has been invested in the telecommunications system and the benefit that has brought to our country in service to the consumer both in the private sector in their homes and in the business sector.  Many of the businesses we have we would not have today were <Col N="38" /> it not for such progress and such efficient telecommunications.</P>
    <P>I reject totally the Deputy's suggestion in relation to Directory Inquiries.  I have had occasion to use it myself regularly and I find them most courteous and efficient.

It also contains a detailed analysis by the board of the working of the system of investigation and adjudication of complaints under the provisions of the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Act, 1986.  The board's conclusions and recommendations on the operation of the system are being examined by my Department in consultation with the board and the Garda authorities and I will consider all the issues arising from that examination when it is completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the areas of most concern to the board is the question of their staffing <Col N="40" /> complement.  Deputies will be aware that, notwithstanding the extreme difficulty in procuring extra staff for any area of the public service, four additional staff were assigned to the board towards the end of 1989.  I am satisfied that the assignment of this staff has helped to ease the board's difficulties.  In addition, I am currently pursuing with my colleague the Minister for Finance the possibility of providing further staff resources for the board.</P>

      <P>Has the embargo of 11 August 1989 by the Garda Complaints Board on the investigation of new applications or new complaints been lifted now by reason of anything the Minister has done, or is the situation still appalling as outlined in the report, that no new work is being progressed by the board?</P>

      <P>At the moment we have in hand about 126 complaints which were received prior to 11 August 1989.  No substantial work remains to be done on these files.  They are still open mainly because replies to queries or the outcome of civil or criminal proceedings are awaited.  Complaints normally take four months to go through the system.  Operating in an acceptable manner the true arrears figure would be approximately 750, that is taking in last year's as well as this year's.  I assure the House that I am not happy about the situation of undue delays in the processing of complaints because of the difficulties for the public and the members of the force.  I assure the Deputy I am doing everything I can in relation to the resources that are available to try to ease a totally unacceptable situation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>3.&mdash;(1)  The Minister shall consult with the trade union or staff association representing the former employees of the company which was incorporated on the 6th day of May, 1940, as the Hospitals Trust (1940) Ltd., and shall then make regulations providing for disposal of the undistributed sweepstake prize funds in respect of the service of such former employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Where it is proposed to make regulations under subsection (1) the <Col N="154" /> Minister shall lay a draft of each regulation before each of the Houses of the Oireachtas and it shall not come into effect until such time as a motion approving the draft has been approved by each such House.</P>
    <P>As we know, section 3 is the kernel of the Bill.  When I spoke on Second Stage I expressed my party's serious concern that this section was very vague and loosely framed.  For instance, as drafted, there is no guarantee that all the employees who were made redundant when the company was placed in voluntary liquidation will be covered.  On the other hand, a loose interpretation of it could mean that employees who left 20 years ago or more and who were not victimised by being made redundant or losing pension rights could benefit. Essentially the Minister is asking us to give him a blank cheque.  He is asking the Dáil to approve in principle the distribution of the money without the House having any say in the detail.  On the basis of this Government's record I do not believe we should extend the trust implied in giving a blank cheque.  The Minister must have decided in general terms on the manner in which he intends to distribute the surplus funds.  Why has he not included in the Bill at least a general outline of his scheme for the distribution of the funds?</P>
    <P>My amendment requires the Minister to put his plans into specific form through the making of regulations which would then be brought back to the Dáil for approval.  This would mean the Dáil would be approving not just the general principle of the scheme but also the detail.  If we do not pass this amendment the Dáil will have no further say in the matter if the Minister's proposals prove unfair or unreasonable.  The Workers' Party amendment would also oblige the Minister to consult with the trade union or staff association which represented the former employees.  My understanding is that some of the workers were represented by the FWUI, as it was then, and some by the staff association.  It would <Col N="155" /> clearly not be a practical proposition to require the Minister to consult with all the employees but it seems an entirely reasonable proposition that he should at least consult with the union or staff association before finalising his plans.  If this was done speedily and the regulations were drawn up without any further delay, the whole process could be completed in time for Christmas, which would be the ideal arrangement.  For that reason I hope the Minister will accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much in sympathy with what Deputy Sherlock has said.  The amendment he is proposing and amendments Nos. 2 and 3 in my name are different methodologies to achieve the same objective.  On Second Stage I indicated a very strong welcome from the Labour Party for the Bill.  It is a belated recognition that the employees of the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes were very badly treated and that they need some redress from the very bad situation that resulted, partly from the direct action of the State in constituting the national lottery.  There was a responsibility there which is now finally being met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had a lot of consultations with former employees since the Bill was enacted and there is certainly a fear that section 3, which is simply an enabling section which gives all authority to the Minister to dispose of the money as he shall determine, is too bold a proposition to allow it to pass unamended.  The specific objective I had in framing the two amendments in my name is twofold: first, to ensure that those employees who were thrown out of work at the collapse of the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes and who received only statutory entitlement and nothing else, would be the ones who would primarily benefit from the money that is now available.  A number of former employees took voluntary redundancy much earlier and they received very considerable severance pay, twice or three times the provision made by statute, and some also got guarantees of work subsequently, of up to 13 weeks per year.  It was felt that they should not be <Col N="156" /> treated as generously as the 147 employees who were put out of a job on the last day and received basically their statutory entitlements and no more.</P>
    <P>The objective of amendment No. 2 in my name is to require the Minister, when he is drawing up his proposals to dispose of this money, to have particular regard to those former employees who received only statutory redundancy at the termination of their employment.  I know the Minister indicated to me in the Dáil and in conversation that that was his intention, but it is important to stitch it into the legislation so that it is a clear signal to the employees that they are going to get a reasonable amount of money.  At the end of the day the sum of money we are talking about is extremely small.  It will amount to less than £3,000 per employee.  It will not make any of them prosperous but it is money they should have as soon as possible.  The notion of trying to do a loaves and fishes on it, to allow everybody who was ever employed by the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes to have a few shillings, would really negative the principle involved in bringing the legislation before the House in the first instance.  I hope the Minister will indicate clearly that he accepts not only the principle but the actual amendment in my name, and that he will enshrine it in the legislation, thus allaying any fears that the former employees may have.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 in my name, seeks to accomplish my second objective, that is the principle I referred to on Second Stage, that the money the employees would get, small as it is, should not be the subject of clawback by way of income tax through the Revenue Commissioners. I am advised that if the money is treated legally as payments in respect of section 114 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, any amount up to £6,000 would be tax free.  It would simply be regarded as severance pay in the normal way.  If you do not enshrine that specifically in the legislation you are at the mercy of the Revenue Commissioners to take a benign view of it, and that is not good enough.  I discussed this matter with the Minister for Health after the Second <Col N="157" /> Stage debate and I do not think he would be at variance with my view on it, that it should be a bonus payment, regarded as a very belated severance pay, and should not be subject to the clawback of income tax.  That is what amendment No. 3 seeks to do.  It is a matter for debate whether there is greater merit in the specifics in relation to The Workers' Party amendments or mine.  The two things that concern me about Deputy Sherlock's amendment is that there will be a requirement on the Minister to consult the trade union or staff associations representing the workers.  However, having consulted them, there is no responsibility on him to act on their advice.  There is, however, a requirement that the regulations subsequently drawn up must be approved by the House but if the Minister decides to ignore the advice of the staff representatives, he could have the regulations approved by the House by way of the natural Government majority.  To achieve what we both seek, it would be better to have the requirement that the Minister should have particular regard to those who were left high and dry on the day the company closed and the specific issue of having the windfall severance payment tax free.</P>
    <P>Assuming that The Workers' Party amendment is passed, would it be possible for me to insert my amendment No. 3 subsequently?  It would still be germane to the Bill that any money to be disposed of to the former employees should be tax free.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the sentiments and the contents of these amendments so far as they seek to press the Minister &mdash; or the Minister of State &mdash; to a proper process of consultation.  I am aware that on Second Stage the Minister said this would be the case.  However, the point Deputy Sherlock made in relation to this House having some role in the monitoring of subsequent events is valid and should be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to raise a number of points in relation to the position of former employees, numbering about 650.  They fall into two categories: first, those who <Col N="158" /> were in full-time employment at the time of the liquidation.  There was a very strong dispute about the <i>ex gratia</i> payments they were to receive and this went to the Labour Court.  I should like the Minister to outline the cost of the Labour Court award and whether it would use up all the £480,000 at the Minister's disposal under this legislation.  What would then be left over?  There is a very strong obligation on the Minister to uphold the Labour Court recommendation in regard to <i>ex gratia</i> payments.  I feel so strongly about it that I should like the Minister to clarify the situation in relation to the proceeds of the sale of the property in Ballsbridge because, as we know, this was a particularly valuable asset of the Trust Board and I cannot see why some of the proceeds could not be diverted for the benefit of former employees.</P>
    <P>I should also like the Minister to clarify whether the subsequent legislation introduced to protect employees in terms of their rights in the event of a liquidation came too late.  If it had been passed in time would it have meant that some of the proceeds of that sale could have gone to former employees?  That is a very important point and every step should be taken to see that all <i>ex gratia</i> entitlements are paid.</P>
    <P>The second category of former employees which deserve recognition are those who worked their whole lives for the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes.  I am aware &mdash; in common with other Members &mdash; that the level of superannuation pensions from the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes is derisory which means that people have to survive on non-contributory pensions.  There must be some case for such pensioners receiving payment. Therefore, the proceeds fall into two categories; pensioners who have duly qualified for a pension should get an <i>ex gratia</i> sum which would arise from the proceeds of what was basically the Labour Court recommendation for the 147 workers.  I have received letters from pensioners who were not full-time employees at the time, but who maybe gave 30 years' service, who feel they have <Col N="159" /> a prospect of a windfall but it is not at all clear whether they will qualify.</P>
    <P>The other point I should like to make in relation to this section is that there is no time limit in relation to how long it will take the Minister to dispose of these funds.  There should be a time limit of certainly not more than one year.  Other Deputies made points in relation to this House having no control and this matter should not be left open-ended.  The provisions of section 7(1) mean that people can claim up to four years from the commencement of this Bill.  Does this mean that some funds will have to be kept in reserve in the event of litigation?  Is it envisaged that the Exchequer will pick up the tab?  It must be assumed from section 4 (1) that, apparently, proceedings are pending against the trustees. If not, there would be no need for the section which specifically says that any pending litigation against trustees will be transferred to the Minister.</P>
    <P>There is a great need for clarification. The Minister's Second Stage speech raised more questions than it answered and there is a clear view on this side of the House that the first priority is the 147 full-time employees and the Labour Court <i>ex gratia</i> entitlement and, secondly, the category of pensioners who must live on a miserly sum.  I hope the Minister will accept these amendments and ensure that there will be a time limit and a clear process whereby this House will know who gets what &mdash; and when &mdash; and that the liquidator will be pursued in relation to the proceeds of the sales of property on behalf of the employees.</P>

      <P>Bearing in mind that there is less than £500,000 to be distributed, one must be careful not to give too much hope to the former employees of the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes.  The situation is quite clear in regard to the 147 former employees but Deputy Howlin mentioned the category who took voluntary redundancy.  They were promised an <i>ex gratia</i> payment and work but they did not receive the <i>ex gratia</i> payment and did not always get work.  Special attention must <Col N="160" /> be given to this category and I ask the Minister to bear those people in mind.</P>

      <P>I wish the Deputy well. Section 3 leaves it open to the Minister for Health to decide, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, how he will dispose of the money on foot of service with the Hospitals Trust (1940) Limited. Three amendments have been tabled on this section.  I have taken particular note of these amendments and have studied them in detail with my officials.  I cannot see that any advantage would accrue by going through the tortuous procedure of moving regulations in draft form as proposed by Deputy Sherlock.  In point of fact my officials have already discussed the issues involved with representatives of SIPTU who were accompanied by former members of the sweepstakes staff. I am not at all sure who could be said to represent the inhouse staff associations at this stage bearing in mind that the company went into liquidation in March 1987.  We have met representatives of the pensioners who lost the <i>ex-gratia</i> elements of their pensions and, of course, have received representations from many of the pensioners.  I am anxious that the payments be made as far as possible before Christmas.  Any move to have the detail of these payments covered by regulations would only serve to delay the arrangements which are now being put in train.</P>
      <P>Equally well I see little point in accepting Deputy Howlin's amendment as, in fact, we have to give the fullest consideration to the case made by each of the staff groups involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I see it there are two disadvantaged groups involved &mdash; those who took early retirement and suffered the loss of the <Col N="161" /><i>ex-gratia</i> element of their pensions and, second, those who were made redundant in March 1987 when the sweepstakes closed.  Other pensioners are not disadvantaged in the sense that they are at least as well off now as they would have been had the sweepstakes continued in operation.  Therefore, I propose to give a flat rate payment to each of the former workers who took early retirement but who lost the <i>ex-gratia</i> element of their pensions and who are still alive.  A similar payment will be made to the spouses of any of these pensioners who have since died.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that legal difficulties would rule out payments to any other relatives of deceased persons.  The balance will be shared out among the persons who were made redundant in March 1987 &mdash; spouses again being catered for as in the case of the first group.  However, payments in the case of the March 1987 entitlement will be calculated on the same basis as was used to calculate statutory redundancy money; that is weighted according to age and service. We will have to be allowed a little latitude as there were a few people who, because of job offers, etc., left some days before 16 March 1987 but who must be regarded as persons who were made redundant on closure.  All of these workers should get at least 60 per cent of their statutory redundancy entitlement, but I think we will put a lower floor on any such payments. I am afraid I will have to ask for the submission of claims in all cases but we should be able to process them very quickly.</P>
    <P>The question of severance pay taxation was raised by Deputy Howlin on Second Stage, and he has now included it in a second amendment we received today at lunch time.  My officials have consulted with the Office of the Revenue Commissioners on the taxation treatment of the proposed payments.  The position is that the payments will fall to be treated as payments received in connection with the termination of employment which are chargeable to income tax by virtue of section 114 of the Income Tax Act, 1967. However, section 115 of that Act <Col N="162" /> exempts from the charge to tax the first £6,000 of the aggregate of all such payments received by an employee in respect of an employment.  In addition the Third Schedule to the Act provides for the exemption level to be increased up to £10,000 or more in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>Statutory redundancy payments which are specifically exempt from income tax by virtue of section 37 of the Finance Act, 1968, are not taken into account for the purposes of the exemption under the 1967 Act.  In the circumstances, while the proposed payments will be technically chargeable to income tax, it is highly unlikely that any of the former employees of the Hospitals Trust will be actually liable to tax in respect of the amounts received by them, since none of the proposed payments will exceed the threshold.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates raised a few points.  The Deputy inquired about the cost of the Labour Court award.  The Labour Court recommended two weeks pay per year's service, that is up to £10,000 per person, and I estimate that that would cost about £1.5 million, and we are talking about distributing £480,000.  There are no proceedings at the moment, and the Exchequer will meet any claims.</P>
    <P>In response to Deputy Sherlock I can say that I am not looking for a blank cheque.  I am looking for the sanction of the Oireachtas to pass an Act enabling the Minister for Health to disburse the special funds.  There are a small number of people, and as Deputy Doyle said, a small sum of money involved.  The Minister is very restricted in what he can do. We do not want a blank cheque.  We want to ensure that we can maximise the information available to give the funds to as many people as possible.  The latitude we are seeking is so that we can distribute those funds as fairly and as equitably as possible within the parameters laid down in the Act taking into account the small amount of money which has to be disbursed. I would be grateful if the House could agree to that and in the light of the information I have given perhaps those amendments can be withdrawn so that we <Col N="163" /> can proceed to have the funds disbursed between now and Christmas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I have pursued the bringing forward of this legislation for no other reason than that a number of the people concerned are in my constituency, and they asked me to do so.  Until just now I have not been in a position to tell them what this legislation is likely to offer in their cases.  In his answer just now the Minister has made it more clear than has been the situation up to now.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to understand how the Minister considers that accepting amendment No. 1 would be somehow inconsistent with the view he has just read out. I have some experience in this kind of situation.  It is imprudent of the Minister to take it upon himself to disburse what is a limited amount of money to quite a substantial number of people in different categories.  No matter what the Minister does, it will not find favour everywhere. I do not see why the Minister would not wish to take on board amendment No. 1. If my information is correct, and perhaps the Minister would confirm this, the meeting with SIPTU was broadly in favour of the two categories the Minister has now advanced.  In those circumstances it would be more prudent for the Minister to accept an amendment which effectively requires him to do no more than consult with the union concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment does not ask the Minister to agree, which would be a reasonably normal clause within such an employment as this, with the trade union, in this case, terms for redundancy, or in the event of an agreement being impossible, to use a mechanism to arbitrate between the two.  This does not require the Minister to agree.  It merely requires him to take into account the views of the trade union, which is as close as the Minister can get to getting a collective view in the unique circumstances in which we are dealing.  The Minister cannot get a collective view no matter how he approaches it and this at least gives him the opportunity to get a collective view. <Col N="164" /> It is a difficult situation, because if one spreads the butter too thinly it will be scarcely worth the exercise.</P>
    <P>Deputies have advanced different categories. For example, Deputy De Rossa showed me a letter he received this morning from an employee apparently in the canteen, who must not have been an employee of the Sweep as such, and she argued fervently that she ought to be included along with her colleagues.  I do not know whether that is the case, but there are different categories.  In a situation like this all the Minister can do is bring forward enabling legislation and let the collective voice that is there take responsibility for suggesting the parameters of distribution.  I would not think there would be such major changes to those suggested by the Minister in his reply but I certainly think that would be the preferable way of going about it. Therefore, far from saying amendment No. 1 is inconsistent with it I think it is perfectly consistent.  If anything, it removes a certain opprobrium from the Minister which I am surprised, being a political animal, he is not anxious to do. It is unusual to have Ministers seeking to incur the opprobrium of the public.  We would certainly be happy to support Deputy Howlin's amendment No. 3, but my own view would concur with what the Minister has confirmed, that in the circumstances it is not relevant because in no event is it likely employees will get the ceiling figure permitted under the Bill.  In those circumstances it is probably unnecessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that a flat rate payment will be made to an individual or, if that individual is now deceased, to the spouse.  The history of the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes is interesting in that most of the employees were women, some of whom were employed at a senior age.  It is to the credit of the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes &mdash; I am aware of the type of people they employed &mdash; that they employed many handicapped people.  Many of the staff were single and lived probably with a caring sister.  I know this is stretching this <Col N="165" /> a bit far but I must make a case for the caring sister who has now been left on her own in very difficult circumstances. Given that the Minister is considering the position of the spouse, I ask him to consider the position of a caring sister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the comments of the House which would seem to indicate that a consensus has been reached in the House.  The difficulty is that we are talking about a very small amount of money.  In a way this debate, and the coverage of it, has given rise to great expectations which will be dashed in the fullness of time.  What I sought to do was recognise that the amount of money available is very small and in an effort to make it meaningful not to dilute it.  If this is to be done effectively we will have to establish some priorities.  As I see it, the first priority should be to those people who after 30 or 40 years of service got statutory redundancy and nothing else. There is a view that they should get a fair amount of the small sum of money we are talking about.  The second category to be given priority should be the pensioners at the time of the closure of the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's comments but I would like him to elaborate on what he said.  Perhaps that is asking too much as I am aware he has to carry out some analysis of specific cases but with regard to the flat rate payment he proposes to make to pensioners, what sum of money are we talking about?  We could then judge what balance will be left to be shared out among those employed on the day the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes closed and an indication of the ball park figures involved.  I also ask the Minister to indicate a timescale within which this could be done.  Is it envisaged that this will be achieved and the money paid out this side of Christmas which would certainly be the desired objective of all Members?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to amendment No. 3 in my name, I am in broad agreement with what the Minister said.  He has now referred the matter to the Revenue Commissioners. Advice from a tax consultant <Col N="166" /> to me was that this sum of money would likely be regarded by the Revenue Commissioners as severance pay and, therefore, not taxable as it would be below the threshold.  However, there was no certainty that this would be the case.  My object in putting down the amendment was to ensure certainty.  If the Minister can assure us that he has ascertained, following consultations with the Revenue Commissioners, that this will be regarded as severance pay under section 114 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, and relieved by section 115 of the same Act, I would not be terribly anxious to press the amendment. It is important to have that principle included.  If the Minister has done this by way of direct consultation, well and good but I want to be sure that the small amount of money they get will not be subject to tax subsequently.  As I said, the Minister's last contribution was very helpful in coming to a consensus in the House but I would welcome the clarification I sought.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>I was disappointed by the Minister's reply to amendment No. 1.  I should say that amendments Nos. 2 and 3 are acceptable to us.  Many questions are being asked, for instance, how many people will benefit, what are the categories and timescale involved. Reference has also been made by Deputy Yates to the recommendation of the Labour Court.  They are very serious questions on a section which states:</P>
      <P>The Minister shall, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, dispose of the undistributed sweepstake prize funds in respect of such service by former employees of the company which was incorporated on the 6th day of May, 1940, as the Hospitals Trust (1940) Limited, as he shall determine</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would draw the attention of the Minister of State to the fact that the Minister on Second Stage said that it was his view that the people who were in permanent full-time employment when the Hospitals Trust (1940) Limited were placed in voluntary liquidation in March 1987 were, in fact, the most seriously disadvantaged <Col N="167" /> of all the former employees and that, consequently, they should get a greater portion of the funds available.  Surely this begs the question of how the Minister is going to ensure this.  Who will help him make the determination?  The Minister went on to state that he would welcome comments from the House and would take them all fully into account when deciding how best to divide up the money.  However, there is no evidence that this has happened.  I sought to ensure this by putting down amendment No. 1. that is the way to go about this and I ask the Minister to reconsider his position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very important that we get these matters clarified given that the Minister has rejected these amendments. First, I would ask the Minister to clarify his reply.  He said that pensioners will get nothing because if the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes were still in operation they would get the same pension.  That is regrettable but understandable.</P>
      <P>We then come to two categories of people, the first of which is the people who were in full-time employment the day the liquidator was appointed.  They only got statutory redundancy and they are to get a flat rate payment.  What I would like to know is how much of the £480,000 they are going to get.  I would also like to know if this flat rate payment will be exactly the same as the flat rate payable to the other category.  In other words will there be a flat rate payment for each year of service and will the amount be the same for each year of service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to clarify the position, as he views it, of the category Deputy Doyle referred to, those who took early retirement.  That group have not been in touch with me and I would like the Minister to outline exactly the loss to them.  Surely they got an <i>ex gratia</i> payment when they left, so presumably their loss is in terms of their pension. How does that loss compare with the £10,000 loss of the <i>ex gratia</i> payment which was recommended by the Labour Court?  In other words, we have two <Col N="168" /> definable groups, having excluded all other groups.  It strikes me that, on balance, if the people who took early retirement received a lump sum, Deputy Howlin's point is valid.  Those who lost their jobs, who received statutory redundancy and did not find other employment have a much better case in terms of this Bill than any of the others involved because they were left high and dry. There was an element of leaving voluntarily in the case of the people who left early and wanted to do something else or wanted to discontinue working.  I am not saying they should not get anything.  I am merely pointing out that those who were made redundant and received only the statutory redundancy are at the greatest loss of all.  The Minister must clarify the amount they will receive and tell us also what the specific loss was for those who went on early retirement.  Presumably pensions are still being paid to those exmembers of the staff who retired on reaching pensionable age but how is it that those who took early retirement are not receiving company pensions?  Surely, like most superannuation funds, the contributions were set aside in some independent pension fund?  I want to establish what their loss is and to compare it with the clearly established loss of the other group.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not answer the other two questions.  The first is whether he would accept &mdash; at this stage it is open to him only to move on this &mdash; some time limit to section 3 or to the whole operation of the Bill.  I suggested it should be not more than one year.  The second question is why it is that none of the proceeds of the sale of the property in Ballsbridge went to the benefit of the former employees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of points have been raised and I will try to clarify them as best I can.  If I miss any point I will respond later.  I would love to be able to accept every amendment that comes before us and with which I am involved. Of course it is not possible to do that because while we all have genuine reasons for submitting amendments, <Col N="169" /> acceptance of them would not always have the desired result.  Deputy Rabbitte made a very good point and confirmed my own position when he said that as a result of meetings between my officials and officials and representatives from SIPTU and the pensioners there was broad agreement.  The words he used were that things were broadly favourable. That is the exact position.  As a result of those discussions we have been able to draft this Bill taking into account what information became available during the discussions and negotiations that proceeded over a number of meetings. The difficulty is that amendment No. 1 is explicit in that it asks for regulations as follows:</P>
      <P>... and shall then make regulations providing for disposal of the undistributed sweepstake prize funds in respect of the service of such former employees.</P>
      <P>If the Bill is passed, and we are confident that this will be the case, we would then, if the amendment were accepted, have to proceed to make regulations.  We would have to prepare those regulations, take them back to the Oireachtas, have them passed in here and passed in the Seanad before they would become operable. That would delay the disbursement of the funds.  This covers the point made by Deputy Yates in regard to a time limit on the Bill.</P>
      <P>We have no desire to delay this Bill. We intend to have the matter concluded, if at all possible, between now and Christmas.  We do not want to create a situation whereby the drafting of regulations would impede the disbursement of the funds to the people who deserve and need them.  We do not see any need to draft regulations because the number of people involved is only 150, at maximum and the amount of money involved is only £480,000.  As Deputy Howlin said that is a very small sum of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Doyle raised a point pertaining to other dependants, for instance, sisters of a former employee of Hospitals Trust (1940) Limited.  There would be legal <Col N="170" /> problems if we attempted to assist dependants other than spouses but of course, we will look at each case individually.  The problem is that my Department would be inundated with claims from other relations, from, perhaps, cousins, nieces, etc.  Under the law I cannot see any hope of catering for anybody other than the spouses concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Howlin asked when the payments will be made.  We envisage paying out as much of that money as possible before Christmas, taking into account the responses we get when we request information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no formal or conclusive list as such but we have information regarding a good number of the employees.  We will be publishing an advertisement which will give an opportunity to any former employee who is affected in any way as a result of the liquidation, to respond.

      <P>Surely there were payroll records to hand for the liquidator and PRSI details under the employer's registered number?  It would be very unfair if people who might not become aware of the advertisement at the time of its publication were to lose out.  There must be some responsibility on the Department to obtain the payroll records.  There would be clearly established legitimate records which could prove beyond doubt who were the 150 employees at the time of the closure of the company.  I do not see any need for an advertisement, and consider that it would be preferable to proceed on the basis of records rather than to leave it to chance as to what papers one might read.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to clarify that issue &mdash; and I do not want to mislead the House or any of the Deputies &mdash; we have details of the 147 workers who were affected at the time.  We think there may be three or four more but we do not have current addresses for many of those involved.  We have been in touch with the liquidator, we have had representations from SIPTU, we have met representatives of the pensioners' group, we have collated all the information but we want to make certain that we can identify, so far as possible, where these people are. We will publish an advertisement to give to people who may not be living in this city now, who may have moved to relations overseas or wherever, an opportunity of writing to us.  But we have the list of people with whom we want to deal.</P>
      <P>Deputy Yates asked a question about the level of pension applying to those pensioners who lost their <i>ex gratia</i> payments. The information available to me is that they are getting 14 per cent of their salary from the Hospitals Trust pension. I hope that clarifies the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to clarify for Deputy Howlin that he is absolutely right in his <Col N="172" /> interpretation of the situation that the payments being made will be treated under the provisions of section 114 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  If the total fund was to be distributed evenly among 150 people it would average only £3,200. Obviously, those involved will be well under the threshold for tax purposes.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's interpretation is correct but it is the other way around.  The people who lost the <i>ex gratia</i> elements of their pensions and who are still alive will be taken on age and years of service.  Consequently, they will have accumulated the right to the greater amount.  We hope to give them about £1,000 but it could be more or less.  We hope to give the people who lost their jobs on the day of the liquidation, some of whom would have short service and others who would have medium service a minimum of £500.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to follow up this point because, quite frankly, it causes me great concern.  I thought we had reached the view that those who had lost their jobs on the day the company went into liquidation were the people who were most disadvantaged in that those who had previously opted in a voluntary way for early redundancy would have got more than the statutory provision at that time. As I said, I understand the Minister is talking about ball park figures but obviously many people who lost their jobs on the day of the liquidation would have had a very long record of service with the company.  Is the Minister saying that there might be a great disparity between the amounts they would get &mdash; the minimum will be £500 but some people will get a great deal more?  Is that what the Minister has in mind?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not want anybody to misinterpret what I am saying. The figures I have given the House are the minimum.  With regard to the people who became redundant on the day of the liquidation &mdash; 16 March 1987 &mdash; some of them, by virtue of age and years of service, could get up to £4,000, some £3,000, scaling down to £500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the people who had left the company &mdash; some left the week of the liquidation and some prior to that &mdash; they lost their <i>ex gratia</i> payments.  We hope that those who are advancing in years, <Col N="174" /> etc, will qualify &mdash; as I said this will depend on age and other criteria &mdash; for £1,000 and upwards, if possible.</P>

      <P>It is obvious from the debate so far that there is a clear need for the amendment proposed by The Workers' Party to section 3.  On 7 November 1987, approximately 100 former employees of the company brought a claim for extra redundancy payments before the Labour Court.  The Labour Court in its recommendation took into consideration the submission made by the parties but stated it was not possible to determine what the eventual financial outturn of the liquidation would be because of pending courts actions.  In the circumstances, the court considered that a case existed for the payment of redundancy of two weeks per year of service. I must say that I find it difficult to understand the trend of the debate so far.  Does the Minister propose to honour the Labour Court recommendation that the 100 former employees should get the additional two weeks redundancy payment for every year of service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Sherlock is misinterpreting the purpose of this Bill.  Its purpose is very clear and explicit: we are disbursing special funds of up to £480,000 which accumulated as a result of non-drawn down prizes and deposit interest accumulating over a number of years and I, on behalf of the Minister for Health and the Department of Health, have responsibility in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill was brought forward to enable us to dispose of these funds which have been lying in abeyance since the liquidation of the company but the subsequent Labour Court decision is a matter for another Minister, and, above all, it has to be determined by the liquidator in his disbursement of the assets of that <Col N="175" /> company.  As such, I have no role, on behalf of the Minister or the Department, in that area.  Our function under this Bill is to deal with the special fund of £480,000 which has accumulated.  We want to ensure that the maximum amount of flexibility is available so that we can treat every worker as fairly as possible based on their age, years of service and the gravity of their situation.  However, we are constrained by the number of workers and the small amount of money to be disposed of.  This is what the Bill refers to; the Labour Court recommendation does not enter into the issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister some very simple questions. Perhaps he will write them down and give me some straight answers.  There are two categories of people &mdash; category A, those who took early retirement, and category B, those in full-term employment who were made redundant on 16 March 1987. What did the people in category A &mdash; those who took early retirement &mdash; actually get?  Did they get any <i>ex gratia</i> payment or pension?  If they did get a pension, are they still getting it?  I should like to establish who lost what.</P>
      <P>I assume that those in category B &mdash; those in full-time employment who were laid off on 16 March &mdash; got statutory redundancy, but did not get an <i>ex gratia</i> payment or pension.  Is that correct?  Will the Minister answer those questions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>About 120 employees left in 1978 and 1980 on voluntary redundancy. They got an <i>ex gratia</i> top-up on their pensions which they lost when the company went into liquidation in March 1987.  That rate was about £1,000.  With regard to those in category B, 147 employees were made redundant on 16 March 1987.  If they had enough service they got pensions and statutory redundancy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, most definitely. Anyone who has a pension entitlement is getting the 14 per cent or thereabouts of their salaries from the Hospitals Trust pension fund.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that those who left in 1978 and 1980 got an <i>ex gratia</i> top-up on their pensions which they lost when the company went into liquidation. Will the Minister clarify that point?  My understanding of an <i>ex gratia</i> payment is that a person gets one lump sum on the day he leaves a company.  Did these people get the <i>ex gratia</i> payment and the pension?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The people who left the company in 1978 and 1980 got approximately 14 per cent of their salary in pension.  They were to get 50 per cent of their salary as a top-up, which they would be paid annually, but when the company went into liquidation they lost that.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>That is, presumably, those who took early retirement.  I am not talking about the total amounts of money but about the reckonable way it is done, which must be based on years of service. Is the flat rate per year of service the same for both groups?</P>

      <P>The first group will get more.  We hope to pay them a flat rate of approximately £1,000 and the second group a flat rate of approximately £500. Age, years of service and situation will be taken into account.  These are minimum figures.  We cannot establish the maximum until we examine each case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take the case of a person with 30 years' service who took early retirement on 1 April 1980 and somebody with 30 years' service who was made redundant on 16 March 1987.  Will they get the same amount?  The reckonable service is identical.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The flat rate is not the same.  The people who went out on early retirement or on pension and who lost their <i>ex gratia</i> payment and their pension top-up will get more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned at that attitude.  If we look at this by way of loss, there is a case to be made to sustain the <Col N="178" /> Minister's weighting of money to pensioners who are losing out on their <i>ex gratia</i> top-up, but in equity they volunteered to go before the company collapsed. They fared better than those who left when the company went into liquidation and simply got statutory entitlements. There is a strong case that those with identical service should be treated the same way.  When the Minister said there would be a disparity, I thought it would be based on length of service and that two individuals with comparable service belonging to either group would be treated in like manner.  I do not see any justification for one group having a greater weight put on their years of service. It has been my contention that those who lost their jobs on the day and simply got statutory redundancy should be better treated than those who lost their <i>ex gratia</i> amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The first group &mdash; those on pension &mdash; will get a flat rate of about £1,000 and the difference in any of the payments made to them will be minimal, varying between £900 and £1,100.  They all had the same level of service and left at a particular time.  The people who left as a result of liquidation obviously will have the greater claim.  Some of them would have very short service and we want to give them, say, £500, but others with longer service will receive amounts ranging up to £4,000.  The first group will get a flat rate of £1,000.  The second group falls into two categories, those who have a minimum service and will get about £500 and those who will qualify for the maximum of about £4,000.  I hope that clarifies the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has contradicted himself.  I asked who would get the higher rate in terms of reckonable service and the Minister replied that it would be the former group, those who took early retirement.  The Minister is now saying that they will get a lump sum of about £1,000, irrespective of years of service.  The rate per year of service for the second group will be higher, which is not what the Minister said earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="179" />
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Pensioners who went out voluntarily or on grounds of age and years of service have lost and we propose to pay them approximately £1,000 by way of flat rate gratuity or gesture.  Those who lost out on liquidation fall into two areas, those who had short term service, who will receive about £500, and those who had longer service and will qualify for up to £4,000.  This is where we need flexiblity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the Minister has outlined what he intends to do, he should reflect on it.  The first group, those who took early retirement, have lost an annual sum which was part of their pension &mdash; 50 per cent, I think.  The other group also lost and that matter was dealt with by the Labour Court.  Their loss is greater.  I disagree with the proposal to give a minimum of £500 to someone who had three or four years' service when the company went into liquidation, while another person may get up to £4,000.  I do not believe there should be a minimum.  Payment should be based on years of service.</P>
      <P>Let us suppose somebody entered the service of the Hospitals Sweepstakes at age 17 and was made redundant at 24 years of age.  Obviously that person would have had a much greater chance of obtaining another job and getting on with their life than somebody who had given, say, 30 years service and was made redundant at 54 years of age on 17 March 1987.  If the Minister is proposing to give minimum guaranteed sums, within the second group, over and above that to which they would be entitled per year of service, that would strike me as being unfair.  Whatever the sum of money available for distribution among the second category, that is those who fit into a clear-cut group, who were in full-time employment and made redundant, I contend they should be paid solely on the basis of their years of service; that is the way all other systems work.  It would strike me that that would be only fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would concur with Deputy Howlin that the Minister's second explanation to him about someone with 30 years' service who went out in 1980 or someone else <Col N="180" /> who was made redundant at the time of liquidation does not quite answer the question as to who will receive the greater amount of money in that case.  For example, let us say that Mr. Murphy was made redundant on the date of liquidation with 30 years' service.  Then there was Miss Murphy who opted for voluntary redundancy, let us say, on 1 April 1980 &mdash; with 30 years' service, which of those two will receive more money this Christmas?  That question must be answered.  Obviously, if either group receives more, that must be accounted for by a difference in the rate per reckonable years' service.  Within the second group &mdash; the subgroups the Minister has outlined &mdash; the amount should be a sum calculated on years of service rather than a minimum payment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Yates has clearly illustrated the position as I see it. If a person had short term service when the company went into liquidation on 16 March 1987, if they were reasonably young, they had a good chance of getting another job.  The minimum payment we hope to make to such a person will be approximately £500.  The other person who, by virtue of age, service and commitment to the company, found themselves in circumstances of having lost their job, their pension having been reduced and receiving no <i>ex gratia</i> payment, now out of work with little or no chance of obtaining another job, will receive a higher payment based on years of service, on their age, amounting perhaps up to £4,000.</P>
      <P>People who prior to March 1987 opted for voluntary redundancy and left, who retired on grounds of age and are receiving a pension, amounting to 14 per cent only of their then salary, who have been losing out on the topping-up facility, will receive a flat rate of approximately £1,000 each.</P>

      <P>Certainly.  My straight-forward question is this: Miss Murphy took voluntary redundancy in 1980 after 30 years' service.  She is still receiving a pension amounting to 14 per cent of her then salary but has lost out on the topping-up money, the one cheque per year. Mr. Murphy was made redundant on 16 March 1987, having 30 years' service. Who will get what in those circumstances? Will they receive the same amount of money or who will get more and who less?</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat puzzled as to why section 7 (1) has been inserted. Perhaps the Minister would clarify, first <Col N="184" /> of all, whether there is a suspicion that people who have not claimed this money will come out of the closet and claim it over the next four years.  Is that the reason for the insertion of this subsection? If the Minister intends to pay out the money by Christmas why has this four-year clause been inserted?  If he disburses all the money, if he does not leave a residue of money, and if someone claims a prize, that charge will fall on the Exchequer.  I understood the Minister to say at the end of the Second Stage that many of these prizes go back decades; they were not won in the eighties, but much earlier.</P>
      <P>It would be better if this open ended clause were not there.  People have had an opportunity to claim their prizes and there should be a time limit.  I referred earlier to a time limit on the disbursement of the funds, but I think four years is far too long to leave the Exchequer open to litigation, charge or whatever.  It would be better to tidy up the housekeeping to get this finished and to say that if people have not claimed their prizes by 1 March next, for example, that would be the end of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy Yates.  One of the hallmarks of the sweepstakes was that you were at liberty to claim your prize any time after you won it.  It is possible, though highly unlikely, that people will discover they have won a prize.  I understand section 4 was to transfer the liability from the sweepstake fund to the Minister for Health.  It is not as if there would be any new liabilities, it is simply that old liabilities would be transferred to the Minister for Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My argument is the reverse to Deputy Yates' argument, that we should leave it open ended.  We should not have this section but instead we should allow anybody who discovered he has entitlement, to pursue that against the Minister for Health.  The amount of money is quantifiable and because we know how much outstanding prizes are not collected &mdash; it is highly unlikely that any will be collected at this stage &mdash; the prospects of <Col N="185" /> someone discovering he can collect a few shillings due to him should be maintained and that liability should fall on the Minister for Health as envisaged under section 4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this section is to provide that any further claims in respect of undistributed prizes can be made only within a period of four years but also that this period of four years would be extended in the case of a claimant under a legal disability which prevents him processing a claim within that period.  We propose to distribute the £480,000 in its entirety among the 150 or so people.  If over the next four years, somebody discovers he won a prize and did not claim it, he can do so over the next four years and the Exchequer will pay that prize to him.  However, there may be some certain circumstances, due to medical disabilities, institutionalisation and so on, where a person was not aware he had won this prize and we feel it would be unfair to deprive him, when it is discovered he has won a prize, of claiming it.  That is why that other clause is there.  We have taken very detailed advice on this, and the advice we have is that at least four years should elapse before we would even close the door, much less put a lock on it.</P>

      <P>Originally the Hospitals Trust (1940) Limited were set up to fund a capital programme for public <Col N="186" /> hospitals.  Some hospitals or some institutions, albeit a small number, would have been supported with funds from that fund in the past.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the Ballsbridge property and why the unfortunate ex-employees had no recourse to any of that money and whether the timing of the legislation which gave legal protection to the rights of employees in the event of liquidation came too late for these cases. The Minister referred to this point on Second Stage.  There has been a very strong demand by the former employees, that the receipts from the sale of the Hospitals Trust premises at Ballsbridge be made available.  What is the Minister's understanding?  Can he use his good offices to ensure that there might be some additional comfort from that quarter for the ex-employees?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would love to be able to use my good offices to create further funds for the ex-employees of Hospitals Trust (1940) Limited.  However, the Ballsbridge property was held in private ownership by a private company and as such Hospitals Trust (1940) Limited were only tenants.  Consequently, the disposal of that property is covered by other law and is in the hands of the liquidator, and the Minister for Health, myself or the Department of Health cannot have a role by law, in getting any of those funds. We regret that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware <Col N="187" /> that under the Landlord and Tenant Act any tenant of a commmercial property who has tenure for longer than three years has automatic legal right to a 35-year lease and cannot be put out of the place willy-nilly.  Therefore, there must have been some tenancy rights that were of some value, and therefore there should have been some proceeds.  That is a normal commercial property position. The Minister knows that you cannot put out a tenant once that tenant has three years tenure.  That means he has fixed rights and the only way a landlord can get him out is to buy him out.  My understanding is that this property has since been sold and is part of a very major development, which is welcome in its own right, but surely there should have been some proceeds from that sale?  The fact that it was a tenancy does not mean certain rights do not have a beneficial value.</P>

      <P>Do I take it that when it is concluded there will be substantial debts that the liquidator will not be able to cover, or is it envisaged that most of the debts will be covered?

      <P>At all Stages the Opposition have wholeheartedly expedited the passage of this legislation and I hope it will bring some small comfort to those ex-employees who, in my view, have been very shamefully treated by the sweepstakes board.  I am also disappointed that the whole concept of sweepstakes money going to public hospitals no longer exists with the repeal of these Acts.  I hope that the national lottery will ensure that the health service in general is not at a net loss in view of the fact that a lot of charitable organisations have lost out badly because of the success of the national lottery.  I hope the Department of Health will bear that in mind so that there will be no loss in total money terms to the health sector.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicate the support also of the Labour Party for this measure.  It is acknowledged on all sides of the House that it is a very inadequate sum of money, giving poor recompense to people who gave a lifetime service in building up the State's health service.  I instanced the very many campaigns in relation to the eradication of tuberculosis, for example, and the provision of a capital fund to enable a national structure of hospitals to be constructed.  That was made possible by the dedicated work of the people who worked for the sweepstakes over the years.  They were treated shamefully at the end and, belatedly, we are beginning <Col N="190" /> to recognise that.  The amount of money is important, but the acknowledgement that these people are due a debt is important as well.  This Bill serves a dual function &mdash; providing a small financial compensation but also an acknowledgement by the Oireachtas that these people were shabbily treated and that their service is, belatedly, very much appreciated.</P>
      <P>I indicated previously that I do not share the view that we should look, in the nineties, to a lottery as a core method for funding our health services.  There should be a proportion of money set aside from the Exchequer purse to provide the level of service that is required by the citizens of this country.  That is a matter of principle.</P>
      <P>I do hope it will be possible, once this Bill is enacted, for the money to be paid out on the timescale the Minister has indicated to this House, and that the small amount of money available will be paid to those people in time for them to enjoy it at Christmas.</P>

      <P>I, too, would like to say that I and The Workers' Party are glad that this Bill has now passed and that the employees, the very faithful and loyal servants who were discarded in a brutal and heartless way, will get some recompense. The Irish Hospitals Trust was one of the great success stories of this country for several decades.  It was established in the thirties and the sweepstakes it ran provided badly needed funds for the development of hospitals.  I hope the fact that it no longer exists will not leave a void.  It must be recognised that the contribution for health must be a much higher percentage of the gross national product.  That is the basis on which health funding should be provided.  As I said, I am glad that there is some recompense for the people who gave such loyal service.</P>

I would like in particular to thank my three <Col N="191" /> Opposition colleagues, the spokes-persons for Health with whom I have had a wonderful working relationship over the past 15 months.  I would like to thank Deputy Doyle for his very generous contribution to this debate.  I would like also to say on behalf of the State, the Minister for Health and the Department, how much we appreciate and acknowledge the loyal and dedicated service given by the workers employed by Hospitals Trust (1940) Limited and that I identify with the difficulties in which they find themselves and have every sympathy with their position.  We would love to be able to assist them further and we appreciate the co-operation of the House in disbursing the only funds available to the Minister for Health in assisting them.</P>
      <P>Taking into account what has been said by other Deputies, we can assure the House that we will provide the maximum amount of resources available for the health services taking into account the budgetary situation prevailing at any given time.

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am opposing section 2.  This section is what the Bill is all about, dissolving Fóir Teoranta, and, therefore, to oppose section 2 is effectively to oppose the Bill.  In April 1989 the Minister stated his intention to abolish Fóir Teoranta.  At that time he said the company were not required any longer because, first, the new Companies Bill would bring forward procedures which would enable the functions carried out by Fóir Teoranta to be carried out in an alternative manner.  Since then we <Col N="192" /> have had the collapse of the Goodman Group.  The Dáil was recalled in August and a Chapter of the Companies Bill was introduced as separate legislation.  We know now there is a way whereby, following certain procedures, the court can provide an examiner to examine the assets of a company in difficulties.  When the examiner has reported, the courts are empowered to allow a company, which on the face of it would be destined for liquidation under the old legislation, to continue to trade themselves out of difficulty.</P>
      <P>Already, even though there is very limited experience of the new legislation apart from the Goodman Group of companies and I understand a small textile company, it is quite clear that certain difficulties are arising with it.  There are, for example, doubts about the constitutionality of the legislation.  Secondly, there are doubts about the cost of the procedure, particularly as it relates to smaller companies.  There are so many occasions on which the examiner can return to court that there is a doubt whether what is effective legislation theoretically will in practice be of benefit for the rescue of small companies.  There is a school of thought in the accountancy profession which suggests that such a dent will be made in the assets of a small company by the involved legal procedures in the appointment of an examiner, his reporting to the courts and making recommendations, they will be whittled away in the attempt to rescue it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend, in the course of Committee Stage of the Companies Bill to raise this matter.  I received correspondence recently which I would like to draw to the Minister's attention.  It relates to a company in one of the Border counties which went into liquidation in 1984.  The liquidators have now brought in their final report and are to distribute the assets.  After the liquidators finished, out of assets of £59,000, there is only £13,000 left to distribute to creditors.  When, under fairly straight-forward procedures involving liquidation, a major firm of accountants in this city can be called in and whittle £59,000 of assets down to <Col N="193" /> £13,000, leaving the unfortunate creditors with less than one-quarter of the assets at the time the company got into difficulty, is it any wonder there are doubts about the Companies Bill introduced in August, with the involved legal procedure of an examiner having recourse to the High Court on so many occasions before he can bring in his report?</P>
    <P>I draw attention to these facts because the major plank on which the Minister based his decision to abolish Fóir Teoranta was that they would no longer be necessary when the new Companies Bill was on the Statute Book.  The Minister referred to that Chapter of the Companies Bill which is now law as a result of the emergency recall of the Dáil in August arising out of the Goodman affair.  We know that that legislation, and the procedure which has been referred to in the debate as being along the lines of Chapter 11 legislation in the United States, is not an effective substitute for the activity carried out by Fóir Teoranta over so many years which resulted in the saving of many companies and thousands of jobs.</P>
    <P>The Minister also on that occasion said there was now no great pressure on companies because interest rates have come down.  Of course interest rates had come down in April 1989 but they shortly went back up again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>They came down again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> They went up four points and came down one point.  Therefore, the Minister is still about three points on the wrong side of the argument since he made it.  If the second plank in the Minister's argument for the abolition of Fóir Teoranta was that we would have permanently lower interest rates and that the cost of money to companies would be permanently at a low level, which would obviate the necessity for an organisation such as Fóir Teoranta being involved in the rescue of companies, he certainly has not justified <Col N="194" /> the decision he made based on that plank of policy.</P>
      <P>In passing, and arising from that, I would like the Minister to comment on something else when replying.  For the last five or six months the Central Bank, I presume on the advice of the Department of Finance, have been following a very strict monetary policy.  When we entered the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS in 1979 the basket of currencies varied against each other to plus or minus 2½ per cent which, when one looks at the relative positions, allowed a fluctuation of about 3 percentage points for an individual currency.  Over the last five or six months the bank have been following a policy of pinning the Irish pound to the German Deutsche Mark.  There has been little or no fluctuation in that time of the Irish pound against the Deutsche Mark &mdash; it stayed at a rate of about £2.68.  All of a sudden in the middle of last week the bank changed that policy.  Such a change in policy, allowing the punt to fluctuate again within the EMS band, is a contradiction of everything the bank have been doing for the last five months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister why the very firm monetary policy which was being followed has now changed.  Will this change lead to higher interest rates? It seems that it will.  Could it be that the bank have less confidence now in the Government's fiscal policy than they had four or five months ago?  Could it be that the bank know now that the Minister is having difficulty in getting his Book of Estimates agreed.  It will be several weeks later than was promised and expected. The Taoiseach said today it would be ready in nine or ten days, sometime towards the middle of December.  If it has taken so long to prepare a Book of Estimates, and if the projections now are that the Minister will have difficulty in bringing in a budget in January which will increase borrowing rather than reduce it, could this be the reason the Central Bank are no longer as firm on their monetary policy as they have been for the last five or six months?  Could it be that the Minister, by failing to control public expenditure last year, sowed the seeds of a <Col N="195" /> difficult budget in 1991?  Are we facing a softer monetary policy which will lead to higher interest rates?  Be that as it may, certainly interest rates are three points higher than when the Minister made his statement on the future of Fóir Teoranta in April 1989.  At that time he firmly based his decisions on a number of policy planks, one of which was that interest rates were down and that, consequently, there was no need for a rescue agency along the lines of Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    <P>The Minister also argued at the time that, because of the introducton of the business expansion scheme, there were now opportunities for companies to acquire finance from the private sector and individual taxpayers and that they did not need to have recourse to a rescue agency like Fóir Teoranta.  The Minister made changes in the business expansion scheme to extend it to tourist activities and we know that hotels, some of which had pretty bad balance sheets, refinanced themselves by recourse to BES funds. While some of the funds supplied through the BES to hotels were spent on extending facilities, putting in a swimming pool, jacuzzi and sauna, sporting facilities and extra bedrooms, quite a lot of the money went towards improving the balance sheet of hotels who were not doing very well.  That was a legitimate use of the money.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage the Minister said that we probably would not need Fóir Teoranta for a number of reasons, one being that companies in difficulty in the future, instead of coming to a State agency, could go to the private sector and get business expansion scheme funds which would be the injection of capital they needed to get their balance sheet right.  He said that we would not need Fóir Teoranta and yet, the week before last, we were circulated with a report of the Comptroller and Auditor General who cast very serious doubt on the efficacy of the business expansion scheme or its desirability as an ongoing policy.  He drew attention to the fact the one company which had attracted £25 million of BES funds created seven jobs.  It is normal, in discussing SFADCo, <Col N="196" /> the IDA and Údarás na Gaeltachta and evaluating their activities, to look at the cost per job.  However, £25 million for seven jobs works out at £3.5 million per job.  That is some cost per job.  The business expansion scheme is up for renewal.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I agree with you quite frequently but on this occasion I must explain the position.  The Minister, in making the initial statement that he was abolishing Fóir Teoranta, said that one of the reasons we no longer needed them was that money would be available to companies in difficulties from the business expansion scheme.  I am showing that there are so many holes in the business expansion scheme at present that the water is coming through in all directions.  It is unlikely that the Minister will renew the scheme in April when it is up for renewal.  That is a legitimate point to make when I am opposing section 2 which, effectively, is the whole Bill because it says that the company is hereby dissolved.  Effectively, therefore, this is very like a Second Stage debate on section 2 because it abolishes Fóir Teoranta.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Is it the Minister's intention to renew the business expansion scheme next April?  Will it be announced in the budget or will he take the advice of the Comptroller and Auditor General who stated that it is not an effective scheme and that it should be looked at again?  He advised that if the Minister and the Government want a particular economic response from a certain sector in the economy, it is more effective to target it by way of grant than to broaden the target by involving the investor in very wide schemes where the main benefit is tax relief and the main loss &mdash; untargeted &mdash; is the tax foregone to the Exchequer.  The business expansion scheme is not an effective vehicle for rescuing companies.  If a manufacturing company is in difficulty I would take a lot of convincing that the investor, who is principally motivated by a tax break, will put his hard earned savings into it.  If it is a tourist-type industry &mdash; a hotel or a scheme of cottages and holiday homes &mdash; and in difficulty it would also be hard to convince me that a tax break scheme is an effective way of stimulating activity in that area and that we get value for money, pound for pound, in circumstances where there is no targeting of the investment or evaluation of the benefit.  I know that the company which attracted £25 million of BES money and created seven jobs was not a tourist-type endeavour but it certainly is open to question and the Minister, in basing his case on it, has a major difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also said &mdash; this was his fourth point &mdash; that NADCORP would also be a new vehicle for venture capital.  On reflection, two years later, the Minister will realise that even though the NADCORP portfolio is quite good, they are not inclined to lend to companies in difficulties and they certainly do not see themselves as some kind of rescue venture capital agency.  It would be a very foolish manager who would look at a range of options and deliberately select <Col N="199" /> companies in difficulty for investment, especially when the original intention of NADCORP was to provide venture capital to high risk start-up companies but not to companies in difficulties.  When we discussed the alternative arrangements introduced by the Minister when bringing forward part of the companies legislation which was proceeding through the House when the Dáil was recalled in August, the Minister claimed that this would be the alternative procedure which would make Fóir Teoranta unnecessary.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the Minister said that Fóir Teoranta were unnecessary because interest rates had gone down and the competitive climate for industry was now much better.  Not alone have interest rates gone up, but the actions of the Central Bank last week were a clear signal to all of us that they are losing confidence in the Minister's fiscal policy, and that they see rain clouds ahead over the January budget.  One would not need to work in the Central Bank to know that the Minister will have problems in the January budget.  It is clear that the BES will not provide an alternative means of rescue for companies in difficulty.  It seems that the case made that NADCORP would carry out this function is a very spurious one indeed.  That was never the intention when they were set up and whatever difficulties they are experiencing now, they do not arise from the fact that they acted as a rescue agency.  If they attempted to act as a rescue agency they would be going beyond their remit.</P>
    <P>As I did on Second Stage, I am opposing the Bill.  Once this section is passed the rest of the Bill is consequential, a matter of little conflict.  The principle of the Bill is in section 2.  I disagree with the principle and I am opposing section 2.  I will be calling a vote on it.  We may spend some time debating the consequential sections, but once section 2 goes through, that is the guts of the Bill and everything else is of little debating consequence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 contains the net <Col N="200" /> point of this legislation.  I was not responsible for finance in the Labour Party when this Bill was taken through Second Stage but I have read the Second Stage debate. As I said earlier on, I suspect that the reason for the abolition of Fóir Teoranta was related to the time when every Government Department were asked to surrender victims in order to frighten people in the public service generally and shake out some of the quangos, some of the extended sections of the public service which needed to be pruned, or so it was termed in the eyes of the economic advisers at the time.  Every Department surrendered some of their outposts.  The Dublin Transportation Authority was surrendered, An Foras Forbartha was surrendered, and it was logical for the Department of Finance to surrender one of their outposts, in this instance Fóir Teoranta.  While Deputy Noonan was right to take apart the spurious arguments put forward as a justification, the Minister should be able to indicate that there was some connection between the timing of the announcement of that decision to abolish Fóir Teoranta and the other decisions made at that time.</P>
      <P>There is certainly a need for the restructuring of Fóir Teoranta.  For that reason the Labour Party opposed Second Stage of this Bill and we will maintain that position when the vote is called.  We should retain some kind of positive interventionist mechanism above and beyond what is already there.  Since Fóir Teoranta were established, the capital market and the taxation system have been transformed and, to a lesser extent, the advent of NADCORP provides venture capital for certain areas of activity. Without going into the history of Fóir Teoranta too deeply, their advent related to circumstances in Ireland after the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement, and the opening up of free trade, when traditional manufacturing industries not used to the brunt of competition found themselves in difficulties.  Fóir Teoranta were introduced by the late George Colley when there was a need for this kind of interventionist agency and they were supported by everyone at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="201" /> We are now facing a similar period with the advent of 1992.  The detailed studies, are not being disseminated certainly to the workers in the various enterprises, on the impact of the single market on sectors of our economy which were previously not exposed to the full brunt of free trade and competition, particularly in the services area, show that, notwithstanding the pro-active advice being given by the EUROPEN campaign, certain companies in those sectors will be very vulnerable and will go to the wall.  We have accepted the reality of that argument.</P>
    <P>I suggest that we should have a restructured Fóir Teoranta in anticipation of companies in certain sectors having difficulties if they do not modernise.  We have the historical precedent of the Reports of the Committee on Industrial Organisation prior to the 1967 Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement.  Certain sectors of our manufacturing industry were identified by the Civil Service as being vulnerable and yet those companies did not modernise or diversify in anticipation of free trade and, consequently, went to the wall.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the EUROPEN campaign, and on 1992, I made the point that there will be a need for a pro-active State agency to anticipate companies or sectors which will be vulnerable, to approach them in advance of the difficulties with the offer of assistance to find partners to merge with to strengthen them, or help them to get additional capital to diversify out of their product range into something that will be economically more secure.  That is the type of positive State intervention we need in an open mixed economy.</P>
    <P>An instrument available to the Minister, although wrongly constituted at present, is Fóir Teoranta.  That instrument in principle exists in the body we are being asked to dissolve today.  For that reason I am proposing to the Minister that there is no need to dissolve Fóir Teoranta but that there is a need to reconstitute them effectively.  If the Minister looked at the detailed reports <Col N="202" /> that the EUROPEN campaign are getting on the various sectors he would see that the Irish economy between now and the end of 1992, even allowing for a certain amount of drift into 1993-94, will need this kind of intervention.  Getting rid of Fóir Teoranta is removing from the Minister's array of possible instruments for intervention a very effective instrument. For that reason I support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>My party will support the amendment but not with as much conviction as the main proposer.  The amendment addresses whether or not we should have a Fóir Teoranta or Fóir Teoranta as we know it.  I am very ambiguous on this question because in too many cases in the past Fóir Teoranta were a milk cow for inefficient businesses.  At the same time I recognise, where there is a potentially viable enterprise, that in the interests of saving jobs we have been left essentially without any rescue agency or mechanism and that in individual and isolated cases we may well live to regret that decision.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to retrace my Second Stage speech on this issue in which I traced the history of Fóir Teoranta which was very uneven.  They had a very inconsistent record in many respects including the publishing of accounts.  I specifically referred to the decision in the early eighties to discontinue publishing information on the companies who benefited from the decisions made by Fóir Teoranta.  I gave some specific instances in my Second Stage address and I do not wish to revive that information now but I must say I find some of it disconcerting.  I do not think any genuine audit of public moneys spent down through the years by or through Fóir Teoranta could leave us satisfied that the public got value for money and that no questions were raised about the manner in which some decisions were taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are of course having this debate in an artificial atmosphere in as much as the decision has effectively been taken and implemented.  I do not see any practical hope of saving Fóir Teoranta but I hope <Col N="203" /> the debate on Deputy Noonan's amendment may give cause to the Government to rethink whether there is a necessity for a rescue agency.  That is one of the odd things about this decision.  It is extraordinary that, at a time when this House will sooner rather than later be confronted with a major debate on the direction of our industrial policy, we find ourselves on a number of occasions pre-empted in the decisions we can take.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister for Finance again why it is the second triennial report on industrial performance has not been published. The Minister's colleague told me as long ago as last February that it was due for publication within a couple of weeks.  When I asked him the same question last week he gave me a similar reply, even though some ten or 11 months have elapsed in between.</P>
    <P>I think we know the reason: the report has concluded that in many respects our industrial strategy is a costly failure, that there is a need to change direction, that very specific conclusions are targeted and that not all Ministers in Cabinet are agreed on what that change in direction would mean.  Consequently, the Minister for Industry and Commerce is not in a position to publish the report.  Meanwhile we are suffering the cost of the inadequacy of that industrial performance through endemic unemployment and levels of emigration not seen since the fifties, yet for some reason the Government seem to be paralysed in terms of giving us the benefit of that report which, fortunately, because of a decision of a previous Minister for Industry and Commerce they are statutorily obliged to produce.  It is very probable that they have come up with some very germane conclusions indeed.</P>
    <P>We find ourselves in a situation where on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis the Minister has proceeded in any event to take certain decisions and this is only one of them, but it is a very pertinent one.  It leaves us in a situation where a potentially viable enterprise, which could be reconstructed, does not have an agency to which it can make its case on its merits.  We know <Col N="204" /> that, given the track record of the Irish commercial banks, with some exceptions depending on who you know and how large you are perceived to be, there is no point in going along with cap in hand to the commercial banks to say &ldquo;if only you would give me a bit of extra credit I might turn the corner and things are looking better for the year ahead&rdquo;.  We know the kind of reply that one will get especially if there is nobody easing one's passage to the door.</P>
    <P>I am also sceptical whether Chapter 11 as a mechanism is going to provide the comfort in the Irish industrial scene that was advanced by the Minister when introducing the Bill.  I am not so sure that it will do other than stave off the evil day for companies confronted with that possibility and perhaps give them a temporary respite.  It is not necessarily going to put them back on the road to recovery.  I also think that to some extent it pre-empts our freedom to have this discussion.  If a change in direction is necessary in industrial strategy then let us see if we can agree on it.  In the document which my party published, for example, we recommended greater emphasis on this kind of assistance being given through the Industrial Development Authority as the main promotional agency, the <i>quid pro quo</i> being that the Industrial Development Authority would take a stake in that enterprise, not necessarily a stake for all time, and provide the necessary investment at that juncture for a period which would be reviewed.  That is but one possible solution.</P>
    <P>As I said, the decision has already been taken to effectively shut down Fóir Teoranta and I see little point in prolonging the obsequies.  However, if Deputy Noonan's amendment gives rise to some fundamental questions which need to be addressed by the House I am happy to support him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for this amendment is not at all clear.  Basically what this amendment says is that we should stop the dissolution and go back to where we were.  We debated this matter at length on Second Stage, the <Col N="205" /> House voted on it and made a firm decision to abolish the agency and that decision stands.  I have tried on many occasions since then to have the Committee and Final Stages of this Bill taken but at all times I was told by my Whip &mdash; the Deputy should correct me if I am wrong &mdash; that Fine Gael were not anxious to take the Committee Stage of this Bill until Chapter 11 was incorporated in the Companies Bill and put in place.  Well, Chapter 11 is now in place and therefore I am not clear on why this amendment has been put down at this stage.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that Chapter 11 was recommended to me when Minister for Industry and Commerce by Fóir Teoranta from their experience in the marketplace.  It was their experience that people were coming to them too late in many instances and in others when they did arrive the rug could be pulled from under them at a moment's notice by the banks, creditors or anyone else.  Therefore they are the organisation who recommended to me when Minister for Industry and Commerce that I should consider incorporating Chapter II in a new Companies Bill, and that is precisely what I did.</P>
      <P>The proof of the pudding is always in the eating and the best test is to examine what has happened in the marketplace since the winding down of Fóir Teoranta. There was a net decline in manufacturing employment during the period 1980-86, but as is clear from the labour force survey, there has been a net increase of 5,700 jobs in the period 1987-90, clearly showing the case I made on Second Stage, that when we improved the competitiveness of the economy jobs were created.  Jobs were being lost faster in 1987 than we could produce them because we were uncompetitive, but since then we have made this economy very competitive; our inflation rate is half that of the European average and about one third of the British market where 40 per cent of our total trade takes place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Noonan makes the point that interest rates went up since the Second Stage debate took place, but interest rates came down by 1½ per cent; however, <Col N="206" /> the differential between the interest rate here and the Deustche Mark has been narrowed by one third in that period.  To try to put a lot of weight on a small blip in last Thursday's exchange rate markets when about a pfennig of a differential appeared and to say this is the new change in exchange rate policy is absolute nonsense and, of course, Deputy Noonan is well aware of that.  He also knows that the Central Bank have done an excellent job recently in marking and tracking the Deutsche Mark and getting us into a position where we would be able to take our place with the narrow band countries in the very highly competitive future that lies ahead of us in Europe.</P>
    <P>Whatever evaluation one wants to carry out in relation to what has happened since the decision to effectively close down Fóir Teoranta was taken, the situation has improved dramatically.  I thought for a moment we were having a discussion on the business expansion scheme or on next year's budget.  For some time I was not quite sure what we were discussing.  To try to elicit from me at this stage the evaluation of a BES scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of announcing what decisions may or may not be taken by the Government in relation to a certain scheme, but the example given by Deputy Bruton is not representative.  Over 600 companies, as the Deputy knows, were helped by that scheme.  No scheme is ever perfect and I think he and his party, and the parties opposite who participated in Government when introducing the business expansion scheme &mdash; to which they claimed so much credit &mdash; might take some of the criticism, if there is criticism, because the Comptroller and Auditor General was not carrying out an evaluation of the scheme.  He was merely talking about the structures that were in place.  If they were so far sighted in Government, why did they not put in <Col N="207" /> some of the structures about which they now complain and for which they were quite happy to take credit, and I give them credit for it?  I took action to stamp out any abuse, and I will leave it at that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn raised the question of the impact of the Single Market.  It may well be when we get to that stage and examine industrial incentives in this country, we may have to remove even more of the incentives, the props for industry which Fóir Teoranta was.  I do not believe in crutches.  The day is gone when we can rely on crutches.  We will have to live by our own means in the highly competitive market after 1992. The decision of the Government, which incidentally was taken in February 1989 when I was Minister but I am not arguing about it, was the correct one.  At that time we were preparing the economy for a highly competitive position.</P>
      <P>I do not accept what Deputy Rabbitte said &mdash; that finance is not available even if viable projects existed.  One can criticise the banks, which I have done from time to time, and there are many other financial institutions, besides the commercial banks.  I cannot accept the point that finance is not available to people who have viable projects.</P>

      <P>Can the Deputy make up his mind which side of the argument he is on.  I am not sure if the Deputy is saying we should dissolve Fóir Teoranta and that if there are fundamental issues involved he may support Deputy Noonan's amendment.  I cannot understand what his amendment is about because we now have Chapter 11, which Fine Gael were seeking.  Deputy Quinn has nailed his colours to the mast and said: &ldquo;I want an interventionist agency&rdquo;. That is his view and that of his party, but it is not one I share.  I do not understand where Deputy Rabbitte stands, on which side of the fence he stands or whether he is trying to sit on the centre of the fence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="208" /> There is one thing I would like to correct, and I am glad I got the opportunity because the Deputy raised the question of a full debate on industrial policy.

      <P>I hope the Deputy will accept that that is the position.  That prop was never intended to be a rescue agency.  It is an agency that takes preference shares or equity shares in a company. I hope I never gave any hint that it might involve itself in this area.  In relation to what has happened, on the competitiveness of the economy, on any examination as to whether this economy can stand on its own feet on the industrial side without Fóir Teoranta I think the case has been clearly proved and consequently I oppose this amendment.</P>

      <P>I want to say a few short words, even though I may be upsetting the schedule.  I oppose the dissolution of Fóir Teoranta because I had a very personal experience of a company in Cork, Sunbeam, that went to the wall but 450 jobs could have been saved had Fóir <Col N="210" /> Teoranta intervened.  I cannot understand at a time when we are spending lots of money producing new jobs, that we are dissolving a rescue agency which could save jobs when companies are in difficulty.  I have learned the very hard lesson of a company in my own constituency, in a very deprived area where in some places unemployment is up to 70 per cent, which was crying out for a rescue attempt by Fóir Teoranta in the spring of this year, but no help was forthcoming. As this legislation is going through I want to put on record, in a sharp way, my opposition to the dissolution of Fóir Teoranta.</P>

      <P>I simply want to query the sanctity of the figure of £2 million.  Can the Minister justify the necessity of including the figure of £2 million in the Bill rather than the figure of £1 million, £3 million, £1.5 million or any other figure?  What liabilities have been brought to the Minister's attention which give rise to the need for the figure of £2 million?</P>

      <P>Section 9 (1) entitles the Minister &mdash; it does not require him to do so &mdash; to advance up to £2 million to ICC to meet liabilities incurred by Fóir Teoranta which had not been discharged as of the transfer date.  These are liabilities which arise from the general statutory functions of Fóir Teoranta as set out in their founding legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of £2 million is designed to cover known liabilities, for example, the £242,000 outstanding to five client firms and deposits from receivers which under certain circumstances may have to be repaid together with interest thereon. <Col N="211" /> It is an enabling provision; it does not require the Minister to use up the £2 million.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (2), line 23, after &ldquo;order&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, but not until such changes in industrial policy as the Minister for Industry and Commerce considers necessary have been accepted by the Oireachtas&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with the point made by Deputy Rabbitte.  I find it difficult to understand the principles on which industrial policy are now based as we are awaiting the publication of the three year review on industrial policy. There has been one review since Deputy Bruton introduced legislation in this House requiring the Department of Industry and Commerce to carry out such a review.  The Minister for Finance said that he has not seen the report and implied that he is putting no pressure on the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Yet, we have been told widely that the report is ready and at Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have thought such a report would take into account the main aspects of industrial policy.  Yet, in the middle of last year out of a clear blue sky, the Government announced, through the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that the 10 per cent tax regime was being extended to the year 2010.  There was no review; it was simply a matter of thinking of a number.  In last year's budget the Minister for Finance proceeded with further reductions in section 84 lending and <Col N="212" /> of free capital depreciation.  One of the major planks of industrial policy, the rescue bank for industry, is now being abolished.  Yet, in parallel, contemporaneously with these major decisions about industrial policy there is supposed to be a review going on which will make recommendations to the Government on the future of Irish industrial policy.  It is difficult to understand the Government's industrial policy when on the one hand a review has been completed and the report which makes certain recommendations is before the Cabinet while, on the other hand, the Minister seemed to change industrial policy without putting forward convincing supporting arguments and we do not know if it runs counter to what is recommended in the review report.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Possibly. I put down this amendment to draw attention to the illogicality of industrial policy at present.  This Bill should not commence until industrial policy is clarified in the House and until the Minister for Industry and Commerce brings in whatever amendments he thinks are necessary to industrial policy.  If, in the course of his recommendations, he tells us that an interventionist agency to rescue industry, a State rescue bank, is no longer required then so be it, we will accept such a proposal then.  However, I strongly object to industrial policy being enunciated in a piecemeal fashion without any overall framework or indication of the direction in which we are going and in a fashion which may be counter to the trend of the people who have examined industrial policy and reported but whose report has not been published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>For the reasons I gave on section 2, I support this amendment as being sensible, logical and coherent. We cannot tackle something as serious and fundamental as a change in industrial policy by making it up as we go along but <Col N="213" /> that is what we have been doing for the past 15 months or so.</P>
      <P>This House knows that the triennial report on industrial performance has been concluded since the beginning of this year.  I cannot verify off the top of my head that it was 15 February but it was certainly in February when the Minister for Industry and Commerce told me in the House that the report was concluded, it required a preface by him and it would be published within the next couple of weeks.  I would not mind if we were talking about something which was incidental or peripheral but this issue goes to the heart of Government economic policy.</P>
      <P>No matter how one looks at the critical economic questions of the day unemployment remains our greatest problem. The Government ought to be given credit for having got a number of the other economic indictors relatively right but how permanently they have done so remains to be seen.  Certainly, some of the economic indicators have been got right but tragically unemployment is a desperately serious problem, seems to be endemic in this economy and, of course, would be so much more horribly and horrifically worse were it not for the safety valve of emigration.</P>
      <P>This goes back to the question of industrial policy and industrial strategy. Deputy Quinn and I, as well as the new Fine Gael, have some ideas on the distribution of wealth but the main problem we have is in creating the wealth in the first instance.  If we do not have a vibrant manufacturing sector we will not have the wealth generating capacity in the economy.</P>

It does not mean that there is a permanent lurch to the right on this issue; it is mainly common sense that if we do not generate wealth we cannot distribute it more equitably. That is fundamentally what the question of industrial policy is about.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan's amendment makes perfect sense.  The Minister for Finance on a hotch-potch basis is making up industrial policy as he goes along without any regard to the man who is charged with the framing of industrial policy and to the fact that there seems to be a general acceptance except in Government that we are going to have to change direction on industrial strategy.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be very reluctant to persist in being disorderly but the amendment we are addressing simply requires that the Bill should not be brought into force until such time as the Minister for Industry and Commerce has put forward whatever proposals he has for a revamp of industrial policy.  That makes sense.  The Minister asks where I stand.  I will tell him.  If I could see a set of proposals from the Minister for Industry and Commerce which addresses my fear about a potentially viable enterprise finding itself in temporary difficulty and not having an agency to look to for support, I would support the dissolution of Fóir Teoranta which served a role in saving employment in certain circumstances. I have direct personal experience of them.  They did so at quite a cost <Col N="215" /> and in many cases boosted up inefficient business at great cost to the taxpayer. One simply could not say in all cases that it was money well spent.  In many cases the problems were not financial but were due to managerial incompetence.  It is not possible to argue in an era of stringent economic considerations that we could persist in that.  However, we do not have an alternative and it is a pity to pre-empt what could be a major debate in this House on a new policy for industrial strategy wherein the taxpayer would get better value for money.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan instanced the decision in last year's Finance Bill concerning the extension of the 10 per cent tax regime to the year 2010.  The IDA were in all probability crying out for that.  Why was it considered so urgent, while the wider question of a comprehensive revamp of industrial policy is not considered urgent and can be postponed?  It is very pertinent that the Opposition parties should put pressure on the Government to publish that report and have that debate.  It is not off the point.  The Minister for Finance is at the heart of this dispute in Government.</P>

      <P>The Chair is not directly concerned with anything that might exist between the Deputy and the Minister.  The Chair is concerned that no Deputy is entitled to use a Committee Stage debate for far-reaching statements on different aspects of industrial policy or matters that would be more appropriate to the budget.  However meritorious the points he is making might be in the Deputy's own estimation, he is not entitled, because of the strictures on Committee Stage debate, to so ramble. It is no pleasure for the Chair to remind the Deputy of the position that one would expect every Deputy to know and accept.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but I <Col N="216" /> repeat that Fóir Teoranta is an instrument of industrial policy and it is proposed here that we should dissolve it. The amendment provides that it should be dissolved only when we have seen the proposals which the Minister for Industry and Commerce will bring forward.  I cannot see how that is off the point. Whether we like it or not, Fóir Teoranta is at the heart of the debate about the future direction of industrial policy.  The amendment makes perfect sense.  We would all be in a much better position to voice an opinion on the wisdom of shutting down Fóir Teoranta permanently if we knew what the Minister proposes to put in its place and the thrust of the new proposals.  This debate might help to bring forward those proposals at an earlier date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment.  To do so would mean that the policy decision of the Government that Fóir Teoranta should be wound up and its assets and liabilities &mdash; mainly its portfolio of loans and investments &mdash; be transferred to the ICC would for its implementation have to await changes in industrial policy, of an unspecified nature, which might be put before the Houses of the Oireachtas at some time in the future.  I can see no point in that. Essentially it would frustrate the basic purpose of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government, including the Minister for Industry and Commerce, have decided that the policy in relation to Fóir Teoranta is that the company should be abolished.  Industrial policy considerations were taken account of at the time and there is no change in the position in this regard.  Any common sense evaluation of what has happened in the industrial sector, with the provision of increased numbers of jobs, would lead to the reasonable conclusion that we can succeed without Fóir Teoranta.  All those matters were taken into consideration by the Government before they made their decision, and that decision stands.  Fóir Teoranta have been closed for business for the past 21 months.  What useful purposes would be served if this amendment <Col N="217" /> were to be carried?  Would it help any firm in difficulty?  It would not, for the simple reason that Fóir Teoranta is no longer in business except in relation to cases which were in hand as of February 1989.  I could not accept a postponement to some unspecified date in the future.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am not anticipating anything.  The Minister and the Government are already on the wrong side of the law in respect of the obligations in the industrial Act which require this report.  It should have been available well before the summer recess but we still have not seen it.  Decisions have been taken involving industrial policy which are being announced on a piecemeal basis, while at the same time we understand there is available to the Government a review of industrial policy over the past three years which contains major and radical recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not an attempt to defer the <Col N="218" /> completion of the Fóir Teoranta legislation to an unspecified date.  It is an attempt to get the Government to specify industrial policy.  For some reason there is total reluctance to specify the policy. This session has about three weeks to run and a Book of Estimates will be published in December.  The budget which will take other decisions on industrial policy will be introduced on the first day of the next session, yet we are still awaiting proposals on industrial policy.  This amendment is meant to be a lever on a reluctant Government to make them come forward with an industrial policy or, alternatively, explain to the House why they are so reluctant to publish the review of industrial policy which has been available for a long time.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to immediately introduce a National AIDS Plan to respond to the AIDS epidemic in Ireland; to establish a national task force on AIDS with a specific budget; and to ensure that the medical, community care, accommodation, financial and other needs of HIV-AIDS patients are properly provided for now and in the future.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is entirely appropriate, with next Saturday 1 December being World AIDS Day, that the Dáil has its first opportunity to debate in depth the AIDS epidemic in Ireland.  I know we have discussed previously the problems of haemophiliacs with AIDS, but this debate goes further and deals with all those who have contracted the HIV virus.  It is very important that this motion impel the Government into having a comprehensive national AIDS policy both in relation to the care of patients and the future control of the spread of the disease.</P>
      <P>Last September Fine Gael published a national AIDS plan.  We were the first party to address this issue in such a fundamental way.  This matter is extremely urgent.  AIDS is a killer disease of young people of tragic proportions.  The growth of the disease abroad if reflected here will be a social disaster.  If we look at the EC and America we see that between 1980 and 1990 that the numbers of AIDS cases have increased in a remarkable way.  In Europe in 1980 there were 19 recorded cases of AIDS; in 1990, there were 28,920 cases; in America there were 78 recorded cases of AIDS; in 1980; earlier this year there were 132,436 cases.  These figures do not take account of the hidden level of AIDS in so far as there is a total dependence in this country on voluntary testing to find incidence levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="222" /> The second alarming factor is that within these figures there is a steady and continuous growth in the proportion of AIDS patients who have contracted the disease through non-drug using heterosexual orientation.  Let me quote the figures in recent years.  In Ireland some years ago, all of the AIDS cases were related either to drugs or the homosexual community.  Now 5 per cent of them are non-drug using heterosexuals.  In America the figures have gone from 11 to 14 per cent; in Europe the figures have gone from 3 to 10 per cent.  This means there is a greater risk of the spread of the disease to the community at large and away from specific sections of the community such as the drug community or those who are homosexual.</P>
    <P>The two major issues facing the Government and Irish society in the context of AIDS are the proper care, in all its facets, for those with the virus, and a comprehensive plan to control the spread of the disease.  It is predicted by conservative estimates that there will be 20,000 people in Ireland who will be HIV positive by the end of this decade, the year 2000.  This epidemic needs a similar response to that of the health programme dealing with tuberculosis in the forties and fifties.  This means a departure from normal public health programmes. Unless a radical approach is adopted, Dublin may become the AIDS capital of Europe and AIDS patients may continue to suffer their sense of imprisonment through rejection by society of their illness on top of the trauma of dealing with a life-threatening illness.  The most striking thing that I have come across in talking to AIDS and HIV patients is that not only do they face the threat of a life-threatening illness but they feel they cannot talk to their relatives, their friends and neighbours about it because of the stigma and attitude to AIDS in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The first step that needs to be taken is to establish a national task force on AIDS.  At present there is an internal Department of Health committee that reviews the disease and the State response.  This is wholy inadequate.  The Department of Education have a pivotal <Col N="223" /> role in communicating to young people the nature of the disease itself, its spread and how it can be avoided.  The Department of Justice have a vital role in relation to the known facts that prisons have been an incubator for this disease both in this country and abroad.</P>
    <P>The valiant voluntary groups that have provided the frontline and often the core services for AIDS patients deserve greater recognition and it is vital that voluntary organisations would be represented on any task force.  The medical personnel dealing directly with AIDS should form part of the membership also. Fine Gael are proposing that this task force would be charged with the responsibility of formulating national policy on AIDS on an ongoing basis both in terms of its control and care for patients.  This group should be chaired by the national AIDS co-ordinator and will be empowered to pilot programmes in the public service which can later be adopted by the Department concerned on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>To ensure that this will not just be a talking shop, we are proposing that a minimum annual budget of £2 million would be allocated to this task force. Expenditure would require the consent of the Minister for Health in any specific area.  The scope of this expenditure could vary from educational or informational programmes to direct financial support and provision of care services.  Both the work of the task force and its budget would be reviewable after two years by the Government and the Oireachtas on the basis of reviewing progress and presenting biannual plans for further policy and administrative decisions.  Such a structure would be able to link with similar bodies established internationally and with the World Health Organisation which has recommended that each member state should establish such a vehicle for policy formulation and executive action.  It is vitally imperative in the first instance of dealing with this disease that such a national co-ordinating body be set up covering all the different Departments of State involved and the <Col N="224" /> people directly in the front line of dealing with this disease.</P>
    <P>Life in this country for an AIDS patient can be particularly grim.  It is common for patients who have been diagnosed as HIV positive to lose their jobs, to lose their accommodation and to experience a lack of access to some of the health and medical services.  These factors have influenced many to either suppress the problem of AIDS under the surface of public awareness or simply to emigrate to London.  This tragedy is totally unacceptable. AIDS patients do not have an automatic entitlement or access to a medical card or even disabled person's maintenance allowance.  There is no special provision for their unique dietary, mobility and heating expenses.  The community care services in health boards across the country are often ill prepared to cope with the home care needs of patients between illnesses in the community. The financial difficulties of such patients extend after their death by virtue of the fact that life assurance is not available for them.  Medical services at hospitals are often inaccessible at week-ends resulting in patients ending up in different hospitals for different ailments.  This is even more pronounced in the regions. All of this results in greater anxiety for the patients concerned.</P>
    <P>There is only one consultant in the whole country dealing with AIDS.  She is Fiona Mulcahy, the genito-urinary consultant in that department at St. James's Hospital, Dublin.  There is no dedicated ward for AIDS patients so that they can receive their special intense nursing requirements at this hospital.  There is a desperate need for a second consultant appointment either in this hospital or in an alternative unit on the north side of Dublin.  It is incredible and, in my view, shameful that a north side Dublin hospital has not take up a second unit and I would be particularly critical of the role of the Mater Hospital in not coming forward with positive proposals to ensure the second consultant appointment on the north side.</P>
    <P>Voluntary funding through the AIDS fund and other voluntary organisations <Col N="225" /> has paid for some of the essential medical staff in the genito-urinary department at St. James's Hospital.  Funding for one registrar has been provided by the British Medical Research Council.  The present situation of <i>ad hoc</i> and uncertain national lottery applications for both these staff and counsellors is unfair to all those directly involved.  There is a shortage of nursing staff.  It is common in Britain in an AIDS ward for there to be eight nursing staff while, in similar conditions here there are only two.</P>
    <P>All the statistics show that there will be a steady increase in the number of AIDS patients who will require care and treatment in the years ahead.  Yet there is no planning for the future growth and provision of services in this area.  The immediate minimum requirement is a dedicated ten bed unit in St. James's Hospital, the appointment of additional medical staff and counsellors and the proper availability of equipment.</P>
    <P>Accommodation is another basic requirement for the AIDS patient, 80 per cent of whose time is spent in the community.  Tenants of private rented accommodation may suffer discrimination where they can lose their accommodation or, alternatively, not be able to maintain weekly or monthly rent payments on their flat.  There is an urgent requirement for sheltered housing for some patients while they are still in the community.</P>
    <P>Home nursing is vital.  In the early stages it was up to a voluntary organisation, Cáirde, to provide this essential service.  The health boards need to reorganise their services to provide for the specific needs of AIDS patients.  There are huge emotional traumas attaching to this disease.  This means a great need for counselling on a continuous basis.  There are less than a handful of such professionals in this area which has been totally neglected.</P>
    <P>Discrimination can also extend into the workforce, mainly due to ignorance.  In 1988 a circular was introduced into the Civil Service to give a minimum level of protection for those patients in terms of their rights of employment.  This set of <Col N="226" /> priciples should be implemented not only in the Civil Service but in the general public service, semi-State bodies and in places of employment of a reasonable size, say, over 20 or 30 employees.</P>
    <P>The largest single component of AIDS patients to date has related to the drugabusing community.  There is a common agenda in terms of tackling AIDS and drug abuse, especially in our urban areas. This can often be manifest in the most marginalisd groups in society.  These young people may be cynical and resentful of both public authorities and their services.  Centralised bureaucratic facilities will not meet their needs.  It is imperative that the Minister, in conjunction with other Departments, put in place on the ground, especially in certain urban areas, social workers and general practitioners to provide a range of services for these at risk groups.  By this I mean the provision of clean needles, methadone maintenance, condoms, counselling and medication.  This concept is based on the totality of care required by the patient and is exclusively client-based in a community setting.  I am talking about the most deprived ghettos of urban Ireland where the people who suspect they may be HIV positive see the lack of care and treatment for those who are HIV positive and therefore take the determined decision to keep their own diagnosis undisclosed and away from the authorities. If they saw there was a proper level of basic human care they would come forward earlier for treatment, which would be in their own best interests.</P>
    <P>Residential and respite care is increasingly becoming required for AIDS patients especially in terminal conditions. A new unit has been opened at Cherry Orchard Hospital.  This must be extended immediately to the regions with a similar provision in Cork and Galway.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael, therefore, are calling, in this motion, on the Government to immediately take the following decisive clear steps in the coming months through the forthcoming budget and Book of Estimates.  These are: the appointment of a second genito-urinary consultant <Col N="227" /> physician with specific responsibility to deal with AIDS patients; the immediate allocation of ten dedicated AIDS-related hospital beds in St. James's Hospital and a similar unit to be opened in a northside Dublin hospital; all HIV positive patients to have eligibility for a medical card if they satisfy a means test for a hospital services card; a programme of financial assistance through superintendent community welfare officers in each of the eight regional health boards to provide money for the heating, mobility, dietary and burial expenses of AIDS patients; and the introduction of an anti-discrimination code of practice in employment for AIDS-HIV patients.</P>
    <P>In terms of planning for the future the Minister for Health should ensure that an AIDS forum group is established in each of the eight regional health boards involving the different components of the health board which deal with the areas of sexually transmitted diseases, community care services, relevant voluntary groups, representatives of the health promotion unit of the Department of Health and health board management.  The purpose of each forum is to review the coordination of AIDS-HIV related services within each health board area and to ensure access to services on a seven-day week basis as well as planning for the future.</P>
    <P>In relation to education and information, all post-primary schools should have available from this academic year onwards a structured AIDS-HIV education programme to specifically advise young students of the risk of contracting the disease, the avoidance of the disease through behavioural patterns, attitudes to the disease and an outline of services for patients.  This should be coupled with a nationwide information programme through the availability of leaflets, advertising and other material aimed at the sexually active adult population, which would advise on the risks of contracting the disease as well as the behavioural patterns required to avoid the virus.  This programme should also include a promotional campaign relating <Col N="228" /> to the virus whereby the pubilic would be encouraged to participate in voluntary testing, which would be available nationwide and would have the back-up facility of pre and post-test counselling.  Each health board would be obliged to make available such services and advertise their availability.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the role of prisons as acting as an incubator of this disease. It is remarkable that the prisons have not been targeted as playing a vital role in the spread of the disease by the Government to date.  There is little or no contact between the health services, health personnel and health structures of the prison services.  Medical facilities in prisons are deplorable.  In Britain, each prison is visited by a genito-urinary consultant physician on a fortnightly basis.  There is a need for proper medical centres in our prisons, with a visitation and consultation process on at least a fortnightly basis by a consultant or senior registrar.  Further more, I believe the policy of segregation of HIV-AIDS prisoners in our prisons should be reviewed and ultimately abolished.</P>
    <P>It must be assumed, in terms of a future code of practice, that all prisoners are potentially HIV positive, and the necessary health and safety procedures are then put in place for all prisoners.  It has been totally inhuman and degrading to hear the first-hand reports of prisoners who have been put in the segregation wing of one particular prison.  It should be an immediate priority of the task force on AIDS to ensure that everything from release procedures from prisons to the direct medical procedures and facilities therein are updated in a modern way that will not only provide a caring attitude but ensure that the disease is not unnecessarily spread.</P>
    <P>Critical to the control of the virus is proper information.  It is an essential prerequisite that maximum knowledge be available as to the prevalence of HIV.  To date there has been a total dependence on voluntary testing.  In other countries such as America and Britain, as well as across Europe, screening systems have <Col N="229" /> been put in place that are based on anonymity, which will yield a purely statistical analysis or broad indicator level of the disease in society.  It is vital that the target age group of 15 to 45 years is reached.  I believe the best way to achieve this would be the testing of patients entering accident and emergency wards in our acute general hospitals.  This would be done on the basis of the consent of the patient in question.  If they did not give their consent the test would not go ahead, but whether or not the test went ahead the opportunity for voluntary testing whereby the people would be notified of the result would still be there in the normal way, as I have outlined earlier. The basis of the anonymity would be that all the blood samples would go to a central laboratory and all the statistics would be recorded without knowing whose blood it was.  This would indicate the number of HIV positive people in the community at large.  As is generally accepted people, having contracted the disease, register as HIV positive within two to six months.  Therefore, we could get a rapid, up-to-date picture of a random group of people who are going through our hospital system.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that this would not interfere with any individual's rights to have a voluntary test, and the keynote of the procedure would be total guaranteed anonymity laid down with statutory protection under strict procedures.  It is vital not to be dependent on voluntary testing as the real level of current HIV positive people in the community could be as high as 3,000 and as low as the publicly recorded level of 1,000.  The future growth of this disease will depend on the availability of accurate data and using that data to plan effectively.</P>
    <P>There is obviously difficulty in terms of medical and moral arguments in relation to the control of any sexually transmitted disease.  In the context of the sexual transmission of the virus, change in behavioural patterns will eliminate the risk of spreading the infection.  However, all the information suggests that among these groups at risk, for whatever reason, behaviour patterns may not and certainly <Col N="230" /> have not changed.  I would instance the survey whereby 50 per cent of female HIV positive patients at St. James's Hospital some time ago showed that they were having unprotected sex.  The issue, therefore, arises of precautions that would reduce the risk of spreading the infection.  The present Family Planning Acts of 1979 and 1985 restrict the sale of condoms to pharmacies, clinics, hospitals and general practitioner surgeries.  A recent court case saw a court conviction for the sale of condoms in an alternative retail outlet.  This issue must be seen in the context of both the spread of the virus and the public health issue.  It would be very wrong for the debate about AIDS to become a debate about condoms. However, the availability of condoms to target groups is essential in terms of public health.  We therefore propose that one of the early duties of the national AIDS task force would be to propose a review in detail of the 1985 Family Planning Act to see what changes are necessary to ensure the availability of condoms to &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; groups.</P>
    <P>There are many other areas that require further scrutiny, such as the proportion of expenditure spent on research, the way it is to be spent and the linkage with international research.  There is a public perception among some AIDS patients that too much is being spent on research.  That is not a view that I entirely share, but it is very important that money spent on research is linked with other international research because Ireland alone cannot pioneer research in this area.  It must be based on mutual co-operation.</P>
    <P>The whole question of fosterage of AIDS babies will be a major problem in the future &mdash; it is major problem abroad. Proper training must be put in place for potential foster parents of AIDS babies. Proper financial assistance is essential for the voluntary groups who are at the front line of action in relation to AIDS.  I would single out for particular mention the AIDS Action Alliance groups throughout the country who have done valiant work.  To outline the importance of voluntary groups, in conjunction with the <Col N="231" /> Irish Family Planning Association, they paid for the production of a film, &ldquo;Stories from the Silence&rdquo; which I am sure Members of this House have seen.  That certainly stimulated me into action on this whole area.  I believe that such a public information and awareness campaign is vital to changing attitudes.  It is essential that information or material that could potentially change attitudes is made available to the public at large to improve public awareness and understanding of the disease and its inherent problems.</P>
    <P>There is a specific need for more dieticians across the country to provide guidance in relation to building up immunity levels for HIV positive patients.  All in all, there is a need for the Government, and the Minister, to ensure that the whole AIDS problem is not swept under the carpet, that it is not dealt with as a disease which is unfashionable, that it is stigmatised and, therefore, should not be confronted in a political and public way. There will be a bitter harvest in terms of future deaths unless the AIDS crisis is confronted now.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael, in this debate, are seeking to put the issue before the Dáil, and to obtain the support of all parties in the House, to ensure by a positive and constructive series of actions across a range of Departments in Government that the Irish response to AIDS is as good &mdash; if not better &mdash; than in any other country.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister took office there has been an appointment of a Minister of State to chair a working party in relation to AIDS.  I have seen a copy of that report and I very much regret that, despite the compelling information in it and the serious problems, the basic proposals have not been acted upon.  Leaving aside the compassionate and human factors involved, the report stated that the estimated cost to the Department of Health of treating HIV patients was somewhere in the order of £12,000 or £12,500 per year and that the cost of treating an AIDS patient was somewhere in excess of £30,000 per year.</P>
    <P>Looking at all the international <Col N="232" /> research and all the possible projections of the numbers who will potentially contract the disease, and those who are HIV positive and will develop full blown AIDS, it is obvious that this will be a huge budgetary item in future.  If for no other reason than sound health economics, it is vital that we plan now.  We are behind in terms of the time-scale of events in America and in some parts of Europe.  That is not to say that we do not have the same lethal potential for death and destruction through AIDS but it does give us the opportunity to learn from their experience.  The time, therefore, to act is now.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister for Health and the Government, to ensure that this will become their priority area in terms of public health issues.  Failure to do so now would be an utter and unadulterated tragedy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Yates, and the House, for allowing me to contribute to this debate.  Next Saturday is the World Health Organisation's International AIDS Day which is part of the ongoing awareness campaign being waged internationally to raise public knowledge about this disease.  It is a campaign which is also being waged by most national governments in their respective countries in an effort to come to terms with the disease, its spread, and promotion of policies which will control it.  The World Health Organisation have projected that, by the year 2000, there will be six million AIDS sufferers and 20 million patients diagnosed as HIV positive.  It is an alarming scenario and this country cannot escape carrying its <i>pro rata</i> proportion of same.  The danger is, however, that due to culmination of certain factors we will end up carrying more than our fair share of the <i>pro rata</i> breakdown of those figures. These factors are basically Government inaction and our AIDS structure which sees large sections of our population in the sexually active age bracket of between 15 and 45.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to remember &mdash; and to repeat on occasions like this &mdash; that there is no vaccine &mdash; no known cure &mdash; for <Col N="233" /> AIDS.  In the absence of a vaccine or cure the most important components of a national AIDS programme are information and education, which do not come cheaply.  However, the cost of inaction, as Deputy Yates outlined in his closing remarks, will result in a huge increase in the number of full blown AIDS cases with all the cost implications which that entails.</P>
    <P>The AIDS virus knows no boundaries and the school of thought which, thankfully, is waning, that suggests our different national moral ethos will mean that we have nothing to fear, is misguided. We are no longer &mdash; if indeed we ever were &mdash; the land of comely maidens.  Our policy in respect of the AIDS issue must reflect this.  Information and education in relation to the AIDS programme will not come cheaply yet the value for money to be derived from same will be unequalled. The formal educational structures need to be used effectively to this end but this avenue is also limited.  We need a consistent media campaign directed at those sexually active in the community, going hand in hand with a programme which seeks to break down the ignorance and prejudice towards those suffering from AIDS and HIV positive.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, in the face of the world's single greatest health issue, we have no policy in place to contain the disease or to prevent its further spread.  We have failed to put in place adequate community and hospital based services to cater for those already infected with the virus.  Quite simply, there is no Government AIDS plan, no specific allocation in the Department of Health funding for same and, consequently, already inadequate funding is being dissipated further in its effect by the absence of an overall plan to be administered and supervised by a national task force.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the work being done by those at the coal face of the AIDS problem, either in a professional or voluntary capacity.  These people deserve better from the Department of Health in terms of research, educational awareness and treatment.  The haphazard nature of services currently provided by our eight <Col N="234" /> health boards varies greatly and this form of discrimination in treatment is totally unacceptable.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann endorses the Government's AIDS strategy which encompasses a programme for the prevention of HIV infection and the care on an integrated basis, of AIDS/HIV patients within existing services and which is responsive to the needs of persons with HIV/AIDS and is up-to-date with international developments in this field.</P>
      <P>At the outset, a Cheann Comhairle, I wish to refute the allegation by the Opposition that the Government are not dealing comprehensively and effectively with the problem of AIDS.</P>
      <P>Nothing could be further from the truth.  We have a comprehensive programme for the prevention, monitoring, diagnosis, treatment and management of AIDS in line with international strategies, a programme which is being implemented in a caring and compassionate manner.  The Government's AIDS strategy consists of the monitoring of AIDS and the trend in HIV infection; prevention through health education strategies aimed specifically at the young and at at-risk groups; the protection of the blood supply; the provision of services to reduce risk such as outreach and methodone maintenance and provision of condoms and needle exchange aimed specifically at certain at-risk groups and linked to counselling at individual level; research into aspects of the disease; the care and management of people suffering from AIDS and HIV within an integrated framework of services including community services, primary care services, respite services, hospice services and acute hospital services and the co-ordination of policy and its implementation at national and local levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="235" /> Our strategy is in line with the strategies adopted in all advanced countries. It takes account of and comprehends the recommendations of the major international bodies and the declarations from major international conferences including the Paris Declaration on Women, Children and AIDS (1989); the Declaration of the London-Ministerial Summit on AIDS (1988); The Council of Europe recommendation concerning a common European policy to fight the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (1987); resolutions of the World Health Assembly endorsing the global strategy on AIDS; The Political Declaration (1989) of the Extraordinary Ministerial Conference on the Council of Europe's Pompidou Group as it relates to HIV/AIDS and drug abuse and the many decisions and recommendations of the EC Health Ministers, including those which relate to improved surveillance of the disease and early-intervention which I brought to the forefront in Europe during my Presidency of the EC Health Council.  As I said at the opening it is a strategy which is flexible and responsive to the needs of patients and is being continually monitored and updated.</P>
    <P>The epideamiological development of AIDS infection in Ireland is similar to that experienced in the USA and Western European countries.  From 1981 to 1985 all cases reported were in people who were homosexual or who had haemophilia and the condition was considered to be a largely imported disease to this country.  When zero-prevalence monitoring became possible in 1985 it was apparent that the HIV virus was indigenous in the country and that a particular problem existed in relation to the spread of HIV infection in intravenous drug abusers.</P>
    <P>Since the disease was first identified we have had 174 cases of AIDS reported and 69 people have died.  In addition some 1,005 people have been established as being HIV positive.  In common with other countries in the EC the spread of transmission in homosexuals is slowing down.  The percentage of intravenous <Col N="236" /> drug-related cases is now 36 per cent of all cases as compared to 20.5 per cent in 1986 in the twelve EC countries.  In Ireland almost half of the people at present infected with AIDS are drug-related. Almost 60 per cent of the people known to be infected with HIV virus are drug abusers.  This movement of the epidemic towards the drug abuser has led to an increase in the number of heterosexual cases.  In 1987 we had no heterosexual cases in Ireland.  At the moment just under 5 per cent of Irish cases are heterosexual.</P>
    <P>I would like at this stage to outline in detail the various components of our strategy.  In relation to monitoring and surveillance, case reporting of the disease is carried out on a strictly confidential basis and there is ongoing direct contact between the national AIDS co-ordinator and the clinicians dealing with AIDS.  In addition death certificates are monitored and deaths, in which deficiency of the immune system is recorded, are discussed with the clinician involved.  As regards serological surveillance all positive HIV antibody tests are confirmed at the national virus laboratory which reports directly to the national AIDS co-ordinator on a weekly basis.  All tests are carried out on a strictly confidential basis and in most cases there is pre and post-test counselling.  A series of ongoing surveys of &ldquo;at-risk&rdquo; groups, which have enabled us to track the transmission of the virus from the initial cases in homosexuals and haemophiliacs through to intravenous drug abusers and on to heterosexuals have been of great value in identifying our main problem areas.  Our strategies dealing with the disease have been based on the data obtained from these sources.</P>
    <P>Our monitoring of the disease is as accurate as any Western European country.  We maintain the closest contacts, through the national AIDS co-ordinator, with the EC AIDS centre in Paris.  The latest figures from the EC countries show that the rate per million of AIDS cases in Ireland is 43.4.  This compares with a rate per million of the population of 173.2 for France, 158.4 for <Col N="237" /> Spain and 59.9 for the UK.  In fact there is only one country in the EC, Greece, with a lower rate than Ireland.  Notwithstanding these hard facts we have been subjected in recent months to attacks from foreign media programmes that have ignored both truth and facts and have presented a totally misleading view of the real position of AIDS within this country.</P>
    <P>Careful appraisal of the data now available suggests two conclusions.  First, the AIDS virus, HIV, is largely confined to certain behavioural risk groups and their immediate sexual contacts.  Secondly, transmission of the virus in homosexual men has declined substantially.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, I raised the issue of improved surveillance of the disease during my Presidency of the European Health Council and this is being considered on both the European and domestic fronts.  It is important, however, to ensure that any new system introduced, such as unlinked voluntary HIV testing, is ethically, legally and medically sound and takes into account the position of the person being tested, the doctor involved and also, the overall benefit to the community at large.  As I have said, new methodologies for surveillance are being actively considered at the moment.</P>
    <P>I might say in this context that I am glad to see that Deputy Yates has pulled back from his previously held view that HIV testing should be compulsory, something he told the nation on a radio programme some months ago.  The suggestion of compulsory testing would be completely inappropriate.  I might also add that nothing can be gained by the alarmist, generalised statements contained in the Fine Gael policy document on AIDS regarding the possible incidence of the disease in Ireland in the year 2000 and repeated by Deputy Yates and Deputy Creed here tonight.</P>

      <P>The World Health Organisation has advised against projecting data beyond 1992 because of the <Col N="238" /> unpredictable nature of the spread of the syndrome, both in terms of at-risk groups and geographical prevalence.</P>
      <P>The medical consensus is that a vaccine to prevent the disease and/or the production of a fully effective cure will take between 5 to 10 years.  Prevention of the disease in uninfected people and secondary measures to prevent the infection from spreading from infected people are critical therefore in the Government's strategy.  As a major part of their strategy therefore, the Government have introduced a series of measures aimed at: informing the general public and in particular young people and people in at-risk groups, about AIDS; informing health professionals; protecting the blood supply; and informing people travelling abroad.</P>
      <P>The dissemination of information to the general public and particularly to the young has been a major part of the Government's strategy to combat the spread of AIDS.  In 1987 there was a mass media campaign just after I came into Government, a campaign that was sitting a long time when the Coalition Government were in power and which they did not introduce for some reason.  We introduced it, using TV, billboards and newspapers to inform the public about the disease.  This campaign was allied to the issue of a booklet by the health promotion unit which was made available through health centres and community pharmacists.  Both of these methods informed the general public of the ways that the disease is and is not spread, and it is estimated that 400,000 adults have to date received a copy of the AIDS booklet.</P>
      <P>The mass media campaign also used a billboard campaign advertising a telephone hotline to which members of the public could call and have their queries answered.  This related to the national AIDS education programme for school going children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of national surveys have been commissioned by the health promotion unit on public knowledge and attitudes to AIDS.  The results of these surveys have been used to determine how <Col N="239" /> information would be best targeted in the light of the public's knowledge of the disease and its transmission in the Irish context.  A priority of our information strategy is to educate young people about the disease and to ensure that no person would leave school without being informed of AIDS and the HIV virus and how it is transmitted.</P>
    <P>In 1988 the directors of community care and medical officers of health were asked by the Department of Health to liaise with school principals in regard to AIDS/HIV education.  This resulted in area medical officers giving support to schools in their efforts to disseminate information about AIDS.  This co-operation is continuing and the new educational materials are a further resource for schools in this area.</P>
    <P>This programme of material for classroom use was developed jointly by the Departments of Health and Education. The aims of these materials are to: provide information on the causes, transmission and prevention of aids; help pupils explore attitudes to aids; encourage pupils to avoid behaviours that could lead to them acquiring the HIV virus; promote among young people a mature attitude in assuming responsibility for their own health and the health of others; and to inform students of community resources available for coping with AIDS.</P>
    <P>The programme was piloted in twenty schools in the autumn of 1989 and a wide range of representative organisations were consulted for their views on the materials.  Final revision of the materials has taken place and the materials are now available nationally.</P>
    <P>These materials are viewed as a resource from which teachers can select and adapt in terms of the particular school context in which an AIDS education programme is taking place. Programmes are carried out in accordance with the school ethos and the wishes of parents, and where pupils have a prior understanding of sexuality and human relationships.</P>
    <P>One-day training seminars for teachers <Col N="240" /> on the use of the materials as well as giving them up-to-date information on AIDS are also an integral part of the programme.  A special set of educational materials has been developed which is designed to appeal to a low literacy group which would be, generally speaking, early school leavers.  This programme is still at pilot phase and has been well received.</P>
    <P>While the public information programmes and the AIDS education programme for secondary schools addressed the problem of the spread of AIDS through intravenous drug abuse, drug abusers are not especially receptive to such campaigns. Like a number of European and American countries, Ireland has a particular problem relating to the level of HIV among intravenous drug abusers. This group is receiving particular attention in our strategy.  Special measures are required to communicate the AIDS message into the drug community and, more importantly, to elicit a positive response from this group.</P>
    <P>Towards this end, the AIDS booklets produced in 1987 and 1989, and a special poster directed at intravenous drug abusers, were provided to all drug agencies, statutory and non-statutory.  This is continuing; the Eastern Health Board, since 1988, have been conducting an Outreach Programme designed to make one-to-one contact with drug abusers.  Such contact is the most important and realistic way of monitoring personal behaviour changes and of encouraging drug abusers to attend services for treatment; an integral part of the Eastern Health Board's Outreach Programme is the AIDS Resource Centre, Baggot Street, which was established in 1989.  This centre is a drop-in facility for drug abusers and provides a range or risk-reduction services, such as syringe exchange, condoms and methadone maintenance, backed-up by individual assessment and counselling. The resource centre has been a resounding success and between January and October of this year an increase of 160 per cent in attendances has been recorded.</P>
    <P>The centre is currently the focal point <Col N="241" /> for the provision of the health board's community based services for AIDS and it is nearing full operational capacity.  In view of this, the Department of Health and the Eastern Health Board are currently planning the opening of a second AIDS Resource Centre.  Ideally, this will be located on the northside of the city and will provide for liaison between the prison services and the health and welfare services for ex-offenders who have contacted the virus.</P>
    <P>As regards providing information on AIDS for health professionals &mdash; all doctors and dentists were circulated with AIDS information booklets in 1985 and 1988; over 500 health professionals from the health boards and voluntary hospitals and others who were relevant to local AIDS programmes took part in an AIDS information and training seminar in 1987; these people now provide a pool of experience and resources to develop and implement local AIDS programmes and similar seminars to those held in 1987 continue at local level; all general practitioners are becoming increasingly involved in the care and management of people with HIV and AIDS at community-domiciliary level.  The Department of Health and the Irish College of General Practitioners are currently developing a protocol to enable GPs to play their part effectively in this area, and in particular their relationship with the services provided by the statutory authorities.</P>
    <P>In relation to the blood supply, measures were initiated in 1985 and continue to be taken to ensure that the country's blood supply is free from infection. I might add that these measures were introduced as rapidly as was possible and it is worth noting that Ireland is the only European Community member state which has not had a case of AIDS associated with a blood transfusion.  Since 1985, when the HIV test first became available all blood donations have been screened for HIV.  Only heat treated blood products are used in Ireland and we are self-sufficient in blood products including Factors VIII and IX for treating haemophilia. People at risk from AIDS are <Col N="242" /> asked not to donate blood or organs and again it is worth noting that Ireland was the first country to implement the Council of Europe recommendation on this self-exclusion of at-risk persons.</P>
    <P>A further part of the Department's preventative strategy is the provision of advice and information to people travelling abroad on the risks about AIDS.</P>
    <P>Much of what Deputy Yates had to say this evening about AIDS in prisons was inaccurate and seriously out of date; the Deputy is clearly not familiar with the various statements on the subject which have been made by the Minister for Justice both in the Dáil and the Seanad.</P>
    <P>The following facts, in relation to prisoners known to be HIV positive will be of interest to the Deputy: all of those infected are visited daily by a medical practitioner who specialises in dealing with the disease; all prisoners who, in the opinion of his her medical adviser, are in need of hospital services, or, indeed, hospitalisation, are provided with such services and hospitalisation where necessary; the Minister for Justice has announced that a special unit is being provided in Mountjoy for those with contageous diseases who need extra care.  Plans are well advanced.</P>
    <P>As regards &ldquo;segregation&rdquo;, the Minister has explained on many occasions that this strategy was not adopted as a means of halting the spread of the disease within prisons as Fine Gael have suggested.  It was introduced in the interests of protecting those known to be HIV positive and maintaining good understanding within the system.  The Minister has established an expert group to examine all aspects of the problem of infectious diseases in prison and the group will, as part of their remit, look at the question of segregation.</P>
    <P>Ireland is particpating in a European Community study on paediatric AIDS and continues to co-operate with international bodies, in particular the European Community, the World Health Organisation and the Council of Europe. We also contribute to the work of the European Centre for AIDS in Paris. <Col N="243" /> Detailed epidemiological data is furnished each quarter to the European centre from this country.</P>
    <P>The care and management of people suffering from AIDS and HIV is conducted in Ireland within an integrated framework of services including community services, primary care services, respite services, hospice services and acute hospital services.  In line with international recommendations and good medical practice, the policy of the Department is that acute hospitals should treat people with AIDS from their catchment areas and that such people should be treated by the appropriate consultant. Deputy Yates cast a slur on the consultants in this country when he said there is only one consultant in Ireland dealing with AIDS.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I said specialising in AIDS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is any number of consultants in Ireland dealing with AIDS very effectively.  They are well able to treat such people depending on the nature of the clinical presentation of their illness.  This has been specified in departmental policy circulars on AIDS since 1985 and I recently approved a circular to be issued from the Department of Health re-emphasising this important aspect of policy relating to the care and management of HIV/AIDS.  I am concerned that all general hospitals should participate fully in this aspect of AIDS policy.  I am equally concerned that any hospital or individual consultant would become synonymous with the care and treatment of the disease, and I aim to ensure that all acute hospitals play their part fully and effectively in the care and management of people with the virus.</P>
      <P>On the question of the provision of integrated models of care and management, health boards are providing services appropriate to their particular needs.  An example of this is the initiative taken by the Eastern Health Board in opening a 22 bed unit in Cherry Orchard Hospital which provides respite care for AIDS sufferers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="244" /> In the Eastern Health Board many voluntary groups supported by the national lottery are complementing the services provided by the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>New STD clinics have been opened in Sligo, Limerick and Waterford.  These clinics, in conjunction with those already provided in Dublin, Cork and Galway are an important element in the control of AIDS.</P>
    <P>The virus reference laboratory in UCD, where confirmatory tests are carried out plays a major role in our strategy. Capital grants totalling £380,000 have been given by the Department towards the development of a new, modern virus reference laboratory which opened last year.</P>
    <P>Product authorisations have been granted on the advice of the National Drugs Advisory Board for the use of a number of drugs in Ireland in the management of people infected with HIV. These are AZT and Ribovirin and it is worth noting that Ireland is the first country to licence Ribovirin for use in HIV.  In addition, I recently approved the use of DDI for clinical trial purposes.</P>
    <P>This is in line with my policy to make medical products available to people with the virus, as soon as they are assessed for their safety, efficiency and quality.  In this context, Ireland has the broadest spectrum of medical products for HIV currently available in Europe.  The use of any or all of these drugs is, of course, a matter of clinical judgment for each individual doctor.  I am sure the House accepts that there has been criticism of the fact that a drug was licensed.  The drug was licensed on the recommendation of the National Drugs Advisory Board but it is a matter entirely for the individual clinician as to when they would use a particular drug.  As far as we are concerned we want to ensure that all the most modern treatment is available to people who are HIV positive or suffering from AIDS.</P>
    <P>Research Studies in recent years have shown that early-medical intervention can decrease the frequency and severity of clinical symptoms and the mortality <Col N="245" /> rate of patients who have been diagnosed as having been infected with the human immune virus.  This would be a step forward in the fight against the virus.  In adopting early intervention strategies, due consideration must be given to the possible toxicity arising as a result of prolonged use of any drug and the potential for converting an apparently healthy, asymptomatic person into a patient committed to long term treatment.</P>
    <P>The Royal College of Physicians in Ireland are holding a major international medical symposium on early medical intervention in HIV on Friday next, 30 November 1990, which I will be addressing. This symposium will be attended by experts from around the world and it is the single, most important AIDS symposium dealing with early intervention to be held in Europe and arguably in the world.  Hopefully, this symposium will progress our knowledge in relation to key early intervention issues and enable policy decisions to be made in these areas, on the basis of clear, factual findings and recommendations.</P>
    <P>There is no basis whatsoever for Deputy Yates' contention that the Government's Strategy is not co-ordinated, nationally or locally.  The facts are that the Department of health coordinate on a regular basis with other Departments, including the Departments of Education, Social Welfare and Justice. The Department of Health also co-ordinate with the health boards and with the voluntary agencies.  Patients are treated appropriately to their needs through the wide range of services available in each health board area.</P>
    <P>In addition the national AIDS co-ordinator is in constant contact with all agencies and groups, statutory and non-statutory, and with individuals, to assist them in the development of programmes and services.</P>
    <P>I also reject the assertion that the Government are not providing the funds required to meet the needs of HIV/AIDS patients.  In line with our general policy that people suffering from AIDS should be cared for as part of the mainstream health services, funding for such care and <Col N="246" /> management has in the main, been provided through the agencies normal allocation. In addition a total of £2.2 million has been allocated from national lottery funds for AIDS-related projects.  I would reiterate that it is our policy that patients should be treated within the mainstream health services and not, as Deputy Yates would suggest, taken out and discriminated against or treated in some different way.</P>
    <P>This funding has been distributed among a wide range of agencies, including the AIDS fund, the Irish Haemophilia Society, the Anna-Liffey Project, Cork AIDS Action Alliance, Ballymun Youth Project, Coolemine Therapeutic Community, St. James' Hospital and The Mater Dei Institute.</P>
    <P>I let the Government's record on AIDS speak for itself, a Cheann Comhairle. Our strategy is rationally based, developed and adopted in line with the changing epidemiological situation and with international recommendations.  It underlines a caring approach with the focus at all times being on the needs of patients and the protection of the general community.  I regret to say that some of Deputy Yates' proposals show a distinct lack of understanding of AIDS, and of how patients suffering from the disease should be cared for and managed, both medically and socially.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a special budget, dedicated hospital beds, and a policy of positive discrimination as suggested by Deputy Yates would only serve to highlight unnecessarily the plight of AIDS sufferers and could stigmatise and alienate such people and their families.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is being continuously monitored, keeping in touch with the <Col N="247" /> latest international developments to ensure that the most up-to-date services are available and continue to be delivered to those who need them in a caring and compassionate manner.</P>
    <P>I would add that both myself and my colleague, Deputy Treacy, Minister of State at the Department of Health, have attended a number of international seminars on the problems of AIDS.  Both of us are satisfied that the treatment, the management and the programmes we have for prevention are in line with the very best available anywhere around the world.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State.  I appreciate his kind comments.  I am glad to have the opportunity of making a few brief comments on what I consider to be one of the most serious health issues that not only this country but the world &mdash; the developed world and the third world &mdash; have to face in the coming generations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had the privilege of visiting different countries and seeing the reaction to this problem in a developed society <Col N="248" /> such as the United States and of witnessing the terror induced by the disease in a developing society like Zambia.  This is a problem that we, too, must come to terms with.  It has already been said that AIDS/HIV is not only a serious problem, that it is fatal.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that some 69 people have died from AIDS in this country.  Currently some 1,000 people have contracted the HIV virus in this country.  Those people are a cross section of the Irish community, they include drug abusers, homosexuals, infants, haemophiliacs and people who need to inject themselves with medicines in order to stay alive.  I acknowledge that the problem is worse elsewhere.  In the EC there are 30,000 HIV cases while in the United States there are an incredible 130,000 cases.  Numbers on that scale do not just occur in the United States because there is some fundamental difference between the people who live in the United States and those who live here.  Potentially we will suffer that crisis.  AIDS can spread and have a devastating effect on any population if it is not recognised and looked at intelligently, if it is not agreed that we need to have a co-ordinated and determined strategy and, most of all, if it is not agreed that we should act upon it immediately with whatever resources are required by the State to protect the people.  The simple truth is that the more time we waste the more lives will be put at risk.</P>
    <P>I have acknowledged in the past that the Government are making a serious effort to educate people and prevent the spread of the HIV infection.  They are also making an effort in relation to the treatment of those who are already infected.  It is encouraging that the Government recognise the need to keep up-to-date with international developments. However, it is not good enough to say that we must keep up to date if there is not allied to that a determination to make any new knowledge or technology which is recognised internationally available in the fight against AIDS in this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="249" /> The Minister tonight indicated in general terms &mdash; I am sure he will take issue with me &mdash; that substantially the battle against the scourge of the spread of AIDS and HIV infection is to predominantly take place within existing services.  That is a pathetic response.  It is acknowledged &mdash; this has been part of the sparring between the Minister and me for three years &mdash; that since 1987 our health services are inadequate to cope with normal problems much less to cope with the specific treatment of AIDS.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that virtually every consultant can combat AIDS.  That sounds good in a ministerial speech but it is not a reality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither is it a perception that the people who are faced with HIV infection have.  I know that like me the Minister has spoken to AIDS groups and their representatives.  They have pointed out that only one hospital in this country specialises in the treatment of AIDS &mdash; St. James's Hospital &mdash; and in that hospital, and the Minister took issue with Deputy Yates on this point, there is only one dedicated specialist consultant who is focusing exclusively on the problem of AIDS.</P>
      <P>We should not try to score points off one another.  We should make a realistic evaluation of existing resources and of their efficacy.  We should recognise that this is not a political problem; it is a health and human problem.  We should, on a consensus basis, provide whatever resources are required to increase the treatment available for people who are already infected and put up the maximum possible defence against further infection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a dreadful mistake for the Minister to think that we can get away with the treatment which is available now.  The Minister must recognise and acknowledge during this debate that additional resources are required, that additional investment must be made available, that additional facilities must be provided, and that additional personnel must be <Col N="250" /> hired, trained and put into the field.  In addition, I hope the Minister's statement regarding developments all over the world will indicate that we are genuinely in touch with what is happening and that we are genuinely committed to putting state of the art practice into place here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates's motion is very realistic. I do not think it is outlandish and I do not think the check list he put before the Dáil tonight is extravagant.  He has recognised that a more open progressive policy must be outlined to deal with the HIV scourge.  He proposed the introduction of a national AIDS plan and referred to education as a means of prevention. I am not suggesting that that proposal is new, but I want to focus on what is required in the context of education.</P>
    <P>Education is acknowledged as the paramount weapon in fighting the problem of the spread of HIV infection.  The plan proposes a minimum AIDS education programme.  This is essential: we should aim to educate every young person in the country.  I use the term &ldquo;young person&rdquo; advisedly because we must focus particularly on the young.  It must be our objective to ensure that they will be armed with a minimum knowledge about how AIDS and HIV are transmitted, how they can put themselves at risk and how they can be treated.  Without such a minimum approach on an across the board basis, without it being mandatory and without it being standardised for all our schools, we will be failing in our duty to prepare Irish people and, in particular, our young people on how to deal with this real hazard.</P>
    <P>The dissemination of information should not be done through schools alone; it must be done through a public information campaign.  Again, a minimum set of standards should be laid down so that we will know exactly what we want to get through to every individual. Holding back information for any reason will be seriously damaging.  The Minister spoke in terms of what has been done by way of education and trying to bring forward knowledge to people.  He said there was a campaign in 1987.  Most of <Col N="251" /> us, on reflection, believe there was a huge public awareness of the problem of AIDS, that somehow it started in and came from America and that it was going to threaten us all.  There was a national campaign at that time &mdash; as the Minister rightly said when he came into office it was ready to be launched &mdash; but we have done very little since then.</P>
    <P>I have gone through the Minister's speech in which he talks about informing health boards and issuing circulars.  I am talking in terms of reaching out to the general public.  We have taken the issue of AIDS off the front burner since 1987 and consigned it somewhere else.  The Government believe that because they have given the information once it is not necessary to analyse how effective it has been and how aware ordinary people are of this problem.  Has any qualitative research been done by the Department?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no current advertising campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is talking about research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about two aspects.  I do not want to be adversarial on this issue &mdash; I do not think there is any merit in that.  There was a major campaign in 1987 but we virtually stopped after that.  The Minister spoke about some qualitative research.  Is monitoring being carried out on a nationwide basis ensuring that young people, married people and at-risk groups have the necessary degree of information about this disease? How much is being spent on this research?  Where is the information?  Will the Department publish reports?  Are reports available to be put before this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that basic information should be included in any preventative programme. This information should include the basic facts on the methods by which AIDS can be spread and it should rubbish the misinformation which is current; it <Col N="252" /> should recommend the means to prevent infection and should identify the areas where treatment is available.</P>
    <P>Of course, our society should instruct citizens about the advantages of having stable sexual relations, thereby minimising the spread not only of AIDS but other sexually transmitted diseases but we must also acknowledge that our society &mdash; other Deputies have spoken about the move from the society of the comely maidens &mdash; is no different and no more morally superior to any other country in Europe or elsewhere and that many people will indulge in sex with more than one partner.  We must prepare to educate them on how to minimise the risk of transmission.  Condoms, especially latex condoms, have been recommended by the World Health Organisation as a method of reducing the spread of AIDS. The promotion and supply of condoms should be viewed as a specific disease control measure, no more and no less. Condoms should be seen not only as contraceptives but as a method of actually preventing the spread of disease.  We have to consider that sentence in the context of a case where a retailer was taken to court for selling or making available condoms.  If we honestly believe that the law should be updated, we should have the courage to bring the necessary amending legislation before this House.</P>
    <P>A list of specifics was put before the House by Deputy Yates.  I think we can have consensus in relation to what is necessary.  He talked about the need for extra specialist consultants dedicated exclusively to this problem.  The Minister said that every consultant in the country is an expert on it.  Realistically we need more people to dedicate themselves specifically to it.  I do not think there can be any disagreement on that.  Deputy Yates proposed two ten-bed hospital wards on the northside of Dublin to be used for treating this problem.  Is there any disagreement on that?  Let us quantify the cost and put it in the Estimates. He suggested some modification in medical card eligibility and I do not believe there would be any fundamental difference across the House in relation to <Col N="253" /> people who have contracted HIV.  He talked about using the community welfare officer system across the country to target financial resources to those people who are HIV positive.</P>
    <P>One of the things which struck me when I visited treatment centres in New York was the importance of the very basic things.  People who are HIV positive or who have AIDS are often stigmatised and vulnerable.  We should ensure that they have decent accommodation, adequate heating, adequate food and clothing and specifically we should target resources through the community welfare service.  I do not think there would be any major disagreement on that issue.</P>
    <P>The final issue which Deputy Yates raised was that of specialist anti-dis-crimination legislation.  I hope the Labour Party will put forward before too long &mdash; at our next Private Members' Time, perhaps &mdash; a comprehensive anti-discrimination Bill.  However, we should consider the specific point that there should not be discrimination against HIV or AIDS sufferers in their employment. This might not be a matter for the Minister for Health but it is something he might bring back to the Government.</P>
    <P>The tone of the Minister's contribution I would best sum up as complacent.  He listed the minimal things we have done and said we are as good as somebody else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>As good as anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to look at the reality of the problem and to decide what new measures we need to take, in consultation with those who are not only at risk but have contracted the disease already.  Let us have less of the self-congratulatory tone that we are on top of the problem and instead let us acknowledge that there is a serious problem to be addressed which all the visits to international seminars will not redress.  We need resources, personnel and an attitudinal change in relation to this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept that all is well in the prison service with regard to AIDS.  In <Col N="254" /> quoting his colleague, the Minister for Justice, the Minister does not re-assure me.  He indicated that plans were well advanced.  It is time that plans were implemented and proposals put into effect on the ground.  Whatever the view put by the Minister to this House in regard to AIDS in prison, there is a general perception among prisoners, and among the general public, that prisons are dangerous places to be.  This is a perception we have to remove.</P>
    <P>Overall the proposals that Deputy Yates has put before the House are encouraging.  It is important that this issue should be addressed periodically in this House.  It would help steer Ireland's approach to the next phase of tackling the problem of HIV infection.  I am not suggesting that there is a comprehensive answer but we need to refocus on this issue.  It is not a political or even a health issue exclusively; it is a human issue that affects all society and all peoples.  On that basis let us work in a consensus way to put realistic proposals into effect and decide that collectively we will vote through whatever resources are needed to make sure we minimise as far as possible the spread of this terrible disease.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a certain sympathy with Deputies Howlin and Yates who show a remarkable degree of caring.  We are dealing with quite a problem. However, most of the points raised have been adequately covered by the Minister in the most comprehensive speech on this matter for some time.  Being a member of the medical profession, albeit a little far removed from the AIDS epidemic in the Dublin area, it is good to see that the issue is being dealt with in this manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Howlin asks for specialist consultants and specialist beds, but the Minister has pointed out that quite a number of our consultants are able to deal with the care of AIDS patients.  The AIDS virus attacks the immune system and it is the secondary responses such as pneumonia which have to be dealt with.  Consultants are quite capable of treating them.  The Deputy also mentioned that HIV and AIDS are not confined to a <Col N="255" /> specific category and he referred to haemophiliacs and babies born with HIV. Unfortunately, these are the real tragedies of AIDS, especially the babies who usually have secondary infection.  I disagree with the Deputy in his assertion that they do not come within the categories mentioned by the Minister.</P>

      <P>Normally at change-over of business the House shows a little consideration to Deputies who, for one reason or another, have to <Col N="256" /> attune themselves to the highly punctual nature of the House.  Perhaps the Minister of State had already commented on amendment No. 18.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick West):</i> Yes, I had already given my view on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerryOSullivan" hpid="Mr. G. O'Sullivan Mr. G. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke at some length on the last occasion this amendment was debated.  It is still important that the Minister give careful consideration to this amendment which I fully support.</P>
      <P>As time passes we have seen greater responsibility <i>vis-à-vis</i> the environment and the discharge of radio-active waste being placed on countries, particularly those bordering on or surrounding the Irish Sea.  With its formation the Marine Institute will have a most important role to play especially with regard to the discharge of radioactive waste into the Irish Sea and for which it has now become famous.</P>
      <P>I must ask the Minister to reconsider his position on the amendment before the House.  While we are part of the nuclear generation as such, the capabilities of the Marine Institute will play an enormously important part in the life of this nation. For that reason I and my party will be fully supportive of the amendment before the House which is comprised of three parts.  Paragraph (a) reads:</P>
      <P>to research the effects on the marine environment of the discharge of radio-active wastes from any source into the Irish Sea, the operation of nuclear generation and reprocessing plants near the Irish Sea and the transportation of nuclear wastes through the Irish Sea.</P>
      <P>It would be my hope that the Minister will have taken clear note of its contents, that is, to research the effects on the marine environment of the discharge of radioactive waste from, and I underline, &ldquo;any source&rdquo; into the Irish Sea and so on.  It is in everybody's interests that recognition be given to the provisions of that paragraph.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="257" /> Paragraph (b) reads:</P>
    <P>to monitor the discharge of radioactive wastes from any source into the Irish Sea, the operation of nuclear generation and re-processing plants near the Irish Sea and the transportation of nuclear wastes through the Irish Sea, and</P>
    <P>Again, the Marine Institute will have a positive role to play in the monitoring of discharge of radioactive waste &ldquo;from any source&rdquo; into the Irish Sea and so on.  I must stress the word &ldquo;monitor&rdquo; which is vitally important.  I contend the Marine Institute is the ideal vehicle by which to monitor such discharge of radioactive waste from whatever source.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (c) reads:</P>
    <P>to participate in European initiatives in relation to these functions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore has already outlined the purpose of this paragraph.  All three paragraphs constitute reasonable, effective recommendations.  Although the Minister has already indicated he is not prepared to take them on board, I would ask him to reconsider his position and perhaps take a second look at the amendment with a view to facilitating its import.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind the House of the fact that, while a few sitting days may have elapsed since we last discussed this amendment, that would not free it from the normal considerations in the matter of repetition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>As I did not speak on the last occasion this amendment was discussed I rise to support it now.  I do not have anything special to add because sufficient has been said already.  Nonetheless I am disappointed at the Minister's response.  He should reconsider his position and I hope accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the same expertise in this matter as Deputy Gilmore and my other colleagues in the House.  It is a pity if the Minister does not avail of this opportunity to give the <Col N="258" /> Marine Institute the functions and/or powers specified in the three paragraphs of this amendment.</P>
      <P>It was quite frightening to have seen a programme recently on television &mdash; the THORP programme &mdash;<i>vis-à-vis</i> the existing Sellafield plant.  The implications of such an enormous structure on our doorstep are indeed frightening.  This would appear to me to be a particularly timely opportunity for us to initiate more effective monitoring of the effects of that development seeing that we have failed so dismally to have that obsolete plant shut down.</P>
      <P>As I entered the House I heard Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan refer to the dangers of transportation of nuclear waste.  Quite clearly, the whole of the THORP programme was based on the expectation that nuclear waste would be transported to that plant from a number of different countries worldwide; otherwise, effectively it will become a white elephant. This means the sea lanes will be used for the purposes of transporting nuclear wastes to that plant.  I am not saying that all of the material which will be fed into it will come by sea but certainly a great deal of it will, adding to what is already the most radioactive sea in this part of the world.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why the Minister would not wish to take this amendment on board and give this additional dimension to the role of the Marine Institute. Paragraph (c) is important in that we should be enabled to co-operate with our colleagues in the EC to the optimum extent possible to ascertain whether it is possible for us to take any initiative in relation to this problem which is, after all, on our doorstep.  In that respect I notice that the recent ferry report in the European Parliament arising from this question of the transportation of nuclear wastes identified that there were virtually no controls on their transportation and indeed very little over most ships flying flags of convenience.  I ask the Minister to reconsider his position on this.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> For the benefit of Deputies who were not here <Col N="259" /> on the last occasion, let me say I agree very much with Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan that this aspect is very important, that the institute are the ideal vehicle to do this, and they can and will do it under the present legislation.  I have had this examined again since the last occasion on which we met and I have considered very carefully the points raised by the Deputies in the course of earlier contributions to this amendment.</P>
      <P>I repeat, with your permission, Sir, that the Bill as drafted gives quite comprehensive scope to the institute.  As I indicated on the last occasion, it is not necessary to identify tasks specifically or to lay down specific priorities within the broad functions and responsibilities as defined in section 4.  All the areas that are being identified specifically in this amendment are covered.  There is nothing at all to preclude the institute from discussing and making decisions on the points raised by the Deputies opposite.  The key areas will be considered by the board in line with their remit when drawing up their programme of work.  If I were to accept this amendment it would be only part of the areas which should be specified in detail as to what the institute should be doing. Section 4 gives adequate scope for the institute to cover exactly what is contained here in amendment No. 18.</P>

      <P>I have spoken already on this.  In relation to the amendment I agree to a point with what the <Col N="260" /> Minister has said, that it would be specifying particular things and other things would be left out, but will he not agree that this aspect of radioactive waste being discharged into the Irish Sea is of very particular significance and great seriousness over and above many other matters we have discussed on Committee Stage and that this deserves particular mention in the Bill?  We would like to see much more included in the Bill but this is of extreme relevance to the Irish people. There is an opportunity here for the Government to indicate how seriously they view what is happening in the Irish Sea in relation to discharge of radioactive waste, the emissions from Sellafield, and nuclear submarines that are traversing the Irish Sea where the Government do not have a supervisory role or any way of monitoring what is going on.  In the last few days off the coast of Scotland a fishing trawler was sunk by a nuclear submarine and lives were lost.  Similar incidents could arise in the future in the Irish Sea. Here is an opportunity for the Government to indicate their concern by accepting this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  The Institute shall examine the strategic and economic necessity for a national deep sea merchant shipping fleet and shall advise the Minister on the reconstitution of such a fleet.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unless the Minister has changed his view from the last occasion, it is our disposition to press this amendment because of the very important net point involved which <Col N="263" /> is essentially that as an island nation it is unthinkable that we should be left without a merchant fleet, especially having regard to the manner in which that came about, the disgraceful decision that was taken in respect of Irish Shipping and the outrageous manner in which the workers of Irish Shipping were treated.  This gives us a very timely opportunity to try to undo the damage and restore to the nation a merchant marine.  It would be particularly appropriate if the Minister were to take on board the essence of this amendment since his senior Minister went out of his way when in Opposition to give undertakings and promises to the former workforce in Irish Shipping that as soon as he would come to power he would see, to the best of his ability, that the damage was undone.</P>
    <P>Those promises have been enumerated in the House in some detail on other occasions and I do not think there is need to dwell on the point now.  It is extraordinary that this House this morning briefly dealt with the implications of the UN Resolution in terms of the prospect of war in the Gulf.  There is no doubt that that is the objective of the United States Government, if they are successful.  To consider that as an island nation we would be left isolated in such a time of international strife is unthinkable.  We have no deep sea shipping fleet, and, indeed, the service provided by the B &amp; I also seems to be under threat, at least threat of retrenchment by the Government. Because of the importance of the net point involved the destruction of Irish Shipping, the outrageous manner in which the workforce of Irish Shipping were treated and the manifest necessity for a merchant marine in an island nation, we have no choice but to press this amendment if the Minister persists in not taking it on board.</P>

      <P>I will be very brief in supporting the amendment.  Some months ago I heard the Minister for the Marine on a radio programme state very clearly that he was in favour of a merchant marine for this nation.  I was glad to hear him say he was thinking very positively in regard to the setting up of a merchant fleet.  I believe the institute is the ideal body to develop the merchant navy in the coming years.  They will have the facilities, will carry out the research, will have the ability, and they could do a very worthwhile exercise in providing the scientific knowledge necessary so that we as a nation can establish a merchant navy. Being the only island nation in Europe, now that Britain is linked to the Continent by tunnel, it is now necessary more than ever that we should sit down with the Marine Institute and see where the future lies for this country in regard to a merchant marine.</P>
      <P>I fully support the amendment, as I am sure do the people who supported my amendment which was taken last week. It is very important that it be stitched into the Bill.  The Minister has indicated that nuclear matters, fishing and the merchant fleet are covered in the Bill but it is important that they are outlined in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is becoming increasingly evident that we as an island nation are very dependent on forms of transport from outside the jurisdiction. That is fine in times of peace but in the event of war and ships becoming involved in a war, we would find ourselves at a major disadvantage as far as exporting our goods is concerned, particularly to markets on mainland Europe.  As the amendment suggests, it is essential that the institute examine the strategic and economic necessity for a national deep sea fleet.  Basically the amendment requests such an examination and suggests that the institute advise the Minister on the reconstruction of such a fleet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the only member state of the EC which is not linked to mainland Europe we are at a significant disadvantage.  It is important to gear our minds and address our thoughts towards more efficient and <Col N="265" /> quicker transport facilities to mainland Europe.  This amendment is now opportune, particularly in view of the Single European Market in 1992.  Given that the European Community is willing and prepared to provide Structural Funds to assist peripheral regions in relation to transport facilities, there is a particular case to be made, especially in view of recent changed circumstances, for the Government to take this matter on board.  I ask the Minister to take it on board.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I gave my view on this matter when we discussed amendment No. 6 which was put and <Col N="266" /> defeated.  I will reiterate what I already said: this amendment is unnecessary in that it relates to the merchant marine. Research and development, as defined in the Bill, is already sufficiently comprehensive to address all matters relating to fisheries and fisheries development. The institute is not precluded from discussing this issue if they wish to do so.  I agree with the views expressed opposite but there is little point in including an amendment in a Bill when it is already provided for in existing legislation.  For that reason &mdash; and for the reasons I previously explained &mdash; I oppose this amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 5, subsection (2), line 35, after &ldquo;Finance.&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;All such charges shall take account of the ability to pay of the person or enterprise charged.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a very simple amendment.  It asks that the ability of the person who avails of the services of the Marine Institute should be taken into consideration. While we would all agree that services should be paid for, it is a fact that marine development and activity is still in its infancy and there are those in need of the services of the Marine Institute who may not be in a position to pay a substantial fee.  Making it a requirement that a person's ability to pay will have to be taken into account will be of help to anyone starting off a commercial business and will enable them to avail of the expertise and knowledge of the Marine Institute in setting up a venture of that kind.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to ensure that any commercial venture which is not in the high income bracket will have the chance or opportunity to avail of the best expertise available for a modest fee.  The reason I put down this amendment is that I want to look after the small man.  This is necessary if people are to be given the opportunity to avail of the services of the Marine Institute and I ask the Minister to take it on board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the <Col N="270" /> amendment because marine development, in particular fisheries development, is undertaken by two categories of people.  First, we have the affluent companies who involve themselves in marine development as an ancillary activity or set up subsidiary companies. Usually these are viable companies and well able to carry out their own research or pay experts to do it for them but, on the other hand, in very isolated rural areas around our coastline we have many young men and women, including some young married people, who are attempting to make a living from the local marine resource.  Many of these people are on unemployment assistance and are attempting to create jobs not only for themselves but also for others in the region.  However, they do not have the necessary capital to get the venture going or to carry out research.  In those circumstances it is very important that they be allowed to avail of the expertise of the Marine Institute who would carry out research and provide every assistance possible to help them make wise decisions and choices with regard to the activity they choose to engage in.  It is very important that the Marine Institute do this because at the beginning it is either make or break.  If they are able to avail of the expertise and support of the Marine Institute at that point it could be the beginning of a major success story.  This amendment is highly commendable and I ask the Minister to examine it in the light of the realities on the ground and take this matter into consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The distinction which has been drawn is a fair and reasonable one and it is proper that the Minister should be asked to take it on board.  I would like to enter one caveat which is equally as important and which arises from my own direct experience in circumstances where consultant professionals can avail of the expertise of various State bodies and agencies and then charge exorbitant private fees for effectively passing on that advice.  I am aware, for example, that An Foras Forbartha were often used by consultant <Col N="271" /> engineers and others as a source of expert advice in certain areas and they, in turn, provided that service to industry or businesses as the case may be for a hefty fee even though the work was done and the expertise was accumulated in the first instance by the State agency concerned. I can see no reason that service could not be sold by the State agency themselves. This goes on in other areas &mdash; the geographical survey, for example &mdash; and it is not an exceptional happening throughout the State service.  In that sense, the first category referred to by Deputy Taylor-Quinn, commercial ventures, are well capable of paying and in those circumstances a fee ought to be extracted from them commensurate with the advice proferred.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I should say at the outset that the Marine Institute do not have to make any charge as much of their work will be undertaken to underpin development in marine research. There may not be any charge; it will be a matter for the Marine Institute to decide.  The section clearly outlines that the institute can determine the amount of the charge and the point raised in the amendment will be considered.  I have no doubt that the ability of the person to pay the amount charged will be taken into consideration and adequate provision is made in the Bill for that.  It is covered very well in section 6 which states that subject to the provisions of the section the institute may make such charges as they consider appropriate in consideration of the provision by them of services.  Therefore, if I were to accept the amendment I would reduce the capacity of the institute to raise the revenue and possibly it would be impractical to implement it.  After all, who decides one has the ability to pay or the amount a person should pay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment would tie the hands of the institute.  I hope the members of the institute will take this into account without the need to enshrine it in legislation. I am satisfied the section is adequate and wide enough in its scope <Col N="272" /> and what Deputy O'Sullivan seeks is already covered in the section as it stands.

      <P>In page 12, subsection (3), line 15, after &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and the inventor, under a share agreement to be determined by the Board of the Institute&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>If the institute are successful, it will be important that the best possible people are attracted to work and remain in the institute.  Talented people will be very quickly taken by private industry and private enterprise and lost to the institute unless there is some incentive for these experts within the institute proper.  As research and development take place and as there are new inventions as a result of the research and studies conducted within the institute, it is important that the researcher or inventor, who makes the major breakthrough is compensated and given some incentive to continue that work and that he or she will receive a just reward for their efforts.  Section 22 (3) states:</P>
      <P>(3)  Any discovery or invention or any part of any discovery or invention which does not become the property of the person for whom such research or investigation as aforesaid is undertaken, shall become the property of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="275" /> That is fine but surely the Minister cannot claim total ownership or value of any invention which was due to the specific expertise, intelligence or talent of the individual concerned.  In natural justice the inventor must be properly compensated. This can be done in a very rational and reasonable way by proper negotiation between the board of the institute, the inventor and the Minister. If the board are a reasonable group of people they should see that the inventor is duly compensated.  This is important if the institute are to be successful.  As I said, it is vital that we get the best people for the institute to do the necessary work and research.  We have a resource that is under-developed and this is an area in which there is great potential and a lot of work still to be done.  If this institute is successful the Irish economy will benefit only if we have the best people.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, in other areas in the past the State sector lost out to the private sector because of inadequate compensation to the people involved in the public sector.  That is not good for the country and it is not good for the State, and it would not be good for the Marine Institute.  This amendment, if accepted, would be particularly valuable and I urge the Minister to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a rather novel idea.  I do not know of any place in the State sector where it operates.  I must say it has a lot of merit, especially having regard to the area we are discussing. Throughout the State sector we have seen the phenomenon to which Deputy Taylor-Quinn referred in terms of the brain drain to the private sector and the head hunting of staff in various State agencies by the private sector.  Indeed, not very long ago in this House we had to enact legislation to establish the National Treasury Management Agency for no other reason, at the end of the day, than that the people managing the national debt in the Department of Finance were not paid a comparable amount to what they would command on the open market.  As a <Col N="276" /> result some of the best people were &ldquo;poached&rdquo; while others stayed because of their commitment to the public service. We have seen this in several areas. For example, in the case of the Revenue Commissioners, tax inspectors have been poached in many technical areas.  Therefore, this amendment has a lot of merit, especially when in regard to an area where we are pushing out the frontiers of knowledge; much of it uncharted waters in terms of the constraints on the various agencies who have responsibility in this area already and it requires a combination of ingenuity, innovation and commitment to the public service.  It may indeed be proper to devise some system which would encourage those people who could make such a contribution to remain in the service of the State and continue their work.  My party have pleasure in supporting this amendment.</P>

It is unique in the sense that it would give the people in the Marine Institute the opportunity to further their knowledge and the incentive to create wealth for the nation.  I assume Deputy Taylor-Quinn envisages the inventors working as a team in the institute.</P>
      <P>This is a unique amendment which I believe would have a positive effect on the workers in the Marine Institute.

        <i>(Limerick West):</i>&mdash;&mdash;and, as Deputy Taylor-Quinn rightly said, we must provide the necessary incentive.  Of course, the Minister for the Marine, myself and the officials from the Department have considered this point and have included an appropriate provision in the Bill.  I thought Deputy Taylor-Quinn would read section 22 (4) after she had read section 22 (3) but she conveniently missed that subsection &mdash; perhaps she did not see it.  Section 22 (4) reads:</P>
      <P>the Institute may, subject to the approval of and at the discretion of, the Minister and the Minister for Finance develop a scheme for the payment of bonuses or royalties, out of moneys at the disposal of the Institute, to members of the staff of the Institute who have made important discoveries or inventions, or have materially assisted in making such discoveries or inventions.</P>
      <P>What the Deputy is seeking in her amendment &mdash; that the staff members who make those important inventions are properly rewarded &mdash; is covered in section 22 (4), which provides for the payment of bonuses or royalties to the people concerned. We also considered that point and I believe the section is adequate as it stands.  Therefore, the Deputy should not have any worries in this regard.</P>

Section 22 (4) provides that payments to such inventors will be subject to the approval of the Minister and the Minister for Finance.  My amendment proposes that an invention should become the property of the Minister and the inventor under a share agreement to be determined by the board of the institute.  My amendment does not contain the words &ldquo;may&rdquo;, &ldquo;shall&rdquo; or &ldquo;subject to&rdquo;.  It is far more specific and definite from the point of view of the inventors concerned.  This is an important point. As the Minister knows once payment is at the discretion of the Minister the bottom line, with all the bureaucracy involved, is that it will never be paid or even if it is eventually paid it will be worth very little.</P>

      <P>In page 12, paragraph 2, line 38, after &ldquo;institute.&rdquo;  to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;At least one ordinary member shall be nominated for appointment by the Minister by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, at least one ordinary member shall be nominated for appointment by the Minister by the Irish Fishermen's Organisation, and at least one ordinary member shall be nominated for appointment by the Minister by a third level institution carrying out marine research or education.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is my last try at getting something into this Bill and I hope the Minister will give me sympathetic consideration. The amendment is reasonable and involves no expense to the institute.  I somehow feel I am talking to a very hardened heart which is not prepared to give in.  It is <Col N="282" /> nevertheless an important amendment. The responsible organisations involved will have a major input to the Marine Institute.  If the appointment of the board is at the discretion of the Minister, then I can see no reason that he should object to the amendment.  I am not telling him whom he should appoint.  All I am asking is that at least three members should be appointed from the responsible bodies I have outlined.  If the Minister will consider this reasonable request, I am prepared to withdraw the amendment and I will at least have salvaged something from my couple of nights' work here.  At the moment I feel dejected because so far he has done a brilliant job of stonewalling &mdash; not an inch.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a late substitute for my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, but I have great sympathy with Deputy Gerry O'Sullivan being sent home empty handed to a maritime county having slaved over this Bill for a couple of days. For that reason, if for no other, I would urge that the Minister should treat him with some sympathy at this twelfth hour.</P>
      <P>The two amendments are not exactly in tune.  Deputy O'Sullivan proposes that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Irish Fishermen's Organisation should at least have one ordinary member on the board.  I have no objection to that. Deputy Gilmore's amendment No. 33 has more to do with worker democracy, the notion being that in accordance with the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977, one-third of the members of the institute should be elected by the staff.  If I thought this was going to break new ground and there was any indication by the Minister that we could look forward to some concession, I would not stand firmly by the figure of one-third.  Having regard to the discussion we have just had on Deputy Taylor-Quinn's amendment concerning possible reward or participation for staff members who are successful in the inventions area or whatever, it is particularly appropriate that in the Marine Institute some of the staff ought to be eligible for membership of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="283" /> To a very large extent the success of the Marine Institute will be dependent on the ingenuity, commitment, imagination, skills and expertise of the workforce.  The very nature of the work in which they will be engaged, indeed its collective nature, in very many instances will render it particularly suitable that their point of view should be represented on the board of the institute.  Even though it is the 12th hour it is my hope that the Minister would make a substantial concession to the view held on this side of the House and to modern trends in organisations such as this, that there should be an element of worker democracy in a body like this. After all, the Act referred to &mdash; the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977 &mdash; specifies a number of State bodies where provision is made for the election of worker directors.  Surely the spirit of that should be imported into an institute such as this one?  Having regard to the type of work that will be engaged in by the institute, the principle and thrust of the Worker Paticipation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977 would be very appropriate. I really do hope the Minister does not say it is provided for elsewhere in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am not as familiar with the contents of the Bill as are my other colleagues in the House but I cannot see any place where worker participation is allowed for unless the Minister tells me that he can always, of course, nominate somebody from the staff.  That is not worker participation; that kind of thing went out with the last election, and indeed quite a while before that.  That is not the kind of participation the workforce of a scientific body such as this would want, that somebody would be selected by the Minister, presumably on the basis that they were a member of an Opposition party or something like that and nominated to the board.  It ought to be genuinely left to the staff to take the decision.  It would be a positive development if the Minister were to permit that to happen and I ask him to respond positively to this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The right spirit <Col N="284" /> would appear to me to be enshrined in these two amendments.  While I might not agree wholeheartedly with the details of either amendment, the facts are that basically they propose the involvement of the workforce on the board of management of the proposed Marine Institute. That is extremely important.  Any attempt to exclude workers from the board of management could have deleterious side effects, or long term serious repercussions for the success of the institute. I also believe it is very important that there be a link between the workers in the institute and the board of management. Neither can work in isolation. It is important that there be two-way communication which can be brought about most effectively by having members of the workforce directly involved on the board of management. That is fundamental to the overall future success of the Marine Institute.  Isolation and exclusion lead only to resentment and hostility rather than co-operation and good-natured working relationships. Unless there is that good working relationship within the institute, with a real link between the board of management and the people who actually undertake the work, there will not be an effective institute.</P>
      <P>Both amendments present very valid points for consideration.  I join Deputies Gerry O'Sullivan and Rabbitte in asking the Minister to get behind the spirit of what is proposed here, not necessarily the full detail of either amendment, but the actual spirit of what is involved is sound.  I am sure the Minister must recognise that.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The Minister will have total and complete discretion in relation to appointments to the board of the institute.  I can give the House a commitment this evening that the personnel who will be appointed to that board will be of great expertise, with great capabilities in their particular field, thereby ensuring that the board will have the necessary depth and scope to adequately fulfil their role and remit.  The appointment of members of the institute <Col N="285" /> will be at the discretion of the Minister. I can give the House my assurance that they will be comprised of persons with great expertise in that field to undertake the work of this important board.  This will be the first time a decision will have been taken to carry out research into marine and marine-related areas.  It is enormously important that this research be properly carried out by members of the board capable of fulfilling that task. The Minister of the day should have the requisite discretion to ensure that the people with the best brains &mdash; as Deputies opposite outlined &mdash; be nominated to this board.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Gilmore's amendment No. 33 proposing that one-third of the members of the institute be elected by the staff of the institute in accordance with the provisions of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977, the advice available to me &mdash; and I should say I have gone into this deeply over the past week or so &mdash; is to the effect that the provisions of that Act would not apply to the Marine Institute when established.  At this stage I should say it is not my intention to request the Minister for Labour to propose an amendment to that Act.  It is clear to me that the provisions of that 1977 Act apply to certain State enterprises or indeed business undertakings of a particular type.  It is also my understanding and my advice that the provisions of that Act were not intended to cover an agency such as the Marine Institute.  For the reasons I have outlined I must reject amendment No. 33, together with amendment No. 31, more particularly amendment No. 31, because I believe the Minister of the day should have discretion to appoint members to the board with the necessary expertise.  After all, research and development constitute important work requiring experts with the necessary experience and expertise to adequately undertake the requisite task. I am more than satisfied with the commitment I have already given the House that the people to be appointed to the board will be persons with great experience and expertise.</P>

      <P>I am bitterly disappointed at the Minister's response &mdash; I suppose I should have known better &mdash; for the simple reason that it is incredible that someone from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Irish Fishermen's Organisation, indeed from third-level institutions, would not be considered for appointment to the board.  I acknowledge that the Minister has not said specifically that they would not be considered &mdash; he has not spelled it out.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, and the Irish Fishermen's Organisation, whose <i>bona fides</i> is impeccable, are considered good enough to sit down with Government representatives to talk about implementing the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> but it appears it cannot be considered to participate in the workings of the institute.  I am extremely disappointed the Minister could not see fit to take this simple amendment on board which I believe would be a shot in the arm for the Bill.  It would mean the board would be very democratically structured with very broad interests and the necessary expertise the Minister is preaching about.  I am very sorry the Minister has not accepted the amendment and I have no option but to push it at this stage.</P>

    <P>I fear that a great opportunity has been lost in this Bill to make up for years of neglect of the area of marine sciences. We are now left with a Bill about to be enacted which does little more than depend on the goodwill of different Government Departments.  That is a tragic missed opportunity.  What we have at the moment are different groups often in a conflicting and contradictory way involved in the marine sciences.  There is a great deal of wasted effort, of unnecessary overlap and there are many gaps that could have been filled in a co-ordinated fashion by this Bill.  Unfortunately, it is so loosely co-ordinated, so imprecise and so non-directive in a great many ways that that opportunity has been lost.  Many professionals out there were hoping this Bill would be the impetus, or would give new impetus to the industry, if one may so call it, to push out the borders of knowledge to discover a wealth of information that could have such a positive impact in terms of the environment and be to our economic advantage in steeling us against claims in the future by neighbouring countries and delineating the extent of the continental shelf.  All these areas have been lost.  It is a great pity.  It is one of the great missed opportunities that there appear to be so many well intentioned people who for whatever reason have not managed to get this part of our national life together.

      <P>Deputy Jim O'Keeffe has been given permission to raise the matter of the circumstances surrounding the attempted suicide of a 16 year old prisoner yesterday and his proposals for reducing the incidence of such occurrence in the future, as a question to the Minister for Justice.  Deputy O'Keeffe has five minutes and the Minister for Justice has five minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I was absolutely horrified at this suicide.  In expressing sympathy for the 16 year old youth involved in this latest tragic suicide in our prisons, and condolences to his relatives, let us all realise that we, and in particular the Minister for Justice, have a responsibility for the safety, health and wellbeing of those who are unwilling guests of the nation in our prisons.  Our prison suicide rate is eight times the suicide rate of the general population.  With 14 deaths in the last three years it is twice the average in UK prisons where positive steps have been taken in recent years to reduce the incidence of suicide.  Last March a 19 year old girl hanged herself in Mountjoy and demands for action at that time fell on deaf ears.</P>
      <P>We should appreciate what our prison conditions are like.  The situation was summed up in a leading article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 8 May last which stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That there is overcrowding appears to be beyond doubt.  The former visiting committee speaks of shocking conditions with prisoners held in corrugated steel cabins that lack ventilation. Overcrowding and inadequate medical facilities are described by the president of the Prison Officers' Association as contributing to &ldquo;the <Col N="289" /> unfortunate death and injury rate in the prisons&rdquo;.  There is the additional factor of drug abuse, an obvious source of fear among prisoners and concern to the prison officers.</P>
    <P>To say that the Minister for Justice has failed to provide the reassurance which these circumstances demand would be an understatement.</P>
    <P>Despite the wealth of research available from the UK and elsewhere, the only response from the Minister was to set up a committee last year.  He has the report of the committee on his desk and has not published it, never mind implemented its recommendations.  In fact, he has even failed to respond to my request for a Dáil debate on the committee of inquiry into the penal system which resulted in the 1985 Whitaker report.  Action must be taken now to reduce the overcrowding in our prisons, which is a major cause of the problem. There must be more emphasis on Garda schemes to prevent and reduce crime, such as the juvenile liaison officer scheme.  They should be put on a statutory basis and given proper funding.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, there must also be more emphasis on non-custodial sentences, particularly for young people involved in petty crime.  This, of course, would involve the greater use of community service orders, the introduction of house arrest procedures, weekend imprisonment and so on to reduce over-crowding. There must be an appreciation that prisoners are usually socially vulnerable and may suffer from mental illness, alcoholism and drug addiction. They are, therefore, much more likely to injure themselves, particularly in unsupported situations of congestion and tension.</P>
    <P>The system must identify those most at risk.  Studies in the UK have shown that those on remand, those serving the early part of sentences and those who have made previous suicide attempts are at most risk.  We must have a system of supervision of those most at risk.  Since 90 per cent of suicides in prisons are by hanging, practical steps should be taken <Col N="290" /> to reduce the physical possibilities, particularly for those identified as being at risk.</P>
    <P>We must have clear lines of responsibility for the health of prisoners as between the Departments of Health, Education and Justice.  At the moment psychiatric, psychological treatment for drug addiction, alcoholism and sexual deviation is not available except on a very occasional basis.  Psychotropic medication should be administered by professional staff with the same regulation as applies to the dispensing of drugs within the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Minister, even at this stage, should publish the latest report, arrange for a Dáil debate on its recommendations and, more importantly, begin to implement them without delay.  Fortunately the services of Dr. Enda Dooley the forensic psychiatrist are now available.  He is the prison medical director.  He has extensive experience and has published serious research findings on the issue of prison suicides.  I hope that full support will be given to him in his new role.</P>
    <P>I hesitate to touch on economic realities where matters of life and death are involved, but even putting the issue at its most basic, I would remind the Minister of the possibility of damages claims. There is a case in the UK on this very issue, the case of Kirkham <i>v.</i> Anderton, the Chief Constable of greater Manchester. The time for action is now. Public conscience has been aroused.  A huge number of people are absolutely appalled.  Let there be no further delay in drawing the lessons from this succession of tragedies and in preventing, as far as possible, any further such tragedies.</P>
    <P>There is about a minute and a half left, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I promised Deputy McCartan that I would give him the opportunity of making a brief intervention.</P>

      <P>Thank you very much, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I would like to thank Deputy O'Keeffe for the opportunity of adding my voice to his in urging the Minister to take some definite and concrete action to deal with what is now an appalling history.  In the past four years 14 people have taken their lives while in the custody of the Minister in our prisons.  I would like to join with this House in expressing my deepest sadness and regret and in offering my condolences to the family of the young teenager from Derry who took his own life in St. Patrick's Institution.  It is an incredible state of affairs that a person as young as that from so far away should end up in this sad and sorry situation.</P>
      <P>The Minister has had the benefit of report from the committee established by him some time ago to investigate these matters.  He undertook that as soon as the report was available he would act on it.  I am urging the Minister to publish that report, make it available to the House and afford a debate.  I would urge him in particular to take the practical steps that I know are contained in that report to try to ensure that we will not even again have a repeat of this sad and unfortunate event.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I, of course, share the concern to which deaths in prison give rise.  As for the death which has led to the debate tonight I am sure the House will agree that the death of someone so young and in such tragic circumstances &mdash; whether it occurs in prison or in the community &mdash; must be a matter of great regret.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an inquest into the death will take place in due course, and as all matters relevant to the death will be inquired into on that occasion, I do not consider that it would be appropriate for me to comment on them in detail here.  There is the further point that sensitivity to the feelings of the family and friends of the deceased, particularly at this time, so soon after the death, require a considerable degree of reticence in that regard.  I am sure no one <Col N="292" /> would wish anything to be said which could add in any way to the distress of the bereaved.  I know that at this very sad and tragic time the House will join with me in expressing sympathy to the family and friends of the deceased.</P>
    <P>Regrettably deaths in prisons are not a recent phenomenon, they are an unfortunate reality with which prison administrations throughout the world have to contend.  Because of the deep concern which deaths in prison understandably give rise to I established towards the end of last year an advisory group to examine specifically the issue of deaths in prison and to make recommendations in relation to any aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>The group comprises a Governor and Deputy Governor, a psychiatrist, a psychologist, a chaplain, a senior probation and welfare officer, a representative of the Prison Officers' Association and a principal officer from the treatment of offenders division of my Department.  In addition the Prisons Medical Director was also assigned to work with the group on his appointment last October.</P>
    <P>It will be readily appreciated that the task which the group were asked to undertake is an extremely complex one involving as it does enormously sensitive issues.  The group which has a high level of expertise, has deliberated on this issue over the last 12 months during which time they have had consultations with others who could assist them in their task.  I understand that they are now nearing the end of their work and expect to produce their final report early in the new year. Because of my concerns on the matter I requested the group to furnish me with interim proposals which could be implemented in the short term.  This they have done and I have fully accepted their proposals.  I will be making a full statement in relation to the implementation of these proposals shortly.</P>
    <P>As I stated on previous occasions to this House very strenuous efforts are made by the prison authorities to identify offenders who may be at risk and, where such offenders are identified, they are given special attention by prison staff with the specific objective of minimising <Col N="293" /> the risk of self-injury.  Offenders whose behaviour suggests that they have psychiatric problems or that they might make an attempt at committing suicide are referred to consultant psychiatrists who visit the prisons regularly and, if the psychiatrist considers it necessary they are transferred to the Central Mental Hospital.  While I am satisfied that all concerned are fully aware of the need to be vigilant in this area, it has to be accepted that it will never be possible to identify every possible potential suicide victim or to eliminate every possible avenue of self-injury; where an offender is determined to take his or her life, there are limits to what the prison authorities can reasonably do.</P>
    <P>A report on each death is carefully examined within my Department with a view to establishing whether there was any action that might have been taken that might have helped to bring a risk to notice or that might have lessened any risk that was known in the particular case. Riders to inquest verdicts are carefully examined by the prison authorities and implemented when considered appropriate and practical.</P>
    <P>Finally let me say that at all times every practical measure is adopted to reduce suicide risks in prisons and I can assure the House that when I receive the final report of the advisory group I shall examine it as a matter of priority.</P>

    <P>The people of Carlow and Kilkenny were expecting a positive response from the Minister last Friday.  These people have been extremely patient over a long number of years with the conditions in the hospital in Kilkenny.  I would like to stress also that the staff in this hospital have also been extremely patient.</P>
    <P>The patience is well exhausted and crisis point was reached a long time ago. The situation there is now worse than a crisis.  I would be hoping that the Minister of State at the Department of Health, who is here for the Minister tonight, could give a positive answer to the question of when the works proposed can be commenced.  These works are very modest, having regard to all the works that are required at this hospital which is now in a chronic and dangerous situation. The staff who have been magnificent beyond the call of duty are now extremely demoralised that they have not got this assurance they were led to expect would be forthcoming before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>I am not one for over-stating matters or being alarmist and my record of many years in this House can prove that.  No word I could find here tonight could overstate the seriousness of the situation.  I hope the Minister will listen now to this earnest appeal I make to him because the staff, having done so much and worked so hard to serve the community in Carlow and Kilkenny, find that they are getting absolutely no help from the Minister.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Pattison in asking the Minister of State to eliminate any confusion that might exist as a result of a meeting between a deputation and the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, last Friday in regard to the extension to St. Luke's Hospital.  There is a greater patient throughput in that <Col N="295" /> hospital than any other hospital in the south-east region.  Hospitals such as those in Kilkenny and Galway, the Minister's own area, have problems with over-crowding, but in Galway there are other hospitals to alleviate that problem whereas Kilkenny has only one option, the corridors in St. Luke's Hospital.  Last winter there was serious over-crowding in that hospital, particularly in the medical wards.  I hope the Minister will ensure that the extension to that hospital which is essential will be provided forthwith.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to respond to this matter and I thank Deputies Pattison and Hogan for raising it.  Deputy Aylward is also present for this debate.  I want to explain the current position in relation to the development of St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny.  The Minister for Health indicated previously in the Dáil that over-crowding has been a feature of this hospital for many years.  On Friday last he met with a deputation from the South-Eastern Health Board in Kilkenny and discussed with them our Department's proposals for resolving the problems of the hospital.</P>
      <P>We have always accepted that the provision of additional facilities at St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny, would have to be treated as a priority.  To that end the Minister for Health earlier this year gave his approval for the proposed three storey development at the hospital to proceed to Stage 5 of planning.  This involves expenditure of £144,000 in the current year.  The proposed development will provide three new operating theatres, three new obstetric delivery suites, a new 16 bed paediatric unit, an intensive care unit and a central sterile supplies department. The overall cost of this project will be approximately £6 million.  When the new children's ward is provided it will release space to ease pressure in the medical wards.  The additional theatres and delivery suites will ensure that first class facilities are available at St. Luke's Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="296" /> Of course, Deputies will be aware that this development is but one of a number of major developments in the acute hospital sector in the South-Eastern Health Board region.  Capital resources are very limited.  I am sure it will be of interest to the Deputies and the House to know, as the Minister has already pointed out to the South-Eastern Health Board, that capital expenditure this year of £14 million on the board's major hospital developments at Ardkeen in Waterford, costing a total of £60 million, and Wexford, costing £12 million, will account for approximately 40 per cent of the total capital resources available this year to our Department for all health services schemes throughout the country.  In line with that, in 1989 30 per cent of the entire capital budget for the Department of Health programme was spent in the South-Eastern Health Board area. Therefore, over the past two years 33 per cent of the entire capital budget for the Department of Health programme has been expended in the South-Eastern Health Board area.</P>

      <P>The priority for spending that money has been decided by the South-Eastern Health Board &mdash; Ardkeen, Wexford and now St. Luke's.  I am surprised that the Deputies, when their parties were in power, did not ensure that this work was carried out.  The House must accept the <i>bona fides</i> of the Minister who has committed himself to the extension of this hospital and to spending £144,000 on the new section this year.</P>

      <P>Unless you plan you cannot spend.  The Deputies will appreciate that further progress on the proposed project in Kilkenny has to be considered in the light of projected expenditure in 1991 on the projects at Waterford and Wexford.  We will look as sympathetically as possible at the further development of the Kilkenny project in the light of the total 1991 capital allocation for our <Col N="297" /> Department and the many other competing demands from all over the country for other highly desirable developments both in the acute hospital sector and other care programmes.</P>
      <P>Officials from my Department are available at any time to discuss with the South-Eastern Health Board or the hospital authorities concerned any difficulties being encountered by St. Luke's in the provision of services.  I appreciate the interest the Deputies have shown in this matter.  We have received constant representations in this regard from the other Oireachtas Members in the constitutency, Deputy Liam Aylward and Senator Michael Lanigan.  I can assure the House that we will do our utmost to see that the resources, as they become available, are allocated to the Kilkenny project to ensure that it comes on-stream as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem of the absence of a proper therapeutic centre for the detention and treatment of young offenders has been well known to those familiar with the courts and the problems of juvenile crime, but it has been brought to the attention of the public in a very dramatic way by the much publicised case involving two 15 year old Dublin girls. These two girls were last week sentenced to Mountjoy adult prison for periods of 18 months and 12 months, respectively. From information supplied to Deputy <Col N="298" /> Sherlock, by the Minister for Justice today, 21 persons aged 15 years have been committed to adult prisons in 1990 alone.  That shows that this is a major problem.</P>
      <P>I want to say first, I acknowledge that these two girls to which I have referred were serious and persistent offenders, and that the public have a right to be protected against the sort of unacceptable activities in which they were involved.  Having said that, I must also say that I consider the practice of sending juvenile offenders, who are still legally recognised as children, to an adult jail to be a deplorable and damning indictment of the Government's neglect of the problem of juvenile crime.  The failure of the Government to provide a therapeutic unit for young offenders is placing the courts in an impossible position.  Every week courts face the dilemma of releasing habitual young offenders on to the streets or locking them away in adult prisons.</P>
      <P>It is appalling that we continue to rely on an Act of 1908 to deal with young offenders and which provides for the courts certifying children as &ldquo;depraved&rdquo;. It is not the children who are depraved but a Government who agree to lock up such children in adult prisons.  While the Taoiseach was prepared to fly, at public expense, to New York to sign the United Nations Convention on Children, his Government continued to tolerate the detention in adult jails and Garda stations of those who were still legally classified as children.  The appalling attempts by the Ministers for Justice, Education and Health to blame each other is one of the most outrageous episodes of buck-passing in Irish political history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for appropriate centres for caring for young offenders has been highlighted by professional organisations working in the area and in a whole succession of reports.  Almost 20 years ago the Kennedy Report recommended the provision of secure centres, but two decades later all our &ldquo;caring&rdquo; society can offer is the Bridewell or release on the streets.  The Government must ensure that an emergency allocation is provided to fund the opening of adequate secure <Col N="299" /> centres for young offenders.  The number of places required would probably be around 20 for girl offenders, with a similar number of places for boys.</P>
    <P>The early detection and treatment of young offenders is essential if we are to reduce the overall level of juvenile crime. The Garda juvenile liaison officer scheme has done excellent work, but it too is being starved of resources.  The number of young offenders handled under the scheme reduced from 3,700 in 1987 to 2,700 in 1989.  The worst possible approach with young offenders is to lock them up in an adult prison with hardened criminals.  This practice will rob the children involved of any chance at rehabilitation and will greatly increase the chances of them spending the rest of their life in crime.  The scandal cannot be allowed to go on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a coincidence that we are discussing this issue following the earlier discussion of a suicide of a 16 year old boy in our prisons.  I believe in the principle that we should cherish all the children of the nation equally and that is not the case when we have to send them to adult prisons.</P>
      <P>I appreciate Deputy McCartan's courtesy in allowing me a moment to speak on this issue and I fully support what he said. We must take action now in the context of the Juvenile Justice Bill, of putting the juvenile liaison office scheme on a statutory basis and of having adequate funding for that scheme so that when officers are needed at weekends they can go on duty, which they are not permitted to do at the moment.</P>
      <P>The Departments of Health, Education and Justice must stop passing the buck and implement a positive policy in relation to these issues.  It is ludicrous that young children are locked up in adult prisons, indeed district justices all over the country have been complaining about this for a long time.  How long more will we have to put up with this insensitive non-reaction of the Government?  We demand that the Government take action forthwith.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to be here on behalf of the Minister for Education to respond to this debate and I thank Deputies McCartan and O'Keeffe for their contributions.  The increasing frequency with which young offenders appear before our courts on serious charges which attract custodial sentences is, of course, a matter of serious concern. Indeed, it was in response to this development and the resulting need to provide adequate and suitable places to accommodate such cases that the Government decided to establish an interdepartmental group to consider ways of addressing this problem.  One of the recommendations to come from that group was that additional accommodation should be provided for boys and girls to supplement existing facilities. The Government have taken urgent action to follow up this recommendation and arrangements are currently being made to bring new facilities on stream for boys and girls.  A new residential school, to house 20 young girl offenders, is being planned for location adjacent to the existing Finglas children's centre.  This school will take up to eight girls on remand for assessment and provide long term accommodation for a further 12 girls.  A special project team are nearing the completion of their work on preparing the necessary schedule of accommodation which is an essential prerequisite to appointing consultants for the project in going to tender. It will be appreciated that the nature and purpose of this new school will require very careful planning at all stages to ensure that the best interests of the inhabitants are served while, at the same time, ensuring that the special nature of the school is not undermined.</P>
      <P>Because the new purpose built school for girls will not be available for some time, the Minister for Education has instructed her Department to look urgently at the possibility of providing a temporary arrangement to cope with the current demand for places for girls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of young male offenders, arrangements are already well advanced for the refurbishment of a major part of <Col N="301" /> the former Scoil Ard Mhuire in Lusk with a view to providing an additional 40 places.  Work on this project is expected to commence on site before Christmas with a view to bringing facilities on stream on a phased basis over succeeding months.  An initial unit to house eight to ten boys is expected to be completed by March next year with the refurbishment work being completed by the end of May 1991.</P>
    <P>These actions &mdash; the fact that we are on Report Stage of the Child Care Bill and that the Minister for Justice has introduced another Children's Bill to the House &mdash; shows the commitment of the Government and the various Ministers to this issue.  I have outlined the measures we are taking and the urgency with which they are being pursued is a concrete illustration of the commitment of the Ministers in Cabinet and the Government in addressing these very difficult issues.  I take exception to Deputy McCartan's flippant remark about the Taoiseach going to sign the United Nations Children's Charter at public expense.  He did his duty on behalf of this country.  We are a member of the United Nations and our action was a response and commitment to that Charter.  Apparently Deputy McCartan expects the Taoiseach to discharge his duties on behalf of the country at his own personal expense.</P>

Is the Minister in a position to give details of how this accident occurred? What protection are the Minister and the Department taking in relation to Irish trawlers and fishermen to avoid a similar disaster?  What action is he taking internationally to ensure that this activity stops because it has been admitted that nuclear submarines are sculling trawlers so that they cannot be observed by satellites? In most instances they operate about 150 feet under the trawlers.  Is the Minister taking up this matter with the United Nations?  It is not enough to come before this House and say that it is a matter for international law or the law of the sea.  Will the Minister take it up at EC level?  What other action do the Government propose to take to afford some protection from this very serious threat around our coasts?  We are unable to monitor the movements of submarines, which is very unsatisfactory.</P>

      <P>Arising from my dual responsibilities for the safety of life at sea and for the development of the fishing industry, I expressed, in a press release on Friday last, my concern at the incident involving a fishing boat in the Firth of Clyde on 22 November.  I explained that I would be taking a keen interest in the outcome of any inquiry established to investigate the incident.  I would like to say here in this House that those with competence in the matter should be conscious of the safety of all seafarers and the absolute necessity of taking all measures to avoid loss of life and damage to fishing vessels or gear.  I should add that fishermen in Donegal and in the Irish Sea have, in the past, expressed concern about the danger from submarines in their respective fishery areas and that they are entitled to the highest safety standard being applied by all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The loss of the <i>Antares</i> took place outside Irish territorial waters which extend to 12 miles off our coast.  I understand from a statement made by Mr. Archibald <Col N="303" /> Hamilton, Minister of State at the UK Ministry of Defence that a Royal Navy submarine HMS <i>Trenchant</i> operating in the Clyde area in the early hours of Thursday morning last surfaced to investigate unexplained sounds on her starboard side.  Mr. Hamilton reported to the House of Commons that the crew recovered a length of trawl cable from its casing and, assuming that it might have snagged the gear of a fishing vessel, tried unsuccessfully to contact neighbouring fishing vessels on VHF radio.  The Ministry of Defence statement indicated that the submarine remained on the surface, conducted a search for some two and a half hours and, seeing nothing untoward, continued her operations.</P>
    <P>The UK coastguard having been contacted by the Royal Navy initiated inquiries in an attempt to account for all vessels which may have been in the area and it later established that the fishing vessel <i>Antares</i> was missing in the search area. Following a search and rescue operation the vessel was discovered on the seabed in the early hours of Friday morning and the four crew are still missing, presumed dead.</P>
    <P>Inquiries are to be conducted by both the UK Department of Transport and the Royal Navy and it would, therefore, be inappropriate for me to speculate in advance on the outcome of such inquiries. However, I wish to reassure this House that all appropriate action that I can take will be taken.</P>
    <P>Ireland's national control over foreign vessels ends at the 12-mile limit of our territorial waters.  Inside that limit vessels must travel on the surface and show identification.  Beyond that limit vessels operate in international waters over <Col N="304" /> which we do not have jurisdiction.  Vessels travel freely through international waters.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that every possible step should be taken to ensure that submarines operate in a responsible fashion <i>vis-à-vis</i> fishing vessels.  To that end, and to minimise the danger posed to fishing vessels at sea by submerged submarines, my Department brought the matter to the attention of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) which is the London-based United Nations specialised agency responsible for safety at sea.  As a result, a resolution was passed by the IMO Assembly in November 1987 recommending that if information on the presence of a fishing vessel and its gear is available a submerged submarine should, as far as possible, keep out of the way of that fishing vessel and any gear connected to it unless the submarine is disabled.</P>
    <P>In the aftermath of the most recent tragedy I am asking the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Gerard Collins, to continue to avail of every opportunity to raise in the appropriate international fora the dangers which submarines pose to fishing vessels.  As the Deputy may know, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have raised this issue in the past at the United Nations.  Furthermore, my Cabinet colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, on a number of occasions has raised bilaterally with the authorities in the countries involved incidents involving submarines and will continue to do so.  In short, my Department will continue to do everything possible to enhance the safety of vessels at sea whether in territorial or international waters.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.5 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 28 November 1990.</P>

      <P>It is important to draw a distinction between the licensing function and the franchising &mdash; or entering into a contract &mdash; function as defined in the Radio and Television Act 1988.</P>
      <P>The franchising function is the prerogative of the Independent Radio and Television Commission.  The licensing function is essentially a technical one which I exercise, under which a radio frequency and other technical parameters relating to transmitter characteristics, are assigned to the commission for the benefit of the service being franchised. Questions relating to the nature of the service being provided &mdash; for example whether it is a community or other type service &mdash; do not arise in relation to the licensing function.</P>
      <P>On the position of the 24 local sound broadcasting services currently franchised and licensed to operate what we would call medium power transmitters, I cannot say how many, if any, would categorise themselves as community services since this is solely a matter for the Independent Radio and Television Commission.</P>

      <P>The objectives set for Telecom Éireann are to be found in the summary of the company's corporate plan which was published in the company's report and accounts for the year ended 29 March 1990, copies of which have been laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  I might add for the record that during that year the company redeemed £88 million of debt, there was a decrease of 2.5 per cent in overall telephone charges and an average decrease of 16 per cent in cross-channel charges.  Since Telecom were set up in 1984 overall telecommunications charges have been reduced by 22 per cent in real terms and it is the company's intention to continue this policy of reduction in prices.  The possibility of expanding local call boundaries is under consideration.  The company's fault clearance target is 85 per cent cleared in two working days and 100 per cent cleared in five working days and the company's performance at year end was approximately 80 per cent cleared in two working days and about 98 per cent cleared in five working days.</P>

      <P>During the Irish Presidency of the EC, the Council adopted a common position on a Council Directive on the Approximation of the Laws of the member states concerning Telecommunications Terminal Equipment, including the mutual recognition of the conformity thereof.  The objective of this directive, which has yet to be formally adopted by the council, is to create an open single market for telecommunications terminal equipment by harmonising procedures for placing equipment on the market and providing for harmonised procedures for conformance testing while ensuring the integrity of public networks.  The directive will allow equipment to be placed on the market in all twelve member states without having to go through additional individual testing procedures in each state after it has been certified in one member state.  It is not expected that this measure will have any impact on the services provided by Telecom Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Council Resolution on the strengthening of Europe-wide co-operation on radio frequencies, in particular with regard to services with a Pan-European dimension, was adopted during the Irish Presidency.  The resolution invites the Commission, the member states and the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT) which has a membership larger than the EC, to support the further development of the new framework set up by CEPT to this end, including the setting up of a new European radio communications office.  Ireland, through my Department will be a member of the new office.  The resolution has no direct impact on Telecom Éireann services.  The resolution will promote greater European co-operation in the use of spectrum. Greater harmonisation of standards and equipment in the radio communications field will be facilitated.  This will benefit <Col N="45" /> Telecom Éireann, as a telecommunications operator, Irish based manufacturers of equipment and suppliers of software, and last but not least the consumer who will get a better service at a cheaper price</P>
    <P>With regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, he will understand that matters relating to Irish industry do not come within my responsibility.</P>

      <P>The scheme of compensation for personal injuries criminally inflicted is administered by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal.  Under the terms of the scheme, compensation to be awarded by the tribunal is on the basis of damages awarded under the Civil Liability Acts, with specific stated exceptions, one of which is that compensation will not be payable in respect of loss or diminution of expectation of life.  In fatal cases the tribunal may make an award to dependants in respect of mental distress and to cover loss of earnings or income, including future loss &mdash; the award in the latter area is related to income at the time of the injury or death of the victim.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very concerned about the level of fatal and other serious traffic accidents which occur on our roads.  Improvements in road safety can be brought about only by action on a number of fronts and my colleague the Minister for the Environment has recently announced a major road safety campaign.  As Minister for Justice my particular concern is that the Garda should do everything in their power to prevent as many of these accidents as they possibly can by more effective enforcement of our traffic laws.</P>
      <P>I recently announced a series of measures which the Garda are taking to step up traffic law enforcement.  These measures include: the permanent assignment of additional gardaí to the Garda Traffic Corps which specialises in the prevention and detection of traffic law offences; the purchase by the Garda authorities of 50 additional mobile radar speed meters which will enable the force to be much more effective in the detection of breaches of speed limits; the revision of procedural directions in relation to the prosecution of serious road traffic offences, such as drunken and dangerous driving, to enable the Garda to institute more effective prosecutions in respect of these offences; and the introduction of a vehicle rectification scheme to enable gardaí to request motorists to rectify minor vehicle defects as an alternative to prosecution.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have also notified me of their intention to place even further emphasis on law enforcement in relation to the more serious breaches of the law such as drunken and dangerous driving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the number of offences under roads-related legislation for which proceedings were instituted in recent years, the Garda authorities have informed me that the 1984 figure was exceptionally high.  The figure for 1988 <Col N="50" /> was in fact above the average figure for the preceding ten years.  The figure for 1989 also showed an increase on the 1988 figure.</P>

    <P>I am satisfied that the level of prison accommodation available for young offenders is adequate and there are no plans at present for the provision of additional prison accommodation for this category of offender.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54, 164, and 165 together.  I have already indicated to the House, in reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 114 and 115 of 29 May 1990, Official Report, Vol. 399, col. 556, that the Government have no plans for legislation to enable a referendum to take place on the abolition of ground rents without compensation.  It would be wrong in principle to confiscate property in that way and successive Governments have been of that view.</P>
      <P>I have made clear to the House on a number of occasions, in reply to parliamentary questions, that the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1978, prevents the creation of new ground rents on dwellinghouses and that the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978, provides, as regards existing ground rents on dwellinghouses, a low cost purchase scheme. The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (Amendment) Act, 1987, extends indefinitely the operation of that scheme.</P>
      <P>The existing law therefore provides a ready means by which any person can abolish the ground rent payable on his dwellinghouse and a considerable number of people have availed themselves of that opportunity.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71 and 150 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that they are fully aware of the policing needs of the Cork East Division and that the number of gardaí serving in the division at any time is the maximum that can be assigned there having regard to overall resources and other demands on Garda services.  The current Garda strength of 798 members in Cork East represents an increase of 9 per cent over the number serving there on 1 January 1990 and I understand that a further two additional members will take up duty in the division in the near future.</P>

      <P>Reform in the prison service is an ongoing process.  There have been significant changes in a number of areas of the service in recent years.  Changes are being implemented in certain areas at present and I have plans for progress in other areas which will be announced in due course.  It is not possible in the course of a reply to a parliamentary question to comment on all of the changes either recently implemented or in progress. However, I would like to refer to some of the more important developments.</P>
      <P>The use of alternatives to custody has grown considerably, with about 3,000 offenders on alternatives of one kind or another, compared with approximately 2,100 in custody.  Consideration is being given in my Department at present to options that may be open for the expansion of the existing range of alternatives or to make greater use of those already in place.</P>
      <P>Late last year I established the Sentence Review Group to make recommendations to me concerning the administration of prison sentences for those who have been in prison for seven years or longer.  This was, I believe, a very worthwhile initiative in the area of reform.  I have received a number of recommendations from this group &mdash; many have been implemented and I am currently examining several others.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned during the debate on the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Bill, 1988, last week, the Medical Director to the Prison Service took up duty last month.  This appointment was a longstanding demand on which I have now taken successful action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of important developments are in progress on the accommodation front.  A major refurbishment of St. Patrick's Institution &mdash; including the <Col N="63" /> Women's Prison &mdash; is in progress; provision of a new unit for those suffering from contagious diseases is well advanced and, as I have stated in reply to another question by Deputy De Rossa today, major advances are taking place in relation to in-cell sanitation for offenders.</P>
    <P>The work of two very important groups which I have established is in progress also and will, I believe, make a major contribution towards improvement.  One group is dealing with deaths in custody and the other with the problem of infectious diseases (including HIV infection).</P>
    <P>What I have outlined are just some of the important developments that are currently taking place in prison reform.</P>

    <P>(1) and (2): Table 1 gives estimates of the total number of farming landholders classified by the time they devoted to farm work.  The data are derived from the periodic farm structures sample surveys conducted by the CSO between 1980 and 1987.  The estimates relate to farming landholders where the area farmed was at least one hectare.  The annual work unit (AWU) was taken as 2,200 hours per year.  In the survey each farmer was required to indicate the estimated <Col N="65" /> number of weeks, and average hours per week, spent on farm work in the previous <Col N="66" /> year and this was expressed in AWU units.</P>

    <P>(5): In Table 3 estimates are presented from the national farm surveys, which are conducted by Teagasc, of the average family farm income classified by farm income quintiles for the years 1984 to 1988 inclusive.  Income classified by farm income deciles is not available nor is comparable information available for earlier years.  The coverage of the national farm survey is restricted to family run farms and also excludes farms below 2 ha., rare farm types and farms identified in the farm structures surveys as being virtually inactive.  Despite these exclusions, it is estimated that the farms represented account for around 95 per cent of total agricultural output.  The family farm income concept used in the survey is calculated as the value of gross output less total net expenses (including interest payments).</P>

      <P>Section 4 of the Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 1959 governs Irish baselines and provides that the Government may by order prescribe straight baselines where this is appropriate.  Under the Maritime Jurisdiction Act, 1959 (Straight Baselines) Order, 1959 straight baselines were drawn around our coastline from Malin Head to Carnsore Point using internationally recognised base points. The order includes the co-ordinates of the base points used to draw the straight baselines.  A map showing the straight baselines, including those in the area to which the Deputy refers, is attached to the Order which is published in Statutory Instrument No. 173 of 1959.</P>

      <P>I am aware of reports of the serious economic situation facing Romania, including shortages of food and other basic products.  I understand <Col N="69" /> that the Romanian Government is taking various measures aimed at reforming the economy.</P>
      <P>I am also aware that there have been recent demonstrations in various cities in Romania.  In most cases, demonstrators have been opposed to the Government's policies, though some pro-Government demonstrations have taken place.</P>
      <P>The situation in Romania is kept under review as appropriate in European Political Co-operation and in the Council framework.  It has also been considered within the group of 24 (G24), which co-ordinates assistance to countries in Central and Eastern Europe.</P>
      <P>A high-level meeting of the G24 on 31 October decided that the reform process in Romania was not sufficiently advanced to warrant the extension of economic assistance by the members of that group. Urgent humanitarian aid is, however, being supplied by the Community and some G24 partners.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the Community recognises that a degree of progress in introducing reforms has been made since the summer.  In recognition of this, the Community recently signed a trade and co-operation agreement with Romania. Once put into effect, this should be of considerable assistance to the Romanian economy.</P>

At least 70 per cent of this amount relates to the bacon industry, but a precise breakdown is not available. <Col N="70" /> Income tax relief on this £6.8 million would cost an estimated £3.5 million. This relief would, of course, be granted to the individual investors, and not to the industry.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer is in receipt of a retirement pension and a social welfare old age pension.  Both sources of income are chargeable to tax. As the social welfare pension is paid gross i.e. without deduction of tax, the tax attributable to it is collected from his retirement pension by restricting his tax-free allowances by the amount of the social welfare pension.</P>
      <P>However, on the basis of his completed return of income for the current year, 1990-91, his estimated income will not exceed the appropriate exemption threshold of £8,700.  Accordingly, he is entitled to exemption from income tax. An amended certificate of tax-free allowances granting exemption has now been issued to him.  The tax deducted from his retirement pension since 6 April last will be refunded by his former employer.</P>

She submitted a claim to the inspector of taxes on 8 August, 1990 for repayment of tax on the grounds of unemployment. An amended certificate of tax-free allowances, which would enable any refund due to be made, was issued to the payer of the pension on 19 September, 1990.  However, it has transpired that the payer of the pension did not correctly operate this certificate.  They are aware now of the position and the tax deducted from the taxpayer's earnings to the date of cessation of her employment will be refunded to her with her next pension payment.</P>

      <P>A preliminary survey of the Lough Allen Canal has been undertaken by the Commissioners of Public Works. A hydrographic survey of the lake itself, commissioned some time ago, is now in hands.  This is required to enable the design and cost estimate of a scheme for the extension of the navigation into Lough Allen to be finalised.  Completion of the hydrographic survey is weather dependent and it is not possible to state exactly when it will be completed. However, it is hoped to be available shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>For the purposes of licensing of sea fishing boats under the Fisheries Acts, 1959 to 1983, the definition of a sea fishing boat is set out in Part IV of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894.  Under that Act the expression &ldquo;fishing boat&rdquo; means a vessel of whatever size, and in whatever way propelled, which is for the time being employed in sea fishing or in the sea fishing service, but save as otherwise expressly provided, that expression shall not include a vessel used for catching fish otherwise than for profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="88" /> It is also relevant to state that the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1983, empowers the Minister, by regulations, to exempt, subsequent to registration, certain boats from the licensing requirements. The Licensing of Sea Fishing Boats (Exemption) Regulations, 1983, provides that boats under 65 feet, being already registerd, do not require a licence.  Boats over 65 feet or boats in respect of which an application to register is being made for the first time require licences.</P>

In this connection my Department recently met representatives of both sides in this dispute.  Some progress was achieved and a further meeting is planned to take place shortly.  In the meantime, the Naval Service have been requested to patrol the areas in question.  In addition, consideration is being given to the maintenance of the Naval presence there in future over the August/October period to ensure strict observance of the law by all vessels.</P>

    <P>The guidelines in relation to the coastal disadvantaged area classification are set out in Article 3.5 of EC Directive 75/268 which refers to &ldquo;small areas affected by specific handicaps in which farming must be continued in order to conserve the <Col N="91" /> countryside and to preserve the tourist potential of the area or in order to protect the coastline&rdquo;.  In relation to Deputy Flanagan's query on County Offaly, I can confirm that the entire county was surveyed with the exception of some townlands that were entirely owned by Bord na Móna and devoted to commercial peat production.  A survey of these townlands was not possible, of course, as there were no residential farmers to visit therein but each townland was noted in case it became farming land again in the future.</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation to the district electoral division of Clonleigh referred to by Deputy Yates, 23 out of the 40 farmers in that area were surveyed by staff of my Department, i.e. over 57 per cent of the farmers in the area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Studies by Coillte Teoranta and the IDA show that Ireland will have sufficient raw material, pulpwood and sawmill residues, to support a major new pulpwood industry by the mid-nineties. Discussions have taken place between Coillte Teoranta, IDA and a number of international companies about such a development.  While detailed negotiations have taken place with one of <Col N="99" /> these companies, Stora of Sweden, it is not possible to confirm that the project envisaged with this particular company will go ahead.  I understand from Coillte Teoranta and the IDA that they are continuing to pursue all possibilities.</P>
    <P>The most likely pulpwood development would take the form of a major chemi-thermal mechanical pulp (CTMP) facility which would use both pulpwood from forests and chips/pulpwood from sawmills.  The location of the plant will be a matter for the investors having regard to all the implications of an export-orientated enterprise.  Substantial power and water supplies will be critical, and some effluent treatment facilities will also be necessary, but it is too early to be specific about exact requirements.</P>

      <P>I will encourage wind energy development which is technologically and financially viable and, with this in view, I have invited the submission by 30 November 1990 of proposals for Ireland's first windfarm. Earlier wind energy attempts in Ireland have been, for the most part, disappointing.  I am hopeful, however, that recent improvements in design and performance of wind energy equipment will lead to better results, as renewable sources of energy that are practical and competitive can play an important role in both our energy and environmental strategies.</P>

      <P>The national fuel scheme is intended to help households who are dependent on long term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  A contributory pensioner can have up to £5 a week over and above the contributory pension, and still qualify for an allowance.  This means that invalidity pensioners can have an income of up to £59.10 and qualify for a fuel allowance.</P>
      <P>In 1989 I extended the national fuel scheme to recipients of pensions from other EC countries on the same conditions, including income limits, as apply to corresponding Irish pensioners.

      <P>The difficulties in this office are related to the poor condition of the staff accommodation in the courthouse building. Plans for renovation are being drawn up at present.  As it is likely that the building will have to be vacated while this work is proceeding, temporary alternative accommodation for the staff is being sought as a matter of urgency.  It is expected that normal services in Galway will resume as soon as the staff are relocated in improved accommodation.</P>

      <P>This matter has come up a <Col N="122" /> number of times over the years.  The basic problem is that we do not have sufficient UHF broadcasting spectrum available to us under the relevant international treaties to enable a satisfactory choice of channels to be made available on a countrywide basis and cater for national or regional broadcasting developments which may occur.  I refer the Deputy, in particular, to Question No. 65 on 18 May 1988, columns 1791 and 1792, volume 380, Official Report, No. 8, for that day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The booklet on MMDS published by my Department is a general guide to MMDS.  It is not a technical specification.  The reference to tower heights in the booklet is a generalisation based on the expectation that operators would seek to maximise the coverage of transmitters by siting them as high as possible.</P>
      <P>There is no minimum tower height specified in my Department's technical condition for the operation of MMDS systems.  Operators are required to observe the guidelines on exposure to radio frequency radiation drawn up by the International Non-Ionising Radiation Committee of the International Radiation Protection Association (IRPA).  A tower height of less than 100 feet would not necessarily conflict with the IRPA guidelines.  This fact, not an opinion, has been conveyed to MMDS operators or their agents by my Department on a number of occasions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to draw a distinction between the licensing function and the franchising &mdash; or entering into a contract &mdash; function as defined in the Radio and Television Act, 1988.</P>
      <P>The franchising function is the prerogative of the Independent Radio and Television Commission.  The licensing function is essentially a technical one which I exercise, under which a radio frequency and other technical parameters relating to transmitter characteristics, are assigned to the commission for the benefit of the service being franchised. Questions realting to the nature of the service being provided &mdash; for example whether it is a community or other type service &mdash; do not arise in relation to the licensing function.</P>
      <P>On the position of the 24 local sound broadcasting services currently franchised and licensed to operate what we would call medium power transmitters, I cannot say how many, if any, would categorise themselves as community services since this is solely a matter for the Independent Radio and Television Commission.</P>
      <P>On the question of what the commission have categorised as low-power community stations, the commission have not sought licences for any stations in this category.</P>

      <P>When I launched the National Road Safety Campaign on 27 September 1990 I announced that the fitting of rear seat belts on all new cars would be mandatory from 1 January 1992, and that rear seat passengers will have to wear these belts, where fitted, from 1 January 1993.  While I feel that both of these deadlines are reasonable, I am prepared to consider whether earlier dates might be prescribed.  In this connection, allowance must be made for the fact that suppliers of cars need a reasonable period to ensure that stocks which they hold or have on order are technically capable of taking rear seat belts and are so fitted.  In addition, it would not be appropriate to introduce an offence of not using a rear seat belt until belts have been fitted for a reasonable period during which publicity can be arranged to bring the change in the law and its road safety benefits to the attention of the public.</P>

      <P>This nursing home reopened as a nursing home in 1987 having been out of business since 1981 when it closed necessitating the Eastern Health Board to assist in the relocation of patients.  Following the closure of the home the approval to operate a nursing home was withdrawn.</P>
      <P>In 1987, having given the required statutory notice to the Eastern Health Board the proprietor reopened the premises as a private nursing home. Approval to operate a new nursing home was granted under the Health (Homes for Incapicated Persons) Act, 1964 and the 1985 Regulations made thereunder. Due to financial constraints the board's practice in relation to new nursing homes is to limit the number of subventions payable to four.  This practice has applied to the Kolbe Nursing Home since it opened in 1987 and remained unchanged until 1990 when the number was increased to five as it is at present.</P>

      <P>The case referred to by the Deputy relates to an individual who, after being discharged following treatment in an acute hospital, gained admission for a period to another acute medical centre and subsequently sought reimbursement of the cost from the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  Medical information available indicate that at the time he entered the second acute hospital all the individual required was a period of convalescence. Under its rules, the VHI will only reimburse the cost of convalescence in a participating convalescent/nursing home.  Unfortunately, the hospital concerned is not in this category and the VHI has, therefore, refused reimbursement of the expenses incurred in this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Game shooting is one of a number of special interest activities promoted by Bord Fáilte because of its potential to generate increased tourist traffic to Ireland.  Visitors coming on shooting holidays represent one of the more lucrative segments of the international tourism market, spending an estimated £4.5 million in the Irish economy in 1989, and something in excess of that figure this year.</P>
      <P>This business is almost wholly off-peak enabling many rural based accommodation providers in particular to extend their tourist season and sustain employment.</P>
      <P>In promoting game shooting Bord Fáilte lay particular stress on the limited nature of facilities available, the laws in this area, and the need to observe local shooting customs and etiquette.  Last year some 4,000 shotgun certificates were issued to visiting hunters.  There are currently some 90,000 licensed shotguns held by native hunters and a further 60,000 farmers have limited shotgun licences.</P>
