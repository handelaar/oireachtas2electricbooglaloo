      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 3, 6, 16, 17 and 18.  It is also proposed, subject to the agreement of the House, that: (1) business shall be interrupted at 6 p.m. today, (2) No. 6 shall be decided without debate, (3) the Supplementary Estimate, Vote 29, shall be taken immediately after No. 6; speakers shall be confined to a spokesperson nominated by each of the groups as defined in Standing Order 89; speeches shall not exceed ten minutes in each case and if a division is challenged, it shall be taken forthwith, (4) the Dáil shall meet tomorrow at 10.30 a.m. and shall adjourn not later than 4 p.m. and (5) any divisions demanded tomorrow shall be postponed until 8.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 11 December 1990.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>My party have agreed to this due to the necessities of maintaining a flow of funds for Government business and for no other reason.  We believe it was possible for the Government to present these Estimates earlier, thereby allowing a proper opportunity for the Dáil to discuss them rather than <Col N="1398" /> under the very restrained time limits that now apply.  Given that the Government have not presented the Estimates for debate until now we are faced with no option other than to agree to this procedure reluctantly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business I would like some clarification from the Taoiseach.  On 31 October the Taoiseach informed this House that he was dismissing the Minister for Defence.  Could the Taoiseach give the House one simple reason why he has failed to appoint a Minister for Defence since then?  It is unprecedented that the Office of the Minister for Defence should not be filled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not well established practice that security Ministers, of which the Minister for Defence is one, when absent from the country always request another Minister to exercise their functions within the country?  Does the Taoiseach believe it is feasible for him to exercise his responsibilities as Minister <Col N="1401" /> for Defence of this country when he is absent and so far away from it?</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £43,238,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1990, for the payment of sundry grants and grants-in-aid and in respect of Third-Level and Further Education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is seeking the approval of the House for a supplementary estimate amounting to £43,238,000 million to meet the requirements of the Vote for third-level and further education.</P>
      <P>The gross expenditure on the Vote will be £4,062 million more than anticipated when the Estimate was approved.  The additional gross expenditure is mainly due to additional capital expenditure on the new engineering block at UCG and underestimation of the costs of grants to third level students.</P>
      <P>The position with regard to Appropriations-in-Aid is that, due to factors beyond our control, only £31.092 million of the anticipated £70.268 million in ESF receipts has been received to date.  It is anticipated that a further £35.87 million will be received before the end of the year, too late to cover payments which will have to be made before then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am bringing forward this Supplementary Estimate now so that payments now due can be made.  For technical drafting reasons, the Supplementary Estimate assumed that no <Col N="1405" /> further European Social Fund aid will be received this year and, consequently, provision is made for a shortfall in Appropriations-in-Aid of £39.176 million.  If the aid is received late in December, as expected, it will of course be returned as savings on the Vote.</P>
    <P>The cost of the higher education grants scheme has been underestimated and an additional £1.29 million is provided to allow for full recoupment to local authorities in respect of the amounts spent by them under the scheme in 1989.</P>
    <P>An additional £714,000 is provided under subhead A5 in respect of Vocational Education Committee scholarships. It is difficult to estimate accurately the number of students who will become eligible for these scholarships and the full picture will not be known until returns have been received from all Vocational Education Committees.</P>
    <P>In view of the growth in European Social Fund aided courses in the regional training colleges and technical colleges, an extra £900,000 is needed for grants to students on those courses.  Again, the full liability under this grant scheme will not be known until full returns have been received from the institutions concerned. Some of the institutions funded through the Higher Education Authority from subhead B2 have unfunded superannuation schemes and £109,000 is provided to meet unanticipated superannuation lump sums.</P>
    <P>An additional £308,000 is provided under subhead D for grants to the training colleges for primary teachers arising from the continued payment of salaries to certain staff of the former Carysfort College.</P>
    <P>A further £1 million is provided under subhead 12 for grants to the Higher Education Authority to update the equipment to the new engineering block at UCD which attracts funding from the EC Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>A total of £259,000 is available in offsetting savings.  Grants to students in Thomond College will cost £120,000 less than expected as fewer students qualified for grant-aid.  The grant-in-aid in respect of the general expenses of the Higher <Col N="1406" /> Education Authority will be £139,000 less than expected for a variety of reasons, including lower than expected expenditure on a unit cost study, career breaks, and so on.</P>
    <P>I commend this Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Supplementary Estimate.  However, it is ridiculous to have this shortfall in ESF funding at this stage of the year.  The finger of blame must be pointed in some direction and this should not recur.</P>
      <P>The time allowed, 40 minutes, is far too short to discuss the allocation of such a large amount of money, over £43 million.  Last summer we debated the main Estimates in the House and passed an Estimate for over £1 billion is just one hour.  We should organise our time in the Dáil to ensure that such large sums of money are examined properly in the context of how we spend them.</P>
      <P>Recently the Minister for Education has been trying to paint a bright picture of education at Question Time and in public statements.  However, her junior Minister who is here will agree that we have major problems at all levels of education.  In the primary sector we have the largest classes in Europe.  I hope a reduction of the pupil/teacher ratio will figure prominently in the negotiations with the social partners for the new programme for economic and social development.</P>
      <P>Last summer the Minister signed a resolution concerning the integration of children with disability into main stream primary education.  However she did not provide any funds to enable schools to adapt their facilities for handicapped children, to provide ramps, special toilets, seating arrangements and so on. The Minister is trying to introduce unsupported integration with no planning and no financial provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment the average pupil/teacher ratio in special schools is 1:12.  If the Minister has her way these children will be placed in classes of 30 or more without extra financial provision <Col N="1407" /> to accommodate their needs.  This will create considerable difficulties for primary schools.</P>
    <P>A recent survey of facilities for second level education carried out by the ASTI showed that many of our secondary schools lack even basic facilities.  The pupil/teacher ratio in our secondary schools is 20:1, one of the highest in Europe.  In Italy the pupil teacher ratio is 10.1 and in the UK 13:1.  On average we have 30 students in most second level classes.  This overcrowding puts tremendous pressure on teachers and students. The teachers cannot give students individual attention which is needed in many cases.</P>
    <P>The Minister should seriously consider the provision of a six year cycle in second level education for all classes.  Irish students spend less time in second level education than most of their European counterparts.  In West Germany they spend nine years in second level, in the UK the second level system lasts seven years and in the rest of Europe they spend six years in second level.  If a six year cycle is not made available in all our schools our students will suffer a distinct disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> their European counterparts.</P>
    <P>This Estimate is really about third level education.  In third level education I welcome the abolition of the four years honours rule for students seeking grants to enter third level institutions.  More young people will have access to third level education now.  However, there are major problems here because many of our third level institutions are being asked to increase student intake without adequate provision for capital expenditure on accommodation, staffing, research facilities, libraries, equipment and so on.</P>
    <P>In the first instance, third level institutions have suffered serious cuts in staffing.  The extra staff sanctioned this year on the basis of increased student numbers is not equal to the number of posts that have been lost in recent years. The staff/student ratios are in most cases double the ratio in United Kingdom <Col N="1408" /> universities.  This results in very little contact or personal supervision of students in most subjects.</P>
    <P>Students in most of our third level institutions are housed in cramped conditions. In Trinity College, UCD, UCG, Maynooth, UCC and in the regional colleges there is serious concern that overcrowding of lecture theatres, canteens, classrooms and laboratories constitutes a serious safety risk.  In many cases students have to sit on the floor in the canteens to eat their lunches.  This is totally unacceptable.  Security staff, maintenance staff and laboratory personnel have been reduced to such an extent that buildings and equipment are frequently unattended with a consequent safety and fire risk.  The overcrowding, if anything, will get worse as we seek to increase the participation in third level education of students from working class backgrounds.  These people are considerably under represented in third level education at the moment.</P>
    <P>I would refer the Minister briefly to the Clancy Report of 1988 which clearly stated that children from semi-skilled and unskilled labouring backgrounds constitute only 4 per cent of those in third level education whereas people from farming backgrounds constitute 21 per cent, from professional and managerial backgrounds constitute 39 per cent, those from salaried employees constitute 22 per cent and other non-manual and skilled manual workers constitute 13 per cent. This is something the Government will have to address if they are serious about providing equal opportunity to all our children.</P>
    <P>The quality of academic research is also suffering.  There is a major shortage of technicians and laboratory staff to back up academic research initiatives. Many routine academic classes have to be postponed, and in some cases abandoned, due to cutbacks.  Basic research here is grossly under-funded.  This will not only affect the quality of teaching but the future competitive nature of Irish industry.  As a result we will fall further behind our main industrial competitors.</P>
    <P>I understand that recently the medical <Col N="1409" /> research centre in Trinity College was closed down because of a lack of funding. The libraries in our third level institutions are grossly under-funded and under-staffed. They have been forced to reduce holdings for books due to lack of space and to reduce opening hours due to lack of personnel.  This is a major disadvantage to many students who do not have alternative study facilities.</P>
    <P>In most colleges the equipment for teaching and research is old and inadequate to meet the increase in student intake.  In many cases the equipment is obsolete but cannot be replaced because of the lack of funding.  It is into this environment that increased numbers of students have come in the RTCs and universities.  The Minister has made a welcome commitment to provide further places but unless proper funding is provided, study places in the libraries will become even more crowded, lecture halls will overflow, there will be larger queues for books in the libraries and longer queues in the canteens, at computer terminals and at the photo copying machines.  The result inevitably will be a significant decline in our standards and in the quality of third level education.</P>
    <P>In relation to the higher education grants system, at the moment the children of a large number of middle and lower income families cannot attend university because their parents cannot afford it.  It is time to base the quallification for higher education grants on residual income as they do in Northern Ireland and in England.  This would make it easier for many families who are discriminated against by the present grants system to gain access to third level education.  At the moment many of them are taking places in RTCs because there they are provided with ESF funding, they cannot afford to go to universities and they are taking places from other people because of this.  It is time for the Government to seriously consider the funding of our education system.</P>
    <P>We are facing very challenging times at all levels in education.  We have a surfeit of review bodies when what we need is a positive commitment from the <Col N="1410" /> Government to provide the necessary financial resources to ensure that education keeps pace with our EC partners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>In his speech to the House the Minister spoke about factors beyond the control of the Department in terms of the shortfall in funding from the European Social Fund.  The Minister did not tell us what those factors were or what has given rise to this dreadful situation. Last year a Supplementary Estimate of about £6 million was brought into the House, the vast bulk of which related to school transport.  When the Book of Estimates was published there was quite a difference between the figure given then and the revised Estimate figure announced on budget day in relation to European Social Fund funding.  There was an additional £7.6 million, which related to 1989 activities, included in the revised Book of Estimates.  As the Minister saw it, there was no need last year to bring in a revised Estimate even though this money was due.  I am alarmed that this is one Supplementary Estimate for Education relating to a shortfall in European Social Fund funding.  My information is that a substantial Supplementary Estimate will be introduced next week for second level.  Indeed further moneys are to be sought in relation to first level and in relation to the Zoo project.  What has gone wrong?  Why is the money not forthcoming?  In his contribution the Minister of State said he expected the balance of the £70.6 million to arrive before the end of December. Can he be sure that will happen?  Where will the £4.3 million extra, which is the subject of this Supplementary Estimate, come from?  From where will it be borrowed? If it is to be borrowed what are the implications for the Exchequer?  If the money arrives &mdash; or does not arrive &mdash; by the end of December what are the implications for the Exchequer?  Is the State now in the position that it will have to use money which is very badly needed for all the areas right across the spectrum to which Deputy Deenihan addressed himself?  Are we now penalising students, <Col N="1411" /> in particular, because for some reason the money is not forthcoming from the EC?  Have the Department claimed the returns from the EC on time?  In this regard we are talking about substantial sums of money.  If my information is correct in relation to further Supplementary Estimates coming in next year we will be talking about further substantial sums of money.</P>
      <P>Have the Department done their part? Have they been doing their homework properly, making proper returns and claiming money on time?  I believe the Minister skirted around these issues.  The essence of the Supplementary Estimate was never dealt with, as neither were the problems that have given rise to the present situation.  Is this ongoing?  Will we be faced with this same type of problem or, perhaps, a worsening one year in year out?  What is the difference this year and what has given rise to this Supplementary Estimate suddenly being thrown at us to be dealt with in the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the funding of third level education, but more particularly in the area of grants, a substantial number of students are availing of European Social Fund grants which are not means tested. The problem arises where parents' incomes are slightly above the limits set for third level education grants.  They are either being nailed to the wall financially and undertaking commitments by means of borrowing etc. which will affect their lives for many years or have to take the soul destroying decision that they cannot make proper provision for their children and cannot give them the opportunity of going to university or, in certain instances, to regional technical colleges or to colleges run by the DIT.  It cannot be over-emphasised, and this was alluded to by Deputy Deenihan that in a country that is as highly taxed as we are, where the vast bulk of all revenues comes from the PAYE sector, it is this very PAYE sector who are being graded and adjudicated on in terms of eligibility for grants for their children but on gross income <Col N="1412" /> which, in all instances, is substantially higher than their net income.  This group also can be just over the income limit for hospital services cards.  This puts them in the position either of having to take grave risks in terms of being able to provide proper health care for their families or having to avail of voluntary health insurance.  This group in a real sense have been and continue to be the real poor.</P>
    <P>It is an absolute basic tenet of Labour Party policy in education that there is equality of access.  A gross injustice is being delivered to this group.  In the context of some revision of European Social Fund grants and how they can possibly be extended to apply to other courses or whether it is done directly from Exchequer funding this group must be catered for as an absolute priority.</P>
    <P>In relation to access to third level education a point which must be considered is that of geographic location as well as socio-economic factors.  Those children who live either in or adjacent to university towns have a marked advantage in terms of whether they can avail of third level education places for degree courses as opposed to those who live in the more remote areas of the country. This problem can be approached on a number of levels.  There is the initial step of basing the qualifying limits for third level education grants on net rather than on gross income.  Because of modern technology and the fact that there is a structure of vocational education committees throughout the country many of the degree courses in the general chalk and talk area, for example, of arts, commerce degrees and so on, can be given out on an agency basis to such bodies as vocational education committees, the lecturers being sent from central points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Not alone are many children being discriminated against here but many areas are being discriminated against because a great deal of the income is going out of those areas into the university towns to the detriment of the towns involved.  This is a matter the Minister must examine.  There is also the <Col N="1413" /> whole area of the open university provision which Dublin City University and the Distance Education Centre have addressed themselves to this year.  These courses are very suitable for, for example, the unemployed or married women who, for part of their career are home bound.  Such people could avail of further education under the open university provision if it were available to them.  In the UK subsidies are involved for similar type courses.  I raised this matter of subsidies with the Minister at Question Time prior to the summer recess.  I hope this is being looked at in terms of the Book of Estimates and the budget so that proper provision is made to help this group avail of further education.</P>
      <P>Finally, and I refer specifically to the Estimate, what has happened?  Why was it that after the publication of last year's Estimates an extra £7 million was found to be required?  Why is such a huge amount outstanding this year in the area of third level education?  If my information is correct &mdash; and I would ask the Minister to confirm this &mdash; a figure of £29.5 million will be sought next week by way of Supplementary Estimate for second level education, while almost £1 million will be sought for first level education, and a sum of £100,000 will be sought in relation to the Zoo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is being introduced because of an under-estimation of grants, lack of European Social Fund funding and so on.  I intend to refer mainly to grants and funding for students.  The other Opposition speakers have dealt with the Clancy Report and the obvious lack of equality of access to third level colleges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 15 February 1989 the Minister said that everybody agreed in theory, but not <Col N="1414" /> in practice, with equality of access to third level colleges.  She also admitted in reply to a parliamentary question from me that the level of grant applicable was another factor in the lack of equality of access and that there was growing concern at the preponderance of children of self-employed people receiving third level grants to the alleged detriment of the children of PAYE workers.  That inequality has been referred to here this morning by both Deputy O'Shea and Deputy Deenihan, I have referred to it on numerous occasions and the Minister has admitted that that is the case, yet it continues.</P>
    <P>There are no ifs, buts or maybes about it, if the people whose tax is deducted under the PAYE system are £1 above the limit the Revenue Commissioners, the Government, and everybody knows about it.  Everybody knows their income, the amount of tax they pay and every detail about them.  For these people there is a cut off figure.  On the other hand, farmers and self-employed are asked to declare their income and there is no way of knowing whether they are right or wrong as there can be all sorts of estimates of income.  The Clancy Report referred to the enormous difference in the level of access to third level education between different counties.  Funnily enough, the lowest level of access is in Dublin where there is the highest number of third level colleges and the greatest possible access.  However, because of the lack of grants and so on, access to third level education is not as widely available to students in the Dublin area as it is to students in other counties.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the huge drop out rate from colleges.  No analysis has been done of this but a headline in the <i>Irish Independent</i> last year stated that 4,500 students quit college each year &mdash; obviously, the small grant they receive is one of the major reasons for this. Because it takes so long for students to receive their grants they have to borrow for the first few months they are at college, and when they receive it, it is not as high as they expect.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to this extraordinary <Col N="1415" /> 15 mile rule.  This rule should not exist because, first, it prevents students from going to the college of their choice and, second, apparently it is a purely arbitrary decision taken by the principal of a college. He has to decide whether a person lives within 15 miles of a college and he usually does this by measuring a map, as the crow flies.  He can decide whether a student should get the lower rate grant of £15 or the higher rate of £38 per week. That decision is made for the student. Even if a student lives more than 15 miles from a college, if he lives on a main route &mdash; either a main train route or main bus route &mdash; he will get the grant and will be told he can commute.</P>
    <P>Students have no idea of the amount they will get by way of grant.  In fact, 38 per cent of students receive no grant whatsoever while those who receive grants are unable to live on them.  Even the maximum grant of £38 per week is not enough to survive on.  The minimum rate for a single person on social welfare is £52 per week, yet a student is expected to survive on £38 per week.  The grant system does not encourage equality of access to our third level colleges.</P>
    <P>The fees for these colleges increase at an enormous rate.  During the past decade, student fees have increased by over 400 per cent while at the same time grants for students have only increased by 50 per cent.  This means that today students are worse off now than they were in 1980.  Instead of increasing the equality of access to third level, this reduces it.  The combined enrolment figures for, VECs, RTCs and the Dublin Institutes of Technology increased from 10,900 in 1980 to 22,000 in 1989, an increase of 105 per cent, whereas there was only an increase of 52 per cent, from 26,000 to 35,000, in the enrolment figures for the university sector.  There is a huge drop out rate in this area but no analysis has been carreid out to establish why 4,500 students out of a total of 22,000 drop out of college each year.  Although some of these students have carried out some analysis on this high drop out rate, <Col N="1416" /> no explanation has been given for it by the Department.</P>
    <P>Another factor which has to be referred to is the lack of facilities in these colleges.  It is not that the facilities are bad but that they are non-existent.  The Union of Students of Ireland carried out a study of six or seven colleges &mdash; Waterford, Carlow, Cork, Tralee and Athlone Regional Technical Colleges, Bolton Street, Kevin Street, the College of Marketing and Design and the Dublin Institutes of Technology.  As the President of the Union of Students of Ireland, Tadhg Daly, said, the simplist way to describe a Vocational Educational college is the bare walls and teaching facilities; virtually all other facets of a college are missing &mdash; library and canteen facilities are totally inadequate, recreational facilities are non-existent or inadequate, apart from a few colleges, there are no medical facilities, safety standards are non-existent and there is no access for the disabled. These colleges are barely education factories which are not at all suitable for the development of the student.  This is probably another factor leading to the huge drop out rate.</P>
    <P>Those involved in the colleges sector were assured during the summer that the long awaited colleges Bill would be brought before the House in October and be completed by Christmas.  That has become more and more doubtful and no solid decisions have been given in reply to questions raised in this House.  It has been suggested that the Bill may be introduced next session, but we do not know. This has created great confusion and doubt and I appeal to the Minister to speed up the colleges Bill for the next session.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey) Frank Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions to this short debate.  This Supplementary Estimate deals only with one area of education and consequently I do not propose to go into some of the other areas mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would, however, clear up a misunderstanding regarding availability of <Col N="1417" /> money.  There is no shortage of money and this Supplementary Estimate is required because of the timing of an ESF payment.  As I explained earlier, ESF funding is paid at a slower rate than we would wish and consequently we are awaiting an ESF payment which we expect to receive in late December.  If this remaining funding comes through in 1990, there will not be an extra charge on the Exchequer; if it does not come through until early 1991, there will be a charge on the Exchequer in 1990 but a reduction in the charge in 1991.  It is not a question of a shortage of money or money being taken from any other area of the Education Vote, rather it is a question of moving forward expenditure which we now need because of our commitments and restoring that expenditure when we receive the promised funding from the ESF.  We cannot control the timing of ESF payments and consequently it has been necessary to move this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>Various comments have been made on shortcomings in third level education. Deputy Mac Giolla referred to what he considered to be an unfair distribution of higher education grants.  I accept that there may have been anomalies in the past but these have been cleared up.  Any applicant to a local authority for a third level grant must produce audited accounts for examination and authentication for the Revenue Commissioners. This applies in the case of self-employed people, farmers and anybody else.  Anomalies of the type described by the Deputy which may have existed in the past have been eliminated. I am satisfied that the judgment made by local authorities on the eligibility of students for third level grants is being made in the most effective way possible. I agree that a person who has tax stopped at source under the PAYE system has no chance of producing incorrect figures, whereas it is a possibility in the case of people who submit their own accounts on a self-assessment basis.  That applies across the board and is not confined to qualification for education grants.  This Department have done everything to <Col N="1418" /> ensure that people who do not qualify for a higher education grant because they are not under the income level do not get it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deenihan referred to shortfalls and difficulties experienced in third level education.  One would have to preface any remarks about expenditure on education by saying that no matter how much money one has to spend, it is not enough.  Great credit is due to the Minister for Education in that during the past few years when there were significant cutbacks in Exchequer expenditure she protected the education system as far as possible.</P>

      <P>In the 1990 Estimate, £116 million was provided in grants to universities, colleges and designated institutions for higher education.  That figure represents an increase of 10 per cent on the 1989 figure.  It is an indication of the Minister's commitment to deal with the problems which I accept are present, such as overcrowding in libraries, canteens and so on.  Nobody denies that these problems exist.  In the context of the need for cutbacks in expenditure and the demand by the colleges for extra expenditure, the Minister has made every effort and has succeeded to a certain degree in tackling the difficulties.  I assure Deputy Deenihan and the House that the Minister for Education has been making every possible effort to get the extra money required under the current and capital programme, and she will continue in that effort.  The increase in last year's Estimate was a significant 10 per cent and I hope to see continuing increases in this very important sector in the Education Vote.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister assuring the House that this Supplementary Estimate has no adverse financial implication for the Exchequer?  In other words, if we are waiting for this money to come from the European Social Fund before the end of December or shortly after that, is it not logical that the money used will be <Col N="1419" /> borrowed and that there will be a cost implication in terms of servicing the debt?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">

There is no requirement for the drawing of extra moneys from the Exchequer as a result of this Supplementary Estimate.  It is purely a question of timing and cash flow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of this Bill is to establish, in the public interest and in the interest of investors, new and enhanced arrangements for the control and regulation of unit trust schemes.  While many of the provisions of this Bill are similar to those of the Unit Trusts Act, 1972, it was considered that, having regard to the extensive amendment of the 1972 Act which would have been necessary to effect the required changes, the most effective and logical approach was to repeal the 1972 Act.</P>
      <P>Under this Bill the Central Bank will assume from the Minister for Industry and commerce statutory responsibility for the supervision of unit trusts.  The other main objective of the Bill is to provide for developments in accepted international practice with regard to the supervision and operation of unit trusts since the 1972 Act was passed by the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The transfer of supervisory functions from the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the Central Bank is part of a process which has been ongoing for a number of years, with the objective of reducing, as far as is practical and desirable, the range of supervisory authorities <Col N="1420" /> responsible for the financial services sector.  Thus, in addition to their responsibility for the banking sector, the Central Bank have, over the past few years, been given regulatory powers with regard to building societies and trustee savings banks, as well as being given supervisory powers in relation to the International Financial Services Centre in Dublin.</P>
    <P>In the area of investment funds the Central Bank is the supervisory authority for UCITS &mdash; undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities &mdash; under the European Communities (UCITS) Regulations, 1989, and it will assume a similar supervisory role for variable capital companies under Part XIII of the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987, which is currently nearing completion of its passage through the Oireachtas.  The Unit Trusts Bill, 1990, will complete the adoption of a consistent approach to the control and supervision of this sector of the financial services industry.</P>
    <P>The consolidation of regulatory control for these financial services in a single supervisory authority will result, I believe, in a more efficient use of scarce resources and the ready availability of a pool of expertise should enhance the quality of supervision and help eliminate any gaps in the supervisory structure in this particular sector.  Such a supervisory authority will help ensure that the rules impact evenly on all institutions operating in this sector and allow for a more coherent response to developments, having regard to the rapid and substantial developments in financial services.</P>
    <P>The other main objective of the Bill is to up-date the provisions of the Unit Trusts Act, 1972, to provide for developments in accepted international practice concerning the operation and supervision of unit trusts.  Since the passage of the 1972 Act, this sector of the financial services industry has developed and expanded enormously and this has been reflected internationally in changes in the form and degree of control and regulation. From being a relatively new investment vehicle here in the early seventies &mdash; in 1973 only two units trusts were registered in Ireland &mdash; unit trusts <Col N="1421" /> are now firmly established.  At present, there are some 30 registered unit trusts with investments worth just under £1 billion. With supervisory systems in existence in most developed countries for many years the unit trust industry has now, in contrast to the situation prevailing when the 1972 Act was enacted, a body of well known and accepted rules and best practices.</P>
    <P>To take account of the situation facing existing and future unit trusts in the nineties, and moving into the 21st century, it is essential, I believe, to adapt our supervisory system to accommodate these new circumstances.  I consider that the best way of dealing with this is to adopt an approach which allows for more flexibility in dealing with modern practices yet maintains fundamental principles of investor protection enshrined in the 1972 Act.  A less rigid approach will allow the supervisory authority to respond more rapidly to developments by using the powers devolved on them in this Bill.</P>
    <P>In addition, I consider that this Bill, in updating our supervisory system, will, without any reduction in supervisory standards, enhance the attractiveness and competitiveness of Ireland, and the Irish Financial Services Centre in particular, as a location for investment fund management services.</P>
    <P>Before I pass on to the detail of the Bill I would like, for the benefit of those Deputies who may not be familiar with unit trusts, to explain what unit trusts are.  A unit trust is an important medium of investment, particularly for individuals with small amounts of money to invest. The money paid by participants or unit-holders is invested by the professional management company in a range of stocks, shares, securities and other property which are put into a fund which is in the custody of an independent trustee and administered in accordance with the terms of a trust deed for the benefit of unit-holders.  The advantage of this medium of investment is that it gives a small investor the benefit of a spread of risk which he would be unable to obtain <Col N="1422" /> on his own, combined with professional management of his investment.</P>
    <P>I would now like to summarise, for the benefit of Deputies, the general thrust of the most important sections of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The definitions of certain terms used in the Bill are contained in section 1. Provision is made in section 2 to exclude from the application of the Bill undertakings authorised, and therefore supervised, under the European Communities (UCITS) Regulations, 1989.  Section 3 provides that the Central Bank establish and maintain a register of authorised unit trust schemes.  This provision is similar to that contained in section 2 of the 1972 Act.  In addition, the section also covers other public disclosure requirements imposed on the bank.  The necessary conditions, similar to those of the 1972 Act, for the authorisation of a unit trust are set out in section 4.  These include the bank being satisfied with: the competence and probity of the management company and trustee; the financial resources and corporate status of the management company and trustee; the independence of the management company and trustee from one another; the trust deed's compliance with the provisions of the Bill and its deposit with the bank; and the name of the unit trust scheme.  This section also empowers the Minister to direct that authorisations be subject to specified conditions or requirements, as long as these do not constrain the prudential supervision of a scheme by the bank.</P>
    <P>Section 5 gives the bank power to impose conditions for authorisation of unit trusts generally, individually or of a particular class.  This will allow the bank to regulate the operation of unit trust schemes, taking due account of the different characteristics of schemes, e.g. a scheme which offers units to the public needs to be subjected to more rigorous conditions than a scheme whose unit holders are a select group of major institutions.</P>
    <P>In the event of a refusal of an authorisation by the bank, section 6 provides that the management company or trustee may appeal to the High Court.  Sections <Col N="1423" /> 7 and 8 of the Bill require that the approval of the bank is necessary to any alteration in the trust deed, or change in name or replacement of the management company or trustee of a scheme.  Section 8 also gives the bank the power, where it is in the interests of unit holders, to replace the management company or trustee, who would have the right to appeal any such decision to the High Court.</P>
    <P>In section 9 the sale or purchase of units, or any solicitation in that regard, by unauthorised unit trusts is prohibited unless approval has been received from the bank, which may attach conditions to any such approval.  This prohibition extends to any arrangements, resembling unit trusts, which provide for the participation of the public in profits or income from securities or any other property. This prohibition does not extend to private trusts.  Neither does it cover investment schemes linked with life assurance or companies incorporated under the Companies Acts or by statute or charter, building societies, friendly societies or industrial and provident societies, which are already covered by separate legislation.  The effect of this section is to prohibit the operation of unauthorised unit trust schemes and is similar to the provisions of section 7 of the 1972 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 10 prohibits the advertising of unauthorised unit trusts, as defined in section 9, unless approval has been received from the bank, who may attach conditions to any such approval.  The effectiveness of the Bill depends on prohibiting unauthorised schemes, not only in the matter of carrying on business, but also the matter of advertising.  The bank will also have the power to exempt foreign newspapers and magazines with only a small circulation in Ireland from compliance with this provision.</P>
    <P>Sections 9 and 10 effectively prevent unauthorised unit trusts from operating in Ireland and avoiding the duties and responsibilities attendant upon authorisation.</P>
    <P>A fundamental operating principle of <Col N="1424" /> unit trusts is that the proceeds of the sale of any units or any income in respect of the assets of a scheme that is not distributed to unit holders shall be assets of the scheme and be treated accordingly and this continues to be provided for in section 11.</P>
    <P>Another fundamental principle is incorporated in section 12 which obliges the management company, as soon as may be, to purchase units from unit holders who so request.  The section allows for the temporary suspension of such purchase in exceptional circumstances in the interests of investors.  There is also provision for the bank to specify other limited circumstances under which this stipulation need not apply.</P>
    <P>Section 13 prohibits a management company, or connected persons, from making profits from transactions in any assets held under the scheme.  It also prohibits a management company or trustee borrowing or lending on the scheme.  The bank will be empowered to allow such practices under conditions it might impose in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>Strict liability of trustees under authorised unit trust schemes is provided for in section 14, which is in itself a re-enactment of section 15 of the 1972 Act.</P>
    <P>The application to authorised unit trusts of certain provisions of the European Communities &mdash; Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities &mdash; Regulations, 1989 is provided for in section 15.  These adapted provisions relate to the temporary suspension of the purchase of units, reporting and auditing requirements, keeping of records, appellate procedures, revocation of authorisation, the bank's power of intervention and the review of the bank's decisions by the High Court.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to say that this Bill, largely reflecting the provisions of the 1972 Act &mdash; albeit amended to take account of more modern conditions and practices &mdash; will provide a continuing framework of control and supervision which will allow for the protection of the public's and investors' interests into the next century without inhibiting the <Col N="1425" /> development and growth of this sector of the financial services industry.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Bill will be welcomed by Deputies on all sides.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be afforded an opportunity to make a few comments on this Bill.</P>
      <P>Like all modern legislation, in appearance at least, it seems to have the effect of streamlining our laws, in this case bringing them into line with EC Directives. I welcome the fact that this is being done by way of legislation rather than by ministerial order or statutory instrument. The Minister saw fit to avail of the opportunity to review the provisions of the 1972 Act, update them in a way which will be reassuring, one would hope, to the consumer/investor and instil public confidence in the system.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that we are dealing with a Bill, the provisions of which will prepare us for the changes now taking place and those likely to occur in ensuing years.  The Financial Services Centre, once on stream in this city, will be a case in point which will warrant the implementation of the provisions of this Bill.  Its provisions also shift the onus of responsibility for supervision in this area from the Department of Industry and Commerce to the Central Bank.  I suppose that is a good thing.  It is something we discussed at some length in the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the EC when debating various EC Directives. By and large it was felt better to have one central organisation responsible right across Europe.  Of course, here we have shades of the European Central Bank which, we are told, ultimately will be likely to assume full and absolute control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might make one or two comments in relation to controls in circumstances such as these.  Modern technology has been extremely helpful in creating a greater level of efficiency and accountability, certainly greater speed of reaction in certain circumstances but, simultaneously, greater vulnerability in certain areas.  We <Col N="1426" /> do not have to go back very far in recent years to find examples of that.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking while allowing foreign companies to advertise and promote their schemes here we need to have a central controlling agency with some continuous contact with their counterparts in Europe.  Can we be reassured that companies operating here are likely to have a clean bill of health when they advertise and operate?  I note that henceforth the Central Bank will be empowered to investigate their state of health and, as it were, give their imprimatur.  Having done so they will have access to the usual sources of information in such cases. Therefore, one can assume that, having arrived here with a clean bill of health &mdash; with a Euro certificate &mdash; that will withstand the test so that we will not have any fast moving relocations or shifts that might not be of a useful or positive nature.</P>
    <P>In both the recent and distant past there has been quite a number of instances of investment houses having been able to operate here in a way which has not been beneficial to the country, to the investor, or indeed to the casual investor, a different category.  I mention those examples because, from our discussions at the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the EC, my fear is that not even the provisions of this Bill will in any way inhibit or restrict the activities of agents who might not be as scrupulous as we would wish.  I do not see any provision in the Bill that will change that position.  For example, there could be a company, acting in an agency capacity, buying, selling, investing and so on, disappear overnight, operating for and on behalf of a legitimate investment scheme, quite above board but which &mdash; because of the management of that scheme by the agent &mdash; might well fall into disrepute.  I am sure that every Member of this House has dealt with constituents over the past ten years who have been the unfortunate victims of such circumstances, in this case, the investor and, more often than not, a small investor. I do not see how that small, uninformed casual investor, can be <Col N="1427" /> safeguarded &mdash; somebody who is unfortunate enough to, say, sell a house to acquire a short term investment who, through sheer bad luck, invests in an area proving less than beneficial.</P>
    <P>However, the most serious point is that not only would it have been a bad investment but it could have been a bad investment by virtue of mismanagement of the scheme, and the deliberate mismanagement of a particular scheme. I envisage a matter which is not dealt with in the Bill but which could and must be dealt with at some stage.  I do not accept that a company or individual acting in an agency capacity, dealing in the sale or advertising of trusts or investment schemes, in the event of they going bankrupt or into liquidation can eliminate any responsibility from the parent company or the original investment company. For example, A is operating in an agency capacity for B who has a number of similar agents, and A disappears or, by virtue of mismanagement, proves unreliable with consequent loss to investors. Can we not devise a system and introduce in a Bill like this some means where the parent company, perhaps a national household name, can be held responsible?</P>
    <P>We have discussed this before in this House but I still am not satisfied.  I do not want to use names in the House and I shall not, but if an agent acting on behalf of an investment company, in many cases an expensive investment company, enters into arrangements and agreements on behalf of that company over a period, many of which are beneficial to both the agent and the parent or original company, then the agent defaults with the consequent loss to the investor, the parent company should be responsible, and should be responsible for compensation. Our experience in the past ten years or so should have taught us that when framing future legislation, particularly in the broader European arena having regard to the open market, etc., we should be more careful to ensure that the scope for abuse is reduced as far as possible.  I know that, no matter what <Col N="1428" /> restrictions are in place, the unscrupulous will always find ways and means to circumvent the system.  Be that as it may, we still have to make every possible effort to close all loopholes to ensure the protection of the consumer or investor.</P>
    <P>That has another significance in the sense that in the European arena, ensuring that observation of all criteria is borne in mind by parent companies, investment companies, insurance companies and anybody involved in the financial services, a great deal will depend on the way we can apply the regulations.  From the point of view of the confidence the European financial services business will have in our ability to operate in this country, that is a very important aspect.  This country depends to a large extent on foreign investors, and if they have confidence in our ability to operate the structure in this country, that will stand us in good stead.  On the other hand, if there is a lack of confidence, not only will it create suspicion on the one hand, but it will damage our investment prospects, our integrity and our good name generally in this area.</P>
    <P>This legislation is welcome so far as it goes: it is useful in that it brings our domestic situation into line with the financial services directives; it updates the 1972 legislation; it gives at least limited consumer protection and, as it were, creates a kind of universal application of a regime right across Europe, so far as unit trusts and various other financial investment schemes are concerned.</P>
    <P>I know my colleagues intend to home in on some of the other details on Committee Stage, and it is probably better that we just deal with the general principle at this stage and allow the Minister some time to consider the possibility of accepting a number of amendments which may be put down on Committee Stage.  From discussions with my colleagues I understand there are a number of such amendments.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation.  I hope it provides some protection for the investor or consumer and will streamline European legislation with our own, as is intended.  I hope sincerely that the <Col N="1429" /> bureaucracy and Eurospeak to which we have become so accustomed in the past number of years, particularly in the financial services area, will be simplified slightly in future legislation.  Whatever chance the people involved in financial services and investment have of interpreting many of the directives coming from Europe which we take on board, the casual investor, the elderly person who has £10,000 or £15,000 to invest on a once off basis, cannot be expected to see through the intricate web of Eurospeak and bureauspeak that have been associated with directives of this nature. There can be no possibility of such a person operating or investing other than on the advice of somebody acting as either a parent company or in an agency capacity.  I feel the biggest weakness in the Bill relates to those acting in an agency capacity because it does nothing to tighten up the possible loopholes there.  The Minister might consider amendments on Committee Stage which will achieve something along the lines I have been suggesting.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will consider introducing amendments on Report Stage to ensure responsibility and accountability on the part of the parent firm.  If that could be done the legislation would be extremely worthwhile.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister said, the unit trusts phenomenon has increased substantially over the years and there is now a very appreciable sum invested in them made up, for the most part, of small savings.  The probability is that such investments will increase substantially in the years ahead.  Therefore, it is appropriate that the House should seek to take all possible steps to protect the position of savers and ensure the safety of their savings; ensure that they are not ripped off, that they get a reasonable return on their savings and that their savings are dealt with in a responsible, prudent, fair and honest manner.  That has not always applied to small savers in various institutions here.  We have had examples over the years where small savers have lost their life savings.  There was the <Col N="1430" /> PMPS where very large sums of money went astray and unfortunate people found themselves left in a sad and sorry position.  It, therefore, behoves the House to be very careful about this.</P>
      <P>In this regard there is one preliminary point I want to make about the security of small savings.  The Bill is giving the Central Bank wide ranging and substantial licensing and supervisory powers in connection with unit trusts.  The Minister also is keeping his finger in the pie &mdash; I will be saying a word about that aspect of the matter later.  The Central Bank and the Minister are taking substantial powers of control, regulation, supervision, inspection and so on in regard to the unit trusts.  I agree with that.  It is right and proper and in order that they should do that but they should have those powers and should use them with great care, rigour and dedication to ensure that the supervision is carried out in a proper manner and that the savings of small savers are properly and prudently managed.  That is all right as far as it goes.</P>
      <P>However, having taken those powers, it is sought to exonerate the bank completely, and presumably the Minister, in the event of anything going wrong.  That is totally unacceptable.  When powers are taken to do a job, there should go along with that, as part and parcel of it, a responsibility to ensure that the job is done, and done properly, and if it is not and the result is that some unfortunate person or widow or family lose their money, then the Central Bank and/or the Minister should be responsible for compensating them for their losses.  I do not think there is anything unreasonable or unfair about that proposal.  One cannot just take powers and then, if one slips up and as the result of one's carelessness or lack of dedication in exercising those powers, somebody loses, wash one's hands of all responsibility.  I do not think that is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the powers are taken the Minister or the Central Bank should take the responsibility also, as happens in every other walk of life.  When people outside the Government or semi-State bodies <Col N="1431" /> have jobs to do, they are legally responsible to compensate those who have suffered damage if they make a mistake and things go wrong, be they solicitors, doctors, architects, engineers or whatever. The same principle should apply to the Central Bank and to the Minister. The idea of putting exonerations in the Bill to excuse them if they do not do their job in a proper manner is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the main thrust of the Bill which is to transfer the role of supervisor and licensing authority in the matter of unit trusts from the Minister to the Central Bank.  A strange phenomenon seems to be developing in the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to be divesting himself of functions that properly should be his and hiving them off either to the private sector or even a semi-State body, as is being done here.</P>
    <P>A week ago or so it was announced that the Minister was appointing consultants in the private sector to undertake a review of the whole scheme of export credit insurance and finance.  Now we find that the Minister is setting about divesting himself of the responsibility he has had until now to supervise and regulate unit trusts.  What is going on here?  Is there some idea now that governmental functions have to be hived off from the Minister?  What is the idea here?  It is not a healthy development.  I am sure the trend I have indicated is not confined to this Minister or this Department.  It is not a great idea.  At the end of the day answerability and responsibility where people's savings are concerned should rest with this House.</P>
    <P>If, in the future, there are difficulties with the unit trusts and we have some thousands of our constituents coming to us in distress and difficulty, as happened with the PMPS, wanting to find out what has happened, after this Bill goes through and the responsibility for the whole issue is hived off from the Minister for Industry to the Central Bank, questions will not be answered here in this House.  We will not be able to raise the matter.  When <Col N="1432" /> we look for an Adjourment debate, a Cheann Comhairle, you will tell us that the Minister has no responsibility, that it is the responsibility of the Central Bank. Questions in the House, debates on the issue, will be taken from us and the responsibility hived off to the semi-State sector.</P>
    <P>The same applies with An Post and Telecom.  That is the trend that is developing and it is not a healthy trend. I believe it would be better if the Minister retained the responsibility in his own office for supervising, controlling, licensing and regulating unit trusts.  He should take on whatever expertise might be required to enable him to carry out that function in a prudent, careful and proper manner.  Likewise on the question of a review of export credit insurance that is a key matter of Government policy that should not be hived off to the private sector.  It should be retained within the ambit of the Minister for which he would be answerable here.  He should take on whatever expertise he needs in that regard.  That is part of a trend that I am rather concerned about.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the Bill that troubles me somewhat is this strange phenomenon that we are presenting ourselves with here.  It is not as though the Minister is hiving off the issue completely and saying that this is a matter for the Central Bank, that the Central Bank will license, examine, investigate, control, regulate and so on.  Under the Bill the Minister vests the power in the Central Bank to do these things but in some strange, vague way which is defined neither in the Bill nor in the Minister's speech he goes on to provide that the Minister has power to specify conditions which may be imposed on the licensee in the controlling process of the unit trusts.  That is all very strange. What is the reason for imposing these conditions?  If you are hiving off responsibility to the Central Bank, why keep your finger in the pie?</P>
    <P>If the Central Bank are being given this job to do &mdash; I am not happy about that &mdash; and if, as the Minister said in his speech, they will of necessity have to employ experts who will know the job <Col N="1433" /> and be able to do it in a proper manner, who will know what to look for and what steps to take to ensure they are getting the right trustees and the right management teams to look after these unit trusts, why duplicate the issue even in part by retaining the power to impose conditions?  I find that rather strange.  If the Central Bank are being given the job we should let them do it in its entirety in a proper manner rather than trying to retain a controlling hand in that job.  Why is this all so vague?  What conditions will be imposed?  Would it not have been appropriate to indicate in the Bill or at least in the Minister's speech what is in mind here rather than simply saying that the Minister may impose conditions, without giving the slightest indication of what is contemplated in that proviso?</P>
    <P>There are important matters that need to be provided for, and maybe some of these have been contemplated in the section. For example, regulations as to the amount which the management team may charge for their services in administering the unit trust is a bit of a grey area.  That is an annual item.  In other words when the income of the unit trust is aggregated at the end of each year, before any saver or unit trust holder gets anything the cream is sliced off by the management company &mdash; it may be called costs of administration or whatever. Those people have to be paid for doing the job and that is all right provided the charges they make each year are reasonable and fair.  I would like to know from the Minister in what way that will be examined.  Will parameters be set under which a maximum percentage charge will be allowed?  Is that perhaps one of the conditions the Minister has in mind?  Will he be dealing with that or imposing a condition limiting the percentage charge which the management team may take for themselves?  I would be interested to know that.</P>
    <P>There is also the other aspect under which management teams on occasion in unit trusts will, from the time of the first subscription, take for themselves a chunk of the money saved, a capital tax as it were.  A person may buy £100 worth of <Col N="1434" /> units but a certain amount, 5 per cent, 10 per cent or 20 per cent is immediately deducted and the remainder goes into the savings pool.  I do not know whether that is fair.  The figure may vary from case to case, but there ought to be regulations that would set maximum figures that could be taken by these management teams.</P>
    <P>As an overriding feature to that, as far as the initial take by the management team and as far as the annual administration charge is concerned, it ought to be made very clear at all stages, not in Euro-speak or business-speak but in plain, everyday layman's language that anybody can understand, exactly what these hidden charges would be and what it would mean to the saver.  All too often these matters are buried in small print. People who are about to put their savings &mdash; small savings for the most part &mdash; into these trusts should know how much of their money is going to be invested and how much is likely to end up in the pockets of the financial and banking institutions or directors thereof who for the most part are the people who run these trusts.  Is that going to be contemplated in the conditions which the Minister arrogates and retains under the Bill?  These matters should be spelled out. This is the nitty gritty that we need to know if we want to ensure that every possible step is being taken to protect the small saver.</P>
    <P>The question of ensuring a fair distribution of the profits made by the trust then arises.  I would like to know how that is to be tackled.  At the end of each year the management board sit in one of their plush offices and see how much profit they have made.  Then they decide how they will distribute it, what proportion they will retain for their own expenses, what proportion they will put into some notional reserve fund, what proportion they may use for making further capital investments and what proportion they will pay in dividends to the original investors.  There is tremendous scope vested in the management board for doing down, as it were, the small <Col N="1435" /> investors and small savers if they felt like doing so.</P>
    <P>For the most part, people who put small savings into unit trusts &mdash; I would think &mdash; reasonably expect that an appreciable proportion of the profits made from the investment of their money would be paid to them on a year to year basis.  I do not think that most of them would be particularly interested in building up long term funds for five, ten, 15 or 20 years ahead.  I suppose that a few might be interested in doing this but, for the most part, people who put in small savings like to get their return fairly quickly instead of building up a fund for the years ahead.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the management board may have other ideas and it may suit them, for their own purposes, to build up fees for the years ahead. However, in building up a bigger fund they would retain an unnecessarily large proportion of the profits made in any one year in reserve and for accumulation purposes.  The best you could say about it is that some balance must be struck between those two extremes.  I know that, in most cases, they will do their best and that a fair balance will be struck but there will be cases when the interests and wishes of the small savers will be in conflict with those of a banking management board.  That is surely where the role of the supervisory authority &mdash; the Minister or the Central Bank &mdash; comes in.  Do the Central Bank intend to involve themselves in that line?  I would be interested to know if that is one of the things they will look at and to see how the profits of a unit trust are being distributed, retained or dealt with, to ensure that the small savers get a fair crack of the whip from the point of view of distribution and a return on their savings. That is very important, having regard to the fact that one is dealing with small savers who could not understand or follow the complex balance sheets or the thrust of the investment policies adopted by the management board from time to time.</P>
    <P>The Bill also deals with the obligation <Col N="1436" /> being put on the management companies to repurchase the units.  That is the one item which is spelt out in some form in the Bill as everything else is rather vague. There is no question of commission, fees, and so on.  Section 12 includes a provision placing an obligation on the management to repurchase the units.  I do not want to debate that in detail at this point because it would be more appropriate on Committee Stage.  However, section 12 provides for an underhanded benefit.  It says that there is an obligation on the management company to repurchase the units at the option of the unit-holder, but at what price?</P>
    <P>The question of repurchase is meaningless unless one determines that the price a person would get for their unit &mdash; a return on their money put into savings &mdash; is reasonable.  The section says that, if they seek to avail of that right, they are only entitled to the price prevailing at the time the management company purchase units of the scheme.  That seems to mean that the management company can nominate their own price, which might be a pittance, if they were out to discourage units being cashed and the person getting their savings back.  That is not good enough.  I do not see any great merit in purporting to place an obligation on a management company to buy back the units and enable the small saver to get their money back if the institution can nominate their own price in doing so. What is the benefit?  Where is the merit in that?  It is an underhand benefit to any small saver.</P>
    <P>If the Central Bank are to be the supervisory authority they should have some say in that regard and should be able to recommend a fair price which the management company should be obliged to pay when the small savers cash their savings.  The Minister should introduce an amendment to this effect on Committee Stage and if not I will table an amendment.  It should provide that the supervisory authority should have a role in examining the assets and in ensuring that, where a person wants to get their money back and cash in savings &mdash; as they are entitled to do &mdash; they get a fair <Col N="1437" /> and reasonable price.  They should not be confined to the price which the management company decide for the repurchase of the units at any particular time.</P>
    <P>Those are the main points which I wanted to make in connection with this Bill.  I am convinced that the Central Bank are the appropriate supervisory authority and it would have been better to have left the matter as it was.  The conditions should be spelt out and there should be answerability in the event of losses on the part of the supervisory authority. Subject to those matters, the Labour Party will support the Bill.  We agree that updating is necessary and my points will be raised on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Taylor's point relating to the merits of the transfer of supervisory and regulatory powers from the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the Central Bank is really the nub of this Bill.  An argument could be made that there is an element of democratic accountability in having the Minister responsible and accountable to this House, but there has been a trend in recent years to diminish that accountability in the House, particularly so far as the Minister for Finance is concerned. It has always seemed crazy that one can pose a question to the Minister for Finance in the House about interest rates, which are central to the performance of the economy, to be told that it is not a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one looks at the question of the responsibility of the Minister there is, ironically, in the case Deputy Taylor mentioned, action being taken in the High Court at the moment on behalf of the unfortunate people who lost their life savings in the PMPS debacle.  The case was due to be heard last Monday, the date of the presidential inauguration, but it was postponed because of that.  The people concerned had been waiting for this for a long time.  Deputy Taylor's contribution reminded me of this.  I am sorry I do not have the notes here, but I met some of those people the week before last and the point they made was that far <Col N="1438" /> from the Minister having been of assistance to them, they considered themselves to have been misled by him.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce of the day apparently made a statement in the House the effect of which was to reassure the investors concerned of the soundness of the PMPA/PMPS at that time.  The Minister had democratic accountability.</P>
    <P>While I would favour the general philosophical argument about the Minister being accountable to this House, I wonder how practical and meaningful it is when we come to something like unit trusts.  I wonder if it means a great deal having regard to the scope of the legislation before us.  There is a certain logic in this responsibility being afforded to the Central Bank as outlined by the Minister. One can see a certain symmetry.  The Minister has listed areas where control passed to the Central Bank in recent times &mdash; responsibility for the building societies, and the Trustee Saving Bank, in the Companies Bill, which we dealt with last week, responsibility for variable capital companies now rests with the Central Bank, and the regulation of the financial services centre itself.</P>
    <P>On examination most people will hold the view that the Gallagher fiasco was in no small part contributed to by either inadequacy of the powers vested in the Central Bank or poor administration of those powers by the Central Bank.  In any event the Central Bank bears some responsibility for that situation.</P>
    <P>On balance I can see the good sense in the supervision and regulation of unit trusts being passed to the Central Bank, although I am unhappy where things go wrong from the point of view of the small investor as to what powers there are to provide a remedy.  The Minister in his address kindly explained to those of us with no expertise in the management of other people's finances what a unit trust is.</P>

      <P>I wish the Minister had presumed a little more and gone on to <Col N="1439" /> explain some other definitions.  I do not know whether the term &ldquo;unit trust scheme&rdquo; and &ldquo;unit linked fund&rdquo; are interchangeable. There was a reference to the fact that when the 1972 legislation became law in 1973 there were only two such registered schemes in Ireland.  I understand that there is only one registered Irish scheme and that the range of the rest are unit linked funds which I presume is what we are talking about here.  I would like to have that clarified because there is some confusion in my mind about it.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister address the question of the exclusion of USITs from this legislation and the implications involved? What is the implication of USITs being excluded for the operation of unit trust schemes as we know them?  Is there not a competitive advantage to USITs and to the development or expectation that USITs dominated by international companies would be attracted to the Financial Services Centre where, as I understand it, there is a tax advantage compared to the operation of domestic unit trust schemes?  Is that likely to attract the preponderance of funds as distinct from unit trust schemes?</P>
      <P>When replying will the Minister comment on whether there is any imposition in the case of USITs for any proportion of that money to be invested in the domestic market?  For example, in the 1972 Act on unit trust schemes, section 10 (3) (a) gives the Minister power by order to provide</P>
      <P>in relation to all registered unit trust schemes or a specified class or specified classes thereof ... or in relation to all such schemes other than a specified class ... that not less than a proportion specified in the order of any property for the time being subject to any trust created under a scheme to which the order applies shall be Irish securities or other property in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of the day in introducing the 1972 Act made quite a deal of its importance as being a source of capital for the domestic economy and that the <Col N="1440" /> then envisaged growth of unit trusts in Ireland would be a valuable source of such capital.  I note that the Minister today referred to the fact that some 13 registered unit trusts have investments worth just over £1 billion.  I do not know to what extent that provision in the 1972 Act was ever invoked or whether there is such a requirement, but I see no reference to it in the new Bill.  Is the thrust of that particular section excluded?  What is the compulsion, if any, for a proportion to continue to be invested in the domestic economy?</P>
    <P>The main question is whether one is in agreement with the central proposal which is to transfer the supervisory powers to the Central Bank.  The Central Bank are effectively being asked to be the watchdogs for the public interest in this instance.  We know from a number of examples that there have been deplorable cases in the past of people being cheated of their life savings in circumstances which &mdash; hopefully &mdash; this legislation will address.</P>
    <P>A unit trust is an important medium of investment for small savers.  In my constituency a great many people regard the credit union as the best they can aspire to in terms of small savings.  I presume so far as the risk is spread that the unit trust, next to the Post Office, is the next safest option.  In so far as the Central Bank are supposed to perform the role as watchdog for the public interest, my fear is that the Central Bank itself seems to be captive of the very people it is supposed to be watching.  The Gallagher case does not create confidence.  That situation as posited by Deputy Durkan could not happen again although the legislation has been tightened up since then.</P>
    <P>Regarding definitions, I would like the Minister to address whether there is a distinction between the imposition of conditions for the authorisation of a unit trust scheme <i>per se</i> and the freedom of any individual or individuals to set themselves up without any licensing authority or without any question being raised about their competence as financial advisers.  At least, this is my impression <Col N="1441" /> based on my experience as a trade union official and having been approached on a number of occasions in the past by gentlemen fronting for organisations soliciting funds in circumstances where they knew major redundancies had taken place.</P>
    <P>The most recent example of that was during the introduction of the early retirement redeployment proposals in the public service arising from which a great number of public servants lost their jobs or opted for early retirement and &mdash; depending on one's point of view &mdash; qualified for not insignificant lump sums. I was approached &mdash; along with other colleagues in the trade union movement &mdash; to provide names and addresses to these people so that they could directly solicit funds from redundant employees with a view to investing it on their behalf in whatever unit link fund they determined. As a layman it seemed to me in some cases that they had no more competence than I had in the investment of financial resources, but that their play was pitched on their ability to market themselves and act as salesmen.  I am not clear from reading the Bill whether that situation has been tightened up.  Any two of us can still cause a company to be set up and market ourselves as investment experts and solicit money from anybody who is gullible enough to give it to us.  It may well be that some of these people are competent.  I am aware of cases where people have been less than happy with the outcome.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of section 5, the bank may impose conditions for the authorisation of a unit trust scheme but I do not know what control there is over the actual financial advisers who would be canvassing this scheme or the type of situation to which Deputy Durkan adverted when he talked about a company acting as an agency.  That freedom is still there to solicit investment from gullible members of the public but I do not think there is anything in this legislation that shuts that out.</P>
    <P>There are a few points I wish to bring forward on Committee Stage.  The main thrust of the legislation makes sense.  In <Col N="1442" /> the area of financial services the tidying up process is completed and the legislation is brought more into line with the developments in this area over recent years.  I acknowledge what Deputy Durkan has said that this is a better way of dealing with it than some of the alternatives that may have been open to him. I should like to ask the Minister, in the wider context of the financial services, whether a financial services Bill is expected to be brought before the House and if there is any particular reason it was felt necessary to advance a Bill in respect of unit trusts at this stage separate from a wider financial services Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to confess that I am disappointed about the way this Bill has been presented to the House; I am not just disappointed but I am almost appalled because this is an important Bill which provides for the regulation of a important part of our financial institutions, a part of our financial institutions which, although not exclusively limited to small savers, is one of particular interest to relatively small savers.</P>
      <P>The Minister has told us what is in the Bill.  In fact, he told us very little more than we can read in the explanatory memorandum but he has not said why the various options in the Bill have been taken; he has not said anything about the question of control, the involvement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the number of exemptions provided in the Bill, etc.  I find it most unsatisfactory that on a Second Stage debate, unless the Minister is going to give us more information in his reply, we are not given more of the thinking behind the choices made in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the need for unified control of the various parts of our financial institutions and financial services sector. I appreciate the need for the setting of standards, for the setting of criteria as to the operation of these various institutions, but I would like to know why the specific choices set out in this Bill have been made.  Some very specific choices have been made in the preparation <Col N="1443" /> of this Bill.  I quote from the Minister's contribution as follows:</P>
    <P>To take account of the situation facing existing and future unit trusts in the nineties, and moving into the 21st century, it is essential, I believe, to adapt our supervisory system to accommodate these new circumstances. I consider that the best way of dealing with this is to adopt an approach which allows for more flexibility in dealing with modern practices yet maintains fundamental principles of investor protection enshrined in the 1972 Act.  A less rigid approach will allow the supervisory authority to respond more rapidly to developments by using the powers devolved on them in this Bill.</P>
    <P>That may well be true.  It may well be the case that a less rigid approach would allow the supervisory authority to respond more rapidly to developments by using the powers devolved to him under the Bill, but the Minister has not shown that the less rigid approach is appropriate.  He has simply asserted that it is appropriate; he has not shown that it is appropriate.  He has not given us any assessment of how this less rigid approach is in some way to be preferred to a more rigid approach.  He has not indicated what other options there might be or, indeed, whether there are any, so that the House might be in a position to assess whether a less rigid approach gives us a better opportunity of satisfying ourselves in relation to the operation of unit trusts.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to assert:</P>
    <P>In addition I consider that this Bill, in updating our supervisory system, will, without any reduction in supervisory standards, enhance the attractiveness and competitiveness of Ireland, and the IFSC in particular, as a location for investment fund management services.</P>
    <P>That is a very popular and trendy thing to say.  It is very satisfying for the Minister to be able to say that this measure will mean that the International Financial Services Centre will work even better <Col N="1444" /> than it now seems to be about to work.  I have to say, if I may digress from the Bill for a moment, that I have rarely seen a more ugly group of buildings than those in the IFSC.  Whatever about the financial side, the physical planning of that operation has been appalling.</P>
    <P>The Minister is asserting that the provisions of this Bill, and the updating of our supervisory services, will enhance the attractiveness and competitiveness of Ireland, and the IFSC in particular, as a location for investment fund management services.  That is an assertion; he has not said how this enhancement is to take place and how this Bill will make us more attractive and competitive.  Are we to assume that because we will have what the Minister described as a less rigid approach, without explaining what it is, that we are somehow going to gain in competitiveness or attraction and, if so, why?  Will this less rigid approach be better than anybody else's or is it simply looser than anybody elses' so that there will be fewer constraints?  How does the proposed legislation stand in comparison with the approach adopted in other member states of the European Community or elsewhere &mdash; our financial services centre is designed to attract investment in from a much wider field than the European Community?  The Minister gave us no information on this. I have to say that the Government have made very little effort to show us why the options adopted in framing this Bill are the appropriate ones.</P>
    <P>I approve of the proposal to centralise the control, the monitoring and supervision of unit trust operations in the hands of the Central Bank.  I have long believed that we need unified control in the financial services sector here.  It has been clear to me for quite some time that some of the less desirable things which have happened here in the last three years have been due partly to the fact that we have had a fragmented approach to the control of financial institutions and deposit-taking institutions.  Contrary to Deputy Taylor's view, I am very much in favour of unifying control in the hands of the Central Bank.  I do not see this in any <Col N="1445" /> sense as being a move by the Government, or any other agency, to shift responsibility.  I have to make the point that we have to allocate responsibility very clearly and make sure that that responsibility can be put into effect efficiently and properly and in a way that is desired and clearly specified in legislation passed by this House.</P>
    <P>If I may make the point, Deputy Taylor believes that some control must remain in this House.  I agree with this sentiment but the way to do it is to make sure that the provisions we make, by law, for the executive, supervisory and monitoring functions, the prosecution of breaches and the remedying of any deficiencies which might be there, are adequate and carry out the functions we want to see carried out in the interests of investers and of those in whose operations these funds are invested.  It is our job to make sure that the legislation is appropriate and that the bodies to which we entrust the operation of the legislation have the necessary powers and controls over them to do this.</P>
    <P>It is not our job as Members of the Oireachtas to be financial regulators.  It is not our job to be involved in any sense in the day-to-day supervision and monitoring of what goes on in our financial institutions.  I would have thought that the experience of socialist systems where legislators, to the extent that they are allowed to do anything, have a finger in every pie and as a result have failed abysmally to do it, would have shown that this is the wrong way to go.  As I am sure Deputy Taylor knows, there are far more financial scandals on a far bigger scale in socialist run operations &mdash; happily now becoming a thing of the past &mdash; than there ever have been in capitalist or private enterprise systems.</P>
    <P>As I said, I agree with the approach in this Bill to centralise and unify control under the aegis of the Central Bank.  I believe the Central Bank are the appropriate organ to carry out this kind of function. We need to have a consistent approach and this should go across the whole range of financial institutions.  I agree with all of those points but I cannot <Col N="1446" /> understand why the Bill provides for a continuing role for the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Quite bluntly, it seems that the Minister with the powers being given to him under this Bill &mdash; I will refer to this in a moment &mdash; could turn out to be a fly in the ointment.  It is not at all inconceivable that a Minister for Industry and Commerce looking at the situation might have very different considerations in mind from those which would motivate or inspire the Central Bank in carrying out their duties under this Bill, if we enact it.  Why should there be two different fingers in the pie?</P>
    <P>It seems our system of Government, if it is designed to do anything, is designed to produce a collective Cabinet view and if a Minister in a Cabinet with a particular set of functions has a view as to how financial institutions should be regulated, monitored or controlled that is a view of which he should persuade the Government and the Government should come in here and propose legislation to the House to give effect to it.  The provision in this Bill for the continuing involvement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce is going to produce rather a cumbersome system and could produce delays, and possibly even inconsistencies, in the way effect is given to the central objective set out in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are other areas in the Bill which are far from properly specified and the Minister has given us no real indication of the thinking behind them.  For example, section 3 provides for the keeping of a register.  It would be useful to know if the register of authorised unit trust schemes referred to in this section will include authorised unit trust schemes incorporated under the law of other member states of the European Community, as provided for in section 4, and the names of authorised unit trust schemes from any other country.  We have to bear in mind that financial services are increasingly becoming an international type of activity.  Not alone have we Europe-wide marketing of these instruments but world-wide marketing of them.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the authorisation of unit trust schemes set up under the law <Col N="1447" /> of other member states of the European Community.  Will this register include those unit trust schemes and unit trusts set up under the law of any other country outside of the European Community? This is important from both sides of the operation.  As has rightly been pointed out, unit trusts have proved to be a very useful vehicle both for individual investors and savers and for those &mdash; we should not forget this side &mdash; in whose projects, operations and properties unit trusts invest.  There has been a very useful development of the relationship between the saver and the investor, the doer, and the unit trusts have been a very important part of this.</P>
    <P>It is important from the point of view of the saver that the unit trusts have the maximum freedom and scope to ensure that they get the best results.  If that means giving them a free hand to invest elsewhere than in this country, then they should have it.  It is my belief that since we are rapidly getting away from exchange controls, this will increasingly be the case with unit trusts.  Perhaps the Minister will expand on that point.  This must be done in the interests of the small saver and investor who puts money into unit trusts. I would add that investors in unit trusts are not all small savers; there are some bigger operators in that area.  We need more information as to the scope of the register of authorised unit trust schemes provided for in section 3.</P>
    <P>Section 4 sets out conditions for the authorisation of unit trust schemes, but again we lack background information. The section sets out the kinds of things about which the bank must satisfy themselves if they are to authorise a unit trust scheme.  They must be satisfied about the competence of the management company and trustee.  They must be satisfied as to their probity and suitability to act as a management company.  The bank must be satisfied that the company under the scheme is a body corporate which is incorporated under the law of the State or any other member state of the European Community, with sufficient financial <Col N="1448" /> resources at its disposal to conduct its business and meet its liabilities and that it will be in a position to comply with any conditions imposed by the bank under section 5.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Bill provides for the authorisation of unit trusts incorporated under the law of other member states of the EC.  The section does not set out, nor has the Minister indicated, how the banks are to satisfy themselves in relation to all these conditions in regard to trusts set up under the law of other member states of the EC.  What means will the bank have at their disposal?  Will particular channels be laid down through which the bank must go to satisfy themselves?  Is there any concept of a body in any of the other member states whose word our Central Bank would accept in deciding to authorise these things?  Is any standard of proof or satisfaction to be suggested to the bank or laid upon the bank which they must achieve if they are to authorise a unit trust scheme?  If we go outside the member states of the EC, again the question arises as to how our Central Bank are to satisfy themselves in relation to the criteria laid down here before they can authorise a unit trust scheme.</P>
    <P>Section 4 also provides that a copy of the deed setting up the unit trust scheme must be deposited with the Central Bank. That applies to unit trust schemes set up under our law and under the law of other member states of the EC.  Although it is not provided for here, it would apply to unit trust schemes set up under the law of any non-EC country.  What provisions will be made for the depositing with our bank of a copy of this deed setting up the unit trust?  In spite of the fact that we live in the age of facsimile transmissions, there are many legal questions as to the validity of certain kinds of copies.  Are we to have a scheme which allows the bank properly to satisfy themselves but without creating so many onerous conditions that the provisions of this part of the section would be impossible to comply with or so unattractive as to dissuade other unit trusts from registering here?</P>
    <P>The intention of the Bill is certainly <Col N="1449" /> right in that the saver here should have access to the widest possible range of unit trusts.  Competition in this area is healthy and is good for the people in whose operations these funds are invested.  We must make sure that the competition is between firms we know we can trust and is not brought about in such a way that the conditions stifle competition by making it impossible for outside firms to operate in our market.</P>
    <P>Section 4 goes on to allow the Minister for Industry and Commerce to direct the bank to make any authorisation, subject to the imposition by them of conditions or requirements specified in his direction. It says they should relate to such matters which the Minister is satisfied, after consultation with the Minister for Finance and the bank, do not constrain the prudential supervision by the bank of a scheme.  It is not clear from the Bill, nor is it mentioned in the explanatory memorandum, why we should provide this power of direction to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Is it envisaged that there might be some conditions which that Minister might legitimately want to impose which would not be thought of by the bank or by the Minister for Finance?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is mentioned in only one instance in this Bill, where the hapless person has to agree with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the bank, about directions that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is allowed to give to the bank.  What conditions might the Minister for Industry and Commerce wish to impose in addition to those imposed by the bank? What might be the reason for doing this? If there is something legitimately to be demanded or required above and beyond the conditions set out here, why not provide that the bank can do it?  Either we are making the Central Bank the central authority for monitoring and regulating the activities of these unit trusts or we are not.  If we are, there is no point in having a second thought and leaving a residual power to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to stick his nose into this business and impose conditions <Col N="1450" /> which might or might not be otherwise thought of by the bank.</P>
    <P>How does all this sit with section 5? Section 5 (1) gives the bank fairly wide powers to impose such conditions for the authorisation of the unit trust scheme as they consider appropriate and prudent. In view of that, why have this power for the Minister for Industry and Commerce? Section 5 sets out all the proper concerns we should have in laying down the conditions.  Subsection (4) lists the various other requirements.  It puts an obligation on the management company and the trustee under an authorised unit trust scheme to comply with any conditions imposed by the bank.  Why is there this half afterthought which allows the Minister for Industry and Commerce to become involved?</P>
    <P>Provision is made in section 6 for an appeal to the High Court against a decision to refuse an authorisation of a unit trust scheme or against conditions imposed.  I would like to know whether that right of appeal includes a right of appeal against any condition set down by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and whether it includes a right of appeal against any condition required by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and imposed as a result by the bank.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with a change in name of an authorised unit trust scheme.  It is not specified in the section but may I assume that the provisions in relation to alterations would apply equally to unit trusts authorised under the law of another European Community member state or any others which might be authorised in the same way as they would apply to unit trust schemes set up under our law?</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with the prohibition of the sale or purchase of units of unauthorised unit trust schemes and certain like schemes.  It provides for certain exemptions. I would like to know &mdash; the Minister has not explained it &mdash; why there is an exemption for schemes linked with life assurance companies, companies incorporated under the Companies Act or by statute or charter, on building societies, friendly societies or industrial and provident societies.  Why is this exclusion <Col N="1451" /> made?  The Minister did not explain that in his speech and it is not immediately apparent from the explanatory memorandum and it certainly is not clear from the Bill.  Are there not dangers here?  Is it being suggested, for example, that a company, building society, friendly society or an industrial and provident society could in some way which is not open to unit trust schemes solicit funds from savers without being caught by the provisions of this Bill and, if so, are there corresponding provisions anywhere else which would give us the same standard of control, accountability and protection for potential depositors and investors which this Bill seeks to ensure for those who put their money into unit trusts? Why is this exemption there?  Is it entirely appropriate and are there not dangers arising from it?</P>
    <P>Provision is made for another exemption in section 10.  Subsection 2 (a) states:</P>
    <P>Whenever it is shown to the satisfaction of the Bank, in the case of a newspaper or magazine printed outside the State that, in the opinion of the Bank, has only a small circulation in the State, that compliance with this section would necessitate the production for circulation in the State of a special edition of the newspaper or magazine and that the cost of such production would impose a burden on the owner of the newspaper or magazine that would be unreasonably heavy in all the circumstances, the Bank may exempt from the application of this section advertisements published in the newspaper or magazine.</P>
    <P>Again, I would like to know why it was felt appropriate to include that provision in the Bill.  It may not be generally known but there are a great many newspapers or magazines with only a small circulation in Ireland.  There are indeed a great many financial newspapers and magazines which have, almost by definition, only a small circulation in Ireland.  I can tell the House that in the offices of any respectable stockbroking firm, investment broking or financial advice firm you will find <Col N="1452" /> copies of magazines that have a very limited circulation in total.  I dare say some of them may have a circulation of not more than ten or 12 copies in Ireland. They are marketing financial services and potential investments and therefore helping to solicit funds on behalf of financial operators of various kind not only in member states of the European Community but also in the United States, and in certain of the more balmy islands in the Caribbean and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I could readily see a situation where a number of such magazines would be held, under the provisions of this section, to have a very small circulation and where the production of a special edition for Ireland would impose an unreasonably heavy cost in all the circumstances as set out in the section, and we could find quite a wide range of potential investment and savings vehicles being offered to people here without there being the kind of supervision and control that this Bill sets out to apply.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to outline the reason that provision was made in the way it is and to state if he is satisfied that that exemption does not in fact go much further than appears on the surface and that he can happily exempt magazines which, as I said, almost by definition have a very small circulation; thereby reducing the protection to be given to the citizens of this country who wish to put their funds into these kinds of operations.</P>
    <P>There is of course a very general and much wider problem of supervision of financial operators and their activities. We have to satisfy ourselves that when we put regulatory mechanisms in place the agency to which we entrust the job have the ability and the resources to carry it out.  The Minister referred to this very briefly in his remarks this morning, and I quote:</P>
    <P>The consolidation of regulatory control for these financial services in a single supervisory authority will result, I believe, in a more efficient use of scarce resources and the ready availability of a pool of expertise should <Col N="1453" /> enhance the quality of supervision and help eliminate any gaps in the supervisory structure in this particular sector.  Such a supervisory authority will help ensure that the rules impact evenly on all institutions operating in this sector and allow for a more coherent response to developments, having regard to the rapid and substantial developments in financial services.</P>
    <P>If we could take that at face value I would jump up and applaud as I am sure would all the many potential investors and all the many advisers of potential investors but that is only an assertion.  The Minister is saying that this will result in a more efficient use of scarce resources but, mind you, he did not say which scarce resources he was referring to.  I assume that he means the scarce resources of the Central Bank.  He also said that it will result in the ready availability of a pool of expertise which should enhance the quality of supervision and help to ensure that the rules impact evenly on all institutions operating in this sector.  I do not know: they amount to assertions and the Minister is going to have to back them up.</P>
    <P>Question number one is, what scarce resources is the Minister talking about? Is he talking about the scarce resources of the Central Bank, and, if so, will the Minister give us the reasons he is satisfied that those scarce resources will in fact be better used in this way or are they so scarce that we need worry about their adequacy to do the job this Bill set out to give them?  The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>... the ready availability of a pool of expertise should enhance the quality of supervision.</P>
    <P>What pool of expertise?  Is it the pool of expertise in the Central Bank?  Is it the same pool that exists there now?  Is it adequate for the job it is doing now?  Will it be adequate to do this job when this Bill is enacted?  Is the Minister giving any consideration to the pool of expertise outside the Central Bank?  For example, is he giving any consideration to the pool of expertise available to the Garda Fraud <Col N="1454" /> Squad or to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions?  If not, I would strongly recommend that he now turn his mind to these issues.</P>
    <P>This Bill, as it must, sets out a number of offences.  If people running authorised unit trusts infringe the provisions of this Bill, they are guilty of an offence; that appears at several points throughout the Bill.  There is no point legislating to set up new regulations, the breach of which will be an offence, unless we will be able to prosecute in the event that offences take place.  We know, and many investors know to their cost, that there is a big question mark over our ability to prosecute offences committed in the handling of money on behalf of savers and investors. We hardly need mention cases. There was the Gallagher affair, mentioned earlier, in respect of which no prosecution has taken place in this jurisdiction. The liquidator in that case has said quite clearly that it is his considered view that the Garda Síochána do not have the requisite resources to deal adequately with this particular branch of white collar crime.  He has also said, in the clearest possible terms, that the Director of Public Prosecutions does not have the resources to deal effectively with this branch of white collar crime.</P>
    <P>We are setting up new offences under the provisions of this Bill.  Yet, all we are told by the Minister is that the ready availability of a pool of expertise should enhance the quality of supervision.  I am extremely sceptical about that.  In fact, unless the Minister has a good explanation and reinforcement to offer, I will be forced to the conclusion that I cannot believe a word of it.</P>
    <P>There is another case going on here, that of International Investors Limited, in liquidation, where as far as I can see &mdash; I will not mention names in this House but many Members will know what I am talking about &mdash; the case is being pursued through the diligence of one person in this jurisdiction.  That is not the ready availability of a pool of expertise of the kind about which the Minister spoke.</P>
    <P>Of course, I have to say that there have been other cases in respect of which <Col N="1455" /> difficulties have been extremely well dealt with by this House.  That has been because, fortunately enough, in the case of the PMPA and ICI, the House was able to deal with the problem, not by establishing new offences but by taking legislative action to deal with the problem, I might add, at no cost to the Irish taxpayer, something which has been overlooked in those cases in much recent comment.</P>
    <P>I want to make the point again &mdash; an extremely important one for this House &mdash; that there is no point in having elegant, steamlined, centralising legislation that creates at least the possibility of new offences if we cannot be sure that those offences, if and when committed, can be properly prosecuted, followed-up and the appropriate penalties applied.  It is not reasonable of the Minister to expect this House simply to accept the kind of assertion that he set out here about our ability to do all this without telling the House what these resources consist of; whether, in the light of the clear inadequacy of the resources obtaining, anything will be done to make additional resources available from whatever source.</P>
    <P>That sums up the series of questions I have about this Bill.  Of course, we must update our legislation.  Of course, we must have effective and, in my view, centralised control and monitoring of the operations of people involved in financial services.  To that extent I believe the direction of this Bill is correct, but there is too much left unsaid by the Minister, too much in this Bill remains unexplained for us to be able to take it without a very hefty dose of salt.  The Minister will have to be much more forthcoming in replying to Second Stage and in his treatment of Committee Stage debate than the Government have shown themselves to date before this House can be properly satisfied that we should embark on the course set out here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Green Party I offer my support to this Bill with certain reservations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1456" /> Deputy Taylor referred to the question of whether supervisory powers should be transferred from the Department of Industry and Commerce to the Central Bank.  I share some of his fears in this respect.  Nonetheless I feel that the balance of advantage lies with what the Bill proposes.  The Department of Industry and Commerce is a very amorphous Department, covering a wide range of issues, controlling a vast, varied area of activity.  It is my opinion that something as specialised as unit trusts would be better dealt with, as is proposed in this Bill, by the Central Bank which, while having wide responsibilities, are confined within a relatively narrow sphere.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill do appear to offer greater protection to investors in unit trusts than has been the case hitherto. That is very welcome bearing in mind that many of these will be small investors, in many cases people who will have invested their life savings in unit trusts.  There is one unsatisfactory feature of unit trusts in general, that is, they represents the abrogation of responsibility on the part of investors.  It should not be forgotten that shareholders still wield considerable power then they invest directly in companies.  For example, they can sell or refuse to purchase shares in companies involved in, say, the armaments industry, companies involved in chemical manufacture, companies supportive of repressive regimes, such as South Africa, companies that manufacture cigarettes and so on.</P>
    <P>Shareholders can and frequently do attend annual general meetings of companies in which they have invested and protest about some or all of the activities those companies carry on in their names. Let us be clear about that: if one invests in or is a shareholder in one of these companies one has to accept some responsibility for what those companies do.  There is no use in washing one's hands, saying: well, of course, that is a matter for the directors.  It is not just a matter for the directors; it is a matter for the shareholders because it is they who ultimately own and control the company.</P>
    <P>More and more responsible investors <Col N="1457" /> realise the need for ethical investment to endeavour to redress the many injustices obtaining in this world and out of a justifiable concern for the needs of this planet.  I would ask investors to examine their consciences, to accept that they must exercise discretion in their investments and not to be concerned solely with their financial implications.</P>
    <P>So far as unit trusts are concerned, I would encourage Irish people to invest in green or ethical funds which are readily available.  Some of these funds have outperformed the market so that, as well as enhancing their incomes, such investors play their part in ensuring the survival of this planet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to begin by thanking all the Deputies who have contributed in a general and constructive way to this debate. However, I must remind the House that the basic supervisory structure established under the 1972 Act has been essentially maintained under this Bill.  Apart from the transfer of the supervisory role from the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the Central Bank and the introduction of a more flexible approach to supervisory requirements, this Bill closely reflects the provisions of the 1972 Act.</P>
      <P>The 1972 Act was drafted and passed by this House at a time when unit trusts, as an investment vehicle, were at an early stage of development in this country and it is to the credit of the then Members of the Oireachtas that the provisions of the 1972 Act have stood the test of time remarkably well, having regard to the significant developments that have taken place in this sector in the interim.  Not alone that, they provide the basis, incorporated into this Bill, for the supervision of unit trusts well into the next century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said earlier, the two main changes in this Bill compared with the 1972 Act relate to the transfer of supervisory functions from the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the Central Bank and the adoption of a more flexible approach to <Col N="1458" /> authorisation.  The transfer of supervisory functions is a recognition that, in the complex business into which the financial services industry has developed, it makes sense that the statutory body already responsible for regulating other sectors of the financial services industry, and which has the necessary expertise, should be given responsibility for supervising unit trusts.  It should be borne in mind that the Minister for Industry and Commerce will retain reserve powers in relation to the authorisation, both initial and ongoing, of unit trusts under section 4 (2), (3) and (4) and, as a statutory requirement the Central Bank are &mdash; under section 20 of the Central Bank Act, 1989 &mdash; required to submit an annual report of their activities to the Oireachtas, including their supervision of unit trust schemes.</P>
    <P>The adoption of a more flexible approach to authorisation does not, of course, mean a reduction in supervisory standards.  The fact is that many different types of unit trust funds now exist which, because of their different characteristics, require differing degrees of supervision &mdash; a situation which was not envisaged in 1972 when all unit trusts in this country were of a similar nature.  This less rigid approach also allows the supervisory authority to adapt quickly to new developments.</P>
    <P>At this stage I would like to emphasise that the first layer of supervision in relation to unit trusts is that of the trustee who is legally obliged to look after the interests of unit-holders and hold the securities and cash of the fund on trust for the unit-holders.  The trustees must also make sure that the managers are operating the fund in accordance with the terms of the trust deed.  The trust deed is an essential, basic protection for the investors.</P>
    <P>The level of supervision of unit trusts, by both the trustee and the Central Bank, ensures that the public interest and the investor are adequately protected.  This Bill ensures that within that protective framework the unit trusts sector can develop and expand to international standards and enhance Ireland's standing as <Col N="1459" /> a location for investment fund management services.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank will be setting conditions or standard rules which will cover areas needing detailed provisions.  The Bill is intended to complete the adoption of a consistent approach to the supervision of this financial services sector. There are already analogous statutory regulations in place for UCITS and the Companies (No. 2) Bill, 1987 &mdash; of its passage through the Oireachtas is currently nearing completion &mdash; provides for a related area of investment companies.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill there will be no facility to limit investments to Ireland except in so far as prudential rules set out by the Central Bank will determine.  In the context of general EC rules in relation to liberalisation of capital movements and the freeing of exchange controls, it was decided to repeal this provision of the 1972 Act.  As we all know, times have changed dramatically since the 1972 orders made by the Minister under the 1972 Act have been amended in recent times.  Further amendments were already in the course of preparation.  These developments are reflected in the decision to repeal these provisions of the 1972 Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister make orders under that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In order to operate in the State, unit trust schemes will have to be authorised by the Central Bank.  These schemes will appear in the statutory register under section 3 of the Bill.  Foreign unit trust schemes will be permitted to market in Ireland only with Central Bank approval under sections 9 and 10.  The Central Bank will be enabled to impose conditions to ensure prudential controls, and control will have to take account of Ireland's international responsibilities. The Central Bank will be in a position to recognise adequate supervisory controls in the country of origin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte's referred to unit linked schemes.  These schemes are linked to policies of life assurance and are <Col N="1460" /> subject to separate statutory regulations. The Minister would have reserve powers to direct the Central Bank to impose conditions only in constrained circumstances where such directions do not constrain the prudential supervision of a unit trust scheme.  This is a precautionary measure.  Let me refer in that context to Deputy Dukes's contribution which in many ways was perhaps more directed towards Committee Stage of this Bill than the general provisions.  Any condition which the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in the context of this legislation, would impose on the Central Bank would then form part of the Central Bank conditions and as part of those conditions would be subject to appeal as is the case with normal Central Bank provisions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan's comments perhaps were more aptly directed at other areas of financial services and not at unit trusts which are a distinct form of investment vehicle.  Unit trusts are legal trusts and as such have trustees whose job it is to look after the interests of unit holders.  The trustee holds the case and securities on trust for unit holders.  The management company cannot get their hands on the assets directly.  There is no scope for abuse of funds either speculatively or fraudulently.  Since unit trusts were created over 60 years ago, no one ever lost money in any unit trust through fraud.  A number of Deputies have referred to this aspect and the question of who should assume responsibility in the event of such a development.  That experience should indicate the position to the House.  There are wider questions that could be answered in the context but they relate to other financial services areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to intermediaries, most investors deal directly with the management company of the unit trust, having become aware of it by advertising or solicitation.  However, if an investor who approaches through an agent intermediary deals directly with the management company after being <Col N="1461" /> referred, the money is paid direct to the management company and that company send certificates direct to the unit-holder. The scope for fly-by-night agents is, therefore, negligible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the somewhat unique structure of unit trusts, the question raised by Deputies in this respect is not particularly relevant.</P>
      <P>Deputy Durkan referred to the Conference of International Investors in the Irish Supervisory Regime.  I assure him that the Irish Supervisory Regime is on a par with the highest standards in the world and is one of the most advanced in the EC.  The confidence of foreign investors is reflected by the large number of international firms of world renown who have located or intend to locate in the International Services Centre.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dukes asked why life assurance companies, building societies, friendly societies, industrial and provident societies are exempt.  Deputy Rabbitte may have made the same point. These are supervised under separate regimes and, for that matter, the same exemptions apply as applied in 1972 with no change.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rabbitte also asked why USITS are excluded from the scope of the Bill.  Here again these schemes are supervised by the Central Bank under a separate statutory instrument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not ask why they were excluded but whether there was a conflict, whether the existence of USITS under these new regulations would be likely to attract a preponderance of funds, if there is a competitive advantage as compared with domestic unit trusts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>USITS developed because of the degree of harmonisation which has evolved in the community, and regulations governing those have already been put into effect.  Through this legislation we are bringing the unit trusts onto a more open playing field.  That is not to say that they will now have an advantage. <Col N="1462" /> It will give them at least an equal opportunity, in the context of these regulations, to compete for these funds.  To that extent they are in a considerably enhanced and improved position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">

      <P>Deputy Dukes referred to the exemption capability of the Central Banks in respect of foreign newspapers and magazines circulating in Ireland. Again that same provision was in the 1972 Act.  The Oireachtas found that this was quite acceptable and there have been no representations since 1972 to indicate that that provision was in any way unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>I think I have dealt with the main items raised during this debate.  Deputies have given exceptional consideration to the provisions and there has been a general welcome for the provisions contained in the Bill.  Deputy Taylor had reservations about the assumption of the responsibilities of the Minister for Industry and Commerce by the Central Bank but he, too, having listened to the contributions from all sides of the House, will understand the complexities and the changes that have taken place in international practices and the fact that in so many other areas relating to financial services the Central Bank has this regulatory and supervisory control and that it would be a step backwards to separate the responsibilities in that whole area by taking part of it back to the Minister and leaving the remainder to the Central Bank.</P>
      <P>On that basis I am assuming approval of passage of the Second Stage of the Bill and look forward to taking Committee Stage as early as possible, perhaps next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask one question before we put down amendments. I would ask the Minister whether it is illegal under European law to cause any specified proportion to be invested in the Irish market?  Is it illegal under European law to continue the provision that is in the 1972 Act?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

      <P>I would not like to give a definitive answer to that question beyond saying that international practice has changed quite dramatically since the passage of the 1972 Act.  If I find there is another dimension to this on which I can enlighten the Deputy further between now and Committee Stage I will be very glad to do so, but we are dealing in a very changed international scene.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The aim of this Bill is to implement the proposals which I devised earlier this year and which ended the rod licence dispute.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for the establishment of fisheries co-operative societies to raise and disburse for the public benefit, funds for the development of trout and coarse fisheries in the various fisheries regions.</P>
      <P>The structure and framework proposed is grounded in the principles of the co-operative movement and of local participation and local democracy.  It will allow anglers themselves through a democratic procedure to make the decisions on the best and most effective process for raising money.</P>
      <P>I am confident that this framework offers a solid basis for the development of trout and coarse angling.</P>
      <P>Most Deputies are aware of the detailed background to this Bill, namely the continuing need to put inland fisheries development on a firm financial footing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland possesses an inland fisheries resource which is unique in Europe.  Geographical considerations have endowed us with extensive natural waterways which are capable of sustaining large populations of fresh-water species and a combination of historical and economic factors has served to ensure that we have <Col N="1464" /> been spared the industrial and population pressures which brought about the demise of fisheries in more prosperous neighbouring countries.</P>
    <P>The potential for development of this indigenous self-renewing resource has been recognised since historical times in the case of the salmon fisheries which have been protected and developed by private owners over the centuries and by Board of Conservators since the 1800s with financial assistance and back-up from state authorities while salmon fishermen and fishery owners made contributons by way of licence duties and fishery rates.</P>
    <P>Trout and coarse fish were, however, for long regarded as the poor relation and were largely left to fend for themselves. There was no State licence duty and generally speaking neither fishery rates nor permit fees were paid.  For some time past however there has been a realisation that these fisheries have considerable potential for development both as a pastime for local anglers and as an amenity for tourist anglers from both home and abroad with very positive implications for income and employment generation.</P>
    <P>Pressure accordingly began to build up on central Government to establish structures to bring about such development and make Exchequer funding available. The first efforts were made in this direction in 1952 with the setting up of the Inland Fisheries Trust at the instigation of the then Minister for Fisheries.  This trust was intended to be a self-financing development body for trout and coarse-fish with a voluntary membership comprising all trout and coarse fish anglers and with the State helping out in the early years with priming finance.  However as the years passed the funds contributed in membership fees tailed off and the trust came increasingly to depend on Exchequer funding while at the same time calls were mounting generally for more public funds to be put into development work.</P>
    <P>In the reorganisation of fisheries administration which took place in 1980, the trust was abolished and the development of trout and coarse fisheries was <Col N="1465" /> entrusted to newly created fisheries boards financed for the most part out of public funds.  In an effort to attract increased funding from anglers a voluntary registration system was introduced whereby anglers who paid a registration fee (initially £5 per annum) were entitled to vote in the election of trout and coarse fish representatives on the various boards.  This charge was increased to £9.50 in 1985.  Nevertheless in 1987 the total contribution came to only £20,000 from a total of almost 80,000 home anglers and 50,000 visitors.</P>
    <P>The net position then was that whereas the State was annually spending around £5 million on services benefiting trout and coarse fishing, only a minimal contribution to financing that service was coming from the angling fraternity in whose interests the services were provided in the first place.  At the same time the same interests continued to seek more and improved services and yet more Government spending in an environment where drastic measures were having to be taken to curtail Exchequer borrowing and cut back on public expenditure generally.</P>
    <P>This then was the background to the introduction of the licensing system for trout and coarse fish angling from the beginning of 1988, to complement the licences which have been required for salmon angling since the middle of the 19th century and which yielded about £170,000 in revenue to the fisheries boards in 1987.  It was hoped to raise an extra £500,000 for inland fisheries development from these new arrangements.</P>
    <P>The system, however, met strong opposition in some parts of the State and fishing, including tourist angling, was disrupted in some areas.  Some communities were bitterly divided on the issue.  The system did not succeed in its objectives.  I was particularly troubled by the scale of the social division and bitterness which was engendered. Here I want to pay tribute to the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Daly, who strove might and main <Col N="1466" /> to resolve this conflict and dissipate the bitterness at that time.</P>
    <P>The programme for Government in July 1989 recognised that the difficulties in relation to angling licences were part of a wider issue involving the funding of inland fisheries development as an important national resource.  On coming to office at that stage I undertook in accordance with the terms of the programme a series of consultations and discussions with interested parties with a view to resolving the difficulties.  As this process advanced I became convinced that a totally new arrangement was required.  I felt that a system which would facilitate co-operation between all interested parties for their mutual benefit was the only realistic proposition if fences were to be mended.</P>
    <P>Eventually after many meetings with both those who favoured licences and those who did not favour licences I devised a set of proposals which were acceptable to those who had opposed the licensing system.  Most Members are no doubt aware that normal fishing activity took place during 1990 and that the disruption which disturbed the 1988 and 1989 seasons in some parts of the State was thankfully absent.  This Bill is aimed at implementing my proposals.  It provides for licences for trout and coarse fish angling to be replaced and for angling development co-operatives to be established in each of the fisheries regions. These co-operatives are to raise and disburse funds on fisheries development work of public benefit.  Anglers and others will be able to contribute to the co-operatives through the purchase of share certificates.  Certificates will cost £12 annual, £5 for 21 days and £3 for three days.  Holders of annual share certificates are to become ordinary members of co-operatives and are to be eligible, provided they live in Ireland, to vote in ballots and elections.</P>
    <P>Angling clubs and other bodies will be enabled to become corporate members of co-operatives.  No-one will be entitled to have more than one vote in any ballot or election conducted by a co-operative. The provisions for the integration of <Col N="1467" /> angling clubs into the structure and for recognising their role in and contribution to fisheries development is, for me, a most important element of the proposed new structure.  A central element of the opposition to the licensing system was that it did not acknowledge the major and valuable efforts of clubs in carrying out work for the public benefit and which is in many respects similar to that carried out by State agencies.  Indeed, this was a point also echoed to some extent by the many anglers groups who supported the licensing concept.  I am determined that this work must be recognised in a constructive fashion and that the new framework will foster and develop further the contribution made by angling clubs.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise that the title &ldquo;fisheries co-operative society&rdquo; is meant to reflect the spirit under which the co-operatives are to be established rather than any legal definition.  Purchase of a share certificate or membership of a co-operative will not confer any proprietorial rights on anyone.  I would hope, however, that the establishment of the co-operatives will introduce a spirit of co-operation, a form of comhar na gcomharsan to our rivers and lakelands.</P>
    <P>The concept of a compulsory licence to fish for trout and coarse fish caused difficulties for some anglers.  On the other hand the previous voluntary registration system was patently unsuccessful.  I have, therefore, decided to introduce an arrangement whereby the members of any co-operative in a secret ballot may decide to make possession of a current share certificate a requirement to fish in their area provided 60 per cent of those voting vote in favour of such a requirement.</P>
    <P>Each co-operative is to hold the first such ballot at the same time as the first elections of their management committees which are to be held at the same time as the next elections to the regional fisheries boards which are due to be held in December 1991.  Subsequent ballots on this issue may be held at times defined in the Bill.  A co-operative may at such <Col N="1468" /> ballots rescind an earlier decision provided 60 per cent of those voting vote accordingly.</P>
    <P>The Bill, in any event, provides for certain categories of people to be exempt from any share certificate requirement viz. persons under 18 and over 66 years of age; those in receipt of unemployment assistance or invalidity pension.  I propose to provide matching funds within parameters to be agreed with each co-operative for a limited period to encourage co-operatives to raise as much finance as possible through the sale of share certificates. Grants to societies are to be paid out of the Exchequer allocation.</P>
    <P>I propose to appoint trustees to manage the co-operatives pending the first elections of management committees. I also intend to have rules formulated for the regulation of the co-operatives which will ensure proper accountability in respect of all funds and that funds are expended in accordance with recognised fisheries management practice.</P>
    <P>In an area where possession of a share certificate is required to fish, this requirement is to be enforced by authorised officers of the relevant regional fisheries board acting at the request and on behalf of the co-operative.  The fisheries boards have a statutory obligation to implement the fisheries Acts and their position is being maintained.  Penalities for contravention of this law are to be related to annual share certificate changes i.e. not greater than ten times the annual share cost and subject to a maximum of £1,000. These I believe are realistic levels.</P>
    <P>Trout and coarse fish angling representatives on the regional fisheries boards are to be elected by the members of the co-operatives.  In order to be eligible to vote in these elections members will need to be ordinarily resident in Ireland and to have been co-operative members in each of the three preceding years.  I am providing, however, that for the purposes of the next election current membership of the co-operatives will suffice.</P>
    <P>I have decided that persons who reside in any part of Ireland should be eligible to vote in co-operative elections and <Col N="1469" /> regional fisheries board elections.  Inland fisheries is a matter of mutual interest to both jurisdictions and my Department, and the boards, have co-operated most effectively with Northern Ireland fisheries agencies over the years to protect and enhance the resource.  Persons residing in any part of the country were traditionally entitled to vote in elections of boards of conservators prior to 1980 and many people from the Six Counties continue to take a keen and constructive interest in fisheries in this jurisdiction.  I believe that my decision in this respect is a good practical means of extending the hand of friendship across the Border.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, licences have been required for salmon angling since the middle of the 19th century, and this arrangement is to continue.  There is general agreement among interested parties however that the categories of licence should be revised.  I propose to reintroduce district licences at a cost of £12 per annum.  I have also decided, in consultation with the salmon anglers, to introduce a juvenile salmon angling licence costing £8 per annum and a oneday licence costing £3.  These charges are all very reasonable.</P>
    <P>Some salmon anglers sought to have the benefit of these new arrangements during the 1990 season.  I was unable to accommodate them.  I have decided however that those who purchased annual licences for salmon angling in 1990 shall be entitled on application to a district or juvenile licence free of charge in 1991.  In effect the purchase of an annual licence for £25 in 1990 is to cover them for two seasons' fishing at district licence level.</P>

    <P>I set myself two goals when tackling this problem, the raising of revenue and achieving reconciliation among anglers. The settlement formula which I have devised has already enabled significant <Col N="1470" /> progress to be made in the restoration of normality in the angling sphere.  This Bill I believe lays the foundation to enable these aims to be fully achieved in the medium term.</P>
    <P>When the settlement proposals were announced I got the following four lines of poetry from Professor J. A. Richmond of the Department of Greek, University College, Dublin, two splendid hexameter/pentameter couplets.</P>
    <P>Excutiens hamos piscator harundine longa</P>
    <P>Praetor, laetatur, maxime, lege tua;</P>
    <P>Undique caupones tandem gaudere videmus,</P>
    <P>At trepidus fugiens &ldquo;uae mihi&rdquo; piscis ait.</P>
    <P>In prose, my pedestrian loose translation is &ldquo;The fisherman as he shakes out his hooks on a long rod rejoices very greatly at your law, O Praetor.  On all sides, at last, we see the inn-keepers rejoice but the fish, fleeing in fear and trembling, says `woe is me'.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In a burst of generosity I am giving a £20 Christmas book token for the best verse translation &mdash; open to all who work in Teach Laighin.  I may even get a practising poet to adjudicate.</P>

Unfortunately, three years ago, the legislation was rushed through the House and consultation did not take place.  The result was a fiasco and many people have emigrated because they lost their livelihood as a result of that dispute.</P>
      <P>The dispute as a result of mismanagement by the 1987 Government was unfortunate, many people went out of business, the banks and lending institutions moved in and the result was that these people had to leave the country.  Some who did not leave the country have been on social welfare since and many others barely survive in business.  The most serious result was that this occurred in areas where it is extremely difficult to get employment. Industrial employment cannot be attracted to these areas with the result that much hardship was created for young people and others for which the Government must be condemned.  This Bill is supposed to address these problems but it does not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill before us today is much worse than the one introduced in 1987.  It is more dictatorial and introduces greater State control than the previous Bill. No <Col N="1472" /> matter what way the Minister for the Marine &mdash; or any other Minister &mdash; attempts to camouflage the Bill it cannot be done.  There is an attempt to set up co-operatives but the Minister is introducing provision for major control of them.  They will be ministerial controlled co-operatives; he will implement regulations regarding the functions, membership, quorums at meetings and all the other details in relation to co-operatives.  As long as I can remember, co-operatives meant one thing &mdash; co-operation.  They were founded to foster co-operation among rural communities and to enhance the economic development of rural communities. If Sir Horace Plunkett could see this legislation he would regard it as a pale imitation of his aspiration in regard to co-operatives.  It is an attempt to couch ministerial diktat under the name of co-operative but it certainly is not a co-operative.</P>
    <P>For the past three years various Ministers have pretended to attempt to settle this matter but the end result is non-resolution of the problem.  A Bill has come before this House which is very dangerous and which could create a much more serious problem long term.  The performance of some Ministers in the past in relation to this matter left an awful lot to be desired.  It is unfortunate, after all the shenanigans, that they have not managed, between them, to come up with something positive.</P>
    <P>When the angling community in every nook and cranny of the country recognise this Bill for what it is, they will realise that they have been badly let down, particularly by the Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, who is in the House, and who has attempted to be all things to all anglers over the past number of years. The provisions of this Bill are very serious for anglers and the future of angling.  It is also detrimental to the future of inland fisheries.</P>
    <P>One of the major fears anglers expressed when the 1987 legislation was introduced was the principle of licensing and what it could confer in future years on the Minister in relation to the disposal of assets, inland lakes and rivers.  They <Col N="1473" /> felt that this was a mechanism through which the control could be sold by the Minister to private interests.</P>
    <P>The Minister is now forming societies or groups and attempting to call them co-operatives. However, these groups are only co-operatives in name and the principle of co-operative is not determined in this Bill.  The concept of co-operatives, which existed in the past, is not reflected in this Bill.  Co-operatives, in particular dairy co-operatives, with which we are familiar round the country, manage their own affairs, have their own meetings and control what they do.  They are the sole arbiters of their future and destiny. Under this Bill the Minister is the arbiter of their future destiny.  Under this Bill, the Minister will decide and dictate, he will make the orders and he has to have a full account, in detail, of everything that goes on.  That is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the Ministers concerned have not seen exactly what is going on.  More seriously, in the long term, these co-operatives could be subject to takeover and this could realise the worst fears that the anglers expressed in 1987 and 1988.  We know what happened in co-operatives in recent times in relation to takeover bids.  The same thing could happen with fishing co-operatives. Perhaps 20 years down the road a private enterprise could make a bid for an angling co-operative.  That is a dangerous possibility which defeats the purpose of the anglers as expressed in 1987.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, constituents of the Minister, Deputy Molloy, will be very disappointed when they closely analyse this Bill for what it is.  It realises all of their worst fears.  A fear in relation to the licence was that one could be apprehended while out fishing or <i>en route</i> to the lakes and rivers and asked to produce a licence.  They felt that this was an intrusion into their privacy and into the peaceful pastime of fishing. There is nothing in the Bill to suggest that they will not be asked to produce a share certificate, a birth certificate or an entitlement to invalidity pension or social welfare to prove that they do not have to contribute for a share certificate.  All the things that were feared in the past are being accommodated in this Bill.  The Bill is seriously flawed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill will do little for the future development of inland fisheries.  Where will the finance come from to fund the fishery boards?  The Minister said that those who had salmon licences last year will automatically get a share certificate in 1991.  How does the Minister propose balancing the amount by which the fishery boards will be short this year because <Col N="1475" /> of that?  What will be the function of the fishery boards in relation to this matter?</P>
    <P>Section 3 says that a licence under the Principal Act shall not be required for angling for trout or coarse fish.  It is interesting that the Bill does not specifically state that this section repeals the section of the 1987 Act which introduced the rod licence for trout and coarse angling.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with fisheries co-operative societies.  Everything is being done by ministerial order which can, at any time, be amended or revoked by the Minister. The co-operatives will be put together by the Minister and direction shall be given by the Minister.  In fact, everything shall be controlled by the Minister. The trustees shall be appointed by the Minister.  The Minister may make rules and regulations under section 5 and the rules shall deal specifically with the functions of the first trustees, the membership and functions of the management committee and so on.  In other words, this group of people will not be in a position to make their own decisions and impose their own rules and regulations. It will all be done by the Minister.  That is absolute State control.  The Minister can even decide by regulation on a quorum for the meetings.  As well as making regulations in relation to the membership he can make regulations in relation to the termination of ordinary membership.</P>
    <P>Where is the basis for co-operation which the Minister talked about in his speech?  I can see a situation where the people will be so tied up in rules and regulations emanating from the Minister that their reaction will be appalling.  One does not get co-operation by dictating but by working with the people to frame suitable rules and regulations.  Direction from a bureaucracy centred in Leeson Lane, Dublin, will not draw the best from the people in the West Galway area, Mayo, Sligo, Leitrim, Clare or anywhere else.  The people who will be affected are traditional anglers who know their neighbourhoods, lakes and rivers, and know what is required.  In the past they have made major contributions on <Col N="1476" /> a voluntary basis to develop their lakes and rivers.  Now the Minister will dictate how they should conduct their affairs. That is against the principle of co-operation. The Minister shall even make regulations in relation to the accounts and auditing of the accounts of the society and in relation to the granting of share certificates by the society.  The Minister may appoint two persons to the management committee.  The Minister then talks about liability and so on.  The trustees shall be appointed by the Minister and they shall be there until the management committee is first selected. The Minister has control over the management committee to a certain degree and is entitled to nominate members.</P>
    <P>There will be a combination of fishery board officials, Department of the Marine officials and somebody from the local club on the management committee. I envisage that that will happen as a result of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Ordinary membership of the co-operative society is dealt with in section 7. Ordinary members shall be the trustees appointed by the Minister and those holding a share certificate for the year 1991. Under the provisions of this section the Minister has total control; the Minister will make the decisions and issue the directives.  I ask the Minister to take the control mechanism out of this Bill.  This is unacceptable.  Co-operatives are not controlled by the Minister.  Co-operatives get on with the job and are not dictated to by any Department, be it the Department of Fisheries and Forestry or the Department of Agriculture and Food. This unprecedented legislation before the House will have long term ramifications and long term effects not only on fishery co-operatives, as suggested in this Bill, but on the entire co-operative movement. That is a dangerous precedent and one about which this House must be extremely cautious.  The Minister must recognise this and agree to accept amendments, or introduce his own amendments, which will change the fundamental structure of what is proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1477" /> Any angling club may become a corporate member in accordance with the rules of the society.  The corporate members of that club will pay X number of pounds for corporate membership and the ordinary members will become ordinary sharholders and will hold an ordinary share certificate.  Who will decide the number of people who will be accepted for corporate membership? Will it be 60, 100 or 120?  In section 8 we discover that the management committee will decide how many members would be accepted for corporate membership.  In other words, if there are 150 or 200 members in the Corrib Angling Club or the Cong Angling Club and if the management of a certain co-operative society decide that under the corporate membership claim they would accept only 50, what redress have the other members of that angling club in those circumstances? I do not see any opportunity to redress that situation.  They will not be able to say that every one of the members will automatically become members.  The managment committee will decide how many members would be accepted under corporate membership.  This is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>In section 8 (2) it is stated that any other corporate member shall be entitled to nominate, without fee, one ordinary member of the society.  What is the significance or the relevance of that statement? What exactly is meant by it?  An angling club can nominate one person to be an ordinary member of the society. What does that mean?  Where is the need for it?  What can be done about it?  It is rather strange and I find it extremely difficult to understand.  I do not understand the reason for it, the significance or the importance of it.  Perhaps the Minister would respond.  I put a question mark over the entire subsection (3) which states:</P>
    <P>in considering whether to grant recognition to an angling club or other body for the purpose of subsection (1) of this section or fixing the amount of a fee to be paid by a corporate member under that subsection particular regard shall <Col N="1478" /> be had to the outlay of the body concerned on work of public benefit in the area in which the society operates.</P>
    <P>Who shall have the particular regard for the outlay of the body concerned on the work of public benefit?  Who shall decide the value of the work of public benefit? Who shall put a monetary value on that work?  To what scrutiny shall it be subject? Is there a danger that the real value of the work being done by the anglers on a voluntary basis will not be fully recognised?  I should like to know who are the people who will be paying particular regard to that work.  Is there a danger they will not recognise the full value of that work?</P>
    <P>Section 9 states who is entitled to fish.  There are four categories &mdash; people who hold a current share certificate, people under the age of 18 years or over 66 years of age, people in receipt of unemployment assistance or social welfare and those on invalidity pension. These are people who would normally be entitled to fish for trout and course fish. While fishing on the lakes and in the rivers, will these people have to produce their share certificate if apprehended by a fishery board officer?  Will they be asked for their birth certificate, their share certificate or proof that they are recipients of invalidity pension or of social welfare benefit?  Is that not something which could happen under the provisions of this section?  This section is unacceptable and has all the inherent dangers about which anglers were originally concerned.  Now, three years after the first Bill was introduced we have rewritten in a more positive fashion those dangers in another Bill.  It is unfortunate that this has happened.</P>
    <P>In section 10 we find that an annual share certificate will cost £12, a 21 day certificate will cost £5 and a three day certificate will cost £3.  The real crunch comes in section 10 (2) which states:</P>
    <P>The Minister may from time to time by order ... alter any fee ... either without limitation as to time or in respect of a specified year or years, and any such order shall take effect at the <Col N="1479" /> beginning of the year following that in which it is made.</P>
    <P>The share certificate fees of £12, £5 and £3 are good on paper in December 1990 but in December, 1991 is there not a possibility that the fees could be £25, £10 and £6?  Under this section, the Minister has given himself the power &ldquo;without limitation as to time&rdquo; to increase the fee as he sees fit.  That is a very wide ranging power.  Indeed, the question I had in mind relating to fines was answered when I saw reference to a £1,000 fine or not less than ten times the annual fee.  We could be talking about a fee ranging from £120 to £1,000.  The figure of £1,000 was included to accommodate the Minister in the event of an increase in the fee as time goes on.  It is totally unacceptable that a Minister at any time can increase the fee as he wishes.</P>
    <P>If the Minister dictates what the price of the share certificate shall be the basic principle of co-operative legislation will be defeated.  This can have long term repercussions for the fishing industry, inland fisheries and the fisheries co-operatives as proposed in the Bill, and for all co-operative societies, I am telling the ICAOS to seriously consider this legislation because it could have fundamental repercussions for all co-operatives in the long term.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Priority Questions Nos. 1, 31 and 33 together.</P>
      <P>At the meeting of the Inter-governmental Conference on 30 November, the Secretary of State and I had a full discussion on the present prospects for political progress.  Our discussion was conducted in an extremely positive atmosphere; we are both determined, in so far as it lies within our power, to ensure that the remaining difficulties are resolved so as to open the way for talks involving the two Governments and the parties in the North.</P>
      <P>At the Conference, the Irish side conveyed various ideas which we hope might help to take the process forward.  In the light of our discussions, the Secretary of State will now seek further meetings with the leaders of the main constitutional parties in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Joint Statement issued at the conclusion of the Conference has been published and is available in the Dáil Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It was reported about a <Col N="1481" /> fortnight ago that the precise time the Irish Government would enter into the talks had been agreed between the British and Irish Governments last April &mdash; between the Minister and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland &mdash; and was confirmed at a meeting between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister the following day.  If that report is correct will the Minister indicate to the House what other difficulties lie in the way of the talks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that people should not get too hung up on the question of whether the two Governments have reached agreement.  Indeed, Mr. Brooke has repeatedly described himself as a facilitator.  Both he and I are acutely aware that even if the two Governments can reach agreement on a common position, progress is crucially dependent on the attitudes adopted by the political parties in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an interesting reply but it does not answer the question I asked.  Is it true that the British and Irish Governments reached agreement last April that the Irish Government could enter the talks within a few days of their commencing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be more participants than just the two Governments if the talks get under way: there will also be, of course, the parties in Northern Ireland without whom the talks cannot take place.  As I have said, people should not get too hung up on the suggestion of an agreement between the two Governments. Great efforts have been made by the two Governments to try to establish a framework within which talks can take place between the Governments, their representatives and the political parties.</P>

      <P>The Minister appears to be side-stepping the question I asked.  It was a bit naive of him to say that we should not be too concerned about what stage the Irish Government enter into the talks.  As far as I can judge from newspaper reports, the only delay in bringing the four parties together around a table is the decision on what stage the Irish Government can enter the negotiations. Evidently this is different to the proposal put forward by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to the Minister last April and agreed by the Irish Government. The Government were correct to agree to this reasonable proposal.  The position of the Official Unionists Party is that the Irish Government should only enter into the talks after substantial progress has been made.  That is totally unreasonable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The European Community is at present considering the question of the provision of humanitarian assistance to the Soviet Union, particularly in the larger cities, where the prospect of severe shortages of foodstuffs, medicines and other basic necessities of life looms large this winter.</P>
      <P>This was discussed in Brussels this week by the General Affairs Council. The Council decided as a matter of urgency to look at the questions of supplying and distributing food aid in particular with a view to further consideration by the December European Council.  Ireland strongly supported this decision.</P>
      <P>A decision on the Community's response will be made at the meeting of Heads of State and Government at the European Council in Rome on 14 December.</P>
      <P>No separate request has been made to Ireland by the Soviet authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Reports from some sources suggest that the problem is not the shortage of food but rather the infrastructure through which the food is distributed and the considerable amount of hoarding which is going on.  If this is so, can the <Col N="1484" /> Minister say if the European Community &mdash; who are probably in a better position than Ireland to help &mdash; can do anything that would help remove the bottlenecks in the distribution system?  I presume they cannot do anything in regard to the hoarding of food but can they undertake to give food?  I think this would be of help to President Gorbachev who could advise the Russian people to release the food which is being hoarded, on the basis that the European Community is willing to give as much food as is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Barry's perception of the situation is correct. Undoubtedly food is short in the Soviet Union.  They had a very good harvest but regrettably the product of that harvest is not finding its way to the shops.  There is supposed to be a thriving black economy in existence in the Soviet Union.  Help is required there.  The Deputy will remember that at the last Summit in Dublin in June it was agreed by the Heads of State and by Government that efforts would be made to see what help could be given to the Soviet Union to try to help them economically so that they could deal with the political problems which have recently developed there.  That is still our intention.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, the President of the Commission, Jacques Delors, was invited to submit proposals to the next Summit which will be held in Rome next week.  We had a preview of the President's proposals at the General Affairs Council Meeting which was held the day before yesterday.  The President will be making a number of suggestions to help in the immediate short term and also in the long term.  Very major decisions will have to be made because of the amounts to be involved.  The Deputy will, perhaps, understand this more than many others because he was involved in this area for a considerable period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an immediate problem in regard to emergency supplies such as medicine.  As Deputy Barry has pointed out, we have to overcome the practical problem of the inadequacies of the distribution system.  We all want to help but <Col N="1485" /> will do so only on the condition that the help we give is conveyed to the needy and not to the black marketeers who will enrich their coffers further.  We have been heartened by the recent efforts of the German Government who have released food supplies from Berlin.  They set up their own distribution system and were able to assure us no later than the day before yesterday of its effectiveness. This is being looked at.  As I have said, hard proposals will be put forward for consideration by the Heads of State and by Government at the meeting in Rome on 14 December.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to pursue this matter because the Community is probably pursuing the right line.  I want to repeat that if it is perceived that hoarding is part of the problem then people will hoard because they think there will be a shortage in the future.  If that fear of shortage in the future could be removed from their minds, the hoarded stocks might be released, which would be of some help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no quarrel whatsoever with Deputy Barry's view with regard to hoarding.  I totally support the thought behind it.  It will be a major element to be contended with so that we can ensure success.  Even in this country when we ran short of petrol people started hoarding despite all the advice.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">

      <P>Of course Deputy Barry had that responsibility at the time.  It is a human instinct.  The shelves in the shops are totally empty.  A parliamentary delegation was there last week and I have spoken to some of the members.  I was there myself two or three weeks ago.  It is a difficult situation but one we will have to address.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 4, 14 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>Under Article 25 of the Charter all member states are committed to accept the decisions of the Security Council in accordance with the Charter.  Ireland has always abided by its obligations under this and other provisions of the United Nations Charter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on 2 August, the UN Security Council has adopted a series of Resolutions under Chapter VII of the Charter.  The first of these, Resolution 660 of 2 August, made a formal determination that a breach of international peace and security exists.  It condemned the Iraqi invasion; demanded <Col N="1487" /> that Iraq withdraw immediately and unconditionally; and called upon Iraq and Kuwait to begin intensive negotiations immediately.  It also supported all efforts in this regard and especially those of the Arab League.</P>
    <P>Since then the Council has adopted a total of 12 Resolutions on the invasion and its consequences.  In the course of these Resolutions, the Council has imposed a wide range of sanctions on Iraq.  It has also decided that the annexation of Kuwait by Iraq has no legal validity and is null and void; and it has demanded that Iraq allow to leave all foreign citizens held against their will in Iraq and Kuwait.</P>
    <P>These Resolutions of the Security Council are unprecedented.  They are based on an impressive degree of unity on the issue within the international community and especially among the five permanent members of the Security Council, who include two of our partners in the European Community, France and the United Kingdom.  They have articulated clear demands directed to Iraq, a member state of the UN; and they have put in place a wide-ranging series of sanctions which all UN member states are obliged to support and which are designed to secure compliance by Iraq with the mandatory decisions of the Council.</P>
    <P>The most recent decision by the Security Council on the situation is Resolution 678 which was adopted on 28 November. This Resolution maintains all previous decisions of the Council and demands that Iraq comply fully with them.  At the same time it decides to allow Iraq one final opportunity, termed a &ldquo;pause of goodwill&rdquo;, to do so.  The Resolution goes on to authorise member states co-operating with the government of Kuwait to use all necessary means to uphold and implement these Resolutions and to restore international peace and security in the area unless Iraq, on or before 15 January 1991, fully implements the Resolutions of the Council from Resolution 660 onwards.  The Council also requests all states to provide appropriate support <Col N="1488" /> for the actions undertaken in pursuance of the Resolutions.</P>
    <P>Since this Resolution was adopted by the Security Council one week ago it has been announced that the US Secretary of State, James Baker, will go to Baghdad and the Iraqi Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, will visit Washington for discussions. The United States Government have made it clear that they do not see these talks as negotiations but rather as an effort to avert a war which, given the weapons and the build up of forces on the Iraqi side and on the part of various countries who have contributed forces to the region, could be hugely destructive and disastrous in its international political and economic consequences.  The hope of the Irish Government is that reason will prevail and that the crisis will be resolved without recourse to war.  I would therefore appeal to Iraq to use the pause of goodwill between now and early January to reassess its position and to consider how disastrous war would be for all it wishes to achieve for its people and for the region.  I would earnestly hope that, having done so, Iraq would comply fully with the decisions of the Security Council which, like all member states, it is obliged under the Charter to accept and implement.</P>
    <P>Since the beginning of the Gulf Crisis there has been close consultation between the twelve member states of the Community at all levels including the Political Committee, the Foreign Ministers and the European Council.  This consultation continues on a regular basis. While fully respecting and complying with all its obligations under the UN Charter and upholding the principles to which we are committed internationally, the Government will continue, in these and other international discussions, to urge their own very clear view.  That is that a concerted approach by the international community to implement the sanctions already in place and to oblige Iraq to comply with the decisions of the Council offers the best hope of a peaceful resolution of this extremely dangerous situation and the best way of averting the <Col N="1489" /> terrible dangers of a major conflict in the region.</P>
    <P>The Government also believe that the best way to effect the restoration of the right of our citizens trapped in Iraq and Kuwait to travel freely, as well as the best way of preventing war, is to adhere strictly to the EC and UN common approach.</P>
    <P>The majority of our citizens are now home.  We will not cease our efforts to secure the early release of all our remaining citizens in these countries.</P>
    <P>I have arranged for copies of Resolution 678 and the other resolutions passed by the Security Council on the Gulf crisis to be placed in the Library.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the information he has given to the House.  I do not want to be dismissive of it but it is public information which one can get anywhere.  The Government's position is based on Resolution 660 of 2 August which calls on Iraq to leave Kuwait and to restore the Emir of Kuwait to his throne. That was the controlling resolution until last Thursday.  Resolution 678 changes the position completely.  It is no longer a question of calling on Iraq to move out of Kuwait, although it must still do that. If it persists in the attitude it has held for the past four months, the Government will be faced with a different situation in that all states are obliged to uphold Resolution 678.  If by 15 January Iraq has not left Kuwait.  I should like to hear the Minister's views on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned very specifically that Resolution 678 incorporates the existing resolutions, in particular Resolution 660.  Therefore, the basic elements of the other resolutions are still there.  Of course there is a new and very important element in that action is sought within a six-week period.  All member states are obliged to accept that Security Council resolution and we do so.  Does that answer the question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has outlined the historical fact as I understand them. On 16 January next this country will be <Col N="1490" /> faced with an entirely different situation if Iraq has not left Kuwait.  Does the Minister agree?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I do.  I am still very hopeful that the situation will not arise.  Nobody wants war and everybody is working hard to ensure that in the remaining five weeks efforts will be made to resolve the crisis through peaceful means.  There has been a flurry of diplomatic activity throughout the world in an effort to achieve that.  Unconfirmed reports around one o'clock today may be regaraded with great hope.  The Deputy may not be aware of these reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Reports have come through that Saddem Hussein has directed Parliament to convene in Baghdad for the purposes of implementing the immediate release of all 3,000 hostages held there.  He has said, according to the Iraqi news agency, that he has no longer any reason for holding them and is sorry he ever held them.  He is sorry for the inconvenience and so on caused to their families.  Immediately after getting that news at approximately 12.20 p.m. we contacted our Ambassador in Iraq to see if that was so.  We are awaiting confirmation and as of now he is at the Foreign Ministry trying to get confirmation. We have been on to our colleagues in the Twelve and the United Nations to see if they have received any confirmation. There are some indicators which would lead us to being somewhat optimistic but, as Deputy Barry knows as well as I do, we have received so many reports from there and news briefings in the past which just did not stand up.  However, we are quite hopeful and taking this into account with other announcements regarding the need for peace in the region as a whole &mdash; the Americans now say they support the United Nations call for an international peace conference in the region &mdash; this will play its part in bringing about the much needed long term stability in the region.  One cannot just resolve the problems in that part of the Middle East <Col N="1491" /> region and leave the rest the way it has been for a considerable period of time. We will deal later on with other questions on the order paper on that matter.  I am sorry but I genuinely believed that Deputy Barry would have had that information. It is not confirmed and when it is we will give it to him with pleasure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland signed the fourth ACP-EEC Convention, subject to ratification, on 15 December last.  Before the Convention could be ratified by Community member states, it was necessary to conclude internal agreements on the financing and administration of Community aid under the Convention.  These were successfully concluded under the Irish Presidency.</P>
      <P>The Convention and the related internal agreements were laid before the Dáil in October.  A motion for approval of the Convention by the Dáil is on the Order Paper and I hope that it can be taken shortly.  The final procedures for ratification can be implemented as soon as the House has given its approval.  It is hoped that the new Convention will come into effect on 1 March next.</P>
      <P>The debate in the Dáil will provide the principal opportunity for public discussion in Ireland of the Convention. Other suitable occasions to promote public interest will of course be availed of; it was, for example, discussed during the meeting last May of the European Parliament's Developoment Committee. I might add that, on the Community side, the EC Commission has primary responsibility for disseminating information about the Convention.  I understand that publications in this regard are available from Commission offices including that in Dublin.  I cannot say with certainty if it is on today's Order Paper but, if not, it should appear.  As I say, I did not have the time to check.</P>

      <P>I certainly welcome the information that an opportunity will be presented to the House to discuss this very important Convention.  Indeed, I would hope that we would find time not in this session perhaps but early in the New Year, to have a very thorough discussion on the Convention.  Does the Minister envisage a discussion taking place, at EC Council of Ministers level in the meantime, or does he at this stage envisage a debate taking place in the Dáil before 1 March next?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would think that if there is agreement between the Whips we will have the debate before the end of this session.  Our Whip will be in contact with his colleagues to ascertain whether that is possible.  It would be desirable.  If we do not, then, having regard to the fact that there will be a time limit on us in the New Year, we would want to give it priority at the beginning of the year.</P>
      <P>There would be practical difficulties involved then because of budgetary agreements that will have to be sorted out by the parties. Of course, Lomé III continues until the implemention of Lomé IV.  Whether or not there will be discussions at the General Affairs Council on that between now and the time it might come to the House, I cannot really say; I would doubt it.  There is one more General Affairs committee meeting to take place on 18 December, the next one to take place in late January.  Therefore, I cannot really say.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, it is Question No. 13 on the Order Paper.  Surely the Lomé IV Convention has been agreed between the ACP states among themselves and then agreed between the ACP member states and the European Communities, that it is ratification after signature that is now at issue?  I think I saw that the French Presidency signed it in December 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>They would have signed it late in December 1989 on behalf of the EC because it was during their term of <Col N="1498" /> Presidency that the negotiations took place.  The Deputy will remember that in the run up to Christmas last year there was quite a flurry of activity in an endeavour to deal with the matter.  As of now, I understand that no Community member state has ratified the Convention to date&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>But it will not be going back to the Council of Ministers, which is the point I am making, that they have disposed of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I think Deputy Spring's question was whether we might have discussion on it.  That would depend on whether there was any element of it that any member state felt warranted some airing for any particular reason. This can happen and has happened before.  Of the 68 ACP states involved in the Convention, 26 have ratified.  As I said earlier, it comes into force on 1 March next provided that all the European Community states and two-thirds of the ACP states have ratified it but it cannot come into force until that happens. For our part I should say we hope to move very quickly.  Our Whip will be talking to the Opposition party Whips in order to ascertain whether we can make provision for such discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that we will be given an opportunity to debate the Lomé IV Convention in more detail. Can the Minister assure the House, in view of the additional resources required for Eastern Europe, there will be no danger of Lomé IV, or any future Convention between the EC and ACP countries, being bled of resources which would be allocated to central and eastern Europe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a legitimate question, one I welcome because it gives me an opportunity of putting on the record that there will be quite a difference between Lomé III and Lomé IV.  Lomé IV will last for ten years rather than five, as was the case with Lomé III.  Lomé IV will have significantly increased financial <Col N="1499" /> resources and new member states.  Any European Community aid for central or eastern European countries will not affect in any way what has been decided in respect of Lomé IV.  As I said to Deputy Barry, the final negotiations leading to eventual decisions on Lomé IV took place around this time last year before there was any agreement or discussion on financial aid for central and eastern European countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>No specific timetable has been agreed for the establishment of the proposed CSCE Parliamentary Assembly.  The recent CSCE Summit meeting in Paris approved in principle the establishment of such a body.  However, some delegations, notably that of the United States, took the view that further discussion of the field of activities, working methods and rules of procedure of such a CSCE parliamentary structure should take place at parliamentary level and involve the parliaments of the participating states.  At the Paris meeting the Spanish Prime Minister conveyed an invitation from the Spanish Parliament for a meeting of parliamentarians to take place in Madrid in the first half of 1991. If this invitation is accepted, this will provide the opportunity for further discussions among parliamentarians.  The Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the 34 CSCE-participating states will review the matter on the occasion of their first meeting as a Council, which will take place in Berlin in June next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have favoured both the creation of a new Parliamentary Assembly and also proposals that have been put forward that they should draw on the experience and infrastructure of <Col N="1500" /> the existing Council of Europe Assembly in Strasbourg.  While it would have a separate identity from the Council of Europe Assembly, we see merit, for a number of practical reasons, in drawing as far as possible on the experience of the Council of Europe and on its resources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from the Minister's reply that the Irish Government will now actively pursue the concept of a Parliamentary Assembly, as reported to us in the House last week by the Taoiseach? May I ask the Minister, strictly in his capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs, if he does not feel this House will have to develop a forum for discussing foreign affairs matters?  If a parliamentary tier or assembly, as proposed by the CSCE, is to be set up, if we are to be constructive participants, would he not agree that we will need a foreign affairs committee, and that in the absence of such a foreign affairs committee it would be quite pointless for us, as a Parliament, to offer to participate in the CSCE Parliamentary Assembly, as described by the Taoiseach last week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of Deputy Spring's question is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. In regard to the second part of his question, I certainly see from the way developments are taking place that there will be greater need for involvement of all parliamentarians in the issues that will come up for discussion.  I would welcome in this House, on a regular basis, whether that be forthnightly or monthly, opportunities to come into this House for a discussion in which all Members could participate and indeed also to oblige in the other House.  I would be prepared to do that.  I said this before and I mean it. It so happens that Foreign Ministers have a certain amount of travelling they must undertake.  If I cannot participate then my Minister of State or another member of the Government representing him will be glad to do so.  There is a need for all our parliamentarians to be fully involved. This was clearly seen when parliamentarians represented the group of countries involved at the meeting in <Col N="1501" /> Rome last week when we discussed European Community matters.  This is wider. This is CSCE with 34 participating states. We are talking about extremely important business.  I will give the House a commitment to come in here on a regular basis and have open discussion available to everybody on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>May I attempt to push the Minister somewhat further?  In so saying I want to compliment the Minister on having been forthright in all of the discussions that have taken place since he assumed his present office.  Could we give him one last push and endeavour to get agreement within the House for a foreign affairs committee, which would be the proper forum and which, I believe, would be of assistance to both the Minister and Department of Foreign Affairs, given the complexities and developments that have taken place worldwide?  There is no better man than the Minister to appreciate the amount of travelling, discussions and meetings that have to be attended from his experience over the past three years.  Therefore he will readily appreciate that this House and parliamentarians here could be of assistance and, I believe, would approach problems worldwide in a very constructive manner.  At this stage could we not seek agreement to set up such a foreign affairs committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will go even further than Deputy Spring and say that, if we can get agreement between the Whips to nominate a particular Friday on a monthly basis, we will ask Members of the Oireachtas who are interested to participate in such discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would clarify one point he made in the course of his reply.  By the way, I wrote to the Taoiseach six or eight months ago &mdash; and despite two reminders I have not had a reply &mdash; suggesting a formula for the establishment of a foreign affairs committee of this House.  Perhaps the Minister might prod him to reply to me.  I understood the Minister to say that he thought the most suitable body to be the <Col N="1502" /> Parliamentary Assembly of the CSCE might be the Council of Europe.  I do not know whether he means the actual members or the physical building?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mean the building because one can get a building anywhere. As I said, the Government favour involving the Council of Europe as far as possible in the new CSCE Parliamentary Assembly.  Along with our partners in The Twelve we will put forward proposals to that effect.  However, it is a matter that will have to be considered by parliamentarians and, subsequently, by the Foreign Ministers of the 34 participating states.  Since consensus will be required, as I have said already in reply to Deputy Spring and since there is opposition in some quarters to the idea, I am not in a position to assure the House that the new body will be linked to the Council of Europe.  We are using it as an exceptionally useful model.  There is a wealth of knowledge and experience there that would benefit the entire process.  I think everybody would agree with that. However, there are some problems to be resolved.  Perhaps when we get an opportunity of discussing this again at EC ministerial level in June next some of the problems may have been resolved in the meantime.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Although Ireland has always taken a deep interest in developments in Central America, we have concentrated our bilateral aid effort in the poorest part of the world and that with which we have the strongest traditional links, namely sub-Saharan Africa.  The current budgetary position precludes us at present from extending this general focus to include Central America. However, we have in the recent past assisted projects in Central America, through our co-financing scheme with non-governmental organisations.  Allocations are decided, both for the co-financing scheme and disaster relief funds, on the basis of the merits of <Col N="1504" /> individual applications.  Of course, Ireland, as a member state of the EC, will continue to participate in all EC aid programmes to Central America.</P>
      <P>In hoping to see a lasting peace established in Central America the Twelve have been guided by the principle that it is primarily for the countries of the region themselves to find a solution to the region's problems.  The Twelve have consistently given all such efforts their political and practical support.  With regard to the present situation in El Salvador, Ireland and its partners in the Twelve unreservedly support the efforts of the UN Secretary General in seeking to promote internal negotiations.  A successful conclusion to these negotiations could lead, we believe, to democracy, reconciliation and respect for human rights in El Salvador.</P>
      <P>The extent to which the UN has been able to facilitate a similar initiative in Nicaragua is a source of encouragement to us.  While problems still remain, the demobilisation of the Contra forces in Nicaragua, in accordance with the agreement of 18 April 1990 between the Nicaraguan Government and the Contras, was carried out in a peaceful manner and completed on 29 June 1990, as reported on that date by the Secretary General of the United Nations.</P>

I have regard to <Col N="1505" /> the overall assessment of the Secretary General and I see no reason to question same.  The Deputy will also be aware that Nicaragua has been through several years of disturbance and violence and it cannot be expected that all problems will be settled at once.  However, the Government, with the support of the international community, are making every effort to reduce the outstanding difficulties.</P>

      <P>The Minister says that as far as the UN report is concerned there are now no Contra operating in Nicaragua, but a report exists of them having intervened.  I have the details here somewhere.  I can pass it on to the Minister in any event.  They intervened with weapons in a strike in recent months.  It is clear they are still active and some action needs to be taken to disarm them. Will the Government take any steps to raise that matter with the UN?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not disagreeing with the Deputy.  There is a small group who are still armed.  The intention is that they be disarmed as quickly as possible because as long as they are as they are they are a source of trouble.  We hope that efforts to complete this task as quickly as possible will be successful.</P>

      <P>In view of the Minister's reply and his reluctance to take on any further bilateral arrangements with any countries other than we are dealing with now, will he look at the ODA budget for 1991 and try to increase the co-financing section of that budget to allow the nongovernmental agencies working in Central America to upgrade their projects there and to assist, particularly in Nicaragua, with the growth of democracy?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, due to the budgetary situation expenditure on official development assistance programme has been reduced since 1986.  Recent OECD figures show that the countries with the lowest annual GNP <i>per capita</i> are mainly situated in Africa, in particular sub-Saharan Africa. <Col N="1506" /> I am satisfied that the choice to prioritise our bilateral aid efforts in this area is the correct one.  Furthermore we are committed to our programme in our four priority countries &mdash; the Sudan, Tanzania, Zambia and Lesotho.  This is budget preparatory time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 34 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The distinction between security and military defence is already well recognised in the European Community.  The Single European Act adopted in 1985 states in Title III, Article 6 (a), that the parties consider that closer co-operation on questions of European security would contribute in an essential way to the development of a European identity in <Col N="1507" /> external policy matters, and are ready to co-ordinate their positions more closely on the political and economic aspects of security.  Article 6 (a) states that nothing in Title III shall impede closer co-operation in the field of security between certain of the parties within the framework of the Western European Union or the Atlantic Alliance.  This formulation acknowledges the distinction between the political and economic aspects of security and other aspects of security, including the defence or military aspects, which for many members of the Community are dealt with in WEU and NATO.  All the members of the Community subscribed to the Single Act.</P>
    <P>The distinction drawn in the Single European Act was not new.  The report on political co-operation adopted by the Foreign Ministers of the EC member states in London in 1981 recognised the flexible and pragmatic approach which had made it possible to discuss in political co-operation certain important foreign policy questions bearing on the political aspects of security.</P>
    <P>The question of future security arrangements is one which will be considered within the EC by the Inter-Governmental Conference on Political Union which will open in Rome on 15 December.  As the Taoiseach told the Dáil on 1 November, the position of the Government is that if the Community were at some stage to embark on arrangements for its own security and with its own security concept.  Ireland as a fully committed member would be willing to consider participation.  Various views and proposals have been put forward as to what the member states should commit themselves to in this area.  While discussions are still at a preliminary stage, it is clear that some member states wish to maintain the distinction between security policy in the broad sense and defence policy, which so far as they are concerned should continue for the time being to be dealt with in WEU or NATO.  Negotiations on the precise content of any security commitment will be for the IGC. I have already suggested some areas <Col N="1508" /> which it might include, over and above those already in the Single European Act &mdash; disarmament, and protection of the Community and its citizens against international terrorism.</P>
    <P>As to the CSCE, this process is, as its name implies, concerned with both security and co-operation.  Security in this context has a much wider connotation than purely military defence; it covers a whole range of areas and activities, including disarmament, confidencebuilding and measures at the political level.  Hitherto, negotiations on disarmament questions have been carried on directly between the two alliances. However, it was decided at the Paris Summit that, following a period for national preparations, there should be a more structured co-operation among all participating States on security matters. Discussions and consultations will take place among the 34 participating States aimed at establishing by 1992, from the conclusion of the Helsinki follow-up meeting, new negotiations on disarmament and confidence and security building open to all participating States. The Government have welcomed these developments.  We see the agreements which have already been reached in the CSCE framework on conventional armed forces reductions and confidence and security building measures as an important element of the CSCE process as a whole.</P>
    <P>I should perhaps point out to Deputy Spring that when the Taoiseach, in reporting to the Dáil on the CSCE Summit, referred to the distinction between security and military defence it was in the separate context, of a reference which he made to the forthcoming Inter-Governmental Conference of the Twelve on Political Union.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the Minister's detailed and well informed reply. My question was put down as a consequence of the Taoiseach's statement last week and directed to the Taoiseach in the first place, but I am very glad we have the opportunity to discuss it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of things spring to mind. <Col N="1509" /> It is obviously of paramount importance that a very detailed discussion takes place in this House in relation to the many difficult and wide concepts which the Minister has been elaborating on.  It is not a matter that can be dealt with by adopting simplistic stances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Or even by statements across the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>That was perhaps one of the most comprehensive replies we have had on these difficult areas.  Perhaps the Minister has answered my query in his previous reply and we may have a facility in this House to explore the many difficult concepts and distinctions between security and military defence.  Will the Minister for Foreign Affairs, at this stage, give us his view as to how Ireland's neutrality, and the traditional concept of our neutrality, will stand in relation to the discussions that will take place in Rome this month?  As the developments are taking place will the Minister say whether the Government are preparing to bring to this House a document or a discussion paper in relation to Ireland's tradition of neutrality as events are developing at the present time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Spring and Barry for what they have said.  It is a very complex area and we would all benefit from much discussion on it.  I will play my part here too because it would be helpful to all of us.  It will be particularly helpful as the IGC gets under way and when it comes to decision-making time it would be only natural that we would all want to be fully informed as to where we are going and what we are considering. Let us have discussions on the options then.  I can see the value of that and that it is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach and I have both made it clear in the Dáil that we do not see a common security policy for the Twelve as being a new military alliance of the kind which has been in existence in Europe for the last 40 years.  The developments of the last year in central and Eastern Europe and the success of the <Col N="1510" /> negotiations within the CSCE framework has created a new security situation characterised by the removal of the threat which marked the last 40 years in Europe. Any common security policy or security commitments which the Twelve adopt must take account of this new situation. This is one of the matters that has to be discussed at the Inter-Governmental Conference on political union. Obviously, none of us could truthfully even make a stab at what might come out of the Inter-Governmental Conference. We had a very long discussion on this matter in the General Affairs Council in Brussels the day before yesterday.  We had before us the Italian Presidency analysis of the discussions that have taken place to date on the IPU.</P>
    <P>At this stage, if I am not taking up too much time, I would like to say a very special word of thanks and appreciation to the Italian Presidency for progressing this issue as far as it has come in the shortest possible time.  Please remember it is only a matter of months, some time around 19 May, since we were trying to get people to tell us what their concepts were, their beliefs and what they were talking about.  Now we have that Italian Presidency photograph, as it were.  It is blurred.  It must be.  It is difficult to pick out some of the people in it, as it were. We also have a report in great detail from the personal representatives of the Foreign Ministers who were involved in all of the discussions on this issue up to now.  Basically what they have been trying to do is clarify as much as they can, not pre-empt any decisions, not offering any options and not making proposals in any way.  That is a good document.  Those two documents will go to the Heads of Government and States in Rome next week before the IGC.  It was agreed in Dublin too that the IGC will set its own agenda too, and that is very important.</P>
    <P>With regard to views, member states have different views on many things but everybody's views are in there.  Some members have changed their positions considerably from the very beginning.  It was very easy last March to have grandiose statements coming from leaders within <Col N="1511" /> the Twelve.  That is their privilege.  It is, however, the poor Foreign Ministers who have to try to get the nuts and bolts of these things down on paper and on the table to see what we are talking about. We have done that, and with difficulty, and it is thanks to the Italian Presidency that we have come this far.</P>
    <P>It is only when we really start teasing out where we are going that we will know what is on the table and, as far as we are concerned, we will want very precise definitions and not vague references with regard to any positions being considered, and we will work to that end.</P>
    <P>Obviously, it will be very slow.  This great leap into the dark that we were told to take by one or two people in this House last May is not what is happening any more.  We were told this was the only way to do it but we are being cautious and safe and we are moving things along step by step because of what is involved.  That is very important.</P>
    <P>We have to have respect for the different points of view held by others.  Some of our colleagues in the Twelve are insisting that the military defence will be looked after within WEU and within NATO.  We say in regard to the security element of the new Community that if it is being worked out for the Twelve, within the Twelve, and only by the Twelve, we are prepared to sit down and discuss that with them.  That is our basic position as of now.</P>
    <P>It is early days.  Soon we will see things clarified with the IGC.  The IGC will move fast.  That they must do because there is a commitment that they finish by 1992.  There is also another timetable, the European parliamentary elections are coming up in 1994.  To come back from 1994, as we must, we see the amount of time we have left to do our business.  If we are to be ready for 1994 we have to prepare for a referendum and allow time for it.  We will have debates in the House and legislative proposals for it so time will go fairly fast.  Within the time available to me I have given as clear a picture as I can.  This is a matter I am prepared to <Col N="1512" /> come back to whenever the opportunity arises.</P>

      <P>I will call Deputy Barry, Deputy De Rossa and finally Deputy Spring.  This is a very important question and we have devoted a long time to it, to the detriment of other questions I had hoped to deal with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the Government going to submit a paper to the Inter-governmental Conference?  I understand that seven or eight countries have already done so.  Does the Minister appreciate the difficulty of this house in the matter? Normally legislation comes before this House and it does not become law until it is finally thrashed out.  I know that in theory any amendments to the treaties will not become law until they have been ratified by this House, but that is after the Government and the Taoiseach have made decisions that are far-reaching &mdash; in some cases they have been made by majority vote while in other cases by unanimous vote &mdash; without us as parliamentarians having an opportunity to discuss what they are doing.  Not even Government backbenchers will have an input into the matter.  Only members of the Government will have a say.  The rest of us parliamentarians who are elected by the people&mdash;that includes the European Parliament also &mdash; will have no say apart from the advice we gave last week, which is totally different.  We have no specific document on which we can argue each line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief because of time restraints.  I am not telling the Deputy anything that Deputy De Rossa would not tell him.  The European Parliament are involved in the two Inter-governmental Conferences.  Yesterday morning we had a long session between representatives of the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council of Ministers on procedures, whereby we have an input from the Parliament through its President and the Leaders of its parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise fully, as a parliamentarian, <Col N="1513" /> the case made by Deputy Peter Barry, and again I repeat the offer I made to Deputy Dick Spring.  I recognise that this is important because when we so decide in this House we must go to the people of the country for approval.  I would not want to put any obstacles in our way in looking for that approval at a particular time because then it would be too late. There is a duty and a responsibility on the Government to try to get as much help as possible from all parties in this House on this issue.  I mean what I said earlier to Deputy Dick Spring &mdash; I will come into the House to discuss the matter but it is a little early yet because we have not even started the negotiations.  The same applies to Deputy Barry's comment on a white paper.  It is likely that we will publish a white paper and obviously we would want the view of the House on it. We have to go to the people for approval of our actions here, and let us do it properly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to raise a number of points.  I suggested to the Taoiseach more than six months ago that it would be worthwhile to publish a white paper on the whole development of Irish-international relationships and how we viewed our international relations in the new position that was developing <i>vis-à-vis</i> Eastern Europe, European Community political union and so on.  The Taoiseach pointed out that he thought it was too soon to publish a White Paper because things were happening so fast at that time that it might be dated before it was published.  The pace has slowed to some extent and it would be important if we had a document from the Government outlining their views on the matter. It is in that sense that we can make a contribution as to whether we agree or disagree or we can make alternative proposals. I would see a necessity for a white paper or discussion document, call it what you will, which would deal with the broad issue of international affairs and not just the question of political union, which obviously has very wide-ranging implications also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the most urgent matter at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, indeed.  In relation to the CSCE, the United Nations and the European Community &mdash; three important bodies of which we are a member and all of which we have commitments to &mdash; how does the Minister see the relationship between these three bodies developing, particularly from the point of view of security, because there are security implications in all&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Deputy repeat the bodies concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The CSCE, the United Nations and the European Council of Ministers, the EPC in other words.  There are clearly overlapping responsibilities here.  I expressed concern <Col N="1515" /> in recent weeks about the way international relationships have changed.  We are now in a sitution where the United Nations Security Council take decisions, and the whole veto system is based on the old Cold War relationships.  We need to look at what our relationship is to the United Nations and to decisions taken at that level on security matters.</P>
      <P>Finally I would suggest to the Minister that if he is going ahead with setting aside a Friday for discussions, we need to change the debate procedures in the house if we are to have an adequate discussion. They should be changed for that day at least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The main question Deputy De Rossa has asked me is one that would require a considerable reply and I do not think it is one I should give by way of a supplementary answer.  I will come back to it and I will be glad to answer it.  Of course, Deputy De Rossa is correct when he says that the old order has changed and we are all thankful for that.  Even within the Security Council of the United Nations, it is obviously something that must be considered.  It will not be easy to bring about change. One could ask why India with almost 900 million people, Japan with 100 million people, and one of the major economic forces in the Group of Seven, or Brazil which is the fifth largest country in the world are not members of the Security Council.  What about the new Germany? Why should Britain and France be members?  It is easy to ask the questions but it is not as easy for me to give the answers.</P>

      <P>I have no doubt that if the worst scenario were painted following the passing of Resolution 678 by the Security Council we could very well find ourselves in a position that none of us want.  There could be an all-out war, and nobody has any idea where it would stop &mdash; I do not mean timewise.  If Israel was brought into that War, if Saddam Hussein turned his nuclear might on Israel, would that not change the whole geography of the scene that is operating at present in the Gulf under this international coalition?  Would we not have a holy war as it were?  That is a possibility but I hope I am wrong.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barry very rightly pointed out the enormous importance of that resolution. All I am saying is that we hope there will not be a war &mdash; I am speaking on behalf of everybody in the House. Steps have been taken in the last 24 hours and decisions have been made.  There is US support for something that we have been hoping for for a long time.  I say a very sincere thanks to President Bush and Secretary of State Baker for what they have done.  They have been dealing with that problem for only about one year, since November 1989, but it was there during the eight years of the previous administration and no progress was made on it.  I sincerely hope we will make movements there.  We play our part too because we are still part of the European Community Troika.  On Tuesday morning next, we will have a ministerial meeting with the Arab League, presided over by Mr. Kaddoumi of the PLO.  The purpose of our meeting is to see how we can maintain international focus of attention on that issue.  It is so important that we could not afford to let it slip to the back burner.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister take into account the type of discussions he has with Members of the European Parliament, for example?  There are smaller meetings during presidencies and private discussions and question and answer sessions are held with various parliamentarians which, I am sure, are fruitful and helpful.  The Minister and other contributors have said that the <Col N="1518" /> whole political map has changed beyond our wildest dreams in the last number of years.  Apart from the present frightening situation in the Gulf, most of the changes have been positive from 1986 onwards in relation to the Cold War, etc.  In his detailed response to my first supplementary question, the Minister covered many positions but I have one fear which I should like the Minister to allay.  I do not want to appear glib in relation to saying that we have certain cornerstones regarding our foreign policy but I should like the Minister to avoid using the expression &ldquo;traditional Irish neutrality&rdquo; which means different things to different people and which is long overdue for discussion in this House. Will the Minister say how he sees our neutrality in the context of the discussions taking place because, as he said, decisions are being made?  He said: &ldquo;The poor Minister for Foreign Affairs has instructions to get things done.&rdquo;  How does the Minister see Ireland's neutrality&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Quest>if it is proposed to establish any court or any other adjudicating mechanism to decide on cases of dispute where citizens of member states of the CSCE feel that the rights granted to them under the Charter of Paris and earlier declaration of the CSCE, have been denied in practice.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Charter of Paris, in common with other CSCE documents, is not a legally binding document although signatory states have undertaken a political commitment to abide by its provisions. The question of judicial interpretation of the provisions of the Charter of Paris does not, therefore, arise and it is, therefore, not proposed at present to establish a court of the type outlined by the Deputies.  There has, however, already been some progress in the CSCE framework in the development on adjudicating mechanisms between states in relation to human rights and there are prospects that these may be developed further to involve individuals.</P>
      <P>The Vienna Concluding Document, adopted in January 1989, contains provisions, known as the human dimension mechanism, whereby a participating state can raise with another state cases and situations where there is reason to believe that CSCE human rights commitments have been violated.  On a number of occasions, these provisions have been invoked in relation to cases involving specific individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1520" /> The Paris Charter contains a commitment to expand this mechanism to include new procedures involving, <i>inter alia,</i> the services of experts or a roster of eminent persons experienced in those human rights issues which could be raised under the mechanism.  There is also a commitment to make provision, in the context of the mechanism, for individuals to be involved in the protection of their rights.</P>
    <P>The participating states have undertaken to develop further their commitments in this respect, in particular at the Moscow Meeting of the Conference on the Human Dimension which will take place from 10 September to 4 October 1991.  This development will be without prejudice to obligations under existing international instruments to which these states are parties.  The Government favour the expansion of the mechanism, and will work actively to this end.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I was trying to elicit from this question that the declarations on the CSCE were not merely declarations but that machinery will be put in place for a follow-through in relation to the decisions being taken so that they will not be just laid on the table and then forgotten about.  I hope the Minister's reply means that there will be some form of mechanism where people who feel aggrieved under various declarations can seek redress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Barry for his remarks.  The Government support the strengthening of means of ensuring that CSCE commitments undertaken in the field of human rights are fully implemented.  With our colleagues and partners in the Twelve, we will consider how best this can be achieved by putting suitable proposals to the Moscow meeting which I have already mentioned.  As the CSCE commitments are not legally binding and not drafted in legal terms, I foresee difficulties in attempting to establish a court to interpret them.  However, that does not mean we cannot strive for the type of mechanism about which we are talking.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I had been dealing with section 10 and the cost of share certificates.  Section 10 (2) concerns me because it gives the Minister power to make an order at any time to increase the cost of the share certificate.  The Minister can increase the cost by 50 per cent, or 100 per cent or whatever he likes.  This is contrary to the usual mechanism of the co-operative society.  The Minister will make the decision rather than the co-operative which hopes to raise finance for their area.  The co-operative would have a better idea what money is needed to do the necessary work so it would be better if they decided on the increase rather than the Minister.</P>
      <P>Section 11 deals with the voting rights and the ordinary rules that apply to ballots apply here.  Section 11 (3) says:</P>
      <P>A person, who is otherwise eligible, shall be entitled to vote if, but only if, he is ordinarily resident in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the definition of &ldquo;ordinarily resident in Ireland&rdquo;?  What category of people will be classified as &ldquo;ordinarily resident in Ireland&rdquo;?  Are emigrants who are forced to leave and seek work elsewhere, are people who emigrate for a number of months, are people who will be out of the country for a few years but have spent most of their lives here, or will non-EC nationals now in the country for a short time be classified as &ldquo;ordinarily resident in Ireland&rdquo;?  Who will make the decisions as to who is ordinarily <Col N="1551" /> resident in Ireland?  Will it be the management committee, the entire co-operative or the corporate member?  This section will be open to a certain amount of misuse and I would like some clarification.</P>
    <P>Section 12 relates to the enforcement of regulation of fishing.  The society at any time can request the assistance of the regional board for the area.  From the Bill it is suggested that the board will already have a very high input into the co-operatives. Seeing that developments are subject to ministerial order it appears that we would end up with appointees from the Department of the Marine, the Fisheries boards and perhaps a token appointee from the co-operative.  The fact that the society can seek assistance from the regional board is interesting seeing that the co-operatives will already have a number of personnel from the board on them.</P>
    <P>An interesting situation arises with regard to a person who is angling for trout or coarse fish and is found with a rod and line.  It will be a good defence, where a person is in possesion of a rod and line to prove he is a manufacturer or a seller of them.  If I go to the Corrib with my rod and line but have not actually cast it into the water, would be be a good defence to say that I went down to the bank of the lake to sell the rod and line to a potential angler who might be there before me?  Is that what is meant by a good defence?  If I am out on a boat with a rod and line but the line is not cast, could I use as a good defence the fact that I was sailing down the river or the lake hoping to meet an angler on the lake so that I could negotiate the sale of the rod and line?  I would like to hear the Minister's comments in relation to subsection (5).</P>
    <P>There are so many things in the Bill which are outlandish and ridiculous that the Bill does not deserve much time in the House.  It would be better for the Minister to withdraw it because it is extremely convoluted and mixed up.  Fishing has <Col N="1552" /> suddenly become one of the most complicated pastimes in the country.  There could not be another pastime with such legality surrounding it.  This Bill is a further burden inhibiting the pastime without doing anything for the basic development of inland fisheries.  If this Bill could develop our inland fisheries in a clear-cut, constructive way we could accept it but it is just a bureaucratic mangle and it gets more complicated section by section.</P>
    <P>Section 14 (4) concerned me where it says that section 13 of the Fisheries Act, 1980, is hereby amended by the substitution of &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; for &rdquo;the State&rdquo;. The Minister clarified that by explaining that many people north of the Border take a very close interest and are involved in our fishing and hence they should have a voting involvement in the co-operatives. That is something I welcome.  I would like to know if there is a reciprocal involvement in activities north of the Border.  If so, this move must be commended.</P>
    <P>I have gone through all sections of the Bill that cause concern and, as I said initially, they are a major disappointment. I had hoped we would have before us a Bill that would be simple in its direction, and would follow along the lines of discussions I had with the anglers in 1988.  At that time we agreed that the licence for coarse and trout angling would be removed and replaced by a development contribution based on development work done by the fisheries boards.  We agreed that cognisance would be taken of any work done by the local angling club when calculating the contribution those clubs would make.  That was fairly straightforward.  The amount of bureaucracy over and above that which has been included in this Bill is extraordinary.  The level of ministerial control provided for in the Bill is extremely suspect and unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister, before he comes back on Committee Stage, to remove all ministerial controls and let the fishing co-operatives be masters of their own destiny, with assistance and direction from the fishery boards but less of an <Col N="1553" /> input from the Minister and fewer regulations and orders.  Only then will the co-operatives be on a sound footing.  Otherwise, the co-operative will be tied up in so many rules and regulations and directions from the Department that the ordinary business a co-operative could conduct would be totally inhibited by all the legal requirements and regulations surrounding it.  That is unfortunate.</P>
    <P>We need to have this natural resource and great asset properly developed for job creation.  There is a real opportunity to create jobs, particularly in tourism. Angling holidays here can be further promoted. People in Ireland who are not already involved in fishing could be encouraged to do so and to go on angling holidays here.  More extensive promotion work should be carried out by Bord Fáilte.  Indeed, I commend the Minister for his article in <i>The Sunday Express</i>, last Sunday, in which he encouraged people to come to Ireland on angling holidays. We have a great opportunity to develop the tourism potential of this asset but it can only be done with the full co-operation of local people.  This asset extends over a wide geographical area and unless the local people can make an input &mdash; one that will be given generously and out of interest &mdash; rather than being dictated to we will not have a good co-operative movement to develop our inland fisheries. It was a mistake that this was not provided for in the Bill.  There is room for improvement.</P>
    <P>There are many areas that have not been developed and which should be looked at.  Many lakes and rivers are understocked or, perhaps, not stocked at all.  Where there are no angling clubs there is an opportunity to encourage people to get involved in angling.  Those people, in turn, could be of assistance to the tourist organisations to bring people to those areas for angling holidays.</P>
    <P>We should recognise the extraordinarily high cost involved in going on an angling holiday in any part of England or Scotland.  In that part of the world an angling holiday is an elitist type holiday. Only people who are very well off can get involved in angling there.  I would <Col N="1554" /> hate to see a time in Ireland when the cost of angling would be prohibitive and become a pastime only for the rich.  That would be most unfortunate and we must ensure it does not occur.  It can be prevented by allowing the people of the area get involved on a voluntary basis but the Minister must not be in total control and dictating right across the board, as suggested in the Bill.  That could be dangerous in the long term.  We must be vigilant and ensure there is not a takeover of our fisheries.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Minister has taken this matter on board and I am aware that his Department have been examining it for a long time.  Quite frankly, I had hoped we would have a simple and less regulative Bill before us.  Unfortunately, that is not the case.  For that reason I am disappointed with the Bill.  Fine Gael are not in a position to support the Bill for many reasons.  There are many sections we find objectionable and it is not enough to say we object to any particular provision. The Bill is a mire of bureaucracy, it is convoluted and makes matters more complicated than they have been in the past.  Complications do not lead to orderly development.  That is what this Bill would do and for that reason we are not in a position to support it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt we will be travelling down those waterways. The Bill sets out as its main aim the setting up of co-operative societies to raise and disburse for the public benefit funds for the development of trout or coarse fisheries in fishery regions, a very laudable and worthwhile venture.  We all know in this House, and the public know, that that is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The setting up of co-operatives is a byproduct of one of the most bitter disputes which this country witnessed for many years.  It is ironic that practically three years to the week we are once again debating a fisheries Bill.  Three years ago <Col N="1555" /> the Labour Party opposed such a Bill, a Bill which was ill thought out, without substance, and rushed through the Dáil before the Christmas recess.  That infamous legislation has cost this country millions of pounds in lost revenue and it dragged decent law abiding citizens through the courts of this land.  It has created divisions within communities, split families and brought politics to a new low.</P>
    <P>One bitter lessson has been learned from that legislation, that rushed legislation of this nature, which affects the traditional practices of our people which have been handed down from generation to generation, cannot be eliminated by two days of rushed debate in Leinster House.  It is also patently obvious that a major miscalculation was made by the Government in trying to impose a new tax on probably one of the most docile groups of sports people in the country.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Government availed of the run up to Christmas to impose probably the most divisive legislation since this country attained its independence. That legislation was passed here with full Government approval.</P>
    <P>When reaction from the angling clubs, and the general public, vented its fury on that Government the scapegoat was found in the then Minister for the Marine, Deputy Daly.  He was used as the sacrificial lamb in a shameful, damaging limitation exercise.  So much for so-called collective Cabinet responsibility.</P>
    <P>That rushed legislation had a direct effect on two of our major industries, fishing and tourism.  I believe it is fair to say that both industries suffered greatly from this disastrous Act.  Cases have been tried before the courts and fines imposed on law abiding citizens who, if this legislation is passed &mdash; I have no doubt that it will be &mdash; will be proven innocent of any criminal act.  The Minister must rectify this ridiculous situation.  Many cases are still pending before the courts and this ludicrous situation must be addressed.</P>
    <P>Many people who depend on fresh water fishing for a living have built up businesses and relationships with visitors <Col N="1556" /> from all over the world but because of the Government's blinkered vision, after a couple of hours' debate serious damage was done to a thriving industry and one of our greatest selling assets was destroyed.</P>
    <P>Not alone did the infamous rod licence create bitterness and division at home but it also did massive damage abroad from which it may take us years to recover.  At home it divided families, ruined businesses, drastically reduced incomes and I have no doubt, led to some people losing their Dáil seats.  The rod licence created confusion abroad because Bord Fáilte were promoting free fishing at a time when the Irish authorities were introducing rod licences.  Tourists who came here to fish saw pickets and the shut-down of one of our greatest resources.  Our image abroad was not one of a green, friendly, clean country but one of aggression, trouble and disputes, with the result that thousands of visitors stayed away.</P>
    <P>The result of this miscalculation by the Government led to the loss of jobs and a number of people who depended on the fishing season to supplement their incomes had to go on the dole or take the boat to Birmingham, Manchester or Camden Town.  In addition millions of pounds were lost to the Exchequer, great damage was done to our reputation and the Government were shown to be completely out of touch with reality.  The people affected by the rod licence displayed their anger and reacted to this move, not by an alien Government but by a native one which they believed would take their birthright from them.</P>
    <P>It is also blatently obvious that the Department of Finance would not give adequate funding to the Department of the Marine.  As a result fishery boards had their budgets slashed.  It is pointless giving fishery boards certain powers to enforce the law if at the same time they are denied sufficient funding to operate efficiently.  The recent verdict by the jury in the case of the Ballycotton tragedy indicates that basic necessary equipment is not available to fishery officers. However, that is a matter for another day <Col N="1557" /> and I am sure we will have a long debate on it.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about developing our rivers, lakes and canals as a business we must invest sufficient finance to make these natural resources productive for recreation and amenity purposes.  I have no doubt that proper consultation with the angling interests will lead to a bright future for our inland fisheries but I want to stress that proper consultation with the angling interests is necessary.  It is now obvious that when the rod licence was imposed on an unsuspecting community it was only natural that there would be swift reaction to it, reaction which had disastrous consequences for everyone. Our history has always shown that when coercion is used to impose unpopular and unjust laws they are met with resistance and when the Government introduce penal measures which abolish traditional rights, practices and customs, they pay the price for their foolishness at the ballot box.</P>
    <P>It was very noticeable during the rod licence dispute that there was widespread resistance to it by both urban and rural communities.  There are a large number of angling clubs in my constituency of Cork north-central and many of these clubs participate in restocking and developing fishing.  These people have always been shown to be responsible and interested in angling and have encouraged young people to participate in one of the oldest recreations and sports known to man.</P>
    <P>Many club members, and non-club members, old and young are unemployed and the imposition of a tax on their sport was completely unacceptable to them and was seen as a means of taking money from the unemployed, those least able to afford it.  One of the main defects of that Bill was that it was regressive, not progressive.  This tax, instead of encouraging young people and the unemployed to take an interest in fishing discouraged them and there was justifiable anger at the introduction of this taxation measure.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes the termination of the need for a trout and coarse fish licence.  This is vital as this licence was <Col N="1558" /> the kernel of the problem three years ago.  As spokesperson on marine matters for my party, I introduced amending legislation over 12 months ago to try to remedy this disastrous situation.  This was the first thing I did when I came into this House as I felt amending legislation was necessary.  Because the Minister indicated at the time that he was negotiating with the angling interests I did not press the issue.  I knew it was a delicate issue and I had no wish to upset any negotiations in which he was involved.  I am sure the Minister did a very good job in these protracted negotiations and I know he put in a lot of hours trying to resolve this problem.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us brings all my worst fears to the surface.  There is an element of coercion in the Bill and the Minister's input is there for everyone to see.  I had envisaged the introduction of a Bill which would give freedom to people, angling clubs and co-operatives but I think the inclusion of the latter was agreed to in principle by the Minister and the people involved in the negotiations.  I believe the principle involving the co-operatives is good; I do not see anything wrong with it, but I do not agree with the way this is outlined in the Bill.  I have grave reservations about this provision and its workability.</P>
    <P>As I said, the kernel of the problem was the trout and coarse fishing licence. The Minister said:</P>
    <P>The structure and framework proposed is grounded in the principles of the co-operative movement and of local participation and local democracy. It will allow anglers themselves through a democratic procedure to make the decisions on the best and most effective process for raising moneys.</P>
    <P>The Minister's proposals will be cumbersome and unwieldly and I do not think for one moment that they will succeed.  I believe, from studying the Bill, that the Government, the Minister and his Department have learned nothing from the disastrous situation which existed a short time ago.  The Bill provides that the <Col N="1559" /> Minister &ldquo;may make an order&rdquo;, &ldquo;may appoint&rdquo; and &ldquo;may make rules and regulations.&rdquo; The Minister is being given a strong hand and he will be able to tell people how to fish, what to fish, how much they fish and how much they can be fined.</P>
    <P>Having spoken to a number of people in fishing and angling clubs, and people who are not members of clubs, I am more than convinced that they are a responsible group who are more than willing to voluntarily come forward and together with the fishery boards, help develop our inland fisheries.  They have also learned lessons from the bitter experience of the rod licence dispute.  They have seen communities torn apart by it.  The pity is that the whole thing could have been avoided. The devastation caused by the dispute was completely out of proportion to the revenue which accrued from the sale of rod licences.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that the voluntary system did not work.  One wonders why.  The Minister and his predecessor should have coaxed, encouraged and advertised what was at stake for inland fisheries.  If people had been given the full facts we need not have had any dispute. The potential of our inland fisheries is huge, as the Minister has consistently stated.  How to gain the co-operation of those involved is another question.  I do not believe this Bill will achieve it.</P>
    <P>Section 10 (2) provides that the Minister may, from time to time, by order made after consultation with the Minister for Finance, alter any fee under subsection (1) of this section either without limitation as to time or in respect of the specified year or years and any such order shall take effect at the beginning of the year following that in which it is made. Under section 15 a person found guilty of an offence under this legislation shall be liable to a fine of £1,000 or ten times the fee for an annual share certificate in force at the time of commission of the offence.  I suspect that the Minister has allowed himself a certain leeway and that he will raise the fee substantially.  The sum of £1,000 is fairly high and far <Col N="1560" /> exceeds the sum of ten times the fee.  The Minister certainly has scope to develop the fees over a number of years.  I find this aspect unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Section 12 (3) states:</P>
    <P>Where a person is angling for trout or coarse fish in an area in which section 9 of this Act is in force or is in possession of a rod and line capable of being used for that purpose at a fishing place in that area or is going or returning from angling for trout or coarse fish at such a place, he shall, at the request of an authorised officer to whom subsection (1) of this section relates (on production, if demanded, of a certificate of his authority issued by the regional board of which he is such officer) give the officer his name and address and produce for his inspection, either then or within seven days of being requested to do so, a share certificate in his name current when the request was made.</P>
    <P>This goes back once again to the licence issue, despite the Minister's statement that he is moving in the direction of coops. My view of co-operatives is that they are run by the community.  The Minister will agree but he will have a heavy input. I am convinced that this Bill will do nothing to change people's thinking.</P>
    <P>There is a moratorium on licences but some people who have appeared in court are still bound to pay fines.  The matter seems to be in abeyance until this Bill is passed.  What will happen then?  It is a serious matter.  We could let matters continue as they are but the angling clubs do not want that.  Anglers feel they have something to contribute to the development of our waterways and fisheries and they do not want to be manacled by any Department in developing these amenities.</P>
    <P>People from other countries may have no great problem about buying a licence to fish but we have a different tradition and birthright.  Voluntary contributions by anglers through the clubs to the fisheries boards would be a far more acceptable method of generating revenue for <Col N="1561" /> the development of inland fisheries.  Conversations with large groups of anglers around the country have convinced me of this.</P>
    <P>Lessons have been learned from the dispute but the Minister and the Department do not appear to have grasped the nettle.  My amending Bill was very simple and I had hoped that the Minister would take the initiative by discussing with the angling clubs the fine print of the co-operative idea which he has suggested.  I am not aware that the angling clubs have agreed to this idea and I am afraid that there may be another outbreak of trouble.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister has not brought in simplifying legislation which would be easy to understand.  This Bill is confusing and gives a complex aspect to the whole question of trout fishing.  In practice, this is all about fellows going out at the weekend to participate in the recreation of fishing.  It would be very simple for the Minister to devise a format which would give these people the right to fish and the right to contribute voluntarily to the development of this wonderful amenity.</P>
    <P>The fisheries boards are very short of funds and cannot develop as they would wish.  I was amazed to discover that their budget had not increased since 1982.  The tourist potential of this magnificent amenity cannot be developed with such meagre funds.  Successive Governments must accept responsibility for this state of affairs.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to have abandoned the idea of voluntary contributions from clubs.  He is not prepared to go down that road.  I believe events have shown that this should be the way forward.  We should indicate to the people involved that while the Government are putting a certain amount of money into the development of fisheries they have a similar obligation.  I believe that money would be forthcoming from anglers.  Never before the rod licence dispute did we have the kind of aggression which was experienced.  If the Minister scrapped the existing Bill and brought forward simple <Col N="1562" /> legislation eliminating the rod licence we could restore community spirit.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies and Ministers have claimed credit in the matter of settling the rod licence dispute.  I have no doubt that they put in a lot of work in an effort to undo the damage they inflicted on the country by way of this serious dispute but I would remind the House that on 16 December 1987 the Labour Party, with Deputy Kemmy, were the only party to oppose this Bill.  It gives me no great pleasure now to state that if my colleagues had been listened to at that time we could have avoided one of the most damaging disputes this country has had the misfortune to experience.  As a result badly needed millions in revenue were lost.</P>
    <P>The one important lesson to be learned from the rod licence debacle is that the taxing of people's traditional rights will never work.  If the Government are serious about developing the tourism and job creation potential of inland fisheries they should do so with the full co-operation of those who have given a lifetime of service to the voluntary &mdash; and I emphasise voluntary &mdash; promotion and development of this ancient art of recreation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill does not abolish the rod licence; it renames it, reduces it and says it will be payable to a different body.  We have to go back to see where the rod licence came from.  It was a product of the economic thinking at the time and of Government cutbacks.  By 1987, the year the rod licence was introduced, Government expenditure in inland fisheries had been cut by 40 per cent on 1982 levels.  That was the year which saw regional fisheries boards grounding their staff as they were not in a position to put petrol in their cars and send them out to patrol our rivers and lakes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dominant economic thinking at that time, which was very much in favour across the water, was to cut public expenditure and shift the burden to the consumer.  Therefore if one got sick and had to go to hospital they paid a charge to get into the hospital.  If one wanted to <Col N="1563" /> drink a glass of water they had to pay a water charge to cover the cost of providing the water.  In order to send their children to school they paid a voluntary contribution while if they wanted to fish they also paid for that.  The attitude was that there was no such thing as a free meal, no free fish.  The rod licence was a kind of poll tax on fish.</P>
    <P>Many commentators have wondered why, of all the charges introduced at that time on hospitals, water, schools and so on, it was the rod licence which provoked the greatest deal of controversy.  My own view is that the public believed there was a limit to the number and type of resources one could define as a commodity to be purchased and that the rod licence struck very deeply at a generally held public view that not every public resource should be paid for and that the traditional right to fish our rivers and lakes freely was not something one should have to pay for.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the rod licence virtually every political party in this House have at one stage or another called for its abandonment with the exception of, until recently, the party who introduced it.  The Workers' Party welcomed the talks which led to the settlement of the dispute which caused serious damage to tourism and community relations.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of this Bill effectively abolishes the licence for trout or coarse fishing. I can understand why those at the centre of this dispute and who negotiated a settlement were to a certain degree pleased that a compromise was worked out which enabled the dispute to be settled.  Indeed, I congratulate those who were involved in negotiating a settlement of what was a very divisive and difficult dispute &mdash; the Minister, Members of this House, people in the Churches, in the angling clubs and those involved in the campaign against the rod licence itself.</P>
    <P>I recall that the dispute was about a principle, that the public should have the freedom to fish and that our fishing resources should not become a commodity to be purchased either by way of <Col N="1564" /> a rod licence or any other charge.  It was that very concept or idea, a charge for fishing, that was at the centre of the dispute. This Bill does not resolve the core issue in the dispute nor does it deal with the principle.  On the one hand it abolishes the rod licence for trout and coarse fishing in section 3 but in subsequent sections it reintroduces the principle that one should pay the requirement, which will become the practice, that a person will have to hold a share certificate in a co-operative if they want to fish.  Section 9 states that a co-operative will be able to stop someone fishing in a river or lake unless that person holds a share certificate. However, there are some very welcome exceptions.  Section 15 states that if a person is caught fishing without a share certificate they can be fined up to £1,000 or ten times the fee for an annual share certificate.</P>
    <P>Do we therefore have a new rod licence, except in this case it is called a share certificate and to be paid directly to the co-operative rather than to the State and will for the time being cost less than the rod licence?  The fees for share certificates are set down in section 10. However it is stated in subsection (2) of that section that the Minister may increase the level of those fees.  Therefore the cost of the share certificate may well be increased in the future to a figure greater than the cost of the rod licence. The responsibility to fund inland fisheries is therefore being shifted from the State to the consumer but in a different way in that instead of being shifted to the individual, it is being shifted to the co-operative. Section 5 (2), which deals with the rules the Minister may make, covering co-operatives makes it very clear that the Minister may direct the co-operative to make certain payments to a regional fisheries board.  It seems, therefore, that instead of the individual angler paying a rod licence directly a more lengthy process is being put in place with a person buying a share certificate from the co-operative who in turn will be required to make a payment to the regional fisheries board.  Circumstances could arise in the future in which, if funding continues to <Col N="1565" /> be withheld from the regional fisheries boards, or is cut back, the co-operatives may find they will have to acquiesce in a ministerial order to increase the cost of share certificates.  What we have before us may not involve the abolition of the rod licence or a reduction in the cost of fishing but, in the longer term, could increase that cost to the public.</P>
    <P>In general I favour the principle of developing power and responsibility for aspects of inland fisheries policy to co-operatives. I do not think there is any disagreement in principle with that. Indeed, I would agree with what the Minister said about the desirability of devolving power democratically to the public and, in this case, to co-operatives.  If the co-operative concept works I have no doubt but that it will be a very exciting one.  I have no doubt that it could serve in a very real way to develop our inland fisheries but I do have some reservations about the proposals contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>First, the Minister's heavy hand remains on the shoulders of the co-operatives. Power to establish co-operatives will rest with the Minister; the drawing up of rules for co-operatives will rest with the Minister; the fixing of membership will rest with the Minister and the appointment of two of the members to the controlling body of the co-operative will rest with the Minister.  How the co-operatives should disburse their money will rest with the Minister.  Of course, much will depend on how those powers are exercised.</P>
    <P>My second reservation is that in time there will be the danger that co-operatives, instead of extending the facility to a wider range of the public to enable them enjoy the resources of our rivers and lakes, will restrict that right.  I agree with my colleagues who have expressed their respect and admiration for the angling clubs.  We have witnessed many cases of bodies having been established, either in the form of co-operatives or of friendly societies, when, over time, their objectives have been lost sight of; when, instead of facilitating greater public participation, the reverse may be the case. We have seen it happen in the case of <Col N="1566" /> building societies.  When they were established they had a credible, democratic approach to the provision of housing.  If one asks somebody like Muriel Scorer about the present rights of a depositor or borrower in a building society, I am sure she would be able to testify that effectively the building societies have come under the control of self-perpetuating cliques so that it becomes very difficult for an individual depositor or borrower to exercise any control or obtain rights from them.</P>
    <P>My concern is that we may establish a structure which, over time, could become very restrictive.  I see a number of provisions in this Bill which signal how they could become restrictive.  For example, I am concerned about the provisions with regard to corporate membership.  In section 8 there is reference to the fee to be paid by a corporate member.  Section 8 (3) states:</P>
    <P>... particular regard shall be had to the outlay of the body concerned on work of public benefit in the area in which the society operates.</P>
    <P>Does that mean that, say, a club or some other corporate body, could say: &ldquo;we have carried out work to the value of £10,000 on a particular river, and in return for the expenditure of that £10,000 we should be issued with, let us say, 800 share certificates?&rdquo;.  In turn does that mean that when the co-operative is established a group of the corporate members could get together and effectively use the strength of their membership to draw up rules which might not be to the advantage of an individual angler or holder of a share certificate?</P>
    <P>Let us examine the powers of co-operatives. For example, under section 9 they will have power to decide by a vote of 60 per cent of the ordinary members eligible to vote and voting that a person shall not be entitled to angle for trout or coarse fish in the area of that society unless he is the holder of a current share certificate of that or any other society established under this Act.  In other words, it will be the co-operatives who will decide that if one is not a member one cannot fish, that <Col N="1567" /> if one does not hold a share certificate, one cannot fish.  In all probability that is what the co-operatives will do.</P>
    <P>We have seen examples of this &mdash; and it is no reflection on the clubs concerned &mdash; where, let us say, a sports club is given access to a public park and then begins to lay down rules either to exclude certain categories of people from membership or increase the fees to such an extent that it will become very difficult for the average citizen to participate.  There have been cases of local authorities having given a facility to a tennis or golf club to use their grounds in the pursuit of either sport, after a number of years discovering the fees are increased and other levies imposed.  By degrees they become very exclusive clubs, albeit operating on what is public property and having been established to broaden participation in that sport.  The concern I am expressing is whether, in a number of years time, circumstances will arise in which, if an individual citizen wishes to fish, he may experience difficulties either by way of having to purchase a share certificate, the cost of which might then be considerable, or having to comply with rules and regulations laid down by a club or co-operative. These questions will hve to be addressed particularly on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I am concerned also about the provisions of section 12 which I find a very stange section indeed, effectively dealing with the enforcement of regulation of fishing.  As I read the section its provisions provide that co-operatives will decide against whom prosecutions may be instituted. As I read it, it may be that they will request the assistance of the regional board in implementing the provisions of that section.  It is not entirely clear to me. Perhaps the Minister would clarify this when replying.  As I read the provisions of this section, a co-operative will have discretion to decide against whom prosecutions may be instituted, against whom enforcement proceedings may be instituted for not complying with some of the terms of this Bill.  It would be a unique departure for this House to transfer the power of enforcement from a public body <Col N="1568" /> to a voluntary one.  That is something that will have to be examined.</P>
    <P>Section 12 (5) is laughable and makes a complete joke of the enforcement aspect where the good defence clause is introduced. We know that in the area of water pollution &mdash; the other famous area where there has been a good defence clause &mdash; the existence of the good defence clause in the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977, meant in practice that prosecutions fell by the dozen because somebody could walk in and claim this good defence clause.  Here it was a good defence to prove he had a rod and line in his possession as a manufacturer or seller thereof and not for use; if he gets caught with the rod in his hand and says &ldquo;I was only trying to sell it; I was not fishing, your Honour&rdquo;, that makes a joke of the enforcement section in the Bill.</P>
    <P>In summary, the parties on this side of the House have been looking for legislation to regularise the position regarding the rod licence.  We have been seeking legislation to amend the 1987 Act and abolish the rod licence.  We now have legislation in front of us but it does not seem to meet the requirement we were seeking.  We are all anxious to amend the 1987 Act, and the place to correct the defects in this Bill in front of us is on Committee Stage.  My party will be tabling a number of Committee Stage amendments to try to remedy some of the defects we see in this Bill and to deal with some of the worries I have expressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Gilmore's last remarks.  Having looked at this Bill and remembering the mistakes that we made I believe we should not rush Committee Stage.  We should take the Bill line by line and amend it where necessary, because this Bill is a long way from a solution to the rod licence dispute. We made the mistake of rushing through the last Bill in the run up to Christmas and we should not make the same mistake again.  By coincidence this Bill was presented to us last week and we are taking Second Stage today, a week after publication.  Very few people outside this <Col N="1569" /> House have had an opportunity to look at the Bill yet, so let us not rush our fences on this occasion.  Let us get it right, once and for all.</P>
      <P>We are now approaching the third anniversary of the introduction of the harmful and damaging rod licence.  It is extraordinary that it has taken three years to introduce a Bill to amend this famous, flawed, failed legislation &mdash; this Fisheries (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1987, the rod licence Bill as it was called. That Bill was suddenly introduced in the Dáil on 16 December 1987 and passed all Stages in the Senaad on 18 December 1987.  It was rushed, badly thought out legislation put through the Dáil by deception, so to speak, and the Minister for the Marine assured the House &mdash; and I quote from the Official Report of 16 December 1987, Volume 376, column 2594: &ldquo;It also has the support of the Trout Anglers Federation of Ireland and the National Coarse Fishing Federation of Ireland&rdquo;.  This, of course, turned out to be false.  The Trout Anglers Federation of Ireland, the National Coarse Fishing Federation of Ireland and most trout and coarse anglers were bitterly opposed to the Bill.</P>
      <P>I was not a Member of the Dáil when that Bill was introduced, but I was a Member of Seanad Éireann and the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, gave the same assurance to the Seanad.  I was there on 18 December 1987 when he said, and I quote from the Official Report of the Seanad, Volume 118, column 450: &ldquo;It is also supported by the Trout Anglers Federation of Ireland and the National Coarse Fishing Federation of Ireland&rdquo;. Again that turned out not to be correct. I spoke at length on this legislation in the Seanad on the night of 18 December 1987.  I said this legislation could not work, that there was indecent haste in rushing a Bill into law which never could be worked, and which subsequently proved unworkable.  I wish the Minister at that time had paid a little more heed to my contribution.  I quote from the same volume, columns 453 and 454:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be no doubt that the <Col N="1570" /> introduction of licence fees will be resisted, especially in the area of Lough Corrib, the largest free fishing lake in Europe.  It is promoted as such throughout the world.  Galway angling and tourism interest are angry and will resist the introduction of these fees....</P>
    <P>Angry Galway anglers will take to the streets next Saturday to protest at the Government's plans to impose licence charges for trout and coarse fishing.</P>
    <P>The anglers are furious that Lough Corrib, the largest free fishing lake in Europe, will lose its free status under the terms of the proposed legislation.</P>
    <P>The Government propose to licence all trout and coarse fishing in a Bill which proposes fines of up to £20,000 and two years in prison for all breaches.</P>
    <P>The Federation of Lough Corrib Anglers are expected to strongly oppose the legislation when they meet later this week, but already a number of individual angling clubs have rejected the move out of hand.</P>
    <P>I quote from column 459 of the same volume:</P>
    <P>There will be, and there is, great hostility on the part of the ordinary angler to the introduction of a licence charge of up to a maximum of £40 a year for a composite licence.  There is great objection to it on the part of the Federation of Corrib Anglers Clubs, on the part of tourists interests, particularly in the Corrib catchment area. As an alternative &mdash; and I have spoken briefly only to some of them &mdash; the Corrib Anglers Clubs have said they would advance a £1 for £1 contribution to match anything central Government would invest in regional fisheries boards for non-pay development.</P>
    <P>The angling and tourist interests in Galway, Connemara and Mayo have been complaining for the past two seasons that salmon are not reaching the rivers....</P>
    <P>That is to give the colour of the debate <Col N="1571" /> in the Seanad on 18 December 1987 when this Bill was hurriedly rushed through. The haste with which it was rushed through led to the situation we are now in, three years later &mdash; trying to amend that Bill.</P>
    <P>However, despite those warnings from myself and others, the Minister and the Government of the day voted that Bill into law.  This rod licence caused great damage and upset in the communities and angling areas through Ireland, none more so than my area of West Galway particularly in the Corrib region of Galway city, Moycullen, Oughterard, Cornamona, Clonbur, Cong, Headford, Claren and Annaghdown.  The people of those areas resented fiercely the licence charges and the implications of Government control of our waters.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gilmore tried to analyse why people resisted this Bill.  The people of the Galway and Corrib-Mask regions resisted it because they did not want to give control of the lakes to any Government by having a licence imposed on them.  For example, there are 60,000 to 70,000 acres in Lough Corrib-Lough Mask, the greatest free fishing lake in Europe, a jewel in the west, worth millions of pounds in tourism revenue if promoted properly and the introduction of this licence triggered off an extraordinary campaign of resistance and opposition in the Corrib-Mask region and other areas.  The campaign was at first ignored by the Government and often misunderstood by people outside the region who mistakenly thought that this resistance to paying the licence was a resistance to paying the licence fee.  It was rather about the principle of right of free fishing and the control of our lakes, and the genuine fears in the communities of the Corrib-Mask region about the Government wishing to take control of the lakes for the granting of fish farming licences or permission for fish cages which were resisted by the people.</P>
    <P>That might seem far-fetched to people outside the area but that was a real problem in the Corrib-Mask areas.  It was a problem because it coincided with the <Col N="1572" /> time of the development of fish farming in many sheltered bays off the coast and there was a perception which turned out to be a reality that this was a means of getting control of the lakes for the purposes of fish farming activities.  That is borne out by a publication by the Western Fisheries Board entitled, <i>Potential Sites for Salmon Smolt Production for Aquaculture Industry in the Western Region.</i>  It stated:</P>
    <P>It is estimated that there will be increasing demand for salmon smolts by the aquaculture industry in the region over the next three years.  The projected figures are: total requirement, 4 million; existing output, 0.5 million; planned output for new units extensions, 1 million; future requirements from 1987-1990, 2.5 million. According to the I.A.A. the lack of available freshwater sites is impeding the development of the industry in the region.  Therefore, at this stage, it is important not only to identify the projected smolt requirements but to decide how and where this can be met. Salmon farming is of growing economic importance to the region but Irish producers have to be competitive with their counterparts in Scotland and Norway and operating costs affecting this.....</P>
    <P>There is little published information in relation to the cost of smolt production on land based sites versus cages, but undoubtedly the capital costs associated with land based units is a prohibitive factor for many small operators.</P>
    <P>The industry requires sites within two hours driving time of the sea cages. In practice this means that sea farms in the board's jurisdiction would most likely have to be supplied with smolts produced within the region.</P>
    <P>I give that quotation because people outside the area seemed to think that it was a figment of the imagination of the people opposed to the rod licence that the lakes would be taken over for fish farming activities.  To give an idea of the amount of fresh water required, there are 25,000 <Col N="1573" /> smolts in one tonne and four million smolts equals 160 tonnes.  It take approximately 250 million litres of fresh water to produce one tonne of fish, that is 55 million gallons.  It would require 8,800 million gallons of fresh water to produce four million smolts or 160 tonnes each year.  To get this into perspective, Galway city, for example, with a population of 48,000, uses eight million gallons of water each day or 300 million gallons of water each year.  That amount of water could only have been got in the Corrib region. To go further, to coincide with that, planning applications were lodged with the authority of which I myself am a member, Galway County Council.  Let me give an example.  Again it was a double application, first plannning reference 52454 by Éisc Iathglas Teoranta, permission for fresh water cages in Lough na Fooey which is a lake at the head of Lough Mask which feeds the Corrib.  This planning application for fish cages at Lough na Fooey was refused by Galway County Council on 17 July 1986 on two grounds. I got this information as a result of a notice of motion I put down to Galway County Council in June 1988.  The two grounds were that is was a public health hazard in the head waters of Lough Mask which is a major source of public water supply, and injury to visual amenity.  It was also refused by the Planning Appeals Board.  Despite the refusal of that application a similar application was made to the same planning authority by the same company for submerged cages in Lough na Fooey under planning reference 55416 and this was decided on by Galway County Council on 17 February 1988, and it was decided to grant temporary permission for five years.  That did not go ahead subsequently, principally because of the campaign against the rod licence in Galway because the people in that area had clearly linked the imposition of the rod licence to the sudden rush of applications for fish cages on the head waters of Lough Corrib and Lough Mask one of which was granted by my own local authority.  So it was not a figment of the people's imagination at all; it was a real fear which existed at the time.  It was <Col N="1574" /> in defence of their free fishing waters that the people so resisted the legislation.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, this ill-conceived and deceptively introduced legislation and the subsequent successful campaign to remove it had its price in great hardships and bitter divisions in our communities. Anglers, hotel and guesthouse owners and other tourist interests suffered greatly in my own region over the three years of the life of this legislation.  It is estimated that the country lost over £20 million in tourism revenue in the first two years because of this licence.  The loss through divisions and misunderstanding in our communities cannot be measured in mere money terms.</P>
    <P>The campaign to settle the rod licence dispute was an extraordinary one even going as far as an agreement between the Taoiseach and the Archbishop of Tuam in May 1988 which led to a temporary truce which was broken within a couple of weeks when fisheries officers resumed enforcement of the new Bill.  The campaign to abolish the rod licence continued in a quiet and determined fashion during the years 1988 and 1989.  Various meetings were arranged at this time at both low and high levels.  The bishops, priests, politicians and the people worked very hard to find a solution.  Numerous meetings and gatherings were held at various locations and this was a time of great stress and strain on the communities involved and on the families involved in the regions effected.  Some people and some families made great sacrifices in an attempt to protect our lakes and waterways and to find a solution to the problem created by the introduction of this rod licence.  Families and their spouses made great sacrifices as their partners travelled long distances to meetings and discussions night after night in their efforts to solve the problem.  Some people even sacrificed their jobs; in some semi-State situations people were harrassed out of their jobs.  Some business people in hotels and guesthouses lost their prime business as a result of the rod licence introduction. In fact, those people made the biggest sacrifices of all in an attempt to find a solution to the problem.  Boat owners and <Col N="1575" /> gilly operators lost their business as, in co-operation with the efforts of anglers and others to have this legislation amended or scrapped, they refused to take any people out on the lakes for angling purposes.</P>
    <P>This was the major tool in the campaign to make the Government realise that this problem would not go away but would have to be faced and resolved. Business people in fishing and tackle shops closed their business altogether and some were unable to recover their business, all because of bad unworkable legislation which was rushed through the House without proper consultation with the interested parties.</P>
    <P>All of this took place during the angling and tourist seasons of 1988 and 1989 and the great mistake made by the Government in introducing this rod licence in December 1987 was now becoming clear to everybody except the Government themselves.  During the election of 1989, however, the seriousness of the matter and the enormity and gravity of the mistake finally dawned on the Fianna Fáil Government when their candidates went out to meet the people on the canvass in the general and European elections.  We heard a well publicised remark by the Taoiseach at the time that it was beyond his comprehension how such a small problem was causing so much bother to such a large section of the community.  It was like his famous remark on the health cuts.  He did not realise there was a problem in the health service until the first or second week of the 1989 general election campaign.  Similarily with the rod licence, the Taoiseach did not realise there was a problem until the facts were reported back to him during the election campaign. On one occasion the Fianna Fáil candidates canvassing in Moycullen were told not to come back until the rod licence dispute had been settled, and because of the lack of response they withdrew from canvassing in the area.</P>
    <P>After the general election the present Minister, Deputy Wilson, was appointed Minister for the Marine.  He announced in March of this year that he was doing <Col N="1576" /> away with the rod licence.  I would like to compliment the Minister who treated the matter very seriously.  He sat down with all sides to the dispute on several occasions to try to find a basis for settlement. It took some time to persuade the rest of the Government that this was a problem that would have to be faced up to and that the legislation as enacted in December 1987 was unworkable.  The Minister made serious efforts to find a solution to the problem.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that the Minister announced in March that a solution had been found, we still have the licence on our Statute Book nine months later. Indeed we had the extraordinary spectacle of the Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy, in my constituency in front of the cameras, in a boat pretending to be fishing, without a lifejacket and with a fly rod in his hand in place of a trawling rod.  That was the level of farce to which Government Ministers &mdash; although not from the Minister's party &mdash; descended.</P>
    <P>I listened early to the contribution of the Labour spokesperson on the Marine who rightly stated that various people tried to claim credit for settling the rod licence dispute.  I did not go out in any boat in March.  During the previous two years when we were trying to seek a solution to this problem I had said both privately and publicly that if the Minister solved the rod licence dispute I would thank him &mdash; which I did publicly in the Dáil in March &mdash; and that I would make no political capital from it.  I have kept my word and I have not spoken publicly about the rod licence since, except to ask the Taoiseach on Tuesday of last week when we could expect the publication of the Bill.  He correctly informed me that it would be published the next day, for which I was very thankful.</P>
    <P>We had to wait from March until now, over nine months, for the amending Bill to be published.  If there was ever a case of long churning producing bad butter &mdash; as they say in our area &mdash; this is a prime example.  I cannot understand the delay. Furthermore I am suspicious about the Bill being produced in the rush coming up to Christmas.  We are taking Second <Col N="1577" /> Stage a week after the publication of the Bill, which is quite soon, and there is a possibility that Committee Stage will be taken next week.  The danger in taking Second Stage only a week after publication is that very few people apart from ourselves will have seen the Bill.  Is there a desire to have the new Bill accepted before the provisions contained therein become known to people or before people have an opportunity of reading it? However, my party and I presume all the other parties who realise the mistake that was made the last time do not object to Second Stage being taken now.  Perhaps it is a little soon but Deputies can do very little harm by their speeches on Second Stage.  It is on Committee Stage that the real work will have to be done.</P>
    <P>Therefore I am not going to agree to Committee Stage being taken next week. I am not happy with everything I see in the Bill and we have to get it right this time.  We cannot afford to come back here again and say that the last stage is worse than the first, but there is a danger of that happening if we attempt to rush Committee Stage or to push the Bill through before Christmas.  Some of the sections in the Bill are complex and vague and therefore I would seriously ask the Minister not to insist on finalising Committee Stage before the Christmas recess. In any case there is only one week left to deal with legislation.  The final week will have to be given to financial matters.</P>
    <P>We should learn from our mistakes in the past.  Very serious mistakes were made in 1987.  The Bill was taken in the Dáil on 16 December when everybody was thinking about going on their Christmas holidays and in the Seanad on 18 December when practically everybody had gone on their holidays, except Deputy G. Reynolds, myself and a few other loyal soldiers.  The legislation was rushed through without any consultation with the angling clubs, the tourist interests and others who might have put us on the right road.  As a result a lot of hardship was suffered by individual families, communities and tourist interests.  People abroad could not understand the complexities of the rod licence <Col N="1578" /> problem, but I assure the Minister and anybody outside who is listening to this debate that the people on the ground certainly understood them.</P>
    <P>As I have said, we are now discussing Second Stage of the Bill a week after its publication, with a possibility of Committee Stage being taken next week.  I would say to the Minister: &ldquo;Hold your horses&rdquo;.  The Government rushed through the legislation three years ago and we have paid dearly ever since.  We should take our time and consult the people involved.  Let us get it right this time and not, as before, work in haste and repent at leisure.  We will of course be told by the Minister and others that it will have to be in place before 1 January to facilitate advertising and printing of Bord Fáilte brochures and so on, but we will not buy that this time.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister what delayed the publication of this Bill since agreement was reached with the interested parties in March of this year.  Surely it did not take nine months to print this Bill.  I further ask the Minister if this Bill is a true reflection of the agreement reached with the interested parties in March.  I do not think it is and I will be surprised if it subsequently turns out to be so.</P>
    <P>The Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 1990, was introduced to deal with the co-operative movement but I submit, with respect, that the Minister's idea of a co-operative differs greatly from the concept of a co-operative as set up and envisaged by Sir Horace Plukett when he founded the co-operative movement in 1889.  The small spark which he lit then soon became a flame which still burns brightly today. By 1894 the co-opertive movement was a national body and the IAOS &mdash; as it was called at that time &mdash; was established to look after the affairs and interests of co-operatives.  The body is now in existence but it is known as the ICOS as it was changed in 1979.  I speak as someone who worked all his life in co-operatives before I got a worse job in this House. What the Minister is proposing in this Bill cannot be deemed to be a co-operative in the real sense of the word.  For example, the only place for the registry <Col N="1579" /> of co-operatives is with the Registrar of Friendly Societies, Hume Sreet, attached to the Department of Industry and Commerce. Will this Bill have provision for a new registry office?  Is that where the new angling co-operatives, if they are set up, will be registered?  Will there be confusion in regard to two bodies registering co-operatives?  Will there be confusion about duplication of names of co-operatives which will be registered in two places?  Those are just the mechanics of the difficulties in approaching it in this manner.</P>
    <P>Existing co-operatives do not have an obligation in law to issue share certificates. They usually do but there is no obligation to do so.  Share certificates will have to be issued to the angling co-operatives if this Bill becomes law.  A share certificate implies share in ownership. How does the Minister propose to overcome that?  If the shareholders have a share in ownership could the co-operatives in five, ten or 20 years decide to put their share certificates up for sale? Could there be a takeover as we have seen in the recent history of dairy co-operatives where large scale multinationals, who are now in trouble, forced up the price of co-operatives against farmer-owned co-operatives?</P>
    <P>It is obvious that this Bill will take a long time to tease out and that my party will have to put down a number of amendments to it.  Indeed, we will have to examine the Bill line by line on Committee Stage.  It is essential, before Committee Stage, to examine this Bill from the point of view of the legal and co-operative aspects, anglers, the Minister and the Department of the Marine because we will only get one bite at the cherry.  We will have to get it right now or go down in history as the people who made a botch of it a second time.  If at all possible I do not intend to make a botch of it but certain guilt must be apportioned to all Members for accepting the word of the Minister when the first legislation was introduced.  Those mistakes were made and I acknowledge my part in them although, as I said earlier, I tried to warn <Col N="1580" /> the Minister on 18 December 1987 in the Seanad about the repercussions the Bill would have.  I was speaking from practical knowledge of my own area at the time.  As Lady Bracknell said, to err once is forgivable but to err twice is sheer carelessness.</P>
    <P>Section 3 says that a licence under the principal Act shall not be required for angling for trout or coarse fish.  However, where does it say that we are abolishing the Fisheries (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1987?  I should like that clearly spelt out because I fail to grasp it so far.  Section 4 states that the Minister shall, by order, establish in each fisheries region one or more fisheries co-operative societies to raise and disburse for the public benefit funds for the development of trout or coarse fisheries, or both, in a specified area in the region.  It is stated all through the Bill that the Minister shall decide this, that and the other.  The Minister is being given too much control.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (3) says that the Minister may, by order, revoke or amend an order made under this section.  The same thing is stated in subsection (6).  The Minister will be a very busy man if, as well as running his Department, he has to run every co-operative in the country set up as a result of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 5 (1) states that the Minister may make rules for the regulation of societies and such rules shall constitute the rules of each society from its establishment. Subsection (2) states that the rules under this section shall, in relation to a society, provide in particular, for (a) the functions of the first trustees of the society; (b) the membership and functions of a management committee (including its functions as trustees) and the appointment, or election, and terms and conditions of office, of its members or any of them; (c) the quorum for meetings of the trustees or management committee of the society; (d) membership and termination of ordinary and corporate membership of the society and (e) ballots for the purposes of this Act. Subsection (2) (h) provides for the accounts of the society and the audit of its accounts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1581" /> Subsection (3) states that the Minister or a society, with the consent of the Minister, may revoke or amend the rules of the society.  The Minister can do what he likes with the societies if they are set up. The Minister has extraordinary control. Is such control necessary?  The whole idea and concept of co-operatives were that they would be a means of allowing angling clubs to co-operate in running their own affairs, such as restocking the lakes.  Co-operatives were not formed to hand back to the Minister full control of angling clubs and their affairs.  It would be very dangerous to do that and I hope that, by the time this debate is finished, the Minister will have the good sense to put down amendments.</P>
    <P>I would prefer if the Minister came back with an amended Bill and we would obviously co-operate in this regard.  It would be better to amend the Bill satisfactorily instead of the Opposition parties putting down amendments and the Government parties opposing them.  I am not sure what the junior Government partner will do because the Minister for Energy from that party represents the same constituency as I and he must have the same gut feeling as I have about this, that we are treading on dangerous ground.  As Deputy O'Sullivan said, that Minister tried to take credit for settling the whole thing.  I do not know if he will be interested in taking credit for this Bill and I do not know what attitude he or his party will take if they speak or vote on the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 7 reads:</P>
    <P>(1)  The first ordinary members of a society shall be&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the trustees appointed by the Minister under section 4 of this Act, and</P>
    <P>(b)  holders of annual share certificates for the year 1991.</P>
    <P>(2)  Any such trustee shall cease to be a member on ceasing to be a trustee.</P>
    <P>There is too much ministerial interference there.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1582" /> I do not understand the meaning behind section 8 which says:</P>
    <P>(1)  Any angling club or other body may become a corporate member of a society in accordance with the rules of the society.</P>
    <P>Then subsections (2) and (3) indicate what the Minister might do about that.</P>
    <P>Section 9 says:</P>
    <P>(1)  Where a society has so decided by vote or 60 per cent of its ordinary members eligible to vote and voting, a person shall not be entitled to angle for trout or coarse fish in the area of that society unless he is&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the holder of a current share certificate of that or any other society established under this Act.</P>
    <P>I can see why section 9 should be in the Bill.  Societies would have to have some control in relation to obliging people to become members, but where 60 per cent of a society decide, irrespective of the views of the other members, people will become eligible to have share certificates and so on.</P>
    <P>Section 10 outlines the fees which look all right on first reading: Subsection (1) reads:</P>
    <P>(1)  The categories of share certificates which may be granted by a society are&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  an annual certificate, for which the fee shall be £12.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) states:</P>
    <P>(2) The Minister may from time to time by order made after consultation with the Minister for Finance, alter any fee under subsection (1) of this section either without limitation as to time or in respect of a specified year or years, and any such order shall take effect at the beginning of the year following that in which it is made.</P>
    <P>I have to relate that to section 15 of the Bill.  Under section 10 the annual certificate fee shall be £12 but if we pass section 15 we give the Minister power to change that to whatever he likes, in <Col N="1583" /> consultation with the Minister for Finance, to be applicable on 1 January of the following year.  I was puzzled when I first read section 15 which says:</P>
    <P>A person who contravenes section 9 or 12 (3) of this Act shall be guilty of an offence and shall, on summary conviction, be liable to a fine not exceeding the lesser of the following amounts:</P>
    <P>(a)  £1,000, or</P>
    <P>The Minister created a doubt when he said in his speech £100, which was then corrected to £1,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a misprint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister acknowledged that he did not know whether it was £100 or £1,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a misprint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>The report will show what the Minister said at the time.  The Bill states that a fine not exceeding the lesser of the following amounts:</P>
      <P>(a)  £1,000, or</P>
      <P>(b)  ten times the fee for an annual share certificate in force at the time of commission of the offence.</P>
      <P>Ten times the suggested fee would be only £120 so perhaps that is why the Minister was confused.  That is a long way short of £1,000.  Why is £1,000 mentioned at all in section 15?  The only logical conclusion is that £1,000 is mentioned because it might be the intention of this or the future Minister to raise the annual fee to £100, perhaps in 1992 or 1993.  The figures would then coincide.  I would like the Minister to clarify that section of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious from section 9 that, if a society decide by a vote of 60 per cent of their ordinary members, anybody can be checked by a fisheries officer for a share certificate.  Does that not leave us back in the situation which the anglers were trying to avoid where people would be <Col N="1584" /> checked when they were out on the lake fishing?  How will the exempt categories under section 9 be defined when they are out with a rod?  During the earlier part of the rod licence dispute when anglers defied the licence and continued to fish, there was a case in Oughterard where an invalided person was knocked down in his boat by a fishery officer and seriously distressed and hurt.  How will we now know if a person out on the lake is under 18, is on invalidity pension or unemployment benefit, or is in receipt of an old age pension?</P>
    <P>Section 11 (5), (6) and (7) will have to be amended.  Subsection (7) reads:</P>
    <P>(7)  If the Minister at his discretion so permits, one other ballot may be held in the second or the third year between elections, on such date as the may fix for the purpose.</P>
    <P>The Minister could fix a date for such a meeting when the ordinary members would not have their share certificates paid up.  It gives far too much control to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 12 is another extraordinary section which will have to be debated line by line to tease out what exactly it is trying to achieve.  Section 12 (3) reads:</P>
    <P>(3)  Where a person is angling for trout or coarse fish in an area in which section 9 of this Act is in force or is in possession of a rod and line capable of being used for that purpose at a fishing place in that area or is going or returning from angling for trout or coarse fish at such a place, he shall, at the request of an authorised officer to whom subsection (1) of this section relates (on production, if demanded, of a certificate of his authority issued by the regional board of which he is such officer) give the officer his name and address and produce for his inspection, either then or within seven days of being requested to do so, a share certificate in his name current when the request was made.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) has already been referred to by Deputy Gilmore.  Is subsection (5) a means of indicating that section 12 will <Col N="1585" /> not be enacted?  Anybody caught with a rod and line in hand could claim as a good defence that they were manufacturing rods and were showing them to the other anglers.  Is subsection (5) meant to invalidate the whole of section 12?</P>
    <P>I have read the Bill and following the Minister's speech today I rushed up to my office to get the Bill because I thought we were talking about two different Bills. The Minister's speech was very nice.  I will have some of it quoted in the <i>Connacht Tribune</i> next week in addition to my own contribution.  I agreed with a great deal of what was in the Minister's speech.  He appeared to be a man after my own heart but the sentiments he expressed bore little relationship to what is in the Bill before us.  He said:</P>
    <P>The potential for development of this indigenous self renewing resource has been recognised since historical times...  It is a pity that was not recognised in December 1987 and because if it had been left alone, we could have got on with the business.  He went on to say:</P>
    <P>Trout and coarse fish were, however, for long regarded as the poor relation and were largely left to fend for themselves.</P>
    <P>That is not fair to the angling clubs.  From experience I know angling clubs over the past number of years have done tremendous voluntary work looking after and cleaning rivers which had lost all fish. They have cleaned and restocked rivers and lakes, even in the Minister's constituency. They have built harbours, jetties etc.  Far from the trout and coarse fish being left to fend for themselves, the Angling Clubs of Ireland, in a voluntary capacity, have looked after trout and coarse fish for a long number of years. The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>For some time past, however, there has been a realisation that these fisheries have considerable potential for development both as a pasttime for local anglers and as a amenity for tourist anglers from both home and <Col N="1586" /> abroad with very positive implications for income and employment generation.</P>
    <P>I could not agree more.  This is a much under-utilised resource.  There is the potential of the Corrib-Mask, for example, which is the only unpolluted free fishing lake in Europe.  It is worth hundreds of millions of pounds to our tourism revenue to have such a lake for the benefit of visiting anglers.</P>
    <P>I am beginning to feel very lonely in this Chamber.  Unfortunately, I have to refer to my absent colleague, the Minister for Energy, Deputy Molloy.  He was in the Chamber when our spokesperson, Deputy Taylor-Quinn, started her contribution, but following a few cross words between them he ran out of the Chamber. Similarly, last week when I was addressing the issue of Ministers serving on local authorities he left before my question came up.  I was sorry he was not available to answer it.</P>
    <P>We have on the Government benches only the lonely Minister for the Marine, Deputy Wilson.  He is a lonely man not because of his new status and I congratulate him on it &mdash; but because he appears to have been deserted all day.  I did not expect to get in on this Bill this evening.  I thought there would be some Fianna Fáil speaker offering after the Labour and The Workers' Party speakers.  To my surprise nobody offered, or nobody came back.  Are they behind the Bill?</P>

      <P>The Minister went on to talk about voluntary membership comprising all trout and coarse fish anglers with the State helping out in the early years with priming finance.  Why was this not left as it was, because voluntary work on fishery clubs has been going on for 100 years or more?  There has been voluntary work on conservation, restocking, cleaning waterways, rivers and lakes for many years. Angling clubs have built roads, jetties, boats, etc.  The Minister should have recognised some of that work.  The Minister also said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time the same interests continued to seek more and improved services and yet more Government spending in an environment where drastic measures were having to be taken to curtail Exchequer borrowing and cut back on public expenditure generally....  It is hoped to raise an <Col N="1588" /> extra £500,000 for inland fisheries development from these new arrangements.</P>
    <P>In the process of trying to raise that £500,000, which turned out to be £1,000 or £2,000, he lost the State an estimated £20 million revenue in the last two years.</P>

      <P>My colleague, Deputy McCormack, gave a wide ranging speech on the Bill.  I was a Member of the Seanad when the 1987 Bill was moved and I am glad to say that I was one of a number of Senators who spoke against it. I thought it was an ill-conceived Bill and I have no doubt that history will prove me correct.</P>
      <P>When the 1987 Bill was being debated in the Seanad we were misinformed by a member of the Government who stated he had got the full agreement of the fisheries boards and angling clubs to the introduction of a licence for coarse fishing. There has been much turmoil and hardship since that licence was introduced three years ago.  Many businesses have been destroyed and friendships ruined as a result of the rod licence dispute. It is very important we do not make the same mistake in this legislation.</P>
      <P>One of the main problems I had with the 1987 Bill was that the introduction of a licence for coarse fishing would prove very difficult to police.  There are 60 coarse fishing lakes within a ten mile radius in my area and I am sure there are as many lakes in the Minister's constituency. I do not understand how anybody could police 60 lakes within a ten mile radius to see if people had licences. It was beyond my comprehension how this could be done.  As it has turned out it could not be done but it caused much consternation and hassle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland was the only country in Europe offering free fishing facilities as a tourist attraction.  Bord Fáilte tried to convey to the Government at that time that our <Col N="1593" /> free fishing facilities were one of our best promotional features.  At the time the licence was introduced Bord Fáilte had produced their tourist brochures for 1989 &mdash; the Bill was rushed through before Christmas 1987 &mdash; giving details of our free fishing.  However, the tourists who came here were asked to pay a licence fee.</P>
    <P>The Bill is quite vague and raises many questions that need to be answered.  Like Deputy McCormack, I believe it is very important that we go through each section line by line on Committee Stage so that we do not make the mistakes we made previously.  From reading the Bill it seems the Minister is being given many powers.  For example, he will have the power to increase the price of the share certificate which at present costs £12. Under the Bill this can be increased at any stage on the advice of the Minister or the Minister for Finance.  This could have serious consequence for fishing clubs and fishing generally.</P>
    <P>As I said in the Seanad debate on the 1987 Bill, it is going to be difficult to police the provisions.  I want to refer to the share certificates which will be sold to tourists.  They will be able to purchase a share certificate for 21 days for £5. Will anglers buy these share certificates at guesthouses here or will they be given them before they come here on a fishing holiday?  That aspect has not been dealt with in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not believe we can promote Ireland as a holiday destination to the extent we could when we had the advantage of offering free fishing facilities. Many English and continental anglers visited my area because they knew they could fish in different lakes and did not have to pay any licence fee.  They had no problem with trying to get licences and that was a great incentive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 20,000 applicants on local authority housing lists. That figure understates the real need because thousands more are unable to get on a housing list because of the unrealistic income limit of £10,000 per annum which most local authorities apply.  The number on their housing lists is likely to increase by between 3,000 and 4,000 per annum for the foreseeable future, because as the recent ERU report on housing requirements states:</P>
      <P>Despite a static or falling population in most areas of the state in the period to 1993, these remains a degree of buoyancy in the area of household formation.</P>
      <P>What is the Government's response to the growing demand for housing?  Since 1987 the Government have been reducing the provision of local authority housing. Last year the number of house completions was 768, down from 7,002 in 1984.  For 1990, the Estimates provision was £51 million less than a quarter of the £206.5 million provided in 1984.  The number of house starts planned for 1990 was 1,200.  How many have actually started?  At this rate it will take 20 years to clear the existing housing lists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Member of this House knows the human hardship on families waiting for housing &mdash; the overcrowding, the family stress, and the rip-off by some of the private rented sector.  There is a housing crisis and it is worsening.  Those on the housing lists are becoming increasingly frustrated and housing authorities are becoming increasingly helpless.  This housing crisis contains the potential for <Col N="1595" /> the greatest social unrest in the State for over two decades.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, who I regret is not present for this debate, claims that there is no crisis and has repeatedly stated this in public.  We can no longer afford the luxury of a Cabinet Minister who will not even acknowledge the greatest single problem facing his Department.</P>
    <P>There are a specific number of things which I believe must now happen.  The Minister for the Environment must admit that there is a housing crisis.  If he fails to do so, he should resign.  The Taoiseach, when he is reshuffling his Cabinet, should appoint a Minister with specific responsibility for housing.</P>
    <P>The Government should adopt a three-year plan to bring down the housing lists, by committing themselves to the provision of 6,000 houses per annum over the next three years, either through construction, purchase, or sale and leaseback. This commitment should be reflected in the Estimates which are to be published shortly.</P>
    <P>Additional funds should be committed to assist the voluntary housing sector, which has proved that it is the most efficient, and cost-effective method of providing houses at prices that people can afford.</P>
    <P>The Minister should give the immediate go-ahead to housing schemes which have been proposed by local authorities, and local authorities should be given the freedom and responsibility to advance these schemes without departmental hindrance, so that those with the greatest housing need can be housed without further delay.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment has since 1987 presided over one of the worst housing records of any Minister since the foundation of this State.  It is now causing misery for many families.  My message to the Minister this evening is either to do the job or to hand it over to somebody who will show some understanding of the <Col N="1596" /> housing crisis.  It is the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment to resolve the housing crisis.  Far from resolving it, he has stated publicly that no housing crisis exists.  That situation cannot continue.  He must acknowledge that there is a housing crisis and do something about it or do the honourable thing and resign his post.</P>

      <P>I want to apologise for the absence of the Minister, who is abroad at an EC meeting.</P>
      <P>Since 1980, about 48,000 new local authority dwellings have been provided at a total capital cost of over £1.3 billion. In the same period, almost 90,000 first-time lettings were made to households on the waiting lists.</P>
      <P>Waiting lists peaked at 29,994 applicants in 1982.  Since then, the number of approved applicants declined significantly. By the end of 1989, numbers were down in total by over one third to about 19,400, with waiting periods almost halved.</P>
      <P>The housing prospects of all categories of applicants have improved over the period 1982 to 1989, and applicants who previously had little or no prospect of securing accommodation have been housed.  Many applicants still on waiting lists have declined reasonable offers of accommodation and are waiting for accommodation in a particular location.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>It has happened in many areas.  Against this background, it would have been irresponsible to maintain the local authority housing programme at the level of previous years.  This could not be justified in terms of real housing needs, or the critical need to restore order to the public finances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The September 1989 assessment of housing needs included, for the first time in many areas, homeless persons and single persons who were not elderly.  It <Col N="1597" /> was a more thorough assessment than had been carried out before.  The September 1989 figure was 19,400 households, compared to the 17,700 households on the lists at the end of December 1988.  However, the figure of 19,400 was still way below the 30,000 on the waiting lists in December 1982.</P>
    <P>The capital available this year to housing authorities for their housing programmes is £51 million, an increase of one third on 1989.  Of this sum, £33 million is for the provision of additional houses.  This represents an increase of over 50 per cent on last year's allocation and reverses the trend of previous years. The increased provision for the programme enabled an expanded programme to be undertaken.  This will give about 1,300 new starts this year.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that up to 5,000 first-time lettings will be made to applicants on the waiting lists in 1990 &mdash; over 1,000 from new house completions plus about 4,000 from vacancies in existing stock.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, increased state expenditure on the voluntary housing programme provided new accommodation for about 500 households in 1990.  Almost all of these would be qualified for local authority housing.</P>
    <P>Finally, I can assure the House that the local authority housing programme and the voluntary housing programme will continue to provide a reasonable response to the housing needs of persons on approved waiting lists.</P>

      <P>Deputy Nuala Fennell gave me notice of her intention to raise on the Adjournment the need for action to provide information for the <Col N="1598" /> medical profession on the likely consequences for daughters whose mothers were prescribed DES, diethylstilboestrol, in line with European Resolution of May 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for allowing me to raise this important issue this evening and thank the Minister for coming into the House to reply.  Diethylstilboestrol, or DES, is a hormone drug which was widely used in Ireland in the forties, fifties and sixties to prevent miscarriages. Indeed, the use of DES was accepted medical practice until 1970.  In 1971, it was discovered that DES could cause a rare type of vaginal cancer in young women whose mothers had taken the drug during pregnancy.  It is now known that approximately one out of every 1,000 DES daughters will develop this rare form of cancer.  As well as this, up to half of all DES daughters will have some kind of fertility problem, for example, ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage or premature labour and delivery.  Many have malformed uteri and Fallopian tubes.  In speaking about diethylstilboestrol I want to make quite sure that people understand that it is different from stilboestrol which was used by many women during that period to suppress breast milk.</P>
      <P>Because of the known risks, DES daughters need special screening examinations. These women should be made aware of this fact.  More importantly, members of the medical profession, in particular GPs and gynaecologists, should be informed and alerted to likely problems and treatments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, only the Council for the Status of Women are taking action to provide information in this area.  More recently, positive action was taken by the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, which has now opened a DES clinic under the direction of Dr. Mary Wingfield specifically to provide specialist care for women referred to it.  Health departments and governments in other <Col N="1599" /> countries have dealt comprehensively with the information and medical needs of women but I regret to say that the Department of Health here are silent. Government and departmental action is vital on this issue because (a) doctors need to be alerted now to the problems and (b) women at risk need to be informed of the facts.  This should be done in order to spare women, who may be DES daughters and are not aware of this fact, having to go through unnecessary treatment and pointless investigations for unknown factors related to fertility and pregnancy.  They may have to undergo these investigations because the doctor dealing with them may not be aware of outstanding issues.</P>
    <P>We do not know how many women are involved because no statistics on DES daughters are available.  From inquiries the Council for the Status of Women have established that the prescribing of diethylstiboestrol was widespread in the fifties and sixties and this is in conflict with the claim of the Department of Health that DES was not widely used here.  I do not want to cause alarm but if the issue was taken seriously and the matter did not have to be raised in the House, there would not be alarm.  I now call on the Minister, in line with the European Resolution of May 1989, to identify women exposed to DES, to provide resources to inform and educate health care professionals about DES, to recognise the need for further research on DES exposure and to provide realistic funding for the programme I have described.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon) Rory O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was raised by Deputy Fennell in a question on Thursday last, 29 November 1990.  In my reply to that question I indicated that the health promotion unit of my Department have had consultations with the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland with a view to preparing suitable material for <Col N="1600" /> distribution in relation to DES.  This material, which will be circulated to the medical profession, should be available for distribution within the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>However, no information is available on the extent of prescribing of DES in Ireland during the forties, fifties and sixties. I would be very interested to hearing from Deputy Fennell if she has information to the contrary because the expert bodies which should have the information do not have it available to them at present.  We should contrast the position in the United States, where DES was widely advertised and widely used, with the position here where in the early sixties, the then Master of the National Maternity Hospital decided that when looking after women, in the areas of gynaecology and obstetrics, there should be the minimum use of drugs.  This would seem to suggest that DES was not widely prescribed in this country.</P>
      <P>However, I am very conscious of the concern in relation to the possible development of cancers related to DES in the daughters of women who may have been prescribed diethylstilboestrol.  At the same time it is important that we approach this issue in a cautious and controlled manner to ensure we do not raise unnecessary fears and anxieties among women about possibility of developing cancer, because these vaginal cancers are extremely rare and, as I said, we have had consultations with the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, through the Health Promotion Unit, and the decision made was to prepare literature for distribution to the medical profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both my Department and the medical profession are very much aware of the problems associated with DES.  Indeed, as far back as 1975, the National Drugs Advisory Board drew attention to this matter.  In more recent times, my colleague, the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Noel Treacy, had a meeting with members of the Council for <Col N="1601" /> the Status of Women to discuss a number of issues relating to women's health, including DES.  As Deputy Fennell pointed out, a special unit has recently been established at the National Maternity Hospital and this will play a critical role in establishing the extent of DES related problems in this country.</P>
    <P>As the hospital campaign develops there may well be a role for my Department, through the Health Promotion Unit, in augmenting and supporting the professional and medical expertise which the Deputy will accept is of fundamental importance.  I do not consider it would be proper to carry out a mass information or screening programme at this time because of the fears and anxieties this would create, particularly since I have indicated that prescribing DES in this country would appear to have been very limited.  It is my view that at this time the most appropriate way in which to continue to deal with this matter would be to ensure that all the information available is channelled through the medical profession with whatever assistance my Department can render.  We keep this matter under review and if action is necessary we will take it as appropriate, but the correct way to proceed is to keep in contact with the experts, the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fennell also referred to the resolution adopted by the European Parliament which requested the Commission to undertake certain investigations on this issue and to report back to the Parliament. If such investigations or anything that might be contained in the Commission's report warrant further or different action on our part, that is something I would be prepared to consider. In the meantime I am satisfied that the approach we have taken is the proper one in all the circumstances.  This will ensure that women who may be affected as a result of DES will be provided with proper medical care and treatment in the appropriate context and setting.</P>

      <P>Deputy Owen has given me notice of her intention to raise on the Adjournment the matter of the provision of education facilities for the many children of the travelling community about to be settled in Mulhuddart, County Dublin before Christmas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this matter with the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>Twice in the past couple of weeks I have endeavoured to raise the implications of a 30-family halting site at Mulhuddart in north County Dublin with the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn.  Twice the Minister indicated that he had no ministerial responsibility in the matter.  Yet, as reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> today, I discover that the same Minister &mdash; because he was approached by Deputy Tunney of his own party &mdash; has now called for a major investigation into the provision of sites of this size in north County Dublin.  I want to say how angry I am that the Minister would make an exception of somebody from his party and not be prepared to come here and tell me what investigation he will carry out.</P>
      <P>Despite extreme warnings on the part of members of Dublin County Council and a section 4 motion ordering the manager not to proceed with this unwise proposal of such a large site, the Manager of Dublin County Council, Mr. John Prendergast, is insisting on going with its provision.  Assuming that he will succeed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I granted the Deputy permission to raise an educational aspect of this matter, specifically educational, with the Minister for <Col N="1603" /> Education or the Minister of State who is present.  I must say I deprecate the fact that the Deputy has referred to matters appertaining to another Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am about to raise the matter of education.  If the manager succeeds in providing this site I would like to raise with the Minister the serious implications for the education of these children moving onto the site.  Travelling families, on average, have approximately six children.  Bearing in mind that there will be provision for 30 families and that some of the children will be babies, there will be approximately 100 to 120 children requiring education, mostly of a primary nature.</P>
      <P>Since the winding up of the National Council for Travellers there have been no full-time education workers available to assess the educational needs of these children.  There are also no school attendance officers in County Dublin.  I have been unable to ascertain how many children from the travelling community are not attending.</P>
      <P>I want to know from the Minister what responsibility she is taking to provide for the educational needs of these children? For example, will she be demanding that local schools take in these children when those schools are already bulging at the seams, requiring remedial teachers for many deprived children attending them? The schools are already engaged in heavy fund-raising activites to provide minimal services at their schools.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister consider providing a special school, as was done in 1969 at Labre Park in Ballyfermot, when a 39-family site was opened there?  Will she provide pre-school classes for those children on the site, once opened.  The site was to be provided before Christmas but, because of difficulties encountered on the site, may not be made available before Christmas.  I might add some people have been jailed because of their opposition to this site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1604" /> I contend the Minister for Education has not taken sufficiently seriously the position of travelling children in the Mulhuddart/Blanchardstown area, with no assessment having been made of their educational requirements.  I have endeavoured to discover whether there has been any assessment undertaken of places now available even for settled children, let alone these additional children of the travelling community.  I have been told by a number of schools that they do not have any places whatsoever available for any children.  If the Minister insists on local schools taking in these travelling children I want to know whether she will provide 100 per cent capital assistance to cover the extra teachers, accommodation and all the back-up facilities required for the proper education of deprived children of the travelling community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey) Frank Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very conscious of the difficulties faced by the large travelling community in the Mulhuddart/Blanchardstown area and of the need to provide educational facilities for their children.</P>
      <P>Already, two schools in the Blanchardstown area, St. Patrick's and St. Francis Xavier, between them are successfully operating three special classes for 47 traveller children, and two others, Blakestown Senior and Huntstown, have indicated their willingness to accommodate a further 30 children.</P>
      <P>I am aware also that 35 children can be accommodated in North William Street and Gardiner Street schools and am prepared to pay 98 per cent of the transport cost to those locations, should such an arrangement contribute in the short term. Placement in these city centre locations would be an interim measure only pending the provision of facilities in the Mulhuddart-Blanchardstown area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard my officials have ascertained that the authorities in St. Mochta's School, Clonsilla, and in St. Bridget's <Col N="1605" /> boys and girls' schools, Blanchardstown, have also indicated a willingness to assist.</P>
    <P>In addition, negotiations are in hand or will shortly be initiated with further schools in the area.  My Department will provide every encouragement and support to enable those schools to provide places for traveller children.  I accord the highest priority to the educational welfare of traveller children and provide practical support through such means as a preferential pupil/teacher ratio and capitation grant.  Special classes are established to cater for travellers in their own area, regardless of the duration of their stay in the area or the nature of their circumstances.</P>
    <P>Traveller children may also enrol in ordinary classes in national schools. Indeed, this is a practice which I would encourage.</P>
    <P>I will be keeping a close watch on developments in the Mulhuddart/ Blanchardstown area and will provide whatever assistance I can, within available resources.</P>
    <P>I have noted carefully Deputy Owen's comments and will endeavour to establish the position in regard to some of the points she has raised.  I agree with the Deputy's sentiments with regard to the need for much greater care in the education of traveller children.  I would hope to have the matter examined further and respond to the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann <Col N="1606" /> Comhairle, for allowing me raise this matter in the House this evening.</P>
      <P>I want to express my dissatisfaction at the method of paying European Social Fund grants to students attending five colleges under the jurisdiction of Dublin Vocational Education Committee.  There are involved approximately 4,500 college students following a variety of courses. Their frustration and anger has reached such a point I believe they are planning an immediate walk-out from their studies. I can understand their annoyance since their first grant payment was effected on 2 November last and no subsequent payment has been made.  I understand there will not be another payment until 18 December, almost seven weeks since the first payment.  In the meantime those students must pay for their accommodation, provide for their food and daily living expenses.</P>
      <P>This delay has been occasioned by a reluctance on the part of the Dublin Vocational Education Committee to provide adequate staff to administer these moneys, already deposited from Europe. The Department must also shoulder some responsibility.  They are responsible for these payments and should ensure punctual disbursement or modify the system or frequency of payments for the benefit of students.  Approximately £150,000 per week is involved.  I hope the Dublin Vocational Education Committee are not callously delaying payment in order to gain interest on the money on deposit.  The losers are the students and their families who are heavily subsidising their children's education.  I plead with the Minister to have this problem resolved immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I wish to raise the question of the pupil-teacher ratio in the Blackrock-Booterstown area.  I have received quite a number of representations from constituents who have children in Booterstown national school, Guardian Angels national school and Hollypark national school about what <Col N="1607" /> they consider a very serious situation in connection with the number of pupils in these very excellent schools in their communities. The national school system is one of the jewels in the educational crown.  I would ask the Minister to kindly investigate the complaints from the many representations I have received from the parents and from many of the young pupils who are suffering under this disability of too many pupils for too few teachers.</P>
      <P>In voicing the second of my concerns in grievance time, again I express the concern of many people in the community of Dún Laoghaire.  The National College of Art has built up a wonderful reputation over the years, and I am now calling on the Government and our very able Minister for Education to undertake to ensure that the College of Art is not interfered with or diminished in its educational value to the community in Dún Laoghaire and nationally.  I would very much appreciate if the Government would give a commitment to increasing the value which they attach to this educational establishment as part of the contribution to the overall educational welfare of the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>St. Brendan's national school in Loughshinny and St. Catherine's national school in Rush are in serious need of a remedial teacher.  They are by national standards quite small schools with 168 pupils in St. Brendan's and approximately 230 in St. Catherine's, but there is a very high requirement for remedial teaching, above the average one would expect in this locality.  I am asking the Minister to make an allocation of a shared &mdash; I am not even looking for a single teacher for each school &mdash; remedial teacher for both these schools.  St. Catherine's school is mainly serving children in a large council estate and it has over 60 pupils assessed as requiring remedial teaching.  In St. Brendan's school in 1986 a psychologist from <Col N="1608" /> Temple Street Hospital assessed a number of children as requiring remedial teaching.  Therefore, I ask the Minister earnestly to consider these children. There is an attitude that just because they might be living at a reasonably good address outside the city centre they do not require remedial teaching, but once they are assessed as requiring it, their need is as much as that of any other child in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the question of a new vocational school for Johnstown, County Kilkenny.  The Minister will be aware that students there are living in a shanty town of prefabs which were provided in the late sixties at the time of the provision of free education, and now those prefabs are in very bad repair.  I am aware the school was sanctioned as far back as 1982 and in 1984 and 1988 it was reviewed.  In December 1988 the school was sanctioned for 400 pupils and in November 1990 a further delay by the Department of Education was mooted due to the fact that it was to undergo a further review.  In view of the closure of schools in Freshford and Durrow, the population increase in the large catchment area around Johnstown and the prospect of a major mining industry in the area should indicate to the Department the urgency of providing a new vocational school for Johnstown as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey) Frank Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. F. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the question from Deputy McGrath, ESF grants were paid monthly in arrears to trainees in third level vocational education committee colleges who were participating in approved ESF grant programmes. It is the responsibility of the vocational education committees concerned to ensure prompt payment of the grant.  My Department wrote to each relevant vocational education committee in October reminding them of the necessity to avoid late payments.  I understand payments <Col N="1609" /> this year for the trainees concerned are no later than in previous years. However, if the Deputy has specific evidence of unusually late payments I will be glad to have them examined if he brings them to my attention.</P>
      <P>In regard to Deputy Andrews's first question, the current pupil-teacher ratio based on the projected enrolment in September 1990 and the number of teachers currently employed in national schools is 26.7:1.  It is possible, in view of the general decline in the population, that the actual enrolment in 1990 will be less than that projected, thereby giving a more favourable pupil-teacher ratio.  As agreed with the Central Review Committee, my Department have implemented a reduction of one point in the staffing schedule at primary level from I September 1990.  Each unit improvement in the staffing schedule will cost in the region of £8 million to £9 million per annum, as approximately 500 teachers will be required for each improvement.  The issue of class sizes in national schools will be reviewed in the context of the ongoing discussions under the programme for economic and national recovery.  There is a need to recognise that there have been significant improvements over the years.  However, each improvement brings with it a substantial cost tag which has to be assessed against the cost of other eagerly sought improvements in the educational system. The question of improving the pupil-teacher ratio in national schools is currently under discussion with the social partners in the context of the ongoing negotiations under the programme for economic and national recovery.  I cannot pre-empt those negotiations, but I will concur with the Deputy in expressing my wish to see improvement in the pupil-teacher ratio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next question from Deputy Andrews was on the College of Art and Design at Dún Laoghaire.  The college has submitted to my Department proposals for its future development.  These <Col N="1610" /> proposals envisage a doubling of student numbers over the next few years, an expansion in the number of courses on offer, an upgrading of its academic staff and extra administrative and technical staff as well as the cost of refurbishment and new equipment to cater for the proposed expansion.  The proposals are being examined at present and meetings have already taken place between Dún Laoghaire Vocational Education Committee and officials in my Department.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question from Deputy Owen about remedial teachers in the national schools at Loughshinny and Rush, remedial education at primary level is a matter in the first instance for the ordinary class teachers.  The majority of pupils with remedial needs will, therefore, be helped within the scope of the normal service.  Where need is particularly acute additional teaching staff may be appointed in particular schools to assist in remedial training.  Remedial posts are allocated on the basis of priority of need.  The availability of such posts depends on the overall level of resources available to my Department.  The Deputy will be aware that, despite difficult financial circumstances, the Minister sanctioned 30 additional remedial posts in primary schools in 1989-90.  However, Loughshinny and Rush national schools were not placed sufficiently high in order of priority to warrant the allocation of a post.  I intend to keep the appointment of further remedial teachers under review.</P>
    <P>While I recognise the need for more remedial teachers, my personal experience on this question is that the demand for remedial teachers is no greater now than it was ten years ago but for whatever reason every school in the country now seems to demand a remedial teacher.  I do not accept that is necessary.</P>
    <P>Finally, from Deputy Phil Hogan an old chestnut between himself and myself on numerous occasions.  Johnstown vocational school in County Kilkenny is a single school, as he has pointed out, in a post-primary area catered for by the <Col N="1611" /> vocational education committee.  The school has a current enrolment of 317 and accommodation for 300 pupils, much of which is in prefabricated buildings.  An extension is currently at an advanced stage of architectural planning.</P>
    <P>However, in common with other projects in the Department's second level building programme, the project at Johnstown has been subject to critical review in the light of all relevant factors, including the most up to date statistical data and demographic trends.  Officials in my Department have had discussions on the matter recently with representatives of Kilkenny Vocational Education Committee with particular reference to the <Col N="1612" /> estimated long term enrolments for the catchment area.</P>
    <P>All aspects of the case are being reviewed in the light of the circumstances advanced by the vocational education committee representatives and a decision on the provision to be made to meet long term pupil needs is imminent.</P>
    <P>I take Deputy Hogan's point that this has been a long running issue and was raised by his colleague Deputy Aylward also.  I understand the frustration being caused by the continuing delay but I assure the House that we will attempt to have progress on this project in the near future.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 6.45 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 7 December 1990.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>The European Council meeting in Dublin on 28 April 1990 confirmed its commitment to political union and decided that a detailed examination would be put in hand by the Foreign Ministers on the need for possible treaty amendments with the aim of strengthening the democratic legitimacy of the union, enabling the Community and its Institutions to respond efficiently and effectively to the demands of the new situation and assuring unity and coherence in the Community's international action.</P>
      <P>The decision to call the Inter-governmental Conference on Political Union was taken at the European Council in Dublin on 25-26 June 1990. The Intergovernmental Conference will adopt its own agenda and conclude its work rapidly with the objective of ratification by member states before the end of 1992.</P>
      <P>The conclusions of the European Council meeting in Rome on 27-28 October, which were approved by Ireland, state that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Council confirmed the will progressively to transform the Community into a European Union by developing its political dimension, strengthening its capacity for action <Col N="1523" /> and extending its powers to other supplementary sectors of economic integration which are essential for convergence and social cohesion. European Union will be the culmination of a progressive process agreed by common accord among the member states; it will evolve with due regard being paid to national identities and to the principle of subsidiarity, which will allow a distinction to be made between matters which fall within the union's jurisdiction and those which must remain within the national jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Since then the preparatory work has been continuing at an intensive pace.  The General Affairs Council on Tuesday last (4 December) decided to forward to the European Council a report covering the four areas that will be considered by the Intergovernmental Conference on Political Union.  These are the scope of political union, democratic legitimacy, efficiency and effectiveness of the institutions and common foreign and security policy.  Ireland has participated fully in the preparatory stages of the conference and we have made our views clear on issues of particular importance to us.</P>
    <P>We have now come to the end of the preparatory phase.  I do not wish to anticipate the negotiations that will take place at the Intergovernmental Conference on Political Union or the Conference on Economic and Monetary Union which will open on 15 December.  However, we may wish to make proposals on specific issues or join with other member states or the Commission in putting forward proposals during the conferences.</P>
    <P>I would recall that the principles on which Ireland's approach to the Inter-governmental Conferences is based have already been spelled out by the Taoiseach in his statement to the Dáil on 1 November which also outlines the main issues under consideration.  The principles are:</P>
    <P>First, that the development of political integration should be based on a growing community of interests in the economic and social field.  Progress in the latter area <Col N="1524" /> which is after all the main focus of the Treaty of Rome's objective to eliminate the barriers dividing Europe, will shape the pace of developments in the former. In short, progress is the economic and social fields must be the basis on which progress in the area of political union is made.</P>
    <P>Second, the Community has proved its political role as a unifying force in Europe, based on its democratic values, success in improving the living and working standards of its peoples, its commitment to international peace and prosperity and its openness to the rest of Europe and the wider world.  Nothing in the current exercise should diminish the constructive and flexible character of this role.</P>
    <P>Third, the two IGCs on political union and on economic and monetary union should mark a significant and coherent advance in the internal efficacy and deepening of the Community and the ability of the Community and its member states to work more closely and constructively with other countries of Europe and internationally.</P>
    <P>Fourth, the development of the Treaty to cover new areas of policy must proceed on the basis of the existing obligation of the Community and the member states under the Treaty to strengthen the Community's economic and social cohesion and, in particular, to reduce regional disparities and the backwardness of the least-favoured regions.  With this goal in mind it would be unreal to consider extending the scope of Treaty competences without addressing the scale of financial resources required to meet the new objectives and to implement new common policies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity to inform the House that negotiations for the accession of Namibia to the Lomé Convention have been concluded and that the instrument of accession will shortly be signed.  Under the terms of accession, Namibia will be granted a quota for the import of beef and veal at a reduced rate of levy in accordance with the relevant Protocol.  The quota for Namibia has been set at 10,500 tonnes <Col N="1526" /> for the first two years, rising to 13,000 tonnes for the following three years.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the importance of the issue for the economic development of Namibia, Ireland supported the provision of an appropriate beef quota for Namibia. Consistent with our record of support for Namibian independence, I welcome the agreement that has now been concluded between the Community and that country.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 27, 30, 38 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>Deputies will recall my comprehensive statement to the Dáil on 31 October on the situation in Cambodia.  In that statement I gave a full account of developments with regard to the ongoing negotiations for peace in Cambodia and particularly those relating to the framework for a settlement agreed by the Five Permanent Members of the United Nations Security Council.  I indicated that resolutions on the framework plan had been adopted by consensus both by the Security Council and the General Assembly in September and October respectively, which were very welcome and positive developments.  I also restated the central elements of Government policy on Cambodia including the situation in relation to aid for Cambodia and our wish to ensure that there be no return to power of the murderous Pol Pot Khmer Rouge.</P>
      <P>Since my statement of 31 October, there have been further developments. On 9-10 November in Jakarta, a working group meeting was convened by the two co-chairman of the Paris International Conference on Cambodia, France and Indonesia.  That meeting reached consensus on a draft comprehensive political settlement developed directly from the framework agreement.  It is envisaged that this draft agreement could, after consideration by the co-ordinating committee of the Paris conference, be submitted for adoption by a fully reconvened Paris conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Five Permanent Members of the Security Council met in Paris from 23-26 November.  The Five reviewed the positive results of the November Jakarta meeting and approved the draft agreed at that meeting.  The Five also reiterated the urgent need for the Cambodians <Col N="1528" /> themselves to contribute to the peace process by reaching final agreement on the composition of the Supreme National Council, so as to enable the Paris conference to be reconvened.</P>
    <P>The difficulties surrounding the chairmanship of the Supreme National Council, which I adverted to in my statement of 31 October, have not yet been resolved.  There is an urgent and compelling need for the Cambodian parties to resolve their differences in a spirit of flexibility and compromise.  The considerable efforts of the international community to bring peace to Cambodia must be paralleled by a corresponding commitment by the Cambodians themselves. Mutual recrimination and condemnation is a sterile exercise, all the more so as the ordinary people of Cambodia continue to suffer greatly from the effects of the ongoing conflict.  I call on the Cambodian parties to reach early and definitive agreement on the composition of the Supreme National Council.</P>
    <P>Deputies will, I know, understand that I cannot enter into a discussion of television programmes on international issues, although I am very aware of the constructive role the media can play in heightening public awareness of the Cambodian tragedy.  I remain deeply conscious of the strong public interest in Cambodia and the desire of the Irish people to see peace and justice prevail there.  I share this desire.</P>
    <P>I continue to be hopeful that the Paris International Conference on Cambodia will be reconvened as soon as possible, in order that final agreement can be reached on a comprehensive settlement.  I call, once again, on all the Cambodian parties to cease hostilities in order to create the necessary environment to facilitate progress towards a political settlement.  We must not allow the positive momentum for peace to dissipate.  I will continue to do everything in my power to promote the cause of peace and reconciliation in Cambodia.</P>

      <Quest>whether the short form of birth certificate is acceptable for the purposes of an application being made by or on behalf of a child for a passport; and if not, if he will give consideration to the acceptance of the short form of birth certificate, particularly in the context of adopted children.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Passport Office require that applications being made by or on behalf of a child, including an adopted child, should be accompanied by the long form of the child's birth certificate.  The reason for this requirement is that this form of birth certificate contains information which is essential for the proper processing of such applications.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, the father and the mother of a child are its joint guardians, subject to any qualifying court order as provided for in the Act.  To safeguard the rights of parents as laid down in the Act, the Passport Office require that the written witnessed consents of both parents be obtained when an application is being made by or on behalf of a child.  To ensure that those giving the consents are in fact the child's parents, the long form of the birth certificate which names the child's parents is also required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of an adopted child, the Passport Office not only require the written witnessed consent of the child's guardians but also proof of the child's Irish citizenship.  The question of the citizenship of an adopted child is addressed in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956.  Under its terms a child, who is not already an Irish citizen, becomes <Col N="1532" /> one upon an adoption order being made under Irish adoption law, provided that at least one of the adoptive parents is an Irish citizen.  The long form of the birth certificate issued in such cases indicates not only the names of the adoptive parents &mdash; which enables the validity of the consents to be checked &mdash; but also the country of birth of the child.  If it transpires that the child was not born in Ireland, the parents are required to prove that at least one of them is an Irish citizen.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, as the Deputy is aware, the short form of the birth certificate gives only the name, sex and date of birth of the person named in the certificate as well as the district where the birth was registered.  As such it clearly does not contain sufficient information to deal with the types of applications mentioned by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>It is long-standing Government policy to channel financial assistance, including assistance to the victims of apartheid, through international organisations, such as the United Nations and the European Community.  As I informed the House on 31 October, the Government have made £25,000 available to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for his special programme to assist the return of exiles to South Africa.  Members of the ANC, of course, stand to benefit from such assistance.</P>

He was subsequently charged with a breach of Article 24 of the Foreigners Residence Law which requires that foreigners under work contracts in Iraq must have an exit visa in order to leave the country.  He has admitted to the Iraqi authorities that he tried to leave Iraq without first securing an exit visa.  Following his arrest, he was moved to detention in a Baghdad hotel where the ambassador visited him on 2 September.</P>
      <P>Since that date, the embassy has been active to ensure that his consular rights are fully respected and safeguarded, and that the due process of law be expedited. The embassy has visited him on a number of occasions and has maintained regular contacts with the citizen, his lawyer and with representatives of his company.

A seminar of experts on national minorities is to be convened in Geneva in July 1991.  This will, <i>inter alia,</i> consider new measures aimed at improving the implementation of CSCE commitments in the field of minorities, and will no doubt make recommendations for consideration by Governments.  To date, the CSCE has not, however, adopted international legal instruments which are binding on member states or which confer enforceable rights on individuals.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to Deputies Owen and Quinn on the same question on 14 June 1990, the question of the opening by Israel of an Embassy in Ireland is a matter for discussion between the two Governments concerned and it would be inappropriate and contrary to international practice to speculate publicly on any such discussions before they have been concluded and an announcement made.</P>

      <P>In my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 63 of 31 October 1990, I explained that, because of the multiplicity of expenditure headings involved and the difficulty in many cases of isolating Presidency costs from the normal running costs of Departments, it is not practicable to give exact details of the cost to the Exchequer of the Presidency of the European Communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1537" /> With this qualification, it is estimated that the total additional cost to my Department arising out of the Presidency in 1984 and 1990 was £807,400 and £2,576,594 respectively.</P>

      <P>It is for the UN Security Council to decide on peace-keeping operations and to agree upon a mandate authorising <Col N="1538" /> the participation of any military and civilian personnel, including police, in such operations.  Once a mandate has been agreed by the Security Council the Secretary General chooses to make a request to those countries whom he considers acceptable for political and operational reasons to provide such personnel as he considers appropriate.</P>
      <P>Ireland has a consistent record of responding favourably to requests from the UN Secretary General to provide military and civilian personnel.  To date, Ireland has been asked on only one occasion to supply police personnel for a peace-keeping operation.  This was in Namibia where 50 gardaí served as police monitors in the UN Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) in the period leading to the independence of that country.  The only other UN peace-keeping operation that includes a civilian police component is the UN Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) for which Ireland was asked to provide military personnel only.</P>
      <P>The UN Secretariat is aware that the Government will always give careful consideration to any request for support for a UN peace-keeping operation.  It would be for the Government to evaluate whether in the circumstances of the time it was possible for us to respond favourably to such a request.</P>

      <Quest>the reason payment of unemployment assistance to a person whose spouse is in receipt of a social welfare pension is capped at a level equivalent to the adult dependant allowance on a pension, particularly in view of the commitment to equality of treatment.</Quest>

      <P>Implementation of Directive 79/7/EEC meant that for the first time a married woman living with her husband could qualify for unemployment assistance on the same basis as other claimants. This necessitated certain changes in the means assessment provisions and these were provided for in the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 12 (4) of that Act contained a provision whereby the overall amount payable to a married couple where one spouse was in receipt of unemployment assistance and the other was in receipt of a social insurance payment would be <Col N="1544" /> limited to that which would be payable if only one of the couple claimed and received an increase in respect of the other as an adult dependant.  The effect of these provisions is that the total amount payable to a household where one spouse is entitled to a benefit and the other spouse is entitled to unemployment assistance is the amount deemed appropriate for such households.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1989, which re-enacted section 12 of the 1985 Act, extended the limitation to cohabiting couples.</P>
    <P>A review group on the treatment of households in the social welfare system was set up in May 1989 to examine the social welfare code in so far as it affects households, with particular regard to the equal treatment provisions.  The group have been asked to report by the end of this year.  When the report is available it will be examined by the Government to determine what changes, if any, in the social welfare code are necessary.</P>
