      <P>While I am on my feet let me ask the Taoiseach if he will inform the House about discussions which I understand are going on between his party, the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party with regard to the ordering of the Business of the House.  I understand the Whips' meetings were intended to assist in the ordering of the work of this House.  Why do these Whips' meetings seem now to be ignored and why is it necessary for private meetings of this kind to take place?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;regarding a serious matter, the <i>St. Columba</i> which was in difficulties in the Irish Sea.  Understandably, the Minister was not in a position to provide information yesterday. I ask that I be allowed to raise the matter on the Adjournment and that the Minister be allowed make a statement during the day in view of the fact that 250 passangers and crew were adrift for ten hours in very dangerous and difficult circumstances.</P>

      <P>I wrote to you yesterday, Sir, concerning a Private Notice Question about the collapse of Ballybay Meat Exports in County Monaghan.  I would be delighted if you would let me know your ruling on the matter because it is of urgent public importance.  There is £3 million of taxpayers' money buried in that project, a project evaluated by the IDA only nine months ago, and I understand the Minister for Agriculture and Food initiated investigations.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I would like to raise a matter of order and procedure with you.  Last year while the budget debate proceeded you ruled out of order a large number of questions, particularly those directed to the Minister for Finance. Finance questions will be taken next Thursday and to enable me and the other spokespersons on Finance to frame Priority Questions which will not be ruled out of order by you and leave the Order Paper blank, I would like you to advise me what you will be ruling out in terms of the scope of the budget debate as most aspects of financial policy are referred to in the budget?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank, you, a Cheann Comhairle.  It is very generous of you to put it in that way.  I will, of course, await your decision with keen anticipation.</P>
      <P>On the issues before us there are some general points which should be made and which might be overlooked in the reaction to the details of the budget.  I am bound to say, a Cheann Comhairle, that what I might call the orange juice and champagne breakfast brigade have been very active.  I am sure all Members have received several copies this morning of these reactions, some of them providing a great deal of food for thought, some indeed taking a lot of the shine off the presentation yesterday of the Minister for Finance of his budgetary proposals.</P>
      <P>On a more general level we should look at what this House can do in order to ensure a better future for our people, which is what we want to do.  We are now in a position in which wise political action can secure gains for our people.  It was difficult to get to that position.  Indeed the economic history of the eighties was marked by an unremitting battle waged against the debt built up in the late seventies. The Fine Gael Party played an honourable role, for the greater part of that period, as the only political party in this House which consistently put the national interest first.  We used our parliamentary strength, both in Government and Opposition, to tackle the debt crisis.  From the mini budget of July 1981, through the term of office of the Government from 1982 to 1987, we took action. We consistently put that objective before the people in successive general elections during that period.  From 1987 to 1989 we took a revolutionary step, that is revolutionary for an Opposition party, of supporting decisions which, while necessary, were often unpopular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In September 1987 I explained in detail why I had adopted that approach.  I told the Tallaght Chamber of Commerce that, <Col N="380" /> when we strip away all the rhetoric and get down to what really matters in the day-to-day life of ordinary people, the resolution of our public finance problems constitutes that essential key to everything we want to do in the economic and social fields, to everything we want to do in order to provide for our people the conditions in which they can live their lives in the way we believe is right.  In other words, I said that what I want for the Irish people cannot happen until our debt burden is brought under control.  It was for that reason that we fought against an irresponsible Fianna Fáil Party right throughout the eighties.  It is for that reason that Fine Gael and I supported economic sanity while we were in Opposition from 1987 to 1989.  That is why the issue of debt control was the dominant one of the decade just finished.  We must never again allow the future of our country and the welfare of our people to be sabotaged by economic recklessness. My party will continue to hold fast to that fundamental principle.</P>
    <P>Control of our debt is essential but it is very clear from what I have said that it can never be an end in itself.  Now that the economic indicators are moving in the right direction &mdash; and there is no doubt that they are moving in the right direction &mdash; we must single-mindedly direct our energies to creating a better and more equitable society.  My party and I will apply the same resolution, the same firmness of purpose, to tackling poverty and inequity in the nineties as we did to tackling our debt in the eighties.  I have no doubt but that our efforts in that respect will meet with the same success that has attended our work in relation to debt control.</P>
    <P>Everybody now agrees that, with the turn our financial situation has taken, we are poised for growth.  That growth must be encouraged and distributed evenly. We must ensure that we avoid a drift towards the kind of divided society we now see in our next door neighbour, in the United Kingdom.  We do not want to see that kind of division appearing or widening in our country.  We must all be extremely concerned by the fact that we <Col N="381" /> can now see the beginnings, indeed not just the beginnings, but a well developed trend in that direction in our society.  We have a divided society here.  In recent years we have seen what my colleague, Deputy Noonan described &mdash; and what is the proper description of it &mdash; as the emergence of an under-class in this country &mdash; people who are caught in poverty traps, who are caught in circumstances they can never get out of because they are disadvantaged in relation to education, the provision of health services, in their access to training and by the way our tax and social welfare systems treat them.  We cannot allow that to continue because, apart from any other consideration, it would be inhuman to allow a situation to continue and develop in which a large proportion of our population, of our brothers and sisters, are systematically left outside the gains of an expanding economy.</P>
    <P>We can either have fundamental reform of our tax and social welfare systems or we can simply drift along with that social division getting wider and wider, with that social and cultural time-bomb ticking away just behind us.  For example, there is no reason the provisions of this year's budget should not have begun firmly and clearly the process of taking the poor out of the tax net. There is no reason PRSI should not have been taken off the first £3,000 of income this year.  There is no reason we should not have had a substantial reform of our social welfare system in order to get rid of poverty traps.  There is no good reason for any one of those initiatives not having been taken.  The reason we have not seen those desirable initiatives is that this Government did not have the courage to take a hard-headed political decision to identify social and economic priorities and set out to deal with those of them they could tackle immediately.</P>
    <P>Instead what we have witnessed is a budget with a little of everything and nothing much of anything.  There is no doubt that it was cleverly packaged.  A casual observer, the ordinary citizen listening to sections of the Minister's statement yesterday &mdash; incidentally no <Col N="382" /> ordinary citizen would inflict it on himself to sit and listen to two and a half hours of turgidity as it was presented to us yesterday &mdash; as it went along would have said: yes, that sounds like a good idea; that sounds like a sensible move.  Of course, a great many things in the budget were good ideas and did represent sensible moves but they were not big enough to make any real difference.  That is the case in relation to the various social welfare provisions as I have said, a number of which were very good but not big enough to make a real difference.  That is the case in relation to the changes proposed in regard to taxation.  Again good enough ideas in themselves, certainly moving in the right direction, but not big enough to make any substantial difference.</P>
    <P>The Government have taken the option of not making up their minds about priorities, merely drifting along effecting minor adjustments to tax and social welfare.  That is the wrong way to go.  It is wrong in every sense; it is wrong socially, economically and politically. There is among the public a genuine expectation of radical reform and a real desire to bring it about.  We must get into our heads in this House that the nineties should be the decade when we make these reforms and this year's budget should have begun those reforms in a purposeful and meaningful way.  After all the work and argument in this House over the last ten years about getting on top of our debt problem we have finally got it to the point where we know we can control and manage it.  We know we are facing a period of years ahead &mdash; if all goes well &mdash; when we will have an expanded level of access to the resources that we ourselves produce and a greater degree of choice in the way we use them.</P>
    <P>If controlling the debt means anything &mdash; and the Taoiseach and his Ministers probably understand this &mdash; it means that there is £2 billion of public expenditure over which we can regain control.  We can gradually liberate part of that sum on an increasing basis so that we do not have to use it for debt servicing but for <Col N="383" /> providing the services and reform needed at home to bolster the effects on our own people, their jobs and daily lives, on the wealth we produce.  That is why the nineties should be a decade of reform.  We should have tax and social welfare reform and reform in our local government structures. However, I do not see any determination on the part of the Government to begin that kind of reform.</P>
    <P>What do we see?  A series of deceptions is being perpetrated in the budget this year and, as usual, they are obvious when you look at the <i>Principal Features of the 1990 Budget.</i>  The most glaring omission is that there is no provision in any real sense to meet the problems with which we are all familiar, day in, day out, in our health services.  It is true there are little pieces here and there, there are a few changes in health and social welfare schemes that provide assistance or care for people who are ill or handicapped but there is nothing of any significance.  They are good ideas in themselves but they will not make any real difference to the people suffering deprivation because they do not have any real access to health services.</P>
    <P>In regard to social welfare, the Government are now trying the same thing which was tried last year.  An entry in the Principal Features came to my attention yesterday.  I looked at it and it seemed to have a familiar ring about it. I went back to the <i>Principal Features of the 1989 Budget</i> and, sure enough, it contained the same thing.  In the <i>Principal Features of the 1989 Budget,</i> under Social Welfare there was a provision for an adjustment of £56.5 million to expenditure over and above the figure that had been provided for in the Estimates published some time before that.  The Government said that this would make a big impact on the problem.</P>
    <P>This year as I looked through the Principal Features I found they are operating the same trick, but the other way around. In 1989 there was £56.5 million extra which was trumpeted in the budget.  We were all pleased a little more money was made available.  What happened?  At the <Col N="384" /> end of 1989 the Government made a great virtue of the fact that they had saved about £56 million on social welfare provisions.  What was presented as a big act of largesse turned out to mean nothing in practical terms.  When the Estimates were produced a couple of months ago the Government again had a big increase in social welfare provision.  They would look after the needs in this area.  What do we find in the Principal Features of the budget?  To cobble together the final outturn at which they are aiming, the Government say they can make adjustments in the light of the 1989 provisional outturn and developments since publication of the 1990 Abridged Estimates Volume of £57,600,000.</P>
    <P>The Government and their predecessor have spent a good deal of energy and ingenuity in trying to con this House and the people into the belief that they are helping people in receipt of social welfare.  They are really operating paper transactions that mean nothing to people on unemployment assistance, child dependant allowance or any of the other schemes which are covered under various subheads.  This must be one of the few places where accounts are given of Government money which threw up a sum of £57,600,000 and called it &ldquo;various subheads&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Another deception is being operated on page 17 of the <i>Principal Features of the 1990 Budget.</i>  Under International Co-operation there is an adjustment in the figures compared to those provided in the Estimates.  The 1990 published allocation for International Co-operation is £7,025 and an adjustment of £1,000.  The explanation is &ldquo;Payments to International Funds for the benefit of developing countries: The contribution required for the European Development Fund will be £1 million less than originally estimated by the EC&rdquo;.  If the Government say that the payments required will be £1 million less than originally estimated we must accept it.  We assume they know what <Col N="385" /> they are talking about and what the EC is asking for.</P>
      <P>After three years in which the Government and their predecessor consistently, regularly and totally unfeelingly reduced our allocation for international co-operation and development aid they were presented with a situation this year where &mdash; compared to the allocation they made in the Estimates &mdash; they could have gained leeway of £1 million which would have funded bilateral aid programmes. What did they do?  They simply robbed it again.  In the financial circumstances in which the budget is presented to us, that smacks of pure boneheaded meanness and a total lack of preparedness on the part of the Government to recognise that there was an opportunity to put right some of the damage they had done to our international development aid efforts and indeed to the Government's image.</P>
      <P>There is no recognition whatever &mdash; and this has been referred to by a number of my colleagues yesterday and today &mdash; of the dramatic situation which has emerged in the civil legal aid system.  I speak from a background of some experience in this matter.  When I had the honour to be Minister for Finance and my colleague, Deputy Noonan, had the honour of being Minister for Justice, he persuaded me &mdash; he is a good persuader &mdash; and the rest of our colleagues that we should use the device of the Funds of Suitors Bill, which no doubt the Taoiseach will remember, to make money available to support and expand the civil legal aid system.  We did that to the point where, in 1986, we were able to open two new legal aid centres, one in Athlone and one in Tallaght.  On leaving office the system had expanded; there was a great deal of pressure on it but over a period of two years we had managed to increase the capacity of the system to meet the real needs.  We never pretended &mdash; nor could we &mdash; that it was meeting all the needs but we could say with honesty, satisfaction and pride that we had expanded the ability of the system to meet the problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is happening now?  Over the last two years there has been inexorable and <Col N="386" /> unbearable pressure on the system to the point where it is less and less able to meet the needs.  People who were honoured at being asked to direct its operation feel that it has gone past the point where they can, with any honesty or credit, stay with it and they have resigned.  That problem should be addressed very quickly but there is no recognition in the budget that the problem even exists.  The Taoiseach may be unaware of public concern in this regard but I can tell him, from the experience of my colleagues and myself on this side of the House, that there is hardly a week when any one of us would not have a number of reasons to find out the possibilities of the free legal aid system helping several people in our constituencies &mdash; and outside them &mdash; to deal with their pressing problems.  One of the most depressing things I and I am sure my colleagues can meet in our work is a person whose difficulty is that he cannot afford legal representation although his case is clearly covered by the free legal aid system, and to know without a shadow of doubt that there is not the slightest chance that that person's case will be dealt with at any time in the next two or three years under the system we have.  There should have been a move in this budget to deal with that.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go into a lot of detail about the various facets of this budget but we should take up on one or two things referred to by the commentators, or as I call them, the champagne and orange juice breakfast clubs, who have looked at what is in the budget.  They have looked into their crystal ball at the outlook for interest rates and their conclusion is that the rise in German interest rates and external reserve losses pushed domestic rates higher in 1989, that while German interest rates may well have peaked, domestic rates are unlikely to fall in coming months.  The Minister for Finance could not present a very different analysis from that.  There will be pressure on the Government, on business and on households over the next few months arising from the dangers of increasing interest rates.  I wonder if this means that the Government cannot rely as happily as <Col N="387" /> they indicated yesterday on saving money from the provision for debt servicing, a figure of £35 million, because they expect that this new office of debt management will be more effective, efficient and subtle in its operations.  The Government will be very lucky this year to find a situation where their provision now for debt servicing will not be breached.  The Government can argue that rises in interest rates that occur from here on will not affect the full amount of the outstanding debt. That is quite true as most of the debts have fixed charging rates for interest but there is no doubt that if there is upward pressure on interest rates it will make life more difficult for the Government.</P>
    <P>A comment on the outlook for the gilt market, which is a subject not without interest in itself, suggests that the budget can do little for the Irish market in the short-term given international uncertainties. That is another reason I have to suspect that the Government may be a little more than optimistic in saying that they will save £35 million by the operations of this new office for debt management.</P>
    <P>The budget this year does a little in relation to a lot of things but not much of anything.  That is a pity.  This has occurred because the Government clearly lack the will or the imagination to prioritise what they are doing and they do not understand that we must give priority for all kinds of social and economic reasons and concerns of justice, to action that will stop the widening of divisions in our society, that will deal directly with the issues of poverty, low pay and inadequate access to services.  The Government have missed an opportunity this year following on missed opportunities in previous years by the same Taoiseach leading different Governments.  Apart from what we might say about it politically, it is a great disappointment to our people who should be better served.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This budget presented an opportunity at the start of this decade to signal the kind of society we want to construct with the resources available to <Col N="388" /> us.  The opportunity has been lost.  The full impact of the budget when analysed will reveal that the Minister has adopted a cautious and conservative approach towards the management of our economy. This will result in no structural change or radical shift in the way in which power and resources are used.  Those in secure jobs and safe in their homes will be little affected by the budget.  The minor changes in personal rates of income tax will be offset by other tax allowance changes.  In fact, the increases in interest rates over the last 12 months have left people on mortgages of £20,000 or so worse off now than they were at this time last year and the budget will not bring them back to the position they were in in 1989.  The 5 per cent increase in social welfare payments which will not be paid until July has already been absorbed in advance, by an increase in local authority housing rents which came into effect in the first week of January this year.  What the Minister for Social Welfare gave with one hand the Minister for Finance in anticipation of it had already taken with the other.</P>
      <P>The large structure of corporation taxes allowances and charges to business remain the most favourable in the whole of Europe.  Our private sector economy remains the most subsidised and lightly taxed of any of our competitors in the EC, yet there are no signs in the budget of any attempt by the Minister to provide either financial inducements or sanctions to ensure that the private sector will create employment.</P>
      <P>The real tragedy of the budget is that it is a lost opportunity and that it admits in no uncertain terms that for the foreseeable future over 200,000 people will be unemployed.  The budget does not attempt to address this problem.  The paltry sum provided to increase payments for the long-term unemployed will further weaken their position relative to the rest of society, as the gap between those at work and those who are unemployed continues to widen.  We are now looking at a problem of enormous proportions which has defied conventional solutions and measures for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="389" /> The Labour Party are committed to the creation of a society within which every person can participate according to his abilities.  The exclusion of over 200,000 people from participating in meaningful jobs is creating a society with dependent spouses and children who are totally without the experience of work and fulfilment in society.  The decision to increase, by 5,000 work places, the social employment scheme so that it will now have 15,000 participants in community work by the end of 1990 is a small but welcome step.  However, it is probable that in urban areas, the effectiveness of the social employment scheme will be further reduced because of the failure of the Government to increase the rates of pay for participants and the consequent reduction in real pay when the increases for the long-term unemployed come into effect.</P>
    <P>This Government could have done a number of things but they chose not to and we should ask ourselves why. Improvements over the last number of years have undoubtedly been made in relation to the management of our public finances, in relation to coming to terms, as a political society, with the need to control the whole question of debt and in relation to our obligations and responsibilities there.</P>
    <P>Politically our society is more mature at the start of this decade than it was at the start of the last decade.  To that extent as democrats in an open society we should recognise that progress has been made. However, that progress will have little relevance or meaning to an increasing section of our population if we do not succeed in bringing everybody with us. That is the challenge of the nineties.</P>
    <P>We are looking at the permanent exclusion of people from the workplace, at the permanent exclusion of people from meaningful educational opportunities. The prospects of some of our people who do not have access to meaningful educational opportunities of getting a job are reduced.  In my constituency there are families who are entering into the third generation of <Col N="390" /> unemployment.  There are families growing up in our urban areas who do not know anything about the culture of work, the discipline of going to work and all the other things that go with that experience. More people are being excluded from those opportunities and we must be wary of the consequences of that for our society.  We should not allow it to happen and should intervene directly to arrest it.</P>
    <P>The respect for property, for people and for the elderly in parts of Dublin and other urban areas has declined dramatically. Politicians in contact with their constituents in rural or urban areas tell of horrific attacks on elderly people and of the extraordinary drop in social standards. Is it any wonder that we have had that breakdown in standards in relation to safety and attacks on women and children when what could be described as the underclass are told officially through economic forecasts that we will have upwards of 200,000 people unemployed through the nineties?  We cannot blame those people for feeling excluded and that they are not part of the economic upturn.  It is not surprising that they feel there is no place in our society for them and, as a consequence, they are outside the normal constraints and standards and are free to do what they feel they should do to get their paltry slice of the action.</P>
    <P>Our society is divided and the budget reaffirms that division.  In this regard I should like to quote from an article by Dick Walsh in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times:</i></P>
    <P>In blunt terms, a reduction of three percentage points in the top rate of income tax will mean more to someone earning £50,000 a year than an increase of 11 per cent in the benefits available to the long-term unemployed.  And while there are hidden advantages on both sides, the debilitated state of the health services and the privilege (or lack of it) represented by education, housing and opportunity ensure that the imbalance remains undisturbed.</P>
    <P>The imbalance to which he referred was the division in our society.  The purpose <Col N="391" /> of trying to manage an economy, of introducing incentives, sanctions and proposals for development that will result in many people being employed directly by the taxpayer, is to create a society that will have room for everybody.  That will not happen as a result of the budget.</P>
    <P>We have had an inconclusive debate going on for some time about our divided society and neither side has succeeded in persuading the other.  Perhaps the conditions under which we all have to operate have changed due to international forces but in addressing the problem of a divided society we need to create jobs in a way that we have failed to do over decades.  Professor Joseph Lee's book, <i>A History of the Irish State 1910-1985</i> is an incredible indictment of successive generations of Irish people since Independence. Our failure to perform relative to other European states is devastating when one looks at the evidence produced in that comprehensive, historical work. We should ask ourselves why countries like Finland, Denmark and the Benelux countries who suffered the ravages of world wars and economic traumas have been more successful in running their economies and accommodating in their societies those who are seeking employment.</P>
    <P>The House, on another occasion, should ask why our reliance on the private sector, which the Coalition Government seem to do exclusively, is not resulting in more jobs.  The money that is necessary to promote investment and reduce inequality is available within our corporate sector.  However, it will remain untouched as a result of the budget.  With the single exception of a change in the capital allowances, and the consequential reduction in the rate of corporation tax to 40 per cent, that sector of our economy has been left untouched in real terms.  As the Minister for Finance said yesterday, the corporate sector make a contribution of just under 4 per cent to our tax revenue. We should bear in mind that that sector receive a lot of money from taxpayers in the form of grants from the IDA and CTT.  A lot of taxpayers' money <Col N="392" /> is spent on infrastructural development, an essential requirement for the private sector to develop but the performance of that sector in terms of job creation is disappointing to say the least.  Nobody has been more disappointed about that than the Minister for Labour.</P>
    <P>The contribution the private sector make in terms of putting finance back into the community will remain disappointing when legislative effect is given to the provisions of the budget in the Finance Bill.  I would like to have seen the Minister accept some of the recommendations put forward by Deputy Taylor in his pre-budget submission to the Government.  It is not too late yet and the recommendations can be included in the Finance Bill.  Indeed, the real budget will be prepared between now and the introduction of the Finance Bill.  The Minister for the Environment, who is present, will be aware of the need to expend money on improving our infrastructure. Roads, in particular, seem to be the poor orphan as far as the Government are concerned.  Their improvement would have a beneficial effect on the profitability of many of our public and private enterprises.  An increase in corporation tax would be a welcome addition to State revenue.  If we did that we would be in a position to restore some of the cuts such as that of £1 million to ODA.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor, with regard to the taxation of companies, suggested that all companies should be required to pay a minimum amount of tax irrespective of allowances.  He suggested a minimum of 20 per cent of the rate applicable which would mean a minimum of 2 per cent tax on the manufacturing sector and a minimum tax of 8.6 per cent on the profits of the rest of the corporate sector.  That concept has been around for some time and is used in many countries.  We are all aware that there is a rapidly expanding group of accountants who can show any company willing to pay the fees required how to manipulate the various allowances in their favour.  Some companies do not pay any tax and they can do that within the framework of the laws passed by the <Col N="393" /> House.  It is for that reason that we are suggesting that, notwithstanding any entitlements to allowances, there should be a minimum contribution of 2 per cent. That could hardly be described as a radical or a heavy imposition on companies who are making profits.  We are talking about 2 per cent on their profits, not on their turnover; we are talking about companies that are trading profitably. The second suggestion of Deputy Taylor was that section 84 reliefs should be abolished and other allowances sharply curtailed so that companies will actually end up paying a fair share of the tax due.</P>
    <P>We need to reduce levels of taxation on the PAYE worker to the point where they significantly impact on their pockets. With all due respect, the present proposals will not have that effect.  A single person in the 48 per cent band with an endowment mortgage will be worse off as a result of this budget.  If we want the PAYE workers, who came out in their thousands ten years ago this very month, to feel there has been a significant change in the taxation system, the tax base in our society has to be broadened.  That is a painful exercise.  It is much more popular to reduce it as we saw back in 1977. Indeed, the Minister for the Environment is seeking an all-party consensus in an Oireachtas committee to look at the question of local government finances because if we do not do something about them the entire system will collapse and the services, such as they are, will disappear.</P>
    <P>The other area where the tax base could have been broadened was in the corporate area which would be far less painful and would not damage the performance of the companies.  One only has to read the business sections of our newspapers or the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> with a circulation of 30,000 to 40,000 designed specifically to cater for the burgeoning corporate population in our society to realise that the international trading conditions for Irish companies, the comparative pricing of our products relative to other competitors particularly within the EC, notwithstanding the recent drop in the rate of sterling, give <Col N="394" /> most of our companies a very strong position to trade internationally.  One only has to look at the financial reports of the quoted companies that have reported improved economic performance over the last two years to see there is room for that kind of increased tax take.  That increased tax take did not come about and perhaps the Minister for the Environment can tell us the reason.  Much of the improved economic performance of those companies is in part due to the wage restraint exercised by workers and their trade unions during the course of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> There was, therefore, an added reason for getting more money from the corporate sector but unfortunately that opportunity has not been availed of.</P>
    <P>This is a long document with a lot of figures and a whole series of adjusted savings which total about £84 million and there is a presumption of additional buoyancy of something of the order of £30 million.  There is, however, a hidden budget within the figures that have been digested by us so far as we will have to look over the next couple of months at the real impact of that hidden budget. One aspect of it has already been highlighted &mdash; the mean miserable reduction by £1 million in our overseas development co-operation budget, simply because the EC got it wrong and said we did not need to contribute as much as was intended.  That money should have been transferred into the bilateral side of that budget within the Department of Foreign Affairs and given to the various programmes or some of the voluntary organisations that are doing excellent work in the Third World, work for which there is broad popular support across the community.</P>
    <P>We may concentrate on our own economic difficulties and the poor in our own society and those who are disadvantaged and alienated in our society, but in real terms we are a wealthy country.  We are the 25th wealthiest country in the world, and there are over 150 nations in the survey that has been done by the World Bank.  It is not just in terms of GNP <i>per capita</i> that we are ranked 25th.  In some <Col N="395" /> regards we are the wealthiest.  We have the highest rate of home ownership of any society in the world.  We have things that do not measure on an economic scale that would indicate that our wealth is even greater than the 25th placing to which I referred.  The miserable taking of £1 million off the ODA budget is, therefore, incomprehensible until one looks at the record of Fianna Fáil in relation to development co-operation and overseas participation.  We will probably spend more on public relations between now and June hyping the ego trip of the Presidency than we have taken from the ODA budget.  That is an indication of our priorities.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to turn to an area that concerns me personally and the Labour Party in a very particular way, that is, the continued failure of our economy to provide employment.  The official projections from the ESRI, NESC and all the other bodies, independently and collectively, is that unemployment will be of the order of 200,000 for the foreseeable future.  Within that there is a group of long-term unemployed, measured conventionally by EC standards as people who are 12 or 13 months or more out of work.  If one were to look in detail at that figure one would find that in some cases there are people who have been out of work for three, four and five years.  There are families going into the third generation of unemployment who have lost total contact with the whole experience of participating in society and contributing in a meaningful way.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have held the view for a long time that the State must take a prime role in creating employment. However, we have never said and we do not say now, that we should create artificial jobs, the avenue which was explored with such gusto back in the seventies and the results of which we are now trying to unravel and pay for with such pain.  That kind of false job creation is not a solution.  I think perhaps the Deputies on the Fianna Fáil side of the House, including the Progressive Democrats, who led the charge to stuff <Col N="396" /> every health board with additional unwanted staff back in 1977 have been converted to seeing the madness of the 1977 manifesto.  If we have learned from history, let us all be the wiser for it.</P>
    <P>We are not talking about false job creation.  The right-wing ideologues of the Progressive Democrats and some of their supporters in Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael believe in the magic of the private sector and say that if we simply keep on facilitating it, encouraging it, subsidising it, the private sector will ultimately create sufficient jobs to deal with the problem of unemployment.  There is no evidence of that happening.  If that were the case I would not be arguing against the private sector.  I have no antipathy towards it. I simply do not think it is capable of generating the level of employment we require.  The private sector is exactly that, private, concerned with its own immediate concerns and not with the broader social issues to which we in public life must have regard.</P>
    <P>That is why this budget has failed to deal with the problem of the massive numbers of unemployed.  The consequences of continued structural long-term unemployment will have a devastating social effect, resulting in the creation of what various social scientists and commentators in the United States and elsewhere talk about as an under-class. Deputy Dukes referred to Deputy Michael Noonan's use of the words &ldquo;under-class&rdquo; as if it was a phrase Deputy Noonan had discovered for the first time and put into coinage here.  That is not the case.  This is the negative side of a welfare society which basically pays people to disappear.  This welfare dependency was rightly condemned by Mr. Phil Flynn, general secretary of the Local Government and Public Services Union, in an article he wrote for <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> of 28 January 1990.</P>

      <P>I am spokesman but I will not be any longer than five minutes.</P>
      <P>I was about to quote from a very comprehensive article in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> in which Mr. Phil Flynn, rightly identifies the problems of permanent dependency, the sense of dependency on welfare payments and refers, in particular, to unemployment and long-term unemployment.  The article is one of a series of articles by various people who were asked to pretend that they were the Minister for Finance and to write a budget.  I want to quote from Mr. Flynn's article because he is a key player in the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> a key advocate of its renewal, and therefore a person to whom the Government might listen with a little more attention than they would to others.  With regard to unemployment Mr. Flynn said:</P>
      <P>Unemployment is a human tragedy, a drain on the economy and a major source of poverty.  The long-term unemployed, in particular, must be prioritised.  For the most part they are over 30, unskilled and educationally disadvantaged.  Only targeted policies including skills training will lift them from their present position.</P>
      <P>The following is proposed:</P>
      <P>&mdash;Payment of ten per cent above welfare levels to those participating in approved education, training or employment.</P>
      <P>&mdash;Additional £1.5 million for pilot literacy and second chance education schemes.</P>
      <P>&mdash;Restructuring of Social Employment Scheme.</P>
      <P>&mdash;Provision for additional 20,000 places in employment/training schemes including a new training for employment scheme.</P>
      <P>&mdash;An urgent examination, in consultation with social pressure, into how education/training/employment schemes can be better integrated into job creation strategy and also to assess the general adequacy of current provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;Employers to be exempt from PRSI for duration of employment of <Col N="398" /> any individual recruited from long-term register.</P>
    <P>&mdash;State aid to industry shifted from support of fixed asset investment to marketing, R &amp; D and employment.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Extension of existing urban renewal areas and designation of new ones.</P>
    <P>With the exception of the change in capital allowances, virtually none of the proposals contained in that tight summary are incorporated in this budget.  A tax incentive to encourage employers to take on people is not provided in the budget. The reduction in PRSI for somebody who is earning £60 per week may have some impact for a person who is outrageously low paid, but it will not encourage an employer to take on any other person for whom he will still have to pay his part of the employers' contribution to PRSI.</P>
    <P>The budget has not dealt with the social employment scheme or with what FÁS are trying to do.  In urban areas the social employment scheme is simply breaking down and is being used increasingly by local authorities as an alternative means of running their own stretched and underresourced services.  This is totally contrary to the whole concept of what a social employment scheme is about in the first instance.  There are areas of ghettoised poverty in this country where one problem compounds another.  There are two Deputies in the House at present, one from Dublin north west and one from Dublin south west, who have intimate knowledge of the kind of ghettoised areas of deprivation to which I refer.  There is no interim targeted programme provided for in this budget which could effectively do anything for those people and lift them out of the morass of dependency and despair.  As I said, generation after generation in these areas face unemployment.</P>
    <P>When the increases are expressed in percentage terms they look very substantial but the 10 per cent increase for the long-term unemployed only amounts to £5, or the cost of three or four pints, and if someone has all day to drink three or four pints this does not amount to <Col N="399" /> much.  By the time the city manager has taken the rent increase out of this 10 per cent, which he did two weeks ago, these people will be in arrears when they get the extra £5 in July.</P>
    <P>A budget has to do many things, and many of the things which are conventionally required have been achieved in this budget but even if there was no Minister for Finance these things would have been done.  If the permanent Minister for Finance in the Department of Finance wrote the budget most of the provisions in it would have been introduced anyway, and the basic drift and shift in the regulation of fiscal affairs would continue without much dramatic change.  Political input is about direction, priorities and values but when we look at the two and a half hours of turgidity of the budget speech &mdash; to quote Deputy Dukes &mdash; we note there is very little evidence of political direction, political priorities or political values.  I may be wrong but I cannot find them.  Perhaps the Government spokespersons over the next few days will try to locate them for me.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party regret that there is very little evidence of a clear value system that is animating the political agenda of this Coalition Government.  We believe that the management of a vibrant, open and mixed economy such as ours is about creating sufficient wealth so that there is space, in every sense of the word, spiritual and physical, for all citizens to fully participate according to their abilities and needs.  What this budget has said to those who are fortunate enough to be at work is &ldquo;steady as you are; there is not much change particularly if you are single&rdquo;, and to those who are not at work &ldquo;here are another few percentage points to keep you just above inflation, so long as you stay out of the mainstream of society&rdquo;. We are creating a level of dependency and demotivation for hundreds of thousands of people who are now dependent either directly or indirectly on social welfare payments which will pile up in the form of a negative social legacy and <Col N="400" /> threaten society for the remainder of this decade.</P>
    <P>This is the real tragedy in final terms about this budget.  The Government could have used the first budget of the nineties to signal to us and the people who depend on us that they are serious about turning this country around and reversing the verdict which Professor Joe Lee has come to so succinctly and comprehensively in his analysis of political performance over the past 60 or 70 years. They could have used this budget to send a clear message conveying some sense of hope.  They could have used this budget to mobilise people and enthuse them as they tried to do in their public relations exercise associated with the Irish Presidency of the EC.  Tragically this has not been the case and there will be little change as a result of this budget.  To quote Mr. Dick Walsh again, the imbalance between the haves and the have nots in our society is going to remain undisturbed as a result of this budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am.  The need to get the national debt under control and reduce the Exchequer borrowing requirement has been used over the past three years by the Government and their predecessors to impose a wide range of cutbacks on the people least able to bear them, that is, the PAYE workers, the old, the sick and the handicapped.  The same excuse was given for not tackling the important matter of tax reform, the subject of major protests exactly ten years ago.  Of course, it is possible to present statistics in the manner most suitable to the case that one is seeking to make, but it is worth recalling all the very favourable indicators, except the one on unemployment, facing the Minister when he sat down to prepare the budget.  I argue that those propitious circumstances were won on the backs of the PAYE workers and the disadvantaged who during most of the past decade were <Col N="401" /> forced to tighten their belts and most savagely during the past three years.</P>
      <P>Economic growth was almost four per cent in 1989, a tremendous performance, and it has been forecast that there will be similar growth in 1990.  Exports were up by the extremely high figure of 11 per cent and this trend is likely to continue in 1990.  Industrial output was up 13 per cent and the stunning record of the work-force's productivity continued.  During the past five years it has virtually quadrupled. The Exchequer borrowing requirement, forecast in last year's budget to be 5.3 per cent or £1,055 million, turned out, as we know, to be drastically different.  Indeed, some of the predictions and forecasts in recent budgets have been so far out that serious questions have to be asked.  For example, the House will be aware that in the negotiations on the formation of a government between the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil the borrowing requirement was targeted to be at 3 per cent by 1992. That is the target that was fixed as recently as seven months ago, but already the outturn for the past year reveals a figure of 2.4 per cent.  Therefore the target fixed for 1992 by the Government at three per cent has already been surpassed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They were the parameters within which the Minister had to work when he sat down to prepare the budget.  Against the background of the figures I have given one can only describe this budget as a populist but cowardly budget in which the Minister and the Government fail to address either of the two fundamental structural problems in the economy which are, the declining number of people creating wealth in the economy, that is, the number in employment and, second, the question of real structural tax reform.  Neither of these issues has been addressed in any serious way, despite the propitious fiscal circumstances I have referred to, earned on the backs of the PAYE worker and the disadvantaged. The Minister passed over those opportunities to tackle the two major structural problems I have referred to and instead <Col N="402" /> he went for the customary populist Fianna Fáil approach.</P>
    <P>Our biggest problem and this is the problem that has baffled the Government &mdash; they admit to it in private &mdash; is the size of our social welfare pool, or to put it another way, why can we not put 100,000 people back to work in productive jobs. The most disheartening statement I have heard for a long time was the statement made last night on television by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment that never will we have full employment in the economy.  This is an extraordinary statement which no doubt will come back even to haunt the charmed life that that Deputy leads.  She is, after all, the alter ego of the man who is Minister for Industry and Commerce. Are we to take it that she was speaking on his behalf when she admitted to the people that full employment will never be realised?  Let it be said that no matter what improvements the Minister for Finance could be realistically expected to make in social welfare, and in my view he made the minimum, they would still represent no more than subsistence support for the individual recipient of social welfare.  This is simply because, notwithstanding the haemorrhage of emigration, there are too few people at work and too many people unemployed.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister for Finance addressed this fundamental problem?  The answer is an emphatic no.  The Minister is engaging in the politics of illusion if he thinks otherwise as his only contribution to job creation in the budget is the pathetic suggestion that 5,000 people may find recreation through an expansion of the SES schemes.  On these make work schemes, which have nothing to do with generating wealth, participants are paid a subsistence wage.  That is the only contribution he makes to job creation in the budget.  Where was the reference to the major review of industrial policy?  In a reply to a parliamentary question last November the Taoiseach told me that a major review &mdash; allowing for the fact that everything is major with the Taoiseach &mdash; of industrial policy is underway.  What has happened to that major review of <Col N="403" /> industrial policy?  I can tell the House that it has now run into major difficulties within the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>The previous Minister, Deputy Bruton, passed a law which requires that a White Paper on industrial policy should be published every three years and that a review of industrial performance be carried out about every three years. Deputy Reynolds when Minister for Industry and Commerce, took fright at the implications the advent of 1992 would have for the economy and industrial policy and asked a gentleman called Mr. Frank Roche at UCD to prepare the report on industrial performance which I have referred to.  That report has been completed, but I am sad to have to inform the House that the report has been suppressed because of disagreement within the Department of Industry and Commerce. That Department, like the Government, are at sixes and sevens on this question of industrial policy.</P>
    <P>The Government are not comprised of fools; their advisers are not fools.  They know that where all the indicators are right the jobs should be coming on stream now.  They know, despite the haemorrhage of emigration, the jobs are not coming on stream and the attempt to review the wastefulness, inefficiency and ineffectiveness of our industrial policy has been stymied because they cannot agree what alterations have to be made. They acknowledge privately that our industrial policy is very expensive and that it has failed, but they cannot agree on what to do about it; indeed, over the last 30 years it has been a sad legacy of failure and neglect.</P>
    <P>I need look no further for examples than what we have seen in the last few days on the industrial landscape.  If an Irish branch of a foreign based company should decide for corporate reasons to pull down the shutters in any major Irish town, as happened in the Minister's town not too long ago, why should the closure of one such plant leave such devastation in its wake?  Let me instance the threat <Col N="404" /> hanging over employment in Bray this week.  If attempts to put together a rescue package for Nixdorf are not successful &mdash; I sincerely hope they will be successful &mdash; the entire town will be left with no major private sector employer because of the failure of successive Governments to develop a thriving indigenous private sector.  Similarly, unless a rescue package can be put together &mdash; again I hope it will be successful &mdash; on the north side of Cork for Sunbeam, what are the prospects for that part of Cork city?  Again the prospect is devastation.  The last major private employer on the north side of Cork city is threatened.  Again that would not have been the case if we had made any progress developing a productive indigenous sector over the last 30 years.  The practice down the years of throwing good money after bad has manifestly failed to create the jobs or the indigenous private sector I have spoken about.</P>
    <P>Irish industrial policy is extremely expensive in terms of subsidies to the private sector by way of cash or tax breaks.  The cost to the taxpayer in tax foregone, for example, in 1987 was £1.3 billion, in the average year it is about £1 billion.  In this year the combined cost in terms of direct grants and tax foregone will be just short of £1.5 billion.  I remind the House that £1.5 billion is more than the entire budget for education and health.  That is the kind of money we are spending, yet if a multinational decide to pull out, there is devastation in Castlebar or Bray or the north side of Cork or the myriad other examples I could instance.</P>
    <P>Falls in unemployment on the live register are due to emigration, not to the supposed success of Government policies in putting people back to work.  Let me refer to the Budget Statement of the Minister for Finance where he chooses to avail of the figures published by the labour force survey.  It is a perfect example of the kind of presentation of statistics I spoke about at the outset, where statistics can be presented in a manner which makes the case for whatever point of view you are adopting.  The only pertinent fact is that the labour force survey figures to mid-April 1989 show <Col N="405" /> there are 1,000 fewer at work in the Irish economy than there were in mid-April 1988.  That is the only figure that matters. Never mind trying to claim credit for taking 20,000 people off the live register. They are in Brooklyn, Chicago, London and elsewhere.  One thousand people fewer were productively involved in this economy between April 1988 and April 1989, and that against the background of varying optimistic forecasts &mdash; from the ESRI 10,000 net new jobs, the Central Bank 13,000, and various spokespersons from the Department of Finance gave the same figures.</P>
    <P>For years economists and conservative politicians have been telling us that if wages could be reduced jobs would be created.  In other times this may well hold some truth in the public services, but it has obviously been proved to be untrue in most manufacturing companies, especially the new manufacturing sector.  The climatology school of economics has mesmerised conservative politicians for a decade into believing a Nirvana type state where something called the &ldquo;climate for enterprise&rdquo;&mdash; how many times have we heard it? &mdash; will produce, I was going to say full employment but let me correct that, will create productive jobs.  We have now got as close to that dreamlike state as we are ever likely to get.  Low wage increases, low inflation, unprecedented calm in industrial relations, booming growth, unprecedented industrial output, spiralling profits and tremendous productivity, but where are the jobs?</P>
    <P>The State spends a fortune on industrial, tourism, agricultural and fishing policies, but too few jobs are created. Meanwhile, unfortunately, redundancies continue apace.  It is The Workers' Party's view that such intervention by the State is costly and ineffective and should have been replaced in this budget with an active industrial policy.  As a democratic socialist party The Workers' Party are not a spending party in the manner alleged by so many Government spokespersons.  We do not believe a more equitable or productive society would be created simply by increasing public spending each year. We do not believe in expanding the levels <Col N="406" /> of State intervention beyond what is economically feasible.  We believe Government should borrow; indeed, the Minister for Finance yesterday could have afforded to borrow another £200 million, but that should be to fund investment spending.  Those investments must be wisely and carefully selected and not rendered ineffective or wasteful by simply pouring money into wasteful and ineffective subsidies to the private sector in the hope that a few productive jobs will occur here and there.</P>
    <P>Last week on the television programme &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; an industrialist was asked to describe industrial policy in Ireland and he said that he did not consider himself to be particularly ill-informed but he could not say what the industrial policy was.  We scattered industries around a bit for everybody, in the hope that a few permanent jobs will stay here and there.  We must seek to achieve a radical alteration in industrial policy designed to secure the structural changes necessary to produce and increase real jobs.  This alteration should favour what I call &ldquo;national champions&rdquo;, that is indigenous companies that have been deliberately and carefully selected to grow and develop in Ireland.</P>
    <P>There have, of course, been several reports that have drawn attention to the weakness in current industrial policy. Sadly all of these reports, so far as I can see, starting way back with the Telesis report, have been shelved.  As long ago as Telesis, it was identified that we were not getting value for money and that the resources spent should be channelled more selectively in terms of trying to produce jobs in this country.  The most recent report to update the work of the Telesis report was <i>NESC 88</i>, which made the point that Ireland has not done as well as any other similar small economy in the area of job creation.  It instanced the Scandinavian countries, for example Denmark with whom we share a great many similarities.</P>
    <P>The main failure of this budget as the central piece of economic policy is the failure to overhaul our industrial policy, by which I mean the set of measures <Col N="407" /> that are designed to tackle job creation financed from fiscal policy.  As I have said, offering people the prospect of &ldquo;make work&rdquo; jobs or social employment schemes is no substitute for genuine, productive jobs generating wealth in this economy.</P>
    <P>In referring to the favourable circumstances that formed the backdrop to the preparation of this year's budget, I would like to refer to the contribution made by the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  I had occasion recently to put something in writing on this question because it is topical and somewhat controversial at present.  I make no apology for having supported the concept and the conclusions of this programme.  It might be no harm to review why that was the case in 1987 and whether the situation has changed since then.  I wrote my article from the perspective of a trade unionist. I admit that bias quite openly, unlike many of the economic gurus who claim to be independent, professional, and whatever other ambiguous words suggest they do not have a point of view.  I think the trade union movement found itself in the trough of recession competing against monetarist policies and a monetarist consensus, against the backdrop of what the Thatcher revolution was supposed to have brought on the neighbouring islands.  We were working against the background where Mrs. Thatcher had very successfully marginalised the trade union movement in Britain and I thought that ought not be allowed to happen in this country.</P>
    <P>We, unlike Britain, have very few representatives of the working people in Parliament and it is necessary that the strength of the trade union movement be protected.  That was the background against which the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was negotiated &mdash; a background of sluggish growth right throughout the eighties and the prevalence of a right wing consensus at that time.  Indeed we were also negotiating against the background of an expected rate of inflation of 2 per cent.  Therefore it was reasonable to anticipate that the <Col N="408" /> programme might have represented a marginal improvement or a standstill in average wages.  Despite the immense pressure on the trade union movement to negotiate that agreement, it was only with the very marginal vote of the ITGWU that the agreement was concluded.</P>
    <P>Today the mood is very different. There is sustained economic growth, massive trade surpluses, the debt-GNP ratio has come down and the Exchequer borrowing requirement has been reduced to 2.4 per cent, lower than the target set by the two parties to this Coalition as recently as seven months ago when they predicted the target of 3 per cent for 1992.  Profits are booming.  There has been wage restraint to a degree of moderation that we have not seen for over 20 years.  Yet no additional jobs have been created.  Workers are beginning to feel, and have been feeling for some time, that they have a right to expect better.  The leading Irish companies, which the Minister for Labour correctly criticised when he pointed to their pitiful contribution to job creation, are experiencing unprecedented and spiralling profits, yet wage constraint is imposed on workers who may not share in those profits.  Most regrettably, of course, the vast bulk of those profits, if not all in some cases, are being repatriated to the country of origin.  It is worth reminding ourselves that the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> promised 20,000 new jobs.  The ink was scarcely dry when we had arguments about what 20,000 new jobs entailed: were they 20,000 net new jobs or were they &mdash; as the Taoiseach eventually settled in this House &mdash; 20,000 extra new jobs?  Of course, we know that what happened was that in the first year the 20,000 target was met by including &mdash; and this was not part of the agreement &mdash; jobs created in the financial services area which brought the figure to 20,000 at the same time as 22,000 redundancies were being notified to the Department of Labour.  Therefore, the job target contributed nothing in terms of additional jobs to the economy.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless I will continue to argue <Col N="409" /> that the trade unions having a place at the table with the Government at that time was important.  The first and key element of the deal, as I well recall, was that there would be no compulsory redundancies in the public service.  At a time when jobs were being shed throughout the entire public services the voluntary severance arrangement made possible by the deal was an important consideration.  On top of this vital gain the deal led to many imaginative and popular job reduction schemes, for example, job sharing, career breaks and early retirements.  Many of these schemes will filter into the private sector and, while of benefit to employers, will also be as popular with workers as they are in the public service.</P>
    <P>The second major gain of the deal, one which is of historic proportions, is the reduction of the working week from 40 hours to 39 hours.  It may not be readily known to everybody in the House that it was the first time in 20 years there had been a reduction in the average working week.  Of course that has not been implemented sufficiently widely yet but, I am satisfied, will be by the time the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> expires.</P>
    <P>The negative aspects of the programme were on jobs and tax reform.  In retrospect, I contend that the ICTU agreed to job targets which could easily have been achieved without any effort on the part of Government and employers.  There was no tax reform whatsoever; tax improvements, but not tax reform. Whereas there was a commitment concerning privatisation nonetheless we have already seen the privatisation of the Hospitals Joint Services Board, the proposed privatisation of Irish Steel, INPC and I suspect &mdash; and regrettably so &mdash; Irish Life.  There may be no option but for trade unionists to accept the first two because of the critical financial position of those companies.  However, the privatisation of Irish Life clearly is in contravention of the programme unless the agreement of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is forthcoming and that should be taken on board by this Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="410" /> One may well ask: what is up for renegotiation at present? &mdash; pay, particularly in the private sector.  Profits have soared and productivity increases have been staggering.  For example, overall profits have grown by 18 per cent in 1989, or on aggregate 20 per cent.  Between 1982 and 1989 output in modern industry quadrupled and productivity trebled, a staggering increase.  Even in the traditional sector productivity has grown by 50 per cent.  As numbers have shrunk and wage increases have not been much above inflation virtually all of the gains have been to business.  This can be observed from the soaring increase in profits.  We have noticed that inflation was falling in the run-up to the negotiations in 1987 &mdash; from 10.4 per cent in 1983 to 3.2 per cent in 1987, followed by 2.1 per cent in 1988, but in 1989 inflation was averaging 3.75 per cent and it rose to 4.5 per cent in mid-August.  The Minister's forecast of 2.5 per cent for next year is way off the target.</P>
    <P>That is the background against which workers will approach the negotiation of the next pay round.  During this time, while workers have been accepting an average of 2.5 per cent pay increase, the position of leading Irish companies has been starkly different.  In an analysis I undertook I made an attempt to examine the profit figures of the top 22 companies in the Irish economy.  However, as only nine of those important companies publish accounts &mdash; despite the requirements of the EC Fourth Directive &mdash; that analysis cannot be comprehensive.</P>
    <P>One group doing especially well in the current climate is the banks.  For example, the directors of Allied Irish Bank gave themselves an overall increase of 11 per cent in 1988, bringing their gross remuneration &mdash; which includes pension contributions and so on &mdash; to £1,248,000 or, an average, £65,684.  The Bank of Ireland directors were kinder to themselves with an 18.5 per cent increase or, on average, £106,250 each.  In spite of the problems experienced in Waterford Glass &mdash; which has been troubled by incompetent management &mdash; the directors tried to console themselves with an <Col N="411" /> increase of 16.2 per cent in 1988, gross remuneration per director of £152,000. They also paid off one or more directors with a golden handshake of £209,000 in 1987 and another of £117,000 in 1988. Smurfits directors were extremely modest and increased their remuneration by 5.3 per cent only.  However, the total package came to almost £10 million or an average of £827,407 each, and so it continues &mdash; one rule for the rich and another for those struggling to make ends meet.</P>
    <P>Against that background it can be clearly seen that the circumstances in which the trade union movement approached the discussions in 1987 have changed dramatically.  I would not be surprised if next week's special conference of Congress decided to withdraw from the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> As a trade unionist my view is that they ought not do so, but great consideration must now be given to any renegotiation of that pact.  We can no longer tolerate circumstances in which companies return such profits in which workers are not permitted to participate.  We cannot tolerate circumstances where workers are expected to engage in interminable wage restraint while at the same time, jobs for their unemployed brothers and sisters are not being provided.  They were told wage restraint could be traded off against the creation of more jobs but that has not happened.  In my view there is no mechanism in this economy that will ensure it will happen.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the other major disappointment in this budget, the Minister's refusal to face up to tax reform. Of course he is once again being seen to make some improvements in the tax code but as they begin to be analysed more closely, more and more workers will appreciate that there is very little in it. Improvements do not constitute structural tax reform.  That has been the greatest area of disappointment.  For example, the Government promised to take 31,000 people out of the tax net.  That is the kind of promise we have heard in the last four budgets with the exception of 1987 but <Col N="412" /> what has happened?  Before the Minister sits down and completes his speech, already that figure is no longer valid. With the effect of fiscal drag on the one hand and inflation on wage increases on the other, a great number of those 31,000 are sucked back into the tax net.  I think it was the Conference of Major Religious Superiors that estimated that between 11 and 18 per cent of those living in poverty are caught in the tax net.  That is a disgrace. The tinkering that the Minister engaged in with the tax code yesterday does not seriously address that problem.</P>
    <P>The major concern that I would express is my disappointment at the failure to look at the take from the corporate sector.  All the leaks to whichever paper you read predicted that the Minister acknowledged that the take from the corporate sector is derisory and that by comparison with any of our EC partners it could not continue.  There were very specific forecasts but what happened? Roughly 4 per cent of tax is contributed by the corporate sector.  That sector escaped virtually unscathed.  All one has to do is read <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning which interprets, comments and reports on the views of the CII on this issue. Indeed the Minister himself made a very specific statement concerning the abuse of the special rate for the manufacturing sector in terms of how the manufacturing process is ill-defined in this economy.  He referred specifically to recent court cases that have produced what has become known as the green banana ripening phenomenon.  He presaged in those statements that he would have to deal with the definition of manufacturing because of the extent of the abuse.  I can find no mention in this document of any such attempt by the Minister to address that problem.</P>
    <P>By comparison with any of our EC partners, we come out at the bottom as far as the contribution from the corporate sector is concerned.  I would remind the Ministers in the House that this is at a time when profit repatriation is at a level which was unthinkable only a few years ago.  Last year economic commentators <Col N="413" /> predicted that £2 billion would be repatriated but what happened?  The amount repatriated to the countries of origin was £3.1 billion.  That immediately forced the Central Bank to revise downwards its figures for growth by 1 per cent.  That amount &mdash; £3.1 billion &mdash; happens to be almost precisely the figure about which there was so much bruhaha by this Government when they went to Brussels looking for structural money over a period of three years.  That amount of money is going out of this economy every year and it was open to the Minister to take some tax measures to cause a proportion of it to be reinvested in this country.  I do not expect that it is realistic to suggest that all of it can be redirected for investment purposes here but I sincerely believe that some of it ought to be redirected and that a modest tax regime, as recommended by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, for example, of approximately 10 per cent on profits in the manufacturing sector, would have had some impact in causing some of that money to be channelled into investment and job creation.  That was one of the greatest missed opportunities in this budget.  It shows how bewildered the Government are about this central matter of job creation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the 80,000 jobs that are being provided by the foreign sector here but I do not believe that the profit spiral that I am talking about should be allowed to continue.  I repeat that this is a matter that requires the most urgent Government attention.  When one of these companies decides to close its branch in Bray, Castlebar or Tralee the entire town is devastated because of our failure to have produced an indigenous sector in this economy over the last 30 years.</P>
    <P>My party made 31 proposals under the heading of tax reform.  Virtually none of them &mdash; although some would be regarded as eminently reasonable by a consensus of this House &mdash; has been applied.  We sought to increase the tax allowance in line with inflation and convert it into credits; to increase the PAYE allowance by 10 per cent and convert it into tax credit; widen the bottom tax <Col N="414" /> band to £15,000 taxable income for married persons; abolish tax relief on covenants; abolish tax relief on VHI Plans D and E by which the average taxpayer is subsidising private medicine for the most wealthy in our society in the Blackrock and Mater private clinics; give an option to workers to have tax relief on mortgages either by way of tax reliefs at the standard rate in the context of the substantial widening band rate that I have spoken about or on a credit by the loan agency; allow actual PRSI payments and levies as a tax allowance; tax all income on a current year basis; extend withholding tax on professionals to include all private sector payments; increase the rate of construction industry withholding tax from 35 to 50 per cent on subcontractors without tax deduction cards; introduce a charter of rights for complying taxpayers; provide a proper information and advisory service for all taxpayers, including the provision of understandable explanatory leaflets and mobile offices; provide a form filling service for small businesses and farmers at a small nominal rate, say, £20; redesign tax return forms to make them more user friendly; launch a major drive against tax evasion and the black economy generally; introduce a global provision to outlaw for tax purposes any scheme where the primary purpose is to avoid tax and is not for bona fide commercial purposes; introduce a provision to require all holders of accounts in financial institutions to provide their revenue and social insurance number to that institution who in turn would return the details to the Revenue Commissioners; introduce self-assessment for companies; relate tax relief for businesses to job creation and not just to capital expenditure; charge PRSI and levies for the self-employed on their income before capital allowances; amend company legislation to ensure that it is no longer used to facilitate abuse of the tax system; introduce a system of local tax collection and grant the collectors power to take walking possession of goods; pay sheriffs an annual salary instead of commission; abolish lease charges and introduce proper financing for local authorities; no <Col N="415" /> VAT to be imposed on foodstuffs and other essentials; no VAT refunds to be made to unregistered farmers; no reduction in indirect taxes; reorganise and restructure capital taxes to double the present yield.  That is a shopping list of 31 proposals and there has been some modest partial concession on only about three of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about taxation and the fact that the proportion of the tax burden on the PAYE sector is now the same as it was ten years ago when 750,000 people marched on the streets.  The advent of 750,000 people marching in East Germany could bring down the Government but 750,000 people marching in Ireland cannot even produce tax reforms ten years later.  That is the issue.  There has not been any shift of the burden of tax from the PAYE sector to the wealth-owning sections of society. The Minister is surely not challenging the fact that there is widespread evasion and tax avoidance, that professionals are avoiding tax, that farmers are not paying their fair share and that the corporate sector is contributing the lowest proportion of tax in Europe.  These are inescapable facts and the Minister missed this opportunity to tackle this important question yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also failed to acknowledge that one of the achievements that the Government boasted about in the June 1989 election was the fantastic progress made in terms of interest rates, <Col N="416" /> and the beneficial spin-off there was for people with mortgages as a result.  It is a pity that some of the sums and tables we were presented with in analysing the tax concessions did not have regard to the impact on mortgages.  Four times since this Coalition came into power interest rates have increased, with a consequent devastating impact on people with mortgages. Any member of any local authority can tell us the extent of repossessions at the moment.  Unfortunately, people on low to middle incomes, penalised by tax who find themselves the victims of the vagaries of the interest rate fluctuations, are having to hand over their homes to either the sheriff or the building societies and be rehoused by the local authorities.  At one meeting of Dublin County Council at which I was present they dealt with 60 such repossessions. That is the effect of the economic policies being pursued by this Government.</P>
    <P>I would reluctantly advise my colleagues in the trade union movement to do precisely what the Minister, Deputy Connolly, recommends, and take a leaf from the book of the peoples of Eastern Europe and go back on to the streets for tax reform.  After the persistent campaign in the late seventies and in 1980, ten years later all that has been done is that levels of tax have been tinkered with and there have been only minimal improvements but no constructive or real tax reform. That is a major issue dividing society. There is no reason why some people should be punished and have to bear the burden of the social services.  I recommend that a Government which was so committed to tax reform should now be provoked by persistent disciplined organised protest campaigns by the trade union movement and by PAYE workers into lessening the load on the backs of the PAYE workers.</P>
    <P>I would refer to a number of other matters given the time but I only have about five minutes left.  The Minister referred yesterday to a commitment to further sales of State assets and said that this is the first phase of a new five year programme of such sales so as to help <Col N="417" /> reduce the national debt.  I am very concerned at the ominous note here which has gone largely unnoticed.  If we are to sell off the family silver it would appear to be a vote of no confidence in the future of this economy and in our hopes of putting people back to work.</P>
    <P>I will give one example to illustrate the kind of thing envisaged by the Minister. The Dublin Port and Docks Board owned 25 acres of fully serviced land at the docks site in Dublin.  The IDA had an option on ten acres and a company called AI Industrial Wastes had a waste disposal site in the area, operating illegally, causing a nuisance to residents, and adjacent to the proposed site for the sports centre. The Minister, Deputy Flynn, gave instructions to have them moved at any cost.  The IDA sold the site privately for £400,000.  The Dublin Port and Docks Board subsequently sold the balance of 15 acres for £450,000 to a company which proposed to provide airport short takeoff and landing facilities.  AI Industrial Wastes sold to the airport company for £1 million within six months.  The airport sold the total site of 25 acres to a UK company who are now developing a £27 million industrial estate.  Two questions arise from that.  Why were the IDA, whose job is supposed to be to encourage industrial development, forced to sell this prime site?  What is the IDA strategy for sites in Dublin, particularly in North Dublin, and why did the IDA not benefit to the full value of the site?  If the intention is to sell off the family silver, it is tantamount to a vote of no confidence in this economy and future generations will live to regret it.</P>
    <P>The two matters in this budget which were of fundamental importance were, first, the question of what measures the Minister could take to improve job creation and what measures he would take to initiate genuine tax reform.  The Minister has missed both opportunities. I have dealt at some length with the taxation arguments.  It is a cause of serious disappointment to the PAYE sector that, ten years after they marched on the streets for tax reform, their situation is little better than it was then.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="418" /> It always happens &mdash; it was the case last year &mdash; despite claims to have reduced tax on the PAYE sector that they end up paying more at the end of the year than was predicted at the beginning of the year.  That, of course, will also happen this year.  There has also been a most disappointing performance in regard to jobs which reveals the conflict, bewilderment and confusion at the heart of Government about what they have to do to get our people working.  To hear a Minister admit on television last night that full employment will never be the case in this economy is the most dismal prediction a Minister has ever made.  I would almost have preferred the disingenuous promises from Fianna Fáil since 1932 that they would put our people to work.  As the late Mr. de Valera said: &ldquo;No more will our children, like our cattle, be raised for export&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I would almost prefer to believe that kind of fairytale than have the new cutting edge of this Government, the PD wing, go on television and tell the people that to seriously contemplate an economy where we can put our people back to work is a mirage and will never happen. We will never get out of this spiral where too few of us at work have to pay for and carry on our backs &mdash; not only the cost of running the social services &mdash; but the huge pool of unemployed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>It has to be agreed, however reluctanly by some Opposition Members, that a great many people in this country feel better off today.  The newspapers have told them precisely how much better they will do as a result of the tax reform and social welfare measures in the budget. The general public are clear that this is a budget geared to consolidate the national recovery, increase our international competitiveness and improve the living standards of the weaker sections of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Immediate good news is always welcome but this budget, when it comes to the Environment, also provides long term good news.  It provides the money for the <Col N="419" /> biggest, most comprehensive, best co-ordinated environment package in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>I will go further.  The environment action programme I announced last Friday is arguably the best example of a country rapidly coming to terms with environmental threat, identifying environmental opportunity, cherishing environmental assets, and encapsulating all of that in a national plan, a radical plan, a workable plan.</P>
    <P>It is part of a continuum which started as soon as I became Minister for the Environment.  At that time, the Department were essentially the Department of Local Government and the Department that related to the construction industry. Within months, I announced that I would turn it around, to grapple effectively with the environmental problems which were beginning to simmer beneath the surface. Last year's budget started the environment ball rolling; this year it has gained speed and scale.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach indicated that this six month period would be a Green EC Presidency.  By his involvement and commitment to the environment action programme, he has made that real.  Today's budget makes it fact.  In environmental terms, this Government have put their money where their mouth is.</P>
    <P>What about specifics?  Twenty million pounds has been allocated for initial expenditure on measures announced in the action programme with the commitment that the moneys necessary over the coming decade will be found in each succeding budget.</P>
    <P>The package is about information.  The road to environmental disaster is paved with good intentions not backed up by information.  The plan lays a new emphasis on the delivery of information to individuals so that they can make the right environmental choices in every aspect of their lives.</P>
    <P>Information will be available in the high street; specifically a city location, where £600,000 will set up the headquarters of ENFO, a new national environment service.  The ENFO premises will <Col N="420" /> be a green one-stop shop.  If you want information on the toxic products you may have in your kitchen or back garden ENFO will provide it.  If you are a schoolgoer doing a project ENFO will provide you with information in a form you can handle.  If you are a researcher needing data on the international environment story ENFO will put you in touch directly with data bases here and in other countries.</P>
    <P>Information encourages people &mdash; and we need our people, as individuals, as communities and as workers &mdash; to take care of our precious environment.  That is why this budget has allocated extra funding for promotional programmes related to issues like smoke pollution, unleaded petrol, litter and recycling.  The extra funding amounts to £200,000 in 1990.</P>
    <P>A change of mind is one thing.  A change of habit is a quite different thing as the unleaded saga makes clear.  Drivers know unleaded is better for the environment and some have changed over, but not enough.  Even with the concession in last year's budget, which brought down the price of unleaded below leaded, the consumption has only gone up to 13 per cent of all petrol sales.</P>
    <P>We have to get this thing moving faster and so the Government have decided to build on last year's budget.  The differential between leaded and unleaded is now 10p per gallon.  On a tankful of petrol the saving could be £1 or higher depending on the type of car.  The increased price differential should boost sales of unleaded petrol substantially and help us achieve the ultimate objective &mdash; putting an end to the use of leaded petrol in this country.</P>
    <P>Putting an end to the use of smokey coal in our capital city is a Government objective with a deadline.  Now, we are saying bluntly that bituminous coal has to go.  Its marketing, sale and distribution in Dublin stops in October next.  It is as simple as that.  However, it will not be simple to implement.  It is not simple to change patterns of living etched in the memory of Dubliners.  It is not simple to make so massive a change and at the <Col N="421" /> same time protect the vulnerable of Dublin, the old, the sick and the poor people.  Hence the provision of an extra £3 million in this budget to help the changeover.  To soften the blow, work is already in hand on a plan to make the best use of this extra money so that the inevitable problems are kept to a minimum.</P>
    <P>For the last few years, Dublin had smog in the winter while in the summer not all our beaches have been a joy. There are two aspects to this.  One is the cleaning up of our seas.  The environment action programme demonstrates our commitment as a Government to tackling head on the pollution of our rivers and coastal waters.</P>
    <P>I intend, by the year 2000 to eliminate all pollution of inland waters by sewage discharges, to eliminate discharges of untreated sewage from major coastal towns which will cost £400 million, to have secondary treatment facilities, costing £40 million designed, urgently, for Ringsend and to clean up Dublin Bay, to bring to an end the present arrangements for the disposal of sewage sludge by Dublin Corporation and to bring to an end all dumping at sea from our land based sources.  These are just some of a host of measures which are going into place right now.</P>
    <P>Our objective is that our seas will be clean, not nearly clean, not clean in isolated areas but that we will have the cleanest coastline in Europe.  That is going to make a considerable difference to the holidaymaker and tourists who in increasing numbers use our beaches.</P>
    <P>The Government have agreed to double the grants to local authorities for amenity work at beaches. The grants go from £500,000 to £1 million.  That means better facilities for ourselves and for visitors attracted to the country.  In some areas, let us be clear, we have to change our environmental practices.</P>
    <P>By international standards, for example, waste recycling in Ireland is very low.  I have got to change that by positive indications backed with money. I propose that each local authority prepare a recycling scheme for its area by <Col N="422" /> June of this year, identifying recycling opportunities and saying how it will facilitate and promote recycling.  Another nudge, backed by money, is the provision of grants to voluntary bodies and local authorities for small-scale recycling activities.  It is going up from £250,000 to £500,000 this year.</P>
    <P>What we want to achieve is a situation where every business, every school, every home, segregates its waste so that paper is recycled, cans are recycled and plastic is recycled.  It is a big objective, and we have to reach it by starting small, starting local.  This year's budget allows us to do precisely that.</P>
    <P>We have also got to recycle CFCs. We are seeking at international level to eliminate their use but CFCs are already around us in most of our houses and what we need to do is make sure we dispose of that material as safely as possible.  This budget allows me to allocate £50,000 this year to promote recovery and recycling facilities for CFCs, especially those used as coolants in fridges.  Here again, local authorities have a developing and important role to play.  County Wicklow set a good example for other counties when they took the initiative as far as CFCs recovery is concerned.</P>
    <P>Most of us who care for the environment want action now.  The environment action programme is action now and it is costly action now.  But we have got to make sure that we are not throwing money at environmental problems; money does change those problems, it does not solve those problems.</P>
    <P>One of the things that is becoming very clear is that people's feelings about the environment do not always inform their day-to-day decisions.  Why?  We do not know.  We do not have a handle on the level of environmental knowledge in this country, nor on the attitudes and behaviour that have got us to where we are, that must be informed and changed if we are to get where we want to go.</P>
    <P>For that reason, £100,000 is to go on a baseline survey which will give us at least some of the answers and which will make sure that in planning policy and promotion programmes in future we are not <Col N="423" /> planning in hope from a basis of understanding and knowledge but truly it can be said that the budget of 1990 will be a green budget which will have a dramatic impact on the environment from now until the end of the century.</P>
    <P>Not for a decade has a Minister for the Environment been able to give an entirely favourable picture of the construction industry.  I am fortunate to be the Minister who has the pleasure of announcing to this House today that 1989 was a bumper year for this key sector of the economy with significant growth across all areas of the industry.</P>
    <P>The trend of declining output and of declining employment which had persisted since 1981 was not just halted in its tracks; it was reversed.  Volume growth of at least 10 per cent was achieved.  Jobs came with that growth; construction jobs rose by more than 4,000 last year: that is direct construction jobs.  There were countless other jobs created in areas providing support services to the industry.</P>
    <P>What is most significant is the fact that current volume growth is being underpinned principally by private investment, not by unsustainable public expenditure. It comes from areas such as new commercial development and new private residential construction, which showed increases in output of more than 50 per cent and 20 per cent respectively.</P>
    <P>The long-term implications for our economy of this move are all good.  I looked at the expenditure when I came into office and it seemed to me very obvious that we were digging ourselves a hole out of which we would never climb unless we stopped digging, and did some lateral thinking.  We have done that and the payoff is evident, not just evident now, but will continue to be evident &mdash; and beneficial &mdash; in the future.</P>
    <P>The present resurgence in the construction industry did not just grow, like Topsy, and people within the industry are the first to admit it.  Government strategy has helped to create the present resurgence particularly by the introduction of important incentives to promote construction activity in key areas. <Col N="424" /> Among the most important of these are the urban renewal scheme and the section 23 &mdash; type tax relief for the provision of private residential accommodation for renting.  Both of these incentives have generated significant building activity in the residential and commercial sectors.</P>
    <P>The budget provides for the extension of the time-limit applying to qualifying expenditure in the designated areas from 31 May 1991 to 31 May 1993.</P>
    <P>This extension of time limit gives breathing space for orderly progressive development in the present designated areas and those additional areas which I will be announcing shortly.</P>
    <P>Nineteen hundred and ninety will also see the tide turn on publicly funded construction works.  The provisions in the 1990 Public Capital Programme affecting the construction industry represent an increase of almost £57 million in real terms over 1989.  The major expenditure increases are on roads, sanitary services, agriculture, industry and the local authority housing programme.  These increases will contribute over 4.5 per cent to volume growth and generate at least 1,500 direct jobs in the industry in 1990. EC Structural Fund assistance is an important feature of the increased PCP provisions affecting construction, and, indeed, of the industry's excellent medium-term prospects.</P>
    <P>The prospects for the construction industry are better now than they have been for a decade.  For the industry, the last decade was like knocking your head off a stone wall; it was lovely when the knocking stopped, as it did in the last couple of years.  The feeling has been one of relief.  Relief, not confidence.  Now confidence is beginning to develop as the industry realises that the Government objective for 1990 is to reinforce the growth pattern, based on the upturn in 1989, and to give the industry a strong competitive edge.  If Ireland's construction industry has that strong competitive edge, facing into and fully exploiting the potential expansion at home and the opportunities in Europe will be a welcome opportunity, not a threatening challenge.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="425" /> I have been talking about growth, sustainable growth, in the construction sector.  That growth has meant that the level of appeals received by An Bord Pleanála increased significantly during 1989.  The Government are most anxious to ensure that appeals are dealt with as expeditiously as possible by the board and that the targets the board have set for themselves in this regard will be met. Accordingly, I am providing an additional sum of £250,000 to the board in 1990 to bring the total Exchequer provision to £1.45 million.  The facts are that in 1989, appeals were up 34 per cent over 1988 and up 24 per cent over the 1987 figure.</P>
    <P>The Government have always been most anxious to ensure that the build-up of a backlog of appeals in An Bord Pleanála does not hinder the continued growth of the construction sector or its important contribution to the overall growth in the economy.  Therefore, we responded positively to all requests for staffing and other additional resources during 1989.  Three professional staff were recruited, a further four were retained on a fee-per-case basis to deal with the workload and five clerical/administrative staff were appointed.</P>
    <P>In 1989 an additional Exchequer funding of £121,000 was provided on top of the original Estimates provision of £1.2 million.  All these steps were taken to ensure that the board had sufficient resources to deal with the task in hand. While about 90 per cent of all appeals are dealt with within six months, there is no doubt that better can be achieved.  As a first step in this direction, the board have set themselves the target of ensuring that all appeals are dealt with within six months by the end of March 1990 and further improving the targets thereafter. I will be pressing the board to meet this target.</P>
    <P>I have previously announced an increase in the level of appeal fees payable to the board from 1 February 1990. Together with the extra income to be generated by the increased fees, estimated at £100,000, the board are more <Col N="426" /> than adequately catered for in the current year.  The Government have done all in their power to ensure that the board will be in a position to fulfil their functions in an effective and efficient way.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to one of the most successful aspects of Government policy, the reviving of our inner cities by the designated areas incentive.</P>
    <P>The budget fully preserves the benefits of the urban renewal incentives, notwithstanding the changes being made otherwise in the system of allowances against corporation tax.  It goes further and provides for a year by year extension of these allowances beyond the previous deadline of May, 1991 until 31 May, 1993.</P>
    <P>This measure is a vote of confidence in the urban renewal programme, and it will ensure that the £170 million worth of work which is still in planning within the designated areas will be consolidated and built on even further.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind Deputies of some of the achievements of the urban renewal programme so far.  Apart from the Custom House Docks development, which will ultimately involve construction to a value of some £300 million, projects to a value of some £30 million have already been completed in the 15 designated areas and work valued at £110 million is actively in progress.</P>
    <P>All of this investment will create in the region of 7,500 once-off man year construction jobs, with substantial permanent employment to follow, especially in the services sector.</P>
    <P>I have already made clear my proposal to build on the success of this programme by, in particular, extending urban renewal designation to a number of additional areas in Dublin and to eight new provincial centres &mdash; Ballina, Bray, Carlow, Clonmel, Drogheda, Ennis, Longford and Portlaoise.  I am finalising my detailed proposals to implement these measures and I hope to announce them shortly.</P>
    <P>In 1989, a sum of £2 million was provided in State grants to assist works by local authorities designed to enhance the environment of the designated areas and to complement other development under <Col N="427" /> the urban renewal programme.  Very worthwhile work has been carried out in many areas under this scheme.  The original provision of £2 million for these grants in the 1990 Estimates will be increased to £2.5 million, in accordance with the recently announced environment action programme.</P>
    <P>Let me now inform the House on the overall housing situation.  In 1989 over 18,000 new houses were completed, compared to just 15,600 in the previous year. All the indications are that a further significant increase in new house building will be achieved in 1990, but with a crucial difference.  While the increase in 1989 was entirely due to the strong recovery in the private housebuilding sector, 1990 will see increased output across the board in both private and local authority housing.</P>
    <P>Last year's resurgence of the private housing sector, after years of decline, proves once again that housing demand is affected by general economic conditions more than any other factor.  The restructuring of stamp duty rates applicable to transfers of houses and land valued at less than £25,000 will help the purchasing of modest size houses.</P>
    <P>This year £51 million will be available for the local authority housing programme and there are important changes in the sourcing of finance for this work. The Government have decided that the proceeds of the local authority house sales schemes should be used to fund most of the programme.  Of the total capital being provided, £33 million will be used to build and acquire new dwellings. This is an increase of over 50 per cent on the 1989 outturn and reverses the trend of previous years since 1984.  The increased funding for the programme this year will yield about 1,200 completions in 1990 and facilitate about the same number of housing starts.  This level of completions, together with casual vacancies arising from existing stock, should produce over 4,000 new lettings during the year.  Also, additional employment will be provided on the new house building programme this year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="428" /> The results of the most comprehensive and in-depth survey yet carried out of the need for local authority housing show that, at 30 September, 1989, the aggregate number of approved applicants for local authority housing was about 19,300 households.</P>
    <P>The Housing Act, 1988 provides a framework for housing authorities to deal more effectively with the problem of homelessness.  Local authorities can now rent accommodation outside their own stock or make financial arrangements with voluntary bodies to provide accommodation for homeless people.  My Department will recoup 80 per cent of payments made by a local authority arising from its exercise of powers under section 10 of the Act and the provision for such recoupment has been increased to £600,000 this year.</P>
    <P>The provision of accommodation by voluntary housing organisations plays a key part in meeting the housing needs of homeless people, elderly people and other disadvantaged groups.  Last year, some 400 units of accommodation were provided by voluntary groups and organisations with the aid of £6.6 million from my Department.</P>
    <P>New projects continue to be brought forward by existing approved voluntary organisations.  New organisations continue to be formed throughout the country.  What they are doing is important. It should not be unduly delayed by lack of resources.  To further encourage the voluntary housing sector, the Government, at my request, have decided to increase the original provision for voluntary housing in 1990 by £1.3 to £9.3 million.  This represents an increase of 41 per cent on last year's expenditure and is clear evidence of the Government's commitment to meeting the housing needs of the most disadvantaged groups in our society.</P>
    <P>The budget allocation for voluntary housing includes a special provision of £120,000 for the Focus Point project in Stanhope Street, Dublin: the largest single voluntary housing project.  When completed it is going to contain 86 single flatlets and 10 small family units.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="429" /> In a sense this will be the flagship of all the work being done by voluntary groups for the homeless under the Government's programme for housing the homeless announced in 1988.</P>
    <P>The special allocation &mdash; additional to the ordinary grant of £1.92 million already committed &mdash; is intended to fund the inclusion of communal facilities and other features that will give the project a pleasant community ambience far removed from the institutional atmosphere of days gone by.</P>
    <P>It recognises the work being done by Focus Point and the major contribution the development will make to relieving the problem of homelessness in Dublin's inner city.</P>
    <P>I mentioned days gone by.  Sometimes &ldquo;days gone by&rdquo; leave us with something valuable, but something which can disappear if we do not take action.  We used to be a country of many thatched cottages but that is no longer the case.  Now, it is their absence which is establishing the character of many parts of the country.</P>
    <P>That is a pity, in many ways.  Thatched houses represent an important and distinctive element in the Irish heritage but sadly they are also a disappearing aspect of our heritage.  In some parts of the country where thatched cottages were the traditional house form &mdash; and they were certainly the traditional house form where Deputy Flaherty's grandparents came from &mdash; they have become very rare indeed.</P>

      <P>In summary, then, this budget has been described as hard headed and soft hearted.  It has taken the opportunity offered to introduce reforms to the existing taxation system; to provide incentives and encouragement for further economic development; to increase payment levels and introduce schemes for those who rely on the social welfare system.</P>
      <P>What it has also done is provide substantial funds to improve our environment, funds that will go towards immediate action and long-term measures; funds that will go to solving problems that have been with us for far too long &mdash; and which will go to preventing the development of other problems; funds that will take care of our built and our natural environment so that this country is always a green and pleasant land to live in.</P>
      <P>Yes, this is a caring budget.  It is a careful and controlled budget but it is also a green budget of a kind we have never had before.</P>
      <P>There is always a danger that in the rush to make political points, we will not see the wood for the trees.  This budget ensures that we will continue to have trees during the coming decade, that we will have clean air and clean water and a continued growth in the construction industry.</P>
      <P>I trust that this House will acknowledge this historic re-positioning of the environment in Government policy and national direction.</P>

      <P>Fine Gael believe this budget will leave inequality and poverty rampant in our society and leave our social welfare system riddled with anomalies. Last week Fine Gael produced a document containing their proposals on social welfare and anti-poverty measures and targeted certain areas for action.  The first area we identified as being in urgent need of a response is the position of those on low pay.  However, the budget has by and large not dealt with those on low pay and those who were caught in the poverty <Col N="431" /> trap prior to the budget will be more firmly fixed in it than ever.</P>
      <P>The changes proposed will not affect the majority of those on low pay.  The reforms in PRSI mooted in the budget will not help the group caught in the poverty trap identified during the past number of weeks by Deputy Jim Mitchell. I am referring in particular to husbands and wives and their children, to people on low pay and who are better off on social welfare.  The exemption from PRSI payments for those earning £60 per week is irrelevant to those people.  The only way some families may benefit indirectly from this proposal is where the wife is the low paid earner.  The failure to tackle the area of low pay is one of the major disappointments of this budget. Fine Gael proposed that the PRSI exemption should be extended to the first £2,500 of all income.  This would have affected workers at all levels and could have been clawed back by raising the ceilings for higher levels.  This would have directly helped the category of people about whom we are most concerned.</P>
      <P>The changes proposed in relation to tax and social welfare are a totally inadequate response to the plight of families with children which report after report has identified as suffering most from poverty and who are most at risk.  The net package for social welfare amounts to £76 million of gross additional expenditure. As our party leader pointed out this morning, £57 million of this amount has already been found through savings in the Department of Social Welfare so the net additional expenditure will be more in the order of £20 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase of 5 per cent in line with inflation to social welfare recipients may initially seem like a shiny package but it loses its shine very rapidly on closer inspection.  We have to remember that last year inflation greatly exceeded the level of any increases awarded and there is a necessary catch-up of between 1 and 1.5 per cent for social welfare recipients. We also have to take into account the figures for inflation being mooted by various commentators which range from 3.5 <Col N="432" /> to 4.5 per cent.  If we have a higher level of inflation this year, then the basic rate of increase for social welfare recipients will not match the inflation rate.</P>
    <P>A very valid point which the general rate of inflation may hide is that the items on which those on very low incomes spend the bulk of their money do not relate exactly to the overall consumer price index.  These people spend a very high proportion of their money on basic items of food and clothing and accommodation. The last assessment of the inflation rate showed that accommodation and food costs made up a very high proportion of the increase in the consumer price index.  This means that the real rate of inflation may be higher for families on social welfare than the national average.  This is also borne out by the fact that many families on social welfare are facing rent increases of up to 25 per cent on the levels they paid last year.  I know we are talking about very low rents but we are also talking about extremely low incomes.  If this is an indication of the increases that will have to be borne by these people, then the increases awarded in this budget will not even cover them for the increase in inflation and will do nothing to improve their position.</P>
    <P>There has been some rationalisation and targeting in this budget but there has been inadequate targeting of families with children.  In some cases dependant allowances have gone up by pennies and in other cases they have gone up more substantially.  The minimum rate has been increased from £10 to £11 but this is substantially below the level recommended by most commentators as adequate for maintaining and supporting children.  The Minister has failed to acknowledge in any way the case we made in our pre-budget submission about the extra costs of rearing older children. A child of 12 years plus can be classified as an adult and may need adult clothing and footwear.  All commentators and most of the members of the Conference of Major Religious Superiors who are campaigning for social welfare reform have identified the need for extra support for older children.  I regret very much <Col N="433" /> that no progress has been made in this area which we highlighted as being very much in need of action.</P>
    <P>The only differentiation in dependency levels is the size of families.  Large families and the age of children increase the demands on family incomes very substantially because of additional schooling costs, examination expenses, etc.  Families with teenagers can have a lot of demands on their income and we believe this concept should be introduced into social welfare payments.  We will raise this matter again when we are debating the Social Welfare Bill and I hope we will be successful in winning a response from the Minister.</P>
    <P>The other very important factor to bear in mind in the light of the glowing presentation of a generous and caring budget is the background of the substantial savings made in the social welfare area over the past number of years.  The Minister has regularly claimed to have made savings in the order of £200 million in the social welfare area over the past two years and during the past two months since the Estimates were produced he has been able to save a further £59 million. What will be the saving in a whole year? What does the give-away really amount to?  I will refer later to specific social welfare schemes.</P>
    <P>In our pre-budget submission we argued there is a need for a multi-disciplinary approach in tackling poverty. With a few honourable exceptions, the Government have failed to tackle this problem seriously.  I listened for the last half an hour to the Minister for the Environment talking about a green Ireland and a caring Ireland.  It seems that the only housing to be provided are thatched cottages in the west, but I would like to point out to him that there are people in Dublin city who would settle for any kind of cottage or accommodation and that by the end of this year the problem will be a great deal more serious because of the grossly inadequate level of funding provided for local authority housing.  I thought this was one of the issues which would have been addressed by the Government if they were serious about <Col N="434" /> responding to people's needs.  It is bad enough to have to live on inadequate incomes, but having to live in over-crowded or inadequate accommodation in estates crying out for improvements and upgrading and which have been listed in local authority plans for five or six years adds to their plight.  However no attempt has been made to address the growing housing crisis in Dublin city. You, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, know this as well as I do.  I, as I am sure you did, had hoped that there would have been some allocation for refurbishment in Dublin city and in our other cities, but unfortunately there was no such good news.</P>
    <P>The Minister in detailing the grossly inadequate allocation for housing this year said this marked the end of the downward trend, but this is blatant misrepresentation of the facts.  The funds allocated in the budget do not come anywhere near the amount of funds provided for housing in Dublin city alone four or five years ago.  The allocation has to be spread around the country which inevitably means thinly.  The failure of the Government to put together a package to tackle this problem will add to the problems facing people on grossly inadequate incomes who will find that the problems they face in health, housing and legal aid have not been eased in any way.</P>
    <P>I welcome the response to the demands we made on primary education and the increased allocation for second level schools.  Our second level schools following the withdrawal of the religious and their indirect subsidies for second level education, are becoming the Cinderella of our education system in terms of their capacity to meet the cost of maintaining and upgrading buildings and providing equipment and to maintain standards.  I also welcome the fact that this area has to some degree been targeted.</P>
    <P>I support the view expressed by my party leader this morning that people living on inadequate incomes will find that their housing problems, as I have already identified, are going to get worse, and there is nothing in the budget which will lead them to have any hope that their <Col N="435" /> position will improve.  They will also find that if they run into family and legal problems the services being provided are grossly inadequate.  The same will apply in the area of health.  There is nothing in the budget which will lead to the average person thinking that the service will improve.</P>
    <P>I welcome the gesture the Minister made towards women.  In our pre-budget submission we indicated that women are strongly represented among the social welfare groupings, the poor, and form the bulk of the low paid.  I now want to refer to the PRSI exemption on incomes below £60.  The problem in using exemptions to assist people is that there has to be a cut-off point and above that figure people run into problems.  Therefore as is the case with equality legislation there is an incentive to keep people on low pay. The reactions of a group of unemployed workers yesterday to the budget which included &ldquo;I do not want to be forced into slave labour&rdquo; and &ldquo;I do not want to be paid £2 extra a week, I want a job&rdquo; should focus our attention on another weakness in the budget and that is the lack of action on jobs.  I will return to this point later.</P>
    <P>At present women are over-represented among the social welfare groupings and the poor and they make up the bulk of the low paid.  This exemption will help to ease the plight of some women but it will also act as a temptation to keep women confined to those lower levels of income.  While I have no reason to doubt that the Minister will handle this matter with sensitivity and compassion these funds should be allocated to a department of women's affairs.  I regret that we do not have such a department.  The fact that the Government are reintroducing a heading in the budget indicates that they were wrong to abolish it in the first place. I also expect them in due course to admit that they were wrong to abolish the women's affairs section.  Women are carrying on the struggle in a very determined way and are coping well under very difficult circumstances.  They need our support.  Women's organisations, particularly in poorer areas, are often left <Col N="436" /> with the burden of tackling the problems facing families on their own.  They deserve direct support.  I welcome this step as an acknowledgement of the immense work that they do and I hope this will be followed in due course by greater funding and the re-establishment of a department of women's affairs which in my view is essential.</P>
    <P>The unions in their response to the budget expressed their disappointment at the failure to take any action on jobs. Even though the budget was presented as one which would encourage job creation it contains nothing which will free the job market.  The Minister has made no attempt to radically reform social welfare or to integrate social welfare, PRSI and taxation and leaves the burden of taxation on employment almost unchanged.  No attempt is made to remove the poverty traps to help husbands with a dependent wife and family nor is any attempt made to remove the disincentives to take up employment except for those at the very lowest margins of income.  The position of the person on the average industrial wage with a large family will remain unchanged.</P>
    <P>What is required is radical reform and the restructuring of PRSI and taxation along the lines suggested by Fine Gael in 1989.  In the absence of such reform and restructuring we have to look at the existing schemes to see how they can be better targeted and improved.  On a first reading the list of schemes announced by the Minister makes impressive reading but when we examine them more closely we see that they are grossly inadequate. While the position of the long-term unemployed on unemployment assistance has been significantly improved, they have leapfrogged, to an ever greater degree, those on unemployment benefit and disability benefit.  This is strange if there is to be any coherence in the idea of having a social insurance scheme.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to get statistics &mdash; at least I do not see them &mdash; for those on disability benefit and unemployment benefit who are in receipt of pay-related benefit. Only a further 2 per cent of the gross spending on disability benefit is spent on <Col N="437" /> pay-related benefit.  In the case of unemployment benefit one would have expected it to be fairly substantial but the figure is of the order of 10 per cent.  This indicates a tiny number in receipt of pay-related benefit while in receipt of disability benefit, and a substantial number of those on unemployment benefit in receipt of no additional benefit.  They are now on a lower level of benefit than all social welfare recipients other than the supplementary welfare group.  This is a problem for those on disability benefit. At least if you are on unemployment benefit for 15 months you have the option of proceeding to unemployment assistance, to a higher level of benefit, and the additional benefits that go with that such as free fuel, bonus payments, etc.</P>
    <P>According to the Minister's statistics, many people on disability benefit have been in receipt of it for three to five years &mdash; upwards of 22,000 recipients have been receiving disability benefit.  While a number of them, said to amount to half, would have other sources of income into the family, the other half must be entirely dependent on disability benefit.</P>
    <P>I have had this argument with the Minister at Question Time and feel I have not got very far with it.  Fine Gael are concerned about this group.  Coming up to Christmas they were in contact with me and, I am sure, with other Deputies about facing Christmas on a lower level of benefit and treated as short-term recipients although some of them have been in receipt of disability benefit for many years; they have applied for their invalidity pension, which the Minister suggests is easily available, and have been turned down time and time again and asked to come back six months or a year later to be checked again.</P>
    <P>Invalidity pension is extremely difficult to get.  The position of that category is appalling because the supplementary welfare system is not even allowed to respond to them positively in that they are seen as being on short-term benefit. There is an urgent need to address the problems of this group and to bring their payments more in line with those of other social welfare recipients.  This group have <Col N="438" /> become a sub-class, perhaps because of the failure to reform the whole area of disability benefit entirely.</P>
    <P>A large group are in need of assistance along the lines of disability payments, which would be means tested.  This would allow them to come on the higher rates and get all the ancillary benefits.  This group have a large number of dependants and they are living on grossly inadequate incomes for long periods.  We will raise this problem again on the Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister has allocated £1 million for the improvement in the family income supplement scheme.  This is grossly inadequate to do what Fine Gael recommend, which is to calculate this on net rather than gross pay.  It is totally inadequate to respond in any way to the fact that the tax changes have left the position of the low paid at work virtually unchanged and unimproved, and they are caught as much as ever in the poverty trap.  Their only hope is the FIS.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister, through the Revenue Commissioners, intends to target the low paid with information.  This was recommended by Dr. Blackwell in his study of the FIS.  I regret that his advice was not taken for a more targeted approach rather than a general PR campaign which may have done the Minister and the Department some good but simply raised expectations of large numbers of people who are not qualified. The target information did not reach the identifiable groups who might have been beneficiaries.  While there has been an increase in the uptake of this benefit, it has not reached all those who qualify.</P>
    <P>The Minister says he will ensure that persons who qualify for FIS will not lose their medical card.  That is welcome, and I will be very interested to hear how he intends to implement this because this is seen as a disincentive to take up the FIS because these people would lose benefits they have as a result of their level of income.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not refer to the demand from women on separate payments. I understand that he has in the past indicated a willingness to deal with <Col N="439" /> this but there has been a total failure to do anything about it.  Women on separate payments looking after their children and often separated from their husbands or maybe living with a husband who is not maintaining the family properly, who has an alcohol problem and is using up a substantial portion of the family income, should be able to receive at least half the combined personal adult dependant allowance.  This was acknowledged on another occasion by the Minister but we have seen no effective action on this to date.  I would like the Minister to respond to that.</P>
    <P>Much has been made of the improvement in the prescribed relative's allowance. This is welcome because up to the announcement in the budget it was the lowest of all social welfare payments for a service we claim to regard highly.  The proposal to increase the level of payment to approximately that of unemployment assistance is welcome and is a move in line with our policy.</P>

      <P>The most problematic part is that only 2,000 people nationally are currently benefiting from this.  The number of people caring for elderly relatives is of the order of 60,000 and unless the conditions under which this allowance is awarded are improved, this will be a nominal change and will have no substantial effect on improving the situation for carers.  This is an essential reform and we will be pressing for the rules to qualify for this allowance to be improved and relaxed.  The fact that a person is giving up employment to look after somebody else should be taken into account.</P>

    <P>The scheme for free travel for the handicapped is confined to those on DPMA.  This excludes blind pensioners and old age pensioners.  In my correspondence there is a great demand among those to be included in this <Col N="440" /> scheme.  The Minister has not mentioned the issue of <i>pro rata</i> old age pensions for people who are in mixed insurance. These are people who have contributed an average of between five and 19 annual contributions.  One group of pensioners have qualified but a large group of pensioners are excluded.  This is an anomaly and an injustice.  I have been trying for months to get the numbers involved from the Minister.  The Minister, kicking to touch, says the pensions board are looking at it.</P>

      <P>This budget continues the progress we have made over the last three years.  Our successful economic strategy, set out in 1987 in the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> continues in place with the <i>Programme for Government 1989-1993.</i></P>
      <P>Our objective is to achieve strong and sustainable economic growth with increased employment and a reduction in personal taxation.  At the same time, we are committed to maintaining and improving the position of those who depend on social welfare.</P>
      <P>This budget produces a unique balance in achieving our twin objectives of social concern and the promotion of enterprise and jobs.  The social welfare provisions show the Government's continued determination to protect and improve the position of those dependent on social welfare. The package of improvements which we are implementing will more than maintain the position of all those on social welfare and at the same time special additional increases are being given to a wider range of people than in previous years.  The total value of the package for those on social welfare or at work on low pay is £216 million in a full year and £100 million this year.  It brings estimated total social welfare expenditure to £2,764 million in 1990, its highest ever figure.</P>

    <P>The main improvements in social welfare payments in this year's budget package are: weekly social welfare payments, which will increase, in general, by a minimum of 5 per cent; the 5 per cent increase will also apply to child benefit from October; there will be special increases in certain rates as follows: £5 per week (11 per cent) to £52 for people on long term unemployment assistance or single woman's allowance: special increases of between 7 per cent and 15 per cent in the rates for adult dependants of the unemployed and those on supplementary welfare. The new adult dependant rate for all of these payments will be £31 per week; £4.80 per week (10 per cent) to £52 for people on disabled person's maintenance allowance; £4 per week (8 per cent) to £53 for widows, widowers, deserted wives-husbands, unmarried mothers and prisoners' wives under 66 on means-tested pensions or allowances; £3 per week to £53 for people on non-contributory old age pensions; £3.50 per week to £56 for widows and deserted wives under 66 on contributory pensions; £3 per week (7 per cent) to £45 for people on short term unemployment assistance or supplementary welfare allowance; and £3 per week (7 per cent) to £48 for people on unemployment benefit or disability benefit.</P>
    <P>There will be an increase to a minimum of £11 per week per child in the child dependant allowances payable with weekly social welfare payments.  Streamlining of the rates for child dependants will reduce the total number of these <Col N="442" /> rates from 12 to six i.e. down from 36 rates in three years.</P>
    <P>Child dependant allowances up to 20 years of age will be paid to the long term unemployed, old age and invalidity pensioners, where the child remains in full time education.</P>
    <P>A new clothing allowance will be introduced in September to help social welfare recipients to provide for their children's school and winter clothing.  Three million pounds has been provided for this allowance.</P>
    <P>A new carer's allowance will replace the current payments for prescribed relatives providing full time care and attention to pensioners in October.  The rate of the allowance will be £45 per week, an increase of £17 (61 per cent).  The new allowance will be means-tested and a wider range of people will be able to qualify as carers under the scheme. Arrangements will be made to preserve entitlement to the existing prescribed relative's allowance where this would be to the advantage of the household.</P>
    <P>Improvements to the value of £1 million will be introduced in the family income supplement &mdash; FIS.  These will include increasing the income limits and the maximum amounts payable.</P>
    <P>Extra benefits such as free travel and free electricity will be extended to certain pensioners, as follows: a companion will be allowed travel free with a recipient of disabled person's maintenance allowance &mdash; this will particularly benefit handicapped people, including mentally handicapped; all the extra benefits will be extended to pensioners of states, such as Austria, with whom Ireland has bilateral social security agreements &mdash; we are completing a number of other bilateral agreements at present; people aged over 80 who have free electricity or natural gas allowance and free TV licence will retain these entitlements even if someone comes to live with them; and invalidity pensioners who transfer to retirement pension will now retain their entitlement to extra benefits.</P>
    <P>The national fuel scheme will be extended to householders where a long term social welfare recipient lives with someone on short term unemployment <Col N="443" /> assistance or supplementary welfare allowance.  Deputies will be aware that the scheme was introduced for the elderly originally.  It was then extended to the long term unemployed and I am now arranging that those on short term unemployment assistance or supplementary welfare allowance will not be debarred from the scheme.  This is an important improvement.  It will also be extended to smallholders receiving long term unemployment assistance who are living alone. That, of course means living within the general terms of living alone, which can mean living with a dependent wife or children or other dependants.</P>
    <P>Special grants will be paid as follows: a special allocation of £500,000 for programmes for women.  Of this £150,000 is for the Rape Crisis Centres.  The balance will be used to give grant-aid to self-help groups working with women in the local community; a special allocation of £550,000 for community development and other initiatives will be used to support certain worth-while projects which did not get funding under the third EC Poverty Programme; and a grant of £50,000 to the Simon Community for community enterprise projects which involve the homeless.</P>
    <P>A PRSI exemption for low-paid workers is being introduced.  From April 1990 workers currently paying full rate PRSI whose gross earnings are at or below £60 in a week will be exempt from their share of the PRSI contribution (5.5 per cent) for that week.  They will continue entitlement to full benefits.  The value of the exemption is up to £3.30 per week for these low paid workers.</P>
    <P>Tax exemption limits for low-paid workers are improved as follows (from April):</P>

    <P>That represents a very substantial increase.  As a result a family with five children earning up to £8,000 a year <Col N="444" /> (£150 per week) will be exempt from income tax, with marginal relief above that level.  There is further relief for those earning above £8,000.</P>
    <P>The age exemption limits for income tax are being increased for single persons to £3,750 for those aged over 65, and to £4,350 for those aged over 75.  These rates will be doubled to £7,500 and £8,700 respectively for married couples.  This, of course affects old age pensioners particularly, and will be of considerable benefit to them.</P>
    <P>The social welfare improvements in this budget build on the achievements of last year by again focusing on families and particularly women working in the home.  Measures which are of benefit to women include: the increase of 5 per cent in child benefit payments; the special increases for the first time in the personal rates of widow's non-contributory pensions and the streamlining of the rates of contributory pensions; the special increases in the rates for adult dependants of the unemployed with the rate being streamlined at £31 per week; the special increases in the rates of deserted wife's allowance, unmarried mother's allowance, prisoner's wife's allowance; the further streamlining and improvement of child dependant rates to achieve a new minimum payment of £11 per week; and the further extension to 20 years of age of the payment of child dependant allowances to long term recipients whose children remain in full time education.</P>
    <P>I was surprised that Deputy Flaherty thought there was very little for women in this budget.  In fact there is a very strong emphasis on women and many facets of the budget were designed specifically to support women, and particularly those working in the home.</P>
    <P>Also included are: the further improvements to be announced in the family income supplement scheme; the introduction of a new clothing allowance, particularly welcomed by women in the home; the introduction of a carer's allowance which will mainly benefit women who care for elderly people at home, the reality being that most carers are women; a special allocation of £500,000 for local <Col N="445" /> programmes for women; and the exemption from PRSI liability for those on low pay which will especially benefit women in low-paid jobs.</P>
    <P>In addition to the PRSI exemption I intend to provide half rate disability benefit for up to 15 months, for windows and other lone parents &mdash; something they have been seeking in recent times.  Those in this group earning above the £60 per week exemption limit will be liable for PRSI on the same basis as other workers.</P>
    <P>I would now like to go through the various measures in some detail.</P>
    <P>The 5 per cent across-the-board increase at a time when inflation is expected to be around 3 per cent for the year mid-1990 to mid-1991, more than meets the commitment in the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  This will keep social welfare payments above increases in the cost of living.  This overall increase is being provided at a cost of £51.5 million in 1990 and almost £100 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>In line with the general increase, child benefit is also being increased by 5 per cent from October.  The monthly rates of payment from then will be £15.80 per child in respect of the first four children, and £22.90 per child for the fifth and subsequent children.  A 4-child family will receive an increase of £3 per month while a 6-child family will receive an additional £5.30 per month.  As a matter of interest, a five-child family will now receive £20 per week in child benefit.  Expenditure on this scheme will be over £211 million this year in respect of some 470,000 families and 1,140,000 children.  I believe that this scheme is one of the most important instruments available to me for providing direct payments to mothers.  It has the advantage that it goes to families of people whether at work or on social welfare. I am happy to be in a position to meet the request of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and others in this regard.</P>

      <P>In line with the commitment in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> significant special increases <Col N="446" /> have again been given to those on the lower payments.  In addition, on this occasion new groups of people will benefit from special increases.  As Deputies will be aware, the long-term unemployed for three years in sucession have received substantial increases but this time we are extending such increases beyond the long-term unemployed.  The long-term unemployed will receive an increase of £5 per week or nearly 11 per cent.  This is on top of increases of 11 per cent and 12 per cent in the last two years.  It means that over the last three years we have increased long-term unemployment assistance by over 37 per cent. This represents a real increase after inflation of 23 per cent.  By any objective yardstick it must be recognised that this represents a substantial improvement.  The range of special increases has been extended this year in a number of ways, as set out earlier.</P>
      <P>In this year's budget we have provided a special increase for people on disabled person's maintenance allowance.  The DPMA rate for a single person will be increased from £47.20 to £52, an increase of just over 10 per cent.  There will also be increases in the payments for dependants.  This is a significant development and ensures that people on DMPA &mdash; who are long-term disabled &mdash; will receive the same rate of payment as those on long-term unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>In line with the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare I am convinced that the best long-term approach is for the supplementary welfare allowance and the DMPA schemes to be administered directly by my Department.  While, in both cases there are major issues to be addressed I envisage at this stage a phased approach with responsibility for the DPMA being transferred to my Department as soon as the necessary administrative arrangements are put in place.  I am today giving the House an undertaking to set that in motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with the focus on families &mdash; and particularly women at home &mdash;I am especially pleased to announce that special increases have been given in the <Col N="447" /> rates payable for adult dependants for unemployment payments.  The rates are being streamlined and increased to a minimum of £31 per week.  This means an increase to £4.10 or 15.2 per cent for those on short-term unemployment assistance or supplementary welfare allowance and an increase of £2 or 6.9 per cent for those on disability benefit, unemployment benefit or long-term unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>The new rate of £31 per week from July next will mean that adult dependant rates will amount to between 60 per cent and 69 per cent of the personal rate of unemployment payments.  This meets and indeed exceeds the relationship recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Following on the improvements made in increasing and streamlining payments in respect of child dependants last year, I am glad to be able to say that this work is being continued.  The minimum child dependant rate is being increased from £10 to £11 per week, and the number of rates is being reduced from 12 to 6.  The range of payments is also being reduced and will now be between £11 and £15.  I have now reduced the number of separate rates of child dependant increases from 36 to 6.</P>
    <P>Also, as I indicated last year, the child dependant payment will be paid up to age 20 in respect of all long-term recipients as a further step towards age 21.  These payments are already paid up to age 21 in respect of widows and other lone parents.</P>
    <P>What do these increases mean?  The package of special rates increases coupled with the general 5 per cent increase, is a significant achievement in budgetary terms.  It also means a considerable increase for single persons and families. This is illustrated by the following examples: a couple with two children on long-term unemployment assistance will receive £105 per week, an increase of £8, while a couple with four children will receive an increase of £10 bringing their payment to £127 per week.  A couple with four children on short-term unemployment assistance or supplementary <Col N="448" /> welfare allowance will receive £120 per week, which is an increase of £11.10, while a couple with six children will get an increase of £13.10, and a total payment of £142; a lone parent under 66 with three children on an assistance payment will receive an additional £5.20, giving a total payment of £93.50; a widow or deserted wife on a contributory payment with four children will receive a payment of £116 which is an increase of £5.10; an old age pensioner couple each on a non-contributory pension will receive a total increase of £6, giving them a payment of £53 each; and a couple both over 66 &mdash; and under 80 &mdash; on a contributory old age pension will receive a payment of £107.20 which is an increase of £5.</P>
    <P>In approaching the social welfare improvements in this budget, I was very much aware of the submissions I received from Deputies and various organisations. Most of these referred to the increases recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  I trust that the House will agree that the increases now being provided represent substantial progress in this regard.  The 1990 equivalent of the priority rate recommended by the commission is £53.  This has now been achieved in the case of all old age and lone parents pensions and almost so &mdash; £52 &mdash; in the case of the long-term unemployment assistance and disabled person's maintenance allowances.  On any objective analysis I know it is not possible to satisfy everybody.  There will always be people who will say we should have given more.  They always say that even when we have given very substantial increases. These are substantial increases, we are making substantial progress and the benefits emanate principally from the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  I know only too well that family budgeting on low incomes is not easy, particularly where children are involved.  Expenses are high especially at certain times of the year and many families find it difficult to budget for these expenses.  In recognition of this last year I introduced improvements into the footwear scheme.  This year the Government have gone a step further by <Col N="449" /> providing a clothing allowance for families on social welfare payments for school and winter clothes.  We have allocated £3 million for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I will announce details of the scheme in the coming months.  Information leaflets setting out the payment levels will then be published so that clients will be aware of their entitlements before autumn. From my pre-budget discussions with the voluntary bodies and ICTU, I know that this will be a very welcome measure.</P>
    <P>Currently a prescribed relative allowance is paid in certain cases where a person is providing full-time care and attention to a pensioner.  This is a very important scheme though limited in scope.  I have been aware for some time of the need to improve the present arrangements.  Many Deputies and voluntary organisations working with elderly people have made this case to me. Recently I arranged for the prescribed relative allowance to be paid directly to the prescribed relative and Deputies welcomed that in last year's Bill.  In this budget we are providing for a major change in the scheme.</P>
    <P>From October this year a carer's allowance will replace the current arrangements. A payment of £45 per week will be made on a means tested basis, and the scope of the scheme will be extended. This improvement indicates that the Government recognise the role of carers, who are mainly women, and the debt the community owes to these dedicated people.  The precise details of the new scheme are currently being worked out and I will be making an announcement in due course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the scheme be widened also?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be widened. Obviously there will have to be controls and criteria but it will be a widened scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the changes in this and last year's budgets the carer's allowance will provide a payment, equivalent to the short-term unemployment assistance rate, to a carer in her/his own right.  I will be keeping the <Col N="450" /> whole scheme under review to establish how it can be further improved given the twin objectives of providing an adequate income maintenance payment to carers and enabling elderly people where possible to remain in their own homes rather than have to go into hospital or a home.</P>
    <P>The budget provides £1 million for increases in the family income supplement. The Government are not against providing more money.  It is a question of estimating what is likely to be taken up in this case.  We will see how it goes, but it will be improved further. In the last year I have made considerable efforts to improve the take-up of FIS including a special advertising campaign. In the weeks following the campaign, FIS applications were more than double their previous levels.  Cases in payment increased from 5,159 at the end of 1988 to over 6,000 at the end of 1989.  The advertising campaign was followed in November with a mailshot to families on low wages in the north-west of the country.  Further mailshots in other regions are planned, and it is proposed to use a number of different mailshots to test the impact on the response rate.  I will also be arranging for research into the reasons so many people who appear to be eligible for FIS are still not applying for the scheme.</P>
    <P>As announced in the budget the Government are taking steps to ensure that no person loses the medical card as a result of claiming the family income supplement.  This has been a major concern for many people and I expect that this measure will have a significant effect on the level of take-up under the scheme. I would like to thank those health boards who co-operated already before we had to take this step &mdash; as Deputies will be aware a number of health boards were not prepared to co-operate with us but all will have to co-operate now.</P>
    <P>The £1 million now being provided for family income supplement will allow for increases in the income ceilings and rates of payments.  The increases will be designed to give an additional incentive to persons who may not be taking up their entitlements under the scheme.  I <Col N="451" /> will announce details of the improvements at a later stage.</P>
    <P>In line with the approach adopted last year, I am continuing to improve the free electricity, TV licence and telephone rental schemes and remove anomalies which come to our notice.  The following improvements will be implemented this year: the free travel scheme will be altered so as to allow recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance who cannot travel alone to bring a companion when availing of the free travel concession.  This will help physically and mentally handicapped people to utilise the free travel concession more fully; elderly pensioners over 80 years of age will be allowed to retain their entitlement to free electricity allowance when people come to live with them; invalidity pensioners who transfer to retirement pension on reaching 65 years of age will no longer lose their entitlement to the free schemes.  The gap which existed there is now being covered; free scheme entitlements will be extended to all social security pensioners of States with whom Ireland has signed bilateral social security agreements.</P>
    <P>The Government have strongly supported the EC Poverty Programme as a means of developing local initiatives. Two large scale Irish projects based in Connemara and Limerick and a smaller project based in Dublin are included in the third EC Programme which is now commencing.  The Government are concerned that other very worth-while projects such as those in Tallaght, Blanchardstown, Coolock, the Inishowen Peninsula, Louisburgh, the Knocknaheeny and Mayfield areas of Cork, south Wexford and the south inner city of Dublin, should be supported. These projects provide a vital resource in their communities.  They initiate a wide range of activities, including local enterprise activities and projects with the elderly, young families, single parents and other groups in need of help and support. An amount of £0.6 million has been provided in the Estimates for grants to voluntary organisations and the <Col N="452" /> Government have decided to allocate £0.525 million of this to support the core activities of worthwhile projects of this kind and I will make the necessary arrangements to allocate these funds. This is in addition to the voluntary grants scheme for once-off projects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is any monitoring and research of these projects being done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Most of these arose through the Combat Poverty Agency and were left out of the EC Programme.  The balance of £50,000 is being provided as a once-off grant to the Simon Community for community enterprise projects involving the homeless.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to be able to introduce a special allocation of £500,000 for projects aimed specifically at women.  The establishment of community-based self-help groups has encouraged women to think about their personal development, to continue to improve their education and to develop their capacity for leadership and organisation. Overall, they enable women to contribute more fully to their own personal development and the development of their communities.  The Combat Poverty Agency have identified a considerable potential for development in this area.</P>
      <P>Of this special allocation, up to £150,000 is being made available to support the work of the Rape Crisis Centres around the country.  The balance of the allocation will be used as grants to local self-help groups working for women. Details of the grant arrangements are being worked out at present and I will be making an announcement shortly as to how the funds will be allocated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The disincentive to work faced by those on social welfare payments has been greatly exaggerated.  In fact, only a minority of individuals are better off on social welfare than at work.  A study of 1,000 unemployment benefit claimants recently undertaken by my Department examined the incentive to work for individuals, as measured by the replacement ratio &mdash; the ratio of net income while on social <Col N="453" /> welfare to net take home pay from working. That study established that only 7.9 per cent of the sample were better off unemployed than at work.  This comprised 3 per cent single people, who are entitled to the lowest level of social welfare payment only.  The reason for their high replacement ratio is obviously that net pay from working was low.  In contrast, a large proportion of the sample were considerably worse off on social welfare.  For almost 60 per cent of individuals, social welfare payments replaced less than 50 per cent of their income from working.  These figures represent the real life situation of workers and social welfare recipients and avoid the unrealistic assumption which is often made that all social welfare recipients are eligible for a medical card, reduced rent, pay-related benefit, and so on.</P>
    <P>In this budget, we have taken steps to ensure that further progress is made towards increasing the incentive to work for the minority of individuals for whom it is a problem and I have mentioned most of them already.</P>
    <P>In relation to the new PRSI exemption for employees, the Government are conscious of the position of individuals on low pay, who have their net take-home pay reduced by deduction of PRSI contributions. The payment of such contributions can be a heavy imposition on those below the poverty line.  Moreover, PRSI contributions penalise those who are willing to take up low paid employment rather than remain on social welfare.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided to tackle this problem by exempting low-paid workers from PRSI contributions. From April 1990, employees whose gross earnings are £60 per week or less will not be required to pay social insurance contributions.  Workers will benefit by up to £3.30 per week from this concession. I would like to emphasise that this will not affect the entitlement of these employees to social insurance benefits. It is estimated that as many as 50,000 individuals may benefit from this relief at a cost of £8 million in 1990.  I will be announcing details of the scheme later.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="454" /> I have pointed out that in the Department of Social Welfare we have taken major steps to improve the position of those who depend on us.  I also set out in the speech I circulated changes I am making in the means testing scheme which will be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The package I have outlined, including the improvements in the administration of my Department's services, will have a major impact on the people who depend on us.  The fruits of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the co-operation given by the social partners have made these improvements possible.  We begin the 1990s with an excellent and progressive social welfare package and a number of novel developments.  I know these measures which the Government have introduced will be widely welcomed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Time passes quickly and we have another budget with the usual budget speeches.  Yesterday we witnessed a marathon speech by the Minister for Finance who could be congratulated on his delivery of it.  The speech was greeted in the Chamber by almost total silence not alone from the Opposition but from his supporters and many people seemed relieved that nothing radical had happened.  Ministers have an opportunity to do things and this is the second time Deputy Reynolds has had an opportunity to do something radical for the people and the economy.  Once again the Minister has been inhibited by the problems in social welfare the details of which were given <i>ad nauseam</i> by the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>The real problem relates to unemployment and we have over 200,000 people unemployed.  In any financial arrangements there should have been an attempt to improve the conditions for creating employment.  As far as I can see the Minister has once again turned the budget into a great PR exercise and the bigger PR exercise relates to tax revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On examination the Principal Features of the budget will show that instead of tax revenue coming down in 1990 as indicated by news headlines, it will go up by <Col N="455" /> £360 million.  That is nothing new for the Fianna Fáil Party in Government.  Since they got to power they have given a little here and taken a little there.  Their economic policy has been totally defensive. They have isolated this country for long periods and now we are being asked to become a market economy.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have adopted a begging bowl approach in order to arrive at solutions for our economic difficulties. When their partners in Government, the Progressive Democrats, were on this side of the House they trumpeted to the other Government that current revenue and current tax was going up, that there was no change in the burden of taxation which was enormous.  Yet, last night they trooped through the lobby saying they had had a major achievement.  The bottom line for the taxpayer is a real reduction in the tax burden which means that the outturn for 1989 would be greater than the post-budget estimate for 1990. The ordinary taxpayer wants a real reduction in tax.  This Government has kicked to touch here and there and given a little here and there and we have ended up with the same national problems and the same constituency problems.</P>
    <P>Great expectations were raised of the European Presidency for this country. One would have thought the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach would lead on tax harmonisation.  Most people on the Government side of the House praised them for leadership and if they want to dissipate some of the gloom and doom, that is all right.  They were the authors of the rumour that we will never see the single market in 1992, that we will never get monetary union or tax harmonisation, that those propositions were only pie in the sky and that Fine Gael were spreading rumours which would never materialise. When meetings were taking place around the country debating the single market, it was played down, too.  They said none of these things would happen.  Although Fianna Fáil were not ready to lead this country into tax harmonisation or monetary union, they had an opportunity which they did not grasp.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="456" /> The Minister in his long speech yesterday just touched on tax harmonisation. He could have said what were the objectives of the Government, what we would like our partners to do and what kind of expenditure would be involved in arriving at a suitable solution to this problem of tax harmonisation. However, when challenged by our spokesperson on finance, Deputy Noonan, and by Deputy Dukes, neither the Taoiseach nor the Minister for Finance indicated what the cost would be.  It is still a mythical figure.  I know the officials in the Commission in Brussels are receiving indications of huge sums from the Department of Finance who are saying it might be this, and it might be that.  I am afraid the people in the west of Ireland will be left in 1992 with &ldquo;it might be this and it might be that&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This Dublin-orientated budget will leave us on the real periphery of Europe with very few jobs and few people left if no jobs materialise.  In the long run young people will look at their pay packets and ask themselves why they should work and pay this crippling tax when they can go abroad and have greater opportunity. They will ask themselves if they should not take the boat, as their forefathers and others before them have done.  The budget should have provided an incentive to keep young people at home and should have lead to an improvement in conditions for people in the west.</P>
    <P>As far as the western seaboard is concerned we will be left with improved tourism only.  A campaign was launched by the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, subtly backed by the Taoiseach's principal adviser, Mr. McCarthy, that flights should overfly Shannon and that we should have only one national airport. They &mdash; the people in Dublin &mdash; even want to take that away from us.  The media are the same.  We had one correspondent last Sunday talking about the irritation of having to stop in Shannon&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been the established policy of successive Governments that Shannon Airport is Ireland's sole transatlantic gateway and that all scheduled trans-atlantic air services must operate via Shannon in both directions.  Charter services are required to serve Shannon in one direction only, on either the inbound or outbound journey at the operator's discretion.  Accordingly, it is open to transatlantic charter operators to fly direct into Connaught Regional Airport <Col N="459" /> and return to the US via Shannon Airport.</P>

      <P>The final report of the Iarnród Éireann Board of Inquiry into the accident near Claremorris, County Mayo on 24 September 1989 has been examined by my Department to determine the need for any follow up action or remedial measures.  In the light of that examination, I have concluded that all relevant information relating to the circumstances of this accident is contained in the report and that no useful purpose would be served in carrying out any further inquiry or formal investigation.  It is not the practice to publish reports of this nature.</P>
      <P>The board of inquiry appointed by Iarnród Éireann in this particular case were given the additional mandate of examining the possibilities of eliminating, where possible, or reducing the hazards in the operation of accommodation level crossings.  In the course of this review, consideration will be given to what additional measures are necessary and existing procedures will be reviewed.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann have been discussing with the IFA and the ICMSA the safe use of accommodation crossings by farmers and all known users of such crossings have already been visited by railway personnel and instructed on the safe and proper use of the crossings.  In addition, a media campaign has been launched and advertisements have appeared in the farming press and at marts and there has been a series of spot radio advertisements.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that the 96 page report in his possession points out that section 68 of the Railway Clauses Consolidation Act, <Col N="461" /> 1845, governs responsibility for railway crossings and that this places the entire responsibility for fencing and gates on the railway company?  Is he satisfied that this is in the best interests of all concerned? Will he consider calling together a group comprising Iarnród Éireann, the IFA and the ICMSA to try to work out a more modern and satisfactory plan for safety? Will he also assure the House that plans are in train to ensure that persons crossing railway lines &mdash; particularly with heavy machinery or cattle &mdash; will now be required to notify the local stationmaster?</P>

      <P>All these options have been considered and we are still deciding which ones are practical.  We have received many suggestions about electric fencing; it is a complex area involving rights of way, ownership of property and old legal rights on certain parts of the line.  It is a complex legal area and I have been taking the advice of the Attorney General, particularly in regard to the interim report, on whether I should consider publishing it.  However, I am advised that this is an area in which individuals involved in the accident may take certain legal steps and that prosecutions may be considered.  In all the circumstances, it would be wise not to elaborate on the report at this stage.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 12 and 50 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by Córas Iompair Éireann that the report of the study group appointed jointly by Iarnród Éireann and <Col N="463" /> Northern Ireland Railways to determine the optimum investment policy for rail services between Dublin and Belfast in the medium to long-term is still under consideration by the board.  When the board have taken their decisions they will be communicating with me in the matter. The question of EC assistance in relation to the line will be considered in the light of developments.  The fact that the proposal was not included in the transport operational programme under the <i>National Development Plan, 1989-1993</i> does not rule out the possibility of EC aid in the matter.</P>
    <P>The impact of bomb attacks is a separate issue and unrelated to the consideration of proposals for development of the line.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Commissioner Bruce Millan and Junior Minister in the Northern Ireland Office with responsibility for transport, Mr. Bottomley, both confirmed on radio &mdash; I have the tape and I can let the Minister hear it if he wishes &mdash; that the Northern Ireland authorities did apply for EC grants and that the only reason the upgrading of the line is not going ahead is &ldquo;because the Republic's Government did not apply&rdquo;.  How were the Northern Ireland authorities able to use the report while the authorities on this side of the Border were not able to do so and that this application was not made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because there are different priorities.  Of the £95 million approximately available to the Republic in transport structural funding from the EC a maximum of £15 million will be available to me, by agreement with the Commission, for developing rail and bus services.  I have to consider whether the allocation of that £15 million should be part of this development or given to other worthwhile developments like, for example, the development of the Clondalkin line or other worthy lines, particularly in Dublin city.  It is not simply a matter of getting additional sums.  Our <Col N="464" /> direct involvement in upgrading the line referred to would directly affect &mdash; I must stress this &mdash; our ability to develop other lines like the Clondalkin line which is a direct competitor for those funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the longstanding statement by the Fine Gael Party that the Government bungled their EC application has now been established? Is it not true that the Government have become partitionists in their attitude that the Unionists in Northern Ireland are strongly advocating an upgrading of this line and our Government are not?  Is the reason for all this the fact that the Minister forgot, bungled or omitted to send the application?  This was not a planned decision.  Will the Minister tell the House when the application was lodged?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>When a fixed sum of money is available for developing rail lines it is my duty, with CIÉ, to try to order the priorities.  There are lines in direct competition with the line referred to, particularly the Clondalkin line, which, it is estimated, will cost £28 million.  Our involvement in the northern line as suggested would cost us about £40 million and that would take up all the money available from Brussels for developing rail lines.  This would mean that I would have to abandon the Clondalkin line.  I must give this serious consideration.</P>

      <P>The EC Commission has a Tourism Division which is responsible for the formulation of EC tourism proposals.  The division is part of DG XXIII and has its own budget line since 1986.  This has been used to finance promotion campaigns, studies, public opinion polls, surveys, pilot projects, a <Col N="466" /> hotel training exchange scheme and statistical work.</P>
      <P>The total moneys allocated for 1990 is 4 million ECU.  The Tourism Division has been given a special, additional allocation of 4.6 million ECU for this year in respect of European Year of Tourism activities.</P>

      <P>It is not policy to provide capital grants to CIE in respect of the acquisition of buses.  The board are required to finance such purchases from their own resources.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the CIE bus replacement programmes, Bus Átha Cliath and Bus Éireann submitted proposals to my Department in 1989 for the purchase of 63 double deck buses and 20 expressway coaches, respectively.  These proposals were approved within the framework of the non-voted capital allocation provided for CIE.

      <P>Will the Minister agree that if he can prevent fare increases by CIE he can also provide a subvention to <Col N="468" /> permit the company to replace their fleet of buses?  Is the Minister in a position to say what percentage of the buses are more than ten years old?  Will the Minister agree that the Government's subvention to CIE is equivalent to about 17 per cent of fare receipts and that it is well below subventions given to public transport services throughout Europe?</P>

      <P>I should like to tell the Deputy that 50 of the buses used in the current year are over age.  I expect that number to increase to 142 by 1992. There are about 800 vehicles in the fleet. The programme of replacing them will lead to a gradual fall-off in over age buses.  I do not have details of the age of the buses but those deemed to be over age by CIE fall into that category.  The Deputy will appreciate that the Government approve or disapprove proposals of the board of CIE to engage in capital expenditure.  Ultimately, we are talking about an undertaking by the State.  There is not a major difference as to how it is carried out because there is a State commitment involved.</P>

Will he agree also that in order to continue to increase passenger numbers they need a speedy replacement of the 142 vehicles that will be over age by 1992?  Will he accept that there is a need to inject further capital into the CIE network to replace those vehicles?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 17 and 63 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 20 September 1989, following a review which I had conducted of the recent performances of Aer Lingus and Ryanair, I announced a number of changes in the allocation of routes to the two airlines.  These changes included the grant of sole operating rights to Ryanair on the Dublin to Luton, Stansted, Liverpool and Munich routes and to Aer Lingus on the Dublin to Heathrow, Gatwick, Manchester and Paris routes. <Col N="473" /> Except in the case of the Dublin-Liver-pool route, the new arrangements came into effect from the end of October 1989. The change in the case of the Dublin-Liverpool route was not due to apply until the beginning of the summer season in March 1990 but Aer Lingus for their own good reasons, linked, I understand, to a shortage of aircraft on other routes, withdrew from the Liverpool route with effect from 15 January 1990.  In order to avoid any short term capacity problems on the route, Ryanair recently increased its services from one to two flights per day.</P>
    <P>The changes in route allocation were designed, <i>inter alia,</i> to place Irish airlines in the best possible position to take advantage of the liberalisation of air transport in the European Community in the run up to 1992 and to focus aviation policy on a strengthening of the Irish presence on services to and from Ireland, rather than having two Irish carriers actively pursuing the same traffic on identical routes.</P>
    <P>The measures are intended to apply only until the end of 1992.  They are being closely monitored in the interim to ensure that there are sufficient services to cope with growth in demand and, in particular, that there will be no diminution in tourism traffic.</P>
    <P>As regards the future development of Aer Lingus, I have reaffirmed to the board of Aer Lingus, and to the unions representing Aer Lingus employees, the full commitment of the Government to the expansion to the airline and development of their network of services abroad. In this context, I would mention the major effort the Government made to secure additional landing rights for Aer Lingus in the United States, which has resulted in the opening up of access to Los Angeles for Aer Lingus.  I should also point out that I have fully supported the Aer Lingus programme of acquiring shareholdings in charter airlines aimed at serving the large and growing charter market from northern Europe to sun destinations. I have also backed their expansion of ancillary activities, including a <Col N="474" /> major new hangar development at Dublin Airport.</P>
    <P>The routes on which Ryanair were given exclusive rights represent three out of 36 in the Aer Lingus network.  I am satisfied with the results to date of the new arrangements and I am also satisfied that they will have no adverse impact on the viability of Aer Lingus.  The changes are strictly limited in scope and duration and are designed to meet specific policy objectives which are in the national interest and which will, I am convinced, serve the long-term interests of both Aer Lingus and Ryanair.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment to Aer Lingus is of long standing and has been well justified by the contribution the company have been making to national development and wealth creation for over 50 years.  That commitment remains unchanged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>What discussions took place with the national carrier, Aer Lingus, and the trade unions involved in Aer Lingus before a decision was taken to hand over the three routes, which had been served exclusively by Aer Lingus? What was the outcome of those discussions, if any?  I understand from the Minister's reply that there was some correspondence between him and Aer Lingnus.  I would have imagined that some discussions would have taken place and some agreement would have been reached before a decision was taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not initiate any formal discussions with either airline.  I had a review undertaken as to the operation of the existing policy with Aer Lingus and Ryanair.  As a result of that review I decided to pull the airlines apart, as it were, in order to get some rational approach to serving the island.  I had discussions immediately before the announcement with the chairman and chief executive of Aer Lingus and subsequent to the announcement I met at length with a very full delegation from the workers of Aer Lingus representing most of the trade unions involved in the company.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that his decision has created a position where Ryanair will have no competition at all on the routes they serve, with the exception of Luton, and that the workers in Aer Lingus have been demoralised as a result of the Minister's decision?

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that there is ample competition on the routes in question. There are four airports in London and a person wishing to travel from Dublin can choose from up to six carriers operating between the two cities. In the case of the two Irish airlines a passenger can choose any one of these four airports.  That is the kind of competition that makes sense for the airlines in question.  I am satisfied that Aer Lingus are going from strength to strength with Government support and that this small adjustment to airline policy and strategy is something which Aer Lingus are well able to handle.  I have full confidence in them.</P>

At present they are working in co-operation because the sudden decision of Aer Lingus to withdraw from the route much earlier than I had asked them to do so.  I am satisfied that within a very short period they will be operating completely independent of each other and that there will be direct competition between both airlines. I welcome Manx Air on that route, or indeed any other airline that is not competing directly with Aer Lingus and Ryanair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept &mdash; probably he will not accept &mdash; that the decision in relation to Stansted effectively keeps Aer Lingus from expanding on the London route which is the most important route?  It affects the tourism potential in that area, while the growth of Aer Lingus in that area is also affected.  Would he not accept that this decision, without consultation, has caused much concern to the workforce who have given a lot of time to building up Aer Lingus?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been in touch with the workforce in Aer Lingus.  There are 1,000 extra people working in that organisation now compared with two years ago.  They are growing at a phenomenal rate.  There was the recent announcement of a £35 million hanger. A number of new routes have been announced including the Los Angeles route.  The company is going from strength to strength and this is a very small adjustment.  With respect, the Deputy's statement is exaggerated.  In regard to Stansted &mdash; and I will not delay the House by giving figures &mdash; I will give the bottom line on it.  The capacity on this route for next summer &mdash; according <Col N="477" /> to the airline flights lists and so on &mdash; will be double what it had been last summer. Therefore, the capacity even without Aer Lingus on that route &mdash; which is of tourist and business interest &mdash; is actually doubled and indeed this is roughly the pattern with all the other airports which both airlines serve.  In other words, the policy has resulted in an increased number of people travelling.  It has resulted in rational competition, in choice for the consumer, it has not interfered with Aer Lingus and, perhaps, it has given Ryanair an opportunity to remain in business.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that what happened was that Ryanair could not compete with Aer Lingus on the routes, that they threatened the Minister they would not make any further investments in Ryanair and that the only solution the Minister could come up with was to discriminate against Aer Lingus in favour of exclusive rights to Ryanair?  Miraculously, and almost overnight, they produced an investment programme.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should be aware that Ryanair also gave up one route, coming off the Paris route; so it worked both ways.  I should also like to refer the Deputy to the very successful regional airport programme.  I estimate that approximately 650,000 passengers will use the regional airports this year. That has something to do with both Aer Lingus and Ryanair and the contribution which both have to make to the airline policy of the country.  The Deputy will appreciate that taking a national view it is important that both airlines have room to breathe.</P>

May I ask the Minister if it is now the case that there may be other applications which are being discussed without reference to Aer Lingus?  Can Aer Lingus anticipate that other routes will be handed over without any further discussion?

The policy was designed to pull the airlines apart at the fringe &mdash; the three routes out of 36 &mdash; to enable them both to go their own way and provide alternative choices to the public. That policy is complete and is in place until 1992 so there is no question of any extension of that policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 33 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Proposals for fiscal harmonisation, including the possible imposition of a positive rate of VAT on passenger transport and the possible abolition of duty free sales within the Community, are <Col N="480" /> being examined by the EC Council of Finance Ministers.</P>
    <P>Under the Commission proposals, as now modified by the Council of Ministers, two rates of VAT are envisaged &mdash; a standard rate in the range of 14 per cent to 20 per cent for general application to goods and services and a reduced rate in the range of 4 per cent to 9 per cent for a limited number of items.  At present, international air passenger transport within the Community is zero-rated for VAT purposes, while domestic air passenger transport is exempt.  Under the Commission proposals, the reduced rate of VAT would apply to both domestic and international air passenger transport. Air freight transport, both domestic and international, would be charged at the proposed standard rate of 14 per cent to 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>While agreement has been reached by the Council of Finance Ministers in relation to the broad outline of VAT structures to apply post-1992, negotiations on the individual elements which would form part of the total package are still at a very preliminary stage.  It is apparent, however, that the abolition of duty free sales within the Community is unlikely to occur in the near future, given its relatively low priority in terms of the main issues involved in fiscal harmonisation.</P>
    <P>I am, however, very much aware of the concerns of the tourism and transport sectors about these issues.  I share these concerns and my Department have written to the EC Commission outlining the serious implications for air transport of any changes in relation to VAT and duty free sales.  It would however, be premature to speculate about the level of increase, if any, on air fares which may result from whatever decisions emerge in due course in relation to VAT and duty free sales.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister how he makes out that simply giving a figure as the increase in the cost of an air ticket as a result of the imposition of VAT at the lower rate would be speculation? I would have thought that would <Col N="481" /> be simply a matter of calculation of which the Minister's Department should be capable. How can they make a case against the proposal if they cannot say what it would cost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that there were various ways of doing this calculation.  I know what is the intent behind his question.  For example the Association of European Airlines have come up with one particular calculation; I could do my own.  It strikes me as a simple lad that if a VAT rate of 4 per cent is applied to a ticket the cost goes up by 4 per cent.  Economists would disagree with me and say that one also has to take into account a fall-off in business if VAT is increased and for that reason a few extra percentages must be added and extra administration must be taken into account it can be built up to any figure the Deputy wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister's responsibility is somewhat more than saying there are a range of calculations that one could make on different assumptions etc.  Would the Minister not agree that for the time being at least he is actually responsible for presenting Ireland's case in this matter and that if anybody in Ireland is to have a view, and a definite view &mdash; not a range of views &mdash; about what this would cost it should be the Minister.  That is why I asked him the question &mdash; not economists or business people.  Will the Minister answer the question?  Will he give figures based on the range between 4 per cent and 9 per cent?  What does he think would be the increase in the cost of a ticket as a result of, say, a 5 per cent VAT rate?  Furthermore, what does he think &mdash; and it is his opinion I am interested in&mdash;would be the likely cost of a ticket in the long-term if duty-free shopping is restricted?  I am not asking the Minister to give me a range of assumptions and refer me to economists. I am asking for his opinion.</P>

I have no doubt that Ecofin will take that into account.  I have made the position of my Department and my own position quite clear.  I am concerned about these proposals and I want them looked at extremely carefully.</P>
      <P>In regard to the calculations, I have given the Deputy my own view.  If the EC are saying it is between 4 per cent and 9 per cent, then I cannot calculate that until I know what exactly it is.  That is simple enough for me.  If it is 5 per cent, then it is 5 per cent.</P>

      <P>My Department are currently drawing up the parameters of a <Col N="484" /> development strategy for both regional and local airports to ensure planned and ordered development for the future.  This strategy will cover the optional and financial criteria to be applied in relation to these developments.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may wish to know, however, that a development plan for regional airports involving a total expenditure of £5 million has recently been completed by my Department.  This plan has upgraded the regional airport network to fully operational levels capable of handling international services and has also established the regional airports as an essential element in the development of tourism in the regions.  I intend to actively encourage the further development of the regional airport network over the next few years with the assistance of funding from the EC Structural Funds.  It is expected that up to 650,000 passengers will use the regional airports in 1990 with a projected 60,000 passengers at Waterford.</P>
      <P>The development plan included provision of £1.35 million for the development of Waterford Airport.  In this context I am satisfied that the south east is now adequately served by Waterford Airport and that the development of another regional airport in the County Wexford locality would not be justified.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 13 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>I accept the need to upgrade the air traffic control facilities at the three State airports.  The Air Navigation Services Office of my Department is currently engaged on a major equipment renewal programme at a cost of £30 million at all three State airports on new radar, communications and navigational aids.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin Airport has instrument landing systems on three runways.  At present all systems operate to Category 1 level &mdash; the basic level.  From autumn this year, the ILS on the new runway will operate <Col N="486" /> to a level which will allow aircraft to land in adverse or minimal weather conditions.</P>
    <P>Cork Airport has two instrument landing systems &mdash; one at each end of the main runway.  Both systems at present operate to Category 1 level.  One of the systems is being evaluated at present to allow aircraft to land when the cloud ceiling is down to 100 feet.</P>
    <P>There is one instrument landing system at Shannon which can operate to basic Category 1 standard.  The need for additional instrument landing systems at Shannon Airport is kept under continuous review by my Department.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased with the progress being made to modernise the navigational, communications and radar systems at the State airports.  The reequipment programme will be completed by 1992 and within budget.  I am satisfied that the new air traffic control facilities, coupled with additional staff, will substantially expand the capacity of the Irish air traffic control system and further enhance aircraft operations within Irish airspace.</P>

I can tell the Deputy, however, that the installation of this equipment will significantly reduce the number of diversions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 41 and 48 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 26 January 1990 Pan AM confirmed <Col N="488" /> its decision to suspend its scheduled passenger service between New York and Shannon with effect from 17 February 1990 because of disappointing economic results on the route and the need to generate profits.</P>
    <P>The suspension of the service is a matter of regret and disappointment to me and I have communicated this to the President and Chief Executive Officer of Pan AM.  I have asked the company to reconsider its decision in the matter, particularly in the light of the Government's targets for the doubling of tourist numbers over a five year period and the considerable investment being made in promoting Ireland as a major tourist destination for US visitors.</P>
    <P>As a result of the Pan AM decision, Aer Lingus is planning to provide additional capacity on the New York-Shannon route this summer.  Aer Lingus already have plans to expand their services on transatlantic routes for summer 1990 by leasing-in additional aircraft and incorporating extra seats on their Boeing 747 aircraft.  In addition to the New YorkShannon route, the company's plans involve an increase in frequency on the Chicago route to twice weekly and Boston will be served by a Boeing 747 aircraft on a daily basis.  Delta Airlines are also planning an expansion of their Atlanta-Shannon-Dublin service.  The tour operators who organise charter services from New York are also planning to mount additional services this summer arising from Pan AM's departure.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte and SFADCo will be making presentations shortly to a number of US airlines in an effort to attract them to serve Shannon.  Senior executives of Aer Rianta are meeting with Pan AM this week to discuss their decision to withdraw from Ireland.</P>
    <P>All of these developments should assist in minimising any impact which the withdrawal of the Pan AM services may have on the tourism industry and on Shannon Airport.  Outside of the peak summer months, there is more than adequate capacity on Aer Lingus services to meet demand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously the withdrawal of the Pan AM service is outside the Government's control but is the Minister not convinced that this will jeopardise the Government's target for bringing tourists into this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe it will because we are making arrangements for Aer Lingus and Delta to pick up the slack.  On a point of information, Pan AM had about 9 per cent of the numbers travelling on the route and I am confident that the other two airlines on the general route can take up that slack.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision taken by Pan AM to cease operations at Shannon Airport will have serious consequences for the Government's projected figure of 100,000 extra tourists from North America this year.  Even if Aer Lingus and Delta Airlines take up the slack of 45,000 seats which is the number of passengers brought into Ireland by Pan AM last year, they do not have the office outlets available to them a large American airline such as Pan AM have.  If the Government do not manage to get another large American airline to fly into Shannon this year there is no way <Col N="490" /> the Government's projected figures of 100,000 extra tourists in 1990 will be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's analysis of the situation is correct.  Obviously he has some very good knowledge of it as that is the rough break-down of the Pan AM catchment.  As I said, I have arranged for Bord Fáilte to meet with TWA and American Airlines this week, Aer Rianta are meeting Pan AM today and SFADCo are having discussions with United Airlines in the coming weeks. These discussions will be of an exploratory nature but I am confident that by moving forward in our efforts to get other airlines to fly into Ireland and arranging with Aer Lingus and Delta to take up the existing 9 per cent slack there will be no adverse effect on our tourist industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with that question in my reply.  Aer Lingus have assured me that they can take up that slack by leasing an aircraft and by a fresh configuration of seats on some of the larger aircraft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that this problem is not one of our making.  The loss of the Pan AM network of contracts both within the travel and tourist businesses means we will suffer if we cannot get a programme together very quickly with Bord Fáilte so that they can get out there into the marketplace and arrange for another airline to transport those tourists who would have been brought into Ireland by the Pan AM network.  Does the Minister not agree that it is not just a question of Aer Lingus and Delta having the aircraft on the tarmac in Chicago and New York &mdash; the passengers will not necessarily be waiting to get into our airplanes &mdash; and that Bord Fáilte and other ancillary groups in the marketplace <Col N="491" /> will have to bring the tourists to the airports in Chicago and New York.  That is the missing link.  The Minister has not given us a broad enough outline of what exactly Bord Fáilte and his Department intend to do to guarantee that those tourists will ultimately arrive in Ireland and holiday here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be very happy at another time to give the Deputy a full breakdown on Bord Fáilte's marketing plans in Chicago, Boston and New York. I can assure the Deputy that Bord Fáilte's marketing plans are very intense and that they have short to long-term strategies to increase our business from those and other catchment areas.  I can go into this in more detail at another time.  The question did not relate specifically to Bord Fáilte's plans but from what I know about them I believe they are extremely professional. The Deputy rightly drew a link between access transport and getting the business and I believe Bord Fáilte are on top of this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerryReynolds" hpid="Mr. G. Reynolds Mr. G. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with what Deputy Byrne said but I do not believe Bord Fáilte have the network available to them that a large American airline such as Pan AM have.  Geographically speaking, it will be nearly impossible for Aer Lingus and Delta airlines to cover small towns in America.  Pan AM who are basically the same as Aer Lingus in Ireland, have offices which promote Ireland in all the small towns in the United States.  If, before they withdrew their services, someone came into one of those offices to buy a ticket to Europe he would have been informed that they flew into Shannon.  If we cannot get United Airlines, TWA or American Airlines to take up Pan AM's place this year it will be very difficult to achieve the Government's projected figure of 100,000 extra tourists.</P>

It is very much at the top of my agenda on the transport side of my brief to get more airlines to fly into Ireland.  I am following a definite strategy to try to do this by starting these talks.  I have invited the United States Secretary of Transportation, Mr. Skinner, to visit us in order to consider an agreement on the Los Angeles route and I propose to discuss this matter with him also.</P>

I share the Deputy's concerns about areas on the west side of the city, such as Clondalkin and Tallaght.  As he is aware, CIE have put forward proposals to develop the Clondalkin line.  They have already announced the opening of four new stations at Confey, Leixlip; Coolmine; Granard Bridge, Castleknock and Broombridge in Cabra.  A number of other proposals have been made by both CIE and other interests.  These proposals cover light rail services throughout the city to dedicated busways in particular areas.

      <P>Given that traffic has almost ground to a standstill in the city &mdash; the congestion is absolutely incredible &mdash; would the Minister not accept in hindsight that the decision taken in 1987 was the wrong one to take and that the only solution to our traffic congestion problems is an extension of the DART? Would he further explain why it is that hundreds of thousands of pounds seem to be available for road building in the city, much of which is taking place against the wishes of communities and the councillors representing the city, and the Government insist on bulldozing their way through Dublin city building massive highways while at the same time claiming that they do not have funding to provide a proper public transportation system?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The investment required to extend the DART would be extremely substantial.  As the Deputy is aware, the finances of DART are not very glamorous in the sense that the capital is not recouped, but there are other options which we are looking at very carefully, in particular the light rail option. There might be something in this but work is at a very early stage.  The Deputy is right to draw attention to the need to integrate our roads and transport policies. I have made a special effort to work on a daily basis extremely closely with the Department of the Environment to make sure that the public transport system is not developed in a different direction, as it were, from the road infrastructure which must also be developed. <Col N="496" /> However, we must develop both in conjunction with each other.  I intend to make sure that both Departments work very closely together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the light rail option in which I have an interest, can the Minister say if it is envisaged that it will be developed throughout the city competing with or doing away with the need for a bus service on our road network? Secondly can the Minister give us any idea of the potential of a light rail system and is he considering this as a very serious project?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, I have a number of proposals some of which are very glamorous and extensive.  I suppose every Minister for Transport has had these on his desk ranging from the extremely glamourous ones to the more practical, covering the routes which need to be handled.  I propose to come to grips as quickly as I can with the more practical proposals covering light rail services but I have yet to assess whether it will be possible for me to pursue the light rail option.  On the question of whether light rail services would interfere with the bus service, this is the kind of complex issue which all of us have to face.  If we progress on one front at the expense of another employment considerations have to be <Col N="497" /> faced and I ask the Deputy to keep this in mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is part of my general policy on the liberalisation of air transport to seek the widest range of opportunities for Irish airlines to provide new air services to those countries with which we are developing our trade, commercial and tourism links.</P>
      <P>Additional routes within the European Community became available to Irish airlines as a result of the first phase of EC air transport liberalisation measures which were adopted by the Council of Ministers in December 1987.  In addition, in March 1988 my predecessor signed a new bilateral memorandum of understanding with his UK colleague which, in terms of liberalisation, went even further than the first phase of EC liberalisation.</P>
      <P>Both these measures opened up considerable opportunities for Irish airlines to develop new routes and in recent years, Aer Lingus have initiated new services from Dublin to Newcastle and Dublin to Hamburg.  In addition, they have taken advantage of fifth freedom rights now available to operate through Manchester to Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Hamburg and Zurich.  Ryanair for their part have been instrumental in developing new direct routes from the regional airports, Connaught, Galway and Kerry, to a number of UK points including Luton, Coventry, Leeds / Bradford and Manchester. Ryanair have also introduced services from Dublin to Stansted, Liverpool, Coventry and Munich, as well as from Cork to Luton and Shannon to Luton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Negotiations on the second phase of EC air transport liberalisation are due to <Col N="498" /> be concluded by 30 June 1990 under the Irish Presidency.  The successful conclusion of the second phase package is a major priority for me during the Presidency. I expect the new package to provide, <i>inter alia,</i> for more liberal arrangements in the areas of market access and capacity sharing, which will increase further the commercial opportunities for Irish airlines to expand the range of their services.</P>
    <P>Decisions in relation to the authorisation of Irish airlines on specific routes are taken on the basis of applications made by the airlines concerned and all such applications are dealt with on their merits in the light of existing air transport policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that after the various stages of deregulation take place there will be great pressure on prestigious routes that Aer Lingus and now Ryanair hold in the present climate and that it will be necessary for the Irish airlines to be able to look at other routes that have been denied to them in the past, particularly to various centres in Europe, because the present regulations will not exist after deregulation? Undoubtedly there will be pressure on air routes like the London run from air companies who have not been able to compete on them because of the existing rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of complex issues interacting there.  Most of the major routes in Europe are already available under the provisions of existing EC law or bilateral air transport agreements with our EC partners.  We have a number of bilateral arrangements with our EC partners.  The difficulty is the old one.  It is not so much negotiating access to a particular city &mdash; by and large that is often the easier part of it &mdash; but the difficulty is to get an airline to take on the route.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Deputy's question there is another aspect, the question of slots, which is the difficulty in London.  It can be difficult to get slots in airports, particularly in Heathrow at the moment.  That <Col N="499" /> is a daily battle and it is hoped that the second air liberalisation package will ease the situation a little.  It is difficult because of overcrowded airports and over-crowded skies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first budget of the Coalition Government, I venture to say the first of many.  It gives effect to many of the provisions of the Programme for Government agreed between the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil last June.  It provides a clear answer to those who said Coalition Governments do not work.  This budget shows that not alone can Coalition Governments work but, dare I say it, they can even be progressive. In the past certain Coalition Governments clearly failed to achieve their potential.  However, if proof is needed that Coalition Governments can be effective, this budget provides it.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Government announced last June included a number of key provisions relevant in the context of the 1990 budget.  I will mention some of them.  First, we established job creation as the major priority of the Government.  We promised to increase the level of job creation through tax reform to encourage employment, attacking anti-competitive and restrictive practices at all levels in the economy, and action to keep inflation and interest rates at the lowest possible level.  We are delivering on these promises and the budget clearly demonstrates that.</P>
      <P>Specifically in the area of public finances and tax reform we promised to reduce the Exchequer borrowing requirement to 3 per cent at most and the debt-GNP ratio to at most 120 per cent by 1993 and to accelerate the process of public finance improvement as economic and budgetary circumstances allow.  We promised to reduce the standard rate of income tax to 25 per cent by 1993 and to move towards a single higher rate of tax, to broaden the tax base and increase the tax yield from the corporate sector, to bring in improvements in tax exemption limits for lower paid workers and their families and to make progress on achieving tax harmonisation in the context of developments within the EC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In social welfare we promised special increases for the long-term unemployed over and above the level of inflation, <Col N="535" /> special increases for families with dependent children and improved payments for those caring for elderly and handicapped relatives in their own homes.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Government gives a major impetus to putting into place new measures, organisational reform and resources which would protect the environment in both urban and rural areas.</P>
    <P>The orientation and the content of the 1990 budget has been shaped and determined by the commitments entered into by the two parties in Government in the agreed Programme for Government. Economic growth and employment creation have been restored to the centre of Government policies and actions after a period during which control over the public finances was the overriding and necessary focus of Government policies. Good financial and economic management by the Government are essential pre-conditions to maintaining the impetus for new job creation.  It would be very easy, following the progress made in recent years and in 1989 in particular, to succumb to the old temptation of forcing the pace of economic growth in the short-term beyond what can be sustained in the medium to longer term.  We have learned a bitter lesson in the not too distant past that this is a &ldquo;rakes's progress&rdquo;&mdash; the road to economic stagnation and social deprivation.  It is an approach that we have avoided in the 1990 budget &mdash; an approach that a Coalition Government, of which the Progressive Democrats form a part, are very unlikely to follow in future years.</P>
    <P>During 1989 we have seen our policies of creating a better environment for enterprise and investment and job creation achieve major progress.  Despite the increase in interest rates in Ireland during the year, they remain several percentage points below the UK level.  Wage cost competitiveness improved by 3 per cent on average against our main trading partners under the influence of the wage moderation achieved under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> International factors pushed inflation upwards during 1989 but the prudent management <Col N="536" /> of the domestic economy ensured that it remained well below that of the UK and average EC levels.  The public finances were kept well under control so that the Exchequer borrowing requirement fell to less than 2.5 per cent of GNP &mdash; well below the 5.3 per cent target set in last year's budget.</P>
    <P>All these factors ensured that output and employment increased strongly in 1989.  Redundancies were at their lowest level since 1979 and overall the number of people employed throughout the country grew by an estimated 13,000 to 14,000 in 1989.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the budget will provide a further impetus to job creation in 1990 in line with the agreed Programme for Government.  The changes in indirect taxation combined with a projected outturn in energy prices and interest rates more favourable than last year should bring inflation down towards 3 per cent on average in 1990 compared with an average rate of 4 per cent in 1989.  The current budget deficit and the Exchequer borrowing requirement will be further reduced so that the commitments agreed to in the Programme for Government are being fully honoured or exceeded.  On the basis of present progress it should be possible to bring the debt &mdash; GNP ratio down to 100 per cent by 1993 &mdash; one-third lower than where it was a year ago. These provisions, together with the changes in taxation to be implemented, will maintain a favourable environment for investment and job-creation during 1990 so that we should see further improvements this year with a projected net increase of some 16,000 people in the total at work.</P>
    <P>The 1990 budget takes a decisive step in the whole area of tax reform.  The reduction in the lower rate of income tax from 32 per cent to 30 per cent and in the highest rate from 56 per cent to 53 per cent means that we are well on the way to meeting our commitment of having a standard rate of income tax of 25 per cent by 1993 together with one single higher rate.  We are beginning to remove the disincentive to work and enterprise which our income tax system has spawned over <Col N="537" /> the past 20 years.  The process of income tax reform on which we have embarked is now irreversible, assuming reasonably favourable international economic conditions over the next two to three years. The reform process will also help to contain the brain-drain from Ireland of some of our brightest and most talented people.  These are people who have gained high educational qualifications and expertise with the aid of subsidies from other taxpayers but who have been discouraged from putting these talents to work for the benefit of our people and our economy by the penal rates of personal taxation that were levied up to now.  We have made a good start on this front in the 1990 budget.  Further progress will be made in the 1991 and subsequent budgets in line with the commitments we made in the Programme for Government.</P>
    <P>While the personal taxation burden in Ireland became penal over the past ten years &mdash; in particular under the strain of a level of public expenditure far beyond the capacity of taxpayers to sustain &mdash; the corporate tax yield in contrast remained low by international standards.  The tax yield from the corporate sector will increase in the coming years as a result of the reductions in accelerated capital allowances, and the restrictions placed on section 84 financing in recent years, the ending of export sales relief from 5 April next and tax receipts expected from firms located in the Financial Services Centre.</P>
    <P>The 1990 budget introduces further reform in this area.  Accelerated capital allowances will be phased out by April 1992 apart from those that apply in the case of the Financial Services Centre, in the Shannon Customs Free Airport and the special building incentives for areas designated for urban renewal.  These measures will contribute to a much needed widening of the tax base and help to remove the bias in our incentive system towards the support of capital rather than employment creating developments.</P>
    <P>Domestic sourced section 84 loans provide relatively cheap finance for companies in the traded goods and services sector &mdash; but at a considerable cost to <Col N="538" /> the Exchequer &mdash; a cost that has been increasing significantly in recent years. As an incentive the loan subsidies derived from the Exchequer are not particularly well focused and are a fairly blunt and non-selective form of support for industrial projects.  The increasing burden of these loans on the Exchequer and the tendency for their abuse as tax avoidance schemes in recent years cannot be sustained in current circumstances.</P>
    <P>The restrictions introduced in the budget to reduce the volume of such loans and their cost to the Exchequer is justifiable and will contribute to achieving a higher yield in taxation from the corporate sector.  The approach set out in the budget is along the lines that I and my party have advocated for some years. The budget also gives effect to the commitments made in the Joint Programme for Government to take steps to move towards indirect tax harmonisation in the context of 1992.  The reduction in the standard rate of VAT from 25 per cent to 23 per cent will reduce the price of a wide range of consumer goods at an estimated cost of some £125 million to the Exchequer in a full year.  Perhaps the public may under estimate the range of goods to which these reductions will apply and the significance of them, which is borne out first by the cost to the Exchequer and second by the fact that this proposal alone will have the effect of reducing the consumer price index by 0.7 per cent.  We will monitor the situation closely to ensure that the benefits of this reduction are passed on to the consumer in lower prices so that the reductions benefit the consumer and are fully reflected in the recorded rate of inflation. The reduction in excise duties announced in the budget will also bring many of these rates more into line with the situation in other EC countries and contribute further to the control of price inflation and reduce distortions in trade that are particularly noticeable in towns along the Border.</P>
    <P>One of our principal concerns in the agreed Programme for Government was to provide tax exemption limits for the lower paid workers which would increase <Col N="539" /> their take-home pay, maintain the incentive to work and contribute towards improvement in their living standards. These concerns and objectives are reflected in the 1990 budget provisions. The income tax exemption limits and allowances for children are being increased significantly so that some 31,000 taxpayers with 58,000 children will be exempt from paying PRSI.  It is estimated that this provision will benefit over 50,000 employees.  It represents a first important and practical recognition by the Government of the taxation nature of employee PRSI payments and lays the foundation for further progress in this area next year and in future years as economic circumstances permit.  These provisions to help the lower paid will also be complemented by making available an extra £1 million to finance further improvements in the family income supplement scheme in line with what is set out in the agreed Programme for Government.</P>
    <P>The creation of more jobs is the single most important contribution that can be made to tackling the problems of poverty and underprivilege that are all too apparent in our society.  As I have indicated, policies and action that will support this fundamental requirement have been brought back to the centre of the Government agenda.</P>
    <P>There is no magic formula by which we can create overnight the level of new jobs required to meet the demand of the labour force.  What we can do is to maintain and accelerate the progress of recent years to bring more and more people off the unemployment rolls and into work. Inevitably unemployment will remain a problem for the foreseeable future.  We fully recognise the facts of life in this area.</P>
    <P>In the 1990 budget we have delivered on our commitment to provide increases for the long-term unemployed over and above the level of inflation.  Weekly welfare payments and health allowances will be increased by at least 5 per cent and, in the case of many welfare recipients, <Col N="540" /> the increases will be significantly greater. In the case of the long-term unemployed for example, an increase of almost 11 per cent will be provided and a 10 per cent increase for dependent children.  Many of these increases are approximately three times higher than the expected rate of inflation and will make a modest but significant contribution in alleviating the hardship suffered by the less well-off in our society.  The budget also provides special increases in other areas including allowances for pensioners, lone parents, children's school and winter clothing, particularly those caring full-time for sick and elderly relatives.  We will continue in future budgets to take similar action to alleviate the worst features of poverty for the less-advantaged in our society.</P>
    <P>In agreeing the Programme for Government my party and I were concerned to make the protection and improvement of the environment central to Government policy.  This has been done.  A major action plan to give effect to these concerns was announced last week by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, and the Minister of State with special responsibility in this area, Deputy Harney.  The additional commitments of over £20 million now made in the budget towards this plan for the remainder of this year demonstrates clearly that what is involved in not simply rhetoric but a major new initiative to create a green, clean Ireland.  We will follow through with our commitments in this area in 1990 and in each subsequent year.</P>
    <P>During 1990 also I will be undertaking a number of further initiatives related to the content of the budget.</P>
    <P>Under the Programme for Government we made commitments to reduce anti-competitive and restrictive practices at all levels in the economy in order to create the conditions in which real jobs can be created and sustained in an outword-looking, internationally competitive economy.  We said we would introduce legislation to give effect in domestic law to provisions similar to Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>My Department is at an advanced stage <Col N="541" /> in preparing the necessary legislation. The prohibition of anti-competitive agreements and practices and abuses of dominant positions will create conditions that allow all businesses to grow and develop.  The existence of such practices in the past has created a sheltered sector of the economy which has been to the detriment of efficiency and the consumer. On the other hand, the beneficiaries have been few.</P>
    <P>The internationally traded sector of our economy is vibrant because it already faces the conditions which will be brought about for all by the new legislation.  This legislation will ensure that all sectors of the economy are faced with the real discipline of open competition.</P>
    <P>The regulations under which life assurance companies operate provide for the localisation of assets within the State.</P>
    <P>The requirement is imposed with a view to protecting the interests of policyholders by ensuring that assets are readily available at all times to meet liabilities to policyholders.  At present, life assurance companies are required to have 80 per cent of assets, representing their basic insurance liabilities, localised here.  In the case of branches of non-EC companies a 100 per cent requirement is imposed. These restrictions do not apply to free assets, that is those which are in excess of liabilities.</P>
    <P>Following representations from the industry and having considered the matters fully I have decided to reduce the 80 per cent requirement to 60 per cent subject to the 80 per cent requirement remaining in respect of non-linked technical reserves.  The latter condition is attached for prudential purposes bearing in mind the guarantees generally associated with non-linked business.  This relaxation will afford life companies greater latitude in developing their strategies for the investment of linked funds.  I will be introducing an amending regulation to give effect to my decision at an early date.</P>
    <P>My decision in this matter was taken having regard to the general relaxation of exchange control regulations in recent times.  I am also very conscious of the need to maintain the competitive position <Col N="542" /> of life companies <i>vis-à-vis</i> other investment vehicles such as UCITS which are not subject to localisation requirements. With the increase in competition within the financial services sector and the advent of 1992 &mdash; with its implications for the freer movement of capital &mdash; it is essential that life companies, which contribute significantly to the economy in terms of employment and investment, remain in a position to compete effectively.</P>
    <P>In recent years companies operating in the traded goods and services sectors have become increasingly professional and sophisticated in their use of financial instruments.  The range of expertise and instruments available in areas such as debt financing, treasury management and foreign exchange activity has increased significantly.  These developments have enabled companies to manage their financial assets and requirements more efficiently.</P>
    <P>This trend is likely to continue.  The internal impetus will come from the need for firms to become increasingly efficient and innovative in the management of all functional activities likely to affect their competitiveness on the market-place, including the financial function.  The external impetus comes from developments such as the removal of exchange controls, the moves towards the creation of an integrated financial market in Europe and the increasing sophistication of the financial activities undertaken in Ireland including those undertaken in the Financial Services Centre.</P>
    <P>The reductions in Government borrowings achieved in recent years &mdash; and on which we are set to make further progress this year &mdash; has been, and continues to be, essential to maintaining the confidence of investors in the Irish economy. The policies in relation to the prudent management of the public finances that my party has advocated since its foundation have been put into place and are now widely accepted as successful.</P>
    <P>One result of this is to be seen in the bond market where the supply of bonds available has fallen sharply as Government borrowing requirements fell.  At the <Col N="543" /> same time overseas investors have shown an increased interest in the purchase of these gilts.  Gilt purchasing activity by overseas investors last year was particularly strong and constitutes a further vote of confidence by these investors in the management of the Irish ecomony.</P>
    <P>These developments, however, together with an increasing tendency to seek portfolio diversification in overseas markets, have resulted in a sharp reduction in the relative holdings of Government bonds by the Irish institutional investors.</P>
    <P>Taking these developments together with the need to allow private sector firms the greatest possible range of market instruments in meeting their financial requirements, provided that market distortions are avoided, points to the need to examine how the development of a corporate bond market might be encouraged here in Ireland.  Corporate bonds form an important element of the capital markets in most developed countries. Such a market could be of considerable interest to State agencies and the larger private sector companies in Ireland.  It could contribute to the achievement of a more competitive market in providing for the debt-financing needs of companies. The Government have decided that the possibilities which exist in this area should be evaluated with the objective of taking definitive decisions in the coming months.</P>
    <P>The 1990 budget provides the first significant financial foundations for the programme agreed last June between the two parties in Government.  That programme derives stength and stability from the fact that it incorporates the best thinking of both parties in Government towards the solution of the economic and social problems in this country &mdash; problems that are daunting by any standards.</P>
    <P>As a Government we are not complacent about what has been achieved. All I will claim is that a good start has been made to the 1990s in this budget in major areas such as tax and PRSI reform, providing the conditions which will facilitate increased employment creation, in <Col N="544" /> improving the position of social welfare recipients and in maintaining essential discipline in relation to the public finances.</P>
    <P>The decisions set out in the budget have benefited from the different viewpoints expressed on all sides and by all Ministers in Government.  The fiscal, monetary and policy measures outlined are stronger and more stable because of the positive and constructive debate to which they were subjected in Government. This is the correct and necessary model for Government in Ireland in the 1990s &mdash; a model which is shared with most of our European partners but which for too long has remained buried in the rhetorical dust that characterised Irish politics in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all in the context of the budget I congratulate Deputy Des O'Malley, Minister for Industry and Commerce, on his recent announcement of industrial benefits in the south-east region and in south Tipperary in particular. In spite of efforts by other Members in the constituency to upstage him, his announcements were very welcome in Tipperary town and particularly where I live, the village of Ardfinnan and in the town of Clonmel.  My only regret is that the package announced by the Minister did not include some measure for the town of Carrick-on-Suir which has been devastated by unemployment and emigration and the consequences of long-term social welfare.  I invite the Minister to visit Carrick-on-Suir and to address the problems in that town.  However, I feel it is appropriate, as the Labour Party constituency representative from south Tipperary, to thank him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before dealing with the specific aspects of the budget I would like to place on the record of the House the overall reaction of the Labour Party to it.  We have discussed the matter at length in the parliamentary party since the budget was announced by the Minister for Finance. Many of the individual items in the budget are welcome but in overall terms it is a budget that tinkers with many of <Col N="545" /> the social problems rather than addressing them in a fundamental way.  No serious attempt has been made in the budget to address the unemployment problem and the emigration that stems from it.  Not nearly enough has been done to address the growing crisis in health. That matter will be dealt with next week when the Labour Party will be proposing a motion of no confidence in the Minister for Health, and it is appropriate that the House has an opportunity of doing that.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the recognition of a major need for residential places for people with mental handicap, the money allocated will do no more than begin to reserve the cutbacks implemented by the Government.  Let it be remembered that the Government cut capital spending on mental handicap by almost 90 per cent in the last three years.  It is not fair to expect the handicap services to depend on schemes such as FÁS to address the crisis in staffing of these centres such as An Scoil Aonghus and An Scoil Cormac in Cashel.  The crisis in our health services generally has been totally ignored in this budget and there is still need for this House to adequately discuss this matter. There is nothing in the budget to shorten the waiting lists, to reopen the acute beds that are urgently needed or to employ additional doctors or nurses.  In short, nothing has been done which would restore confidence in the Minister for Health of this Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>The budget will lead to more benefits for the higher paid taxpayers.  The combination of measures outlined today and yesterday will ensure a disproportionate benefit to all those in the higher income brackets.  Many of the measures applicable to the lower paid will have effects that are more cosmetic than real.  For instance, the PRSI exemption package is clearly designed to benefit casual workers only and even then they will not secure that benefit every week.  In spite of all the aspirations of commentators and other people who made submissions, there is no incentive to employers even to employ workers on low pay, as a result of exempting that level of employee from PRSI. The base rate of £60 which has been set <Col N="546" /> is so low that it is almost equal to social welfare.  It is equal to some of the FÁS and social employment schemes.  If we could get people into insurable employment they could then benefit from the family income supplement scheme but nothing was done to bring that about.</P>
    <P>Child benefit was increased yesterday for the first time in four years but it continues to lag well behind inflation.  In general the provisions in this budget, for children in particular, show that the Government have not studied the evidence that was made available to them by the Conference of Major Religious Superiors, the Combat Poverty Agency and other agencies who are charged with the responsibility of making submissions not alone to the policital groupings in this House but to Government.  They have said that 40 per cent of all children in Ireland are living in poverty.  They have also said that the minimum level of unemployment assistance for a husband and wife should be £96 per week, £20 a week more than the rate provided for in the budget.  The figure is now £76 a week when it should be at least £96.  We have researched that figure further and suggest that, in order to keep people out of the poverty trap, it should be in the region of £106.30 per week.</P>
    <P>The Government have ignored the evidence that was made available to them, which shows that the cost of nuturing children is almost twice what they have provided.  An increase of 19p per week in child benefit can only be described as cynical.  The increase of £1 in the allowance for children of social welfare recipients bring the total to only £11.  It has been accepted by all of these agencies that up to £20 is required to nurture a child under the age of four and up to £28 is required for an older child.  We are talking about £11 when the need is for £20.  We should compare that with the continuing favourable treatment of companies in the corporate sector.  The real value of the tax reductions should be measured against increases of up to £70 per month in mortgages under the jurisdiction of this Government against increases in local authority rents, against <Col N="547" /> increases in telephone charges and against increases in the cost of electricity. The Taoiseach last night admitted that there were anomalies and that small businesses and people running bed and breakfasts who are not registered for VAT will all face increased electricity charges.  In spite of the arrangements the Minister made with the agencies, increased costs will be passed on to the consumer. Because of the reduction in the amounts capable of being claimed back on insurance premia there will be increased insurance costs.  The reduction here will lead to unattractive policies.</P>
    <P>Only the very well paid will reap any benefit from this budget.  The budget does nothing to deal with the growing housing crisis or to alleviate overcrowding in the classrooms.  The Minister has introduced a great many measures, more of them cosmetic.  The Minister cut £84 million in public spending Estimates before introducing the social measures, so the real improvement is a lot less than it appears. All that can be said for this budget is that it is a populist budget.  It is certainly not a reforming budget in spite of the efforts of the Progressive Democrats.  The equitable sharing of the fruits of growth demands more fundamental reform than the Government have attempted in the budget.</P>
    <P>A Government can avail of a number of policy instruments in pursuit of their goals whether social or economic.  The Book of Estimates and the budget are two important instruments.  In the past both documents were used to signal the Government's intentions under a variety of headings.  Very often the signals sent out by Government in the Estimates and in the budget are oblique and difficult to read.  On this occasion the signals were easy enough to read as this was the most leaked budget in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>The Government intend to do nothing more than continue a bookkeeping policy with a largely cosmetic veneer of populism of the kind always so skilfully practised by Fianna Fáil in times of economic growth.  The Government will not take action to halt the flood of emigration. <Col N="548" /> They will ignore the unacceptable level of unemployment and try to sweep under the carpet the growing poverty crisis by giving a few goodies to the very poor while ignoring the need for fundamental structural reform.  The Government will take only cosmetic action to deal with our many difficult social problems.  This Government will carry on with this charade quoting the famous rising tide that will lift all boats, without any direct intervention by the Government.  That approach ignores the reality that good bookkeeping is not enough.  The indicators might be right but unemployment and emigration are still at crisis levels and poverty is rampant throughout society.</P>
    <P>The growth in exchange revenue achieved during the past year reflects only increased consumer spending on imported durable goods, especially motor cars.  Many of the new changes in VAT and other duties will lead to more consumer spending on imported goods which means that our healthy statistics reflect the jobs being created in other countries but not here in Ireland.  Indeed, we have exported jobs.  The economic growth we are seeing will result in increased imports and in extra profits for repatriation abroad.  Yesterday's budget did more for video manufacturers in Japan and car manufacturers in Germany than for food manufacturers here.  That kind of economic growth is meaningless. We need a detailed programme to end emigration, to reverse spiralling unemployment and to combat poverty.</P>
    <P>A great deal of the growth we have seen, and are likely to see, is in a very restricted area, that is the growth in multinational profits and in the profits of the financial services sector.  A great deal of this growth has already drained out of the country.  It is clear from the warnings, particularly those in the recent ESRI report, that a continuation of the policy of wealthy Irish companies investing the bulk of their profits abroad will deny us the opportunity to benefit from that growth.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the Government have no coherent industrial policy aimed at translating growth into wealth that can <Col N="549" /> be retained here and into jobs for Irish workers.  We need radical changes in our industrial policy.  The Minister has indicated that he will examine the IDA in relation to what they are doing to secure jobs here and to maximise investment in our economy.  Nothing in yesterday's budget suggests that the Government understand the importance of that concept. Without change our economic growth will have a greater impact on countries like America, Japan and Germany than it will have on Ireland.</P>
    <P>Admittedly growth has been good for some people.  In the period when the two largest banks here report huge increases in their half yearly profits, it is appropriate to reflect on how they continue to fail to make a contribution to the economy where they have made their profits. On several occasions the Labour Party have called for the establishment of a commission of inquiry into the regulation of our financial services industry.  Many other people have also called for such an inquiry.  There are a number of major issues involved, for instance the lack of exchange controls, the growing practice among fund managers of distributing funds abroad at a time when investment here is vital, the growing practice of the banks investing their profits in capital acquisitions abroad and the management of the Stock Exchange.  All these things indicate that more care is being given to this type of development than to creating jobs here.  All these areas are surrounded by a sort of mystique.  The Government are not even fully aware of everything that is going on in this area.  Some Government Ministers could not put their hands on their hearts and say that the financial services industry always operate in the best interests of the country.  A full scale inquiry into this area is urgently required.</P>
    <P>In general terms, the cuts of the past few years and yesterday's budget have gone further down the road to creating a two-tiered system, than has Mrs. Thatcher in the past ten years in England.  In health, education and social welfare the poorest and most vulnerable have suffered most.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="550" /> The Estimates published last year envisaged substantial cuts in allocations for social welfare and education, and the number of houses to be built this year will not meet our housing needs.  In the Tipperary County Council area none of these needs is being met.  The money available for road repairs is just about enough to bring one county up to the required standard by 1992.  The worst feature of the Estimates is that they just paper over the cracks.  They will not undo any of the social and economic damage of the last three years.  Yesterday's budget will do very little to redress this imbalance.  It will not create one extra job to stop our young people from emigrating; it will not provide any meaningful additional educational opportunities; it will not alleviate the continuing crisis in the health service and it will not build the houses needed for thousands of prospective local authority tenants on waiting lists.</P>
    <P>Over the last three years the Estimates and the budgets originally produced by the Fine Gael Government, a Fianna Fáil Government and now by a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Coalition Government, have sown the seeds of a divided society.  There is a two-tier system, those with money have access to health, shelter and education and those without money must wait.  The Conference of Major Religious Superiors asked if the poor must always wait.  Figures published by the Government illustrate the point.  The consumer price index has risen by 10.8 per cent from the end of 1986 to date and by the end of 1990 will have increased by at least 12 per cent compared to 1986.  It means that even taking the 1990 Estimates into account spending on economic services generally will have been cut by 20 per cent in real terms by the end of 1990.  Current spending on infrastructure will be cut by 22 per cent, spending on social services will be cut by 12 per cent and the same applies to the area of security.  Is it any wonder that the levels of poverty, emigration and alienation within society have grown?</P>
    <P>On the capital side the principal areas cut are those where the EC Structural <Col N="551" /> Funds will impact or do not apply, in other words, in relation to housing and health facilities, where we must look after our own needs.  The Government decided they will not spend the money even though there are adequate resources available.  I will give one example to illustrate the mean spirit which has motivated the Government, their approach to Third World aid.  The total allocation for international co-operation was £28 million in 1986, having been increased by 23 per cent over 1985.  In 1987 it was reduced to £24.9 million and by the end of this year it is expected that £22.8 million will have been spent.  The provision for next year, according to the Book of Estimates, is £24 million.  If the 1986 Estimate had been increased merely in line with inflation, aid to the Third World would now stand at approximately £33.6 million and would meet some of the demands made in this area.  Indeed it would make a real contribution to solving the problems of the Third World.</P>
    <P>The most recent Estimates I have seen of the gross national product at current market prices is £18.784 billion.  This figure appears in the statistical information published by the Central Statistics Office.  This means that the proportion of national wealth which we will spend on the Third World next year will have shrunk even further, to 0.13 per cent of GNP.  The United Nations' target for the Third World is 0.7 per cent so we are getting further and further away from the target instead of getting closer to it, which we would all like to see.  We had hoped that the Government would take advantage of the growth in our economic development to make even a small gesture to the Third World in yesterday's budget but we are sorely disappointed. Surely it would have been possible for a Government willing to spend £3.5 million on racehorses to have done something about starvation of people in the Third World?</P>
    <P>In the three years since Deputy O'Hanlon became Minister for Health the service has deteriorated although the Minister says there is no crisis.  However, <Col N="552" /> as a result of his and the Government's policies &mdash; in particular as a result of the policy decisions taken by the Government regarding financial allocations to health &mdash; there is a crisis.  When Deputy Desmond was Minister for Health he was much maligned by Fianna Fáil and others but health spending was kept at a constant rate of 7 per cent of GNP or £7 for every £100 of national wealth.  In 1987 this was reduced to £6.50, in 1980 to £6.30 and, by the end of this year, it will stand at £5.80.  They are the figures at which people should look when talking about the health area.</P>
    <P>The last time international comparisons on health spending were published in 1984 they produced evidence that Ireland spent 6.9 per cent of its GDP on health; the OECD average was 5.6 per cent and the United Kingdom was 5.5 per cent.  It might appear from these figures that Ireland is well up in the spending league but the truth is that the only reason we are spending a higher proportion of our national wealth on health care is that our national wealth is considerably smaller.  When <i>per capita</i> figures of spending are looked at the true picture emerges.</P>
    <P>The crisis in the health service will be discussed next week but it is appropriate to mention them in the budget debate. We have lost 5,000 workers in the health area, comprising nurses, doctors and operatives.  Charges have been introduced for essential services which were normally freely available to people before.  There are now transport charges for medical card holders and others.  I have had many letters from people in difficulty: many of them were taken to hospital as an emergency case with a broken leg or other injury and, after treatment, told to find their own way home although they all had medical cards.  There are no longer any entitlements. There are charges for day attendance and out- and in-patient care although most of these people are paying PRSI which, up to now, covered these charges.  Four thousand beds have been removed from the system, 3,000 of these beds were for acute cases and they were <Col N="553" /> badly needed this winter.  It is impossible to get a bed for a geriatric patient who has been discharged from an acute or semi-acute hospital; 700 psychiatric beds have also been lost in this whole process; 19 hospitals have been closed and the threat of closure hangs over more of them.  The Minister does not accept this and he does not believe that any hospitals have closed in some areas.  In a reply to a parliamentary question which I tabled last week he said that some of the hospitals which have been closed are still open.  However, he then admitted that some of them had been changed to day care centres.  This playing with words is typical of the Minister's approach but next week he will have to answer to this House for his attitude.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government had a glorious opportunity yesterday to do something for the health service.  They could have diffused this crisis but they did not do so.  Indeed they blew the opportunity to diffuse it.  The money allocated yesterday, welcome as it is, will not reopen one bed or ward.  It will not hire additional staff, shorten any waiting list or alleviate the sufferings of many thousands of people who need treatment and cannot get it, unless they can pay for it. As I said earlier, it will not restore the confidence of this House in the Minister for Health.  There is every possiblity that we are now facing into a period of sustained economic growth.</P>
    <P>The medium term review published by the Economic and Social Research Institute heralded the possibility of us being able to make capital repayments on our debt within a few short years rather than simply servicing the interest.  According to the ESRI, our economy will grow by an average of 5 per cent over the next five years and by 1991, on the basis of present revenue and spending policies, we will be taking in more in taxation than we are spending.  That will be the first time that has happened since the early seventies.</P>
    <P>That is a very rosy picture to paint but I wonder if it is too optimistic.  However, it poses the question, who will benefit <Col N="554" /> from the achievements in this book-keeping exercise?  Certainly, while the poor will be perceived to have benefited from the budget by July when the increases will be paid they will have a better idea of what it will mean for them. The Labour Party time and again have posed questions about the policy dilemma, and the need to reconcile economic efficiency with the desirability for social equity, but we have not seen any evidence in the budget of any list of priorities for the areas we are concerned about.  All parties in the House and Independents, with the exception of the Government side, consider the problems of the people in need to be the priority. The non-Government agencies and voluntary organisations throughout the country are aware of what we should be doing for those people.</P>
    <P>If there is economic growth those people should benefit.  Side by side with increasing efficiency in our economy we have witnessed increased polarisation of sections of our society.  We are now cursed with a two-tiered system which can be a recipe for disaster.  The British Prime Minister now realises that that type of policy has led her into a disaster area and she is in trouble with the Community in regard to it.  At a time when we hold the Presidency of the Community, we must ensure that we do not go down that road.  We must give priority to those in need.  They should benefit from the buoyancy that is apparent to everybody, except those in need.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise a point in regard to the rules of the House. I should like to ask the Chair, whether the rules of the House refer to the number of speakers from the different sides of the House who should be called.  Four speakers from the Government side and three from the main Opposition benches have been called today.  A Member of the Labour Party has just concluded his contribution and yesterday we listened to nominated speakers from the major parties but the Independents &mdash; and there are five of us including the Ceann Comhairle &mdash; have not had a look in to say <Col N="555" /> one word about the budget good, bad or indifferent.  Is that enshrined in the rules of the House?  If it is, I appeal to Members on both sides to have a thought in these days of growing democracy in far away places behind the Iron Curtain, and the Berlin Wall, about not erecting walls and drawing down curtains in the House. This was not always the way the business of the House was conducted.</P>
      <P>In other days those who offered after the spokespersons for the major parties had contributed were taken in their turn and in the order in which they offered. Perhaps I am being unfair to the Acting Chairman, who is relieving on a day such as this, by putting this question to him, but I should like to ask him to convey to the Ceann Comhairle my concern and my protest if this is the way the business of the House is being conducted.  We are not progressing as far as democracy is concerned.  In fact, we are receding, and receding fast.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, and this is not directed at the Minister present in the Chamber or other Members, I understand that the rules of the House have enshrined in them a clear directive to the Chair that speeches must be made and not read.  I understand that supplied scripts are not allowed under the rules of the House.  I have watched Members reading their scripts today.  In fact, it has become a growing practice here.  We should either apply those rules or abandon them and let Members who have prepared scripts supply them for inclusion in the Official Report so that the time of the House is not taken up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. S. Brennan) Seamus Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Blaney, I enjoy an odd speech without a script but when in Government that can be dangerous territory.  The budget has been <Col N="556" /> good for the tourism and transport industries. I am pleased to report that the two sectors &mdash; transport and tourism &mdash; for which I have responsibility have continued to play their part in the growth of the economy.  A useful transport barometer is the fact that 1989 saw a growth of 14 per cent in the number of passengers moving through our State Airports.  This growth was in parallel with a continued dramatic resurgence of the tourism industry. I am anxious to ensure that our State airports' capacity should not constrain the growth in passenger numbers in future years.  In this context I should point out that the National Development Plan provides for total expenditure of the order of £100 million at the State airports up to 1993.  This investment is designed to complement other transport investment programmes on both a national and regional level and will have a major role in developing access transport linkages and providing the necessary support infrastructure for the development of the tourism industry.</P>
      <P>The primary objectives of the investment programme are to provide first rate international and efficient facilities for both passenger and freight traffic and to prepare for the projected increases in traffic expected to arise from the further liberalisation of air transport within the community.  These investments are regarded as major priorities in the context of EC Structural Funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the increase in capacity in State airports, I am also ensuring that the facilities at regional and local airports are augmented.  Already the major development programme which commenced in 1988 involving total expenditure of up to £5 million to upgrade the regional airport network has been completed.  This has placed these airports in a position to exploit fully the opportunities for traffic and tourism growth. Arising from the investment programme passenger traffic is now running at over 500,000 persons per annum and is expected to reach 650,000 this year. Those figures point to the great success of the regional airport network which has <Col N="557" /> been such a valuable part in developing the country.</P>
    <P>As the House will be only too aware, the development of the regional airports is an essential element in the creation of a complementary and properly integrated national transport network and is a crucial element in Ireland's access transport policy and strategy to reduce our peripherality. The development of the regional airport network is also regarded as essential for the stimulation of local investment and for the economic, industrial and tourism development of the regions.  Further major development and the regional airport network will take place over the next few years with the assistance of EC Structural Funds.  I will be making further announcements in that regard during the year.</P>
    <P>Turning to the performance of our airlines I am pleased to report that 1989 has been another very good year for Aer Lingus with a continuation of growth in passengers and cargo which has been a feature of recent years.  In 1989, Aer Lingus carried 578,000 visitors from Britain to Ireland, a new record and it represents an increase of 25 per cent over the previous year.  That is very significant. The airline also had a record increase of 34 per cent in visitors from Europe.  US visitors carried by Aer Lingus increased by 21 per cent.  These are very significant figures.</P>
    <P>In the financial year ended 31 March 1989, the Aer Lingus Group returned a record profit of £41.3 million, an increase of 9 per cent over the previous year, enabling a dividend of £3.5 million gross to be paid to the Exchequer.  The airline results, including airline related services, contributed to this improvement.  In the current financial year, Aer Lingus is continuing to perform well, although there are a number of unfavourable factors which the airline has to contend with, notably increased expenditure due to rising fuel costs and a continuation of the additional expense which is being caused by air traffic congestion in Europe.  I am confident, however, that Aer Lingus will show a good profit performance for the current financial year.  It is essential that <Col N="558" /> the company not only maintains its present level of profit, but increases it in order to finance fleet renewal and expansion through the nineties.</P>
    <P>The estimated Aer Lingus expenditure for the 1990 Public Capital Programme amounts to over £189 million, or more than double the previous year's outturn. The bulk of this expenditure relates to fleet replacement &mdash; £131 million approximately. Eight new aircraft are due for delivery to the company this year, bringing to 14 the number of new aircraft acquired since 1987.  The need for these new aircraft reflects the expansion in traffic arising from the general liberalisation of European air transport and the increase in inbound tourism in line with Government policies.</P>
    <P>In addition to expenditure on aircraft, the company will also be making substantial investment in airline related activities, most notably the establishment of a wide-bodied hangar at Dublin Airport, which received much media coverage recently.  This project, which involves an investment of £35 million, is scheduled to come on stream in early 1991.  It will be capable of servicing the largest aircraft currently in operation, notably the latest Boeing 747-400, and the new facility will be targeted at a world market.  Substantial IDA grants have been approved by the Government for the project, which is expected to create 560 new jobs, mainly for skilled people, by 1997.  This development is very much in line with the spirit of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> to which Aer Lingus is making a substantial contribution in terms of employment creation, not only in its subsidiary companies but also in the front line areas of its air transport business.</P>
    <P>During the coming year I will continue to promote the liberalisation of air transport, seeking the widest range of opportunities for Irish airlines to provide new air services to those countries with which we are developing our trade, commercial and tourism links.  In this regard, I expect that revised bilateral arrangements with the United States will be formally concluded in the near future, which will give Aer Lingus the right to provide passenger <Col N="559" /> and freight services between Ireland and Los Angeles.  This is a major breakthrough for the airline.  The question of services to Japan and Australia is also being pursued.</P>
    <P>Additional routes within the European Community became available to Irish airlines as a result of the first phase of EC air transport liberalisation measures which were adopted by the Council of Ministers in December 1987 and the bilateral memorandum of understanding concluded with the UK in 1988 which, in terms of liberalisation, went even further than the first phase of EC liberalisation.  Both these measures opened up considerable opportunities for Irish airlines to develop new routes.  In this context, it should be noted that in recent years, Aer Lingus has initiated new services from Dublin to Newcastle and Dublin to Hamburg.  In addition, they have taken advantage of fifth freedom rights to operate through Manchester to Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Hamburg and Zurich.</P>
    <P>Ryanair for their part have been instrumental in developing new direct routes from the regional airports, Connaught Galway and Kerry to a number of UK points, including Luton, Coventry, Leeds-Bradford and Manchester. Ryanair have also introduced services from Dublin to Liverpool, Coventry and Munich.  All of these developments have brought significant benefits to our tourism industry in terms of low fares and improved access.</P>
    <P>Negotiations on the second phase of EC air transport liberalisation, which will mark a further major advance towards the goal of achieving a single air transport market in Europe, are due to be concluded by 30 June 1990, under the Irish Presidency.</P>
    <P>Members will agree that we cannot have an internal market in the real sense unless we have an internal market in transport, particularly air transport.  That is why the second package is so central to the opening up of the internal market. I expect the results of these negotiations to increase the commercial opportunities for Irish airlines to expand the range of <Col N="560" /> their services as a result of more liberal fifth freedom rights and capacity sharing provisions.  This should enable Irish carriers to continue the programme of expansion of services through Irish airports with particular benefits for Irish tourism generally.</P>
    <P>I should point out, however, that the very welcome growth in aviation activity over the past few years has created a need to expand the capacity of the air traffic control and air navigation systems. Expanding the capacity of the air navigation system is a complex task that cannot be accomplished instantly.  In the current year we are recruiting additional staff and investing £11 million as part of an overall investment programme of £30 million on new radar, communications and navigational aids.  The programme will be completed by the end of 1992 and will increase capacity at Dublin, Cork and Shannon Airports to a level which is more than capable of meeting all air traffic demands.  I am pleased with the progress that is being made &mdash; work is on target and within budget.  Investment in the system was badly needed.  This is the first such major investment in a long time and it will bring air traffic control fully up to international standards.</P>
    <P>While I am happy that good progress is now being made in expanding the air navigation system, I believe there is room for improvement in the structures through which we provide our national air navigation services.  I said at Question Time today that I am looking at a number of options in regard to future structures for air traffic control in full consultation with the members of staff who do an excellent job under much pressure.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to report that the ferry operators have continued to respond well to competition from air services.  While they have lost market share to the air carriers in the foot passenger market, they are successfully developing their own market in car party traffic.  To this end, the ferry companies are offering very attractive fares for car parties, together with special incentive fares for package holidays, especially those which are activity-related.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="561" /> The substantial progress made by B &amp; I in 1988 has continued into 1989 and the company's recovery programme remains on target.  This will be borne out when the company's 1989 results are published.  B &amp; I have recently negotiated improved sailing slots at Holyhead which, I believe, will help the company's performance in 1990 and beyond.  I am confident that B &amp; I management and staff will continue in their efforts to turn the company around and make it into a commercially viable concern.  Although substantial progress has been made, it should be clear to everybody concerned that there is still a long way to go.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Cork-Swansea ferry service, the Government have decided that financial assistance comprising a grant of £500,000, together with a repayable loan of £500,000, should be made available to Swansea-Cork Ferries Limited for the provision of a service in 1990. This assistance is subject to certain conditions being met by the company.  I again emphasise the exceptional nature of this package and also reiterate the Government's policy that access transport services to Ireland must operate on a fully commercial basis.  To this end, I must stress that no Exchequer assistance will be available to Swansea-Cork Ferries after 1990.  It is now up to the people of the Cork and Kerry region to support the service and prove that a self-sustaining and competitive service can be maintained beyond 1990.</P>
    <P>As regards developments in international road transport, the criterion of competitiveness is also to the fore.  In the context of the completion of the single market, one key objective is the full liberalisation of the road freight transport sector by 1993.  Under the Irish Presidency of the European Communities, I will give priority to reaching agreement on substantial increases in the quota for international haulage within the Community leading to this liberalisation.  I am confident that this will benefit the whole of the Community and that Irish hauliers will respond well to the increasingly competitive climate.  We can already see a notable increase of activity in the Irish <Col N="562" /> road haulage sector since liberalisation of the industry in 1988.</P>
    <P>In December last the Council of Ministers of Transport gave a further boost to the liberalisation of the haulage market when they reached agreement, on the basis of a compromise which I had put forward at the October Council.  This was to allow hauliers to carry goods within another member state on a limited basis &mdash; a transport phenomenon known as &ldquo;cabotage&rdquo;.  From 1 July 1990 Irish hauliers will be able to avail of licences to operate such services in other member states.  This is a major breakthrough in the sense that we cannot have an internal market in transport without also having freedom for road hauliers to move freely within the Community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to <Col N="563" /> thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter which is of prime concern to the agricultural industry, to the bacon and pork industry and particularly for our export markets. I know this has caused devastation in the Ballybay area &mdash; I was in that general area last week &mdash; certainly to the 175 people who lost their jobs as well as the farmers who are owed in excess of £2 million for their pigs.  The whole thing is a very sorry story.</P>
      <P>However, it is incumbent on somebody like me to ensure that all the facts surrounding this problem are known.  In the few minutes at my disposal I should like to ask the Minister for Agriculture and Food to inform the public how the IDA evaluated the Ballybay Meat Exports project for grant-aid purposes and to explain how such a project went into receivership so soon after the evaluation was carried out.  I find it difficult to understand how only a year ago the IDA could see fit &mdash; and in my view rightly so &mdash; to grant-aid the company.  In my view the factory was in the right place.  How could an evaluation of that type go so terribly wrong?  I should like to know if Ballybay Meat Exports Limited, or any other company involving the same directors, got aid from Fóir Teoranta before the new processing plant was built and if the IDA were in receipt of this information.  It is very important that those points be clarified.  Is it true that over £3 million of FEOGA grant-aid and IDA funds were involved and what opportunities or mechanisms are available to the IDA to recover taxpayers' money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from the media that the Minister initiated an investigation a few weeks ago.  I should like to know the terms of reference of such an investigation and if the results will be made public.  I should like to know who is being investigated and by whom.  Is the investigation being carried out by the Department of Agriculture and Food, the Garda or the Fraud Squad?  Is the Minister worried by the consistent newspaper reports <Col N="564" /> about ongoing investigations by Danish and US police about the mislabelling of consignments of pork on the US markets? Such rumours are extremely dangerous and serious for Irish bacon and pork products on all our export markets.  Have such investigations taken place in Ballybay Meat Exports Limited or, indeed, in any other Irish meat processing factory? If those reports are wrong it is incumbent on the Minister to say so immediately before we do serious harm to the export drive in the continental countries and particularly in America.  It is time to cut this out if it is wrong; if it is right it is another story.</P>
    <P>Newspaper reports indicate that the company in Ballybay had debts of £7 million.  If these reports are true where did the money go?  Will farmers who are owed £2 million receive preferential treatment?  Was Ballybay Meat Exports Limited connected in any way with any London meat export company or trading house or have the Danish company who are involved with Ballybay Meat any business connections in London?  Would the Minister agree that it is now past the time when all the matters relating to the above should be addressed in a full and frank public discussion and that the results should be made public immediately. Failure to do so would greatly affect the entire marketing of bacon and pork abroad and would devastate Ballybay and its hinterland and the 175 people who lost their jobs.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to use his influence with the receiver to ensure that the plant will re-open as a bacon and pork processing factory and that the jobs will be protected.  A pre-condition of opening must be to pay farmers for their stock.</P>
    <P>This is a very serious matter and it behoves everybody involved to clarify immediately what exactly is going on.  If the reports are incorrect then obviously this processing factory at Ballybay should not have closed.  It has very serious ramifications across the entire industry.  I am asking the Minister to clarify to the best <Col N="565" /> of his ability the questions I have asked today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to reply to this question relating to Ballybay Meat Exports Limited put down by Deputy Connaughton.</P>
      <P>I would like to put the position at Ballybay into perspective.  It is generally acknowledged that the pigmeat industry is in urgent need of restructuring to gear it for the increasingly competitive European and world markets in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>In July 1987, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, announced a major programme for the development of this very important industry.  This programme involves a total capital investment by 1992 of some £140 million, including substantial investment in the processing sectors of the industry. The purpose of the programme is to rationalise and modernise these sectors so as to create an up-to-date and efficient industry comparable to the best in Europe and capable of matching its competitors both at home and abroad.  It also has an ambitious job creation target of some 1,000 jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development strategy involves the creation of up to eight central slaughtering and processing plants, up to the highest EC and US veterinary standards, with a minimum slaughtering capacity of 6,000 pigs per week.  The strategy also provides for the establishment of a number of specialised export-orientated processing plants which it is envisaged would source their raw material from the central slaughtering units.  The programme is well under way with a number of plants already on stream and some others in the process of construction or at an advanced planning stage.  In fact, since June 1987 my Department have approved of investment projects in pig slaughtering and processing facilities involving a total capital input of about £85 <Col N="566" /> million.  Of this, the IDA have committed £15 million to these investments while EC grant aid of some £40 million has been sought, of which about £23 million has been approved.</P>
    <P>The decision to appoint a receiver at Ballybay is one over which the Minister for Agriculture and Food has no control.</P>
    <P>The closure of Ballybay Meat is of course a serious setback, and the Minister, who is particularly concerned that a firm should go into receivership so soon after it opened, has asked for a report from his Department and the IDA on certain aspects of the case.  Because of the confidential nature of the Department's dealings with individual companies it would be inappropriate to comment further in public on this particular aspect of the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Investment aid to private companies is normally made by State agencies such as the IDA or SFADCo. Each agency undertakes a critical examination of grant applications and all relevant matters including the financial structure and management expertise of the company are taken into account.  It is only after such screening and following the approval of a grant by the State agency concerned, that the application for EC funding is submitted by the Department to Brussels.  Payment of the EC grant is made on the basis of a duly audited claim checked and certified by the relevant State grant agency.  Thus, in the case of Ballybay Meat the EC grant was paid only after the building had been completed and the equipment installed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can confirm that the IDA examined and evaluated the project in great detail prior to grant approval and satisfied themselves as to the commercial viability of the venture at the time.  The IDA were always aware of the tight financial position of Ballybay Meat going back to their start up period in 1981.  This situation is not unusual as the financial needs <Col N="567" /> of food companies both in terms of working capital and fixed assets are sizeable particularly those engaged in establishing a new venture.  The IDA approved their first grant package to Ballybay Meat in 1981 for their original facility at Corbrack.</P>
    <P>In 1985 due to the expanding trading needs of the company and with a view to putting their funding on a more secure basis, additional sources of finance were sought and Fóir Teoranta provided funding to the company.  This initiative was seen as beneficial by all parties concerned with the company including their bankers, IDA and, subsequently, their new investors, ESS Foods.</P>
    <P>In 1987, in considering the most recent proposal from Ballybay the IDA were aware, among others, of the Fóir Teoranta participation in the venture.  This increment of investment was progressed with the involvement of ESS Foods who represented a significant additional initiative in the development of the Ballybay enterprise.</P>
    <P>The closure of Ballybay is, as I said, very regrettable and one's sympathies must certainly go out to the estimated 180 people who have lost their jobs.  I am also concerned about the pig producers who are owed a great deal of money by the company.  However, I would be very hopeful of positive developments regarding the future of the Ballybay plant.  This plant is in excellent condition and one of the most modern in the business.  The FEOGA and State moneys involved were used to build a substantial asset.  I understand that the receiver has advertised the plant for sale by tender.  I would be very anxious that a buyer be found and in co-operation with all concerned would recommence operations at the plant as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We now come <Col N="568" /> to deal with the second item for consideration on the Adjournment.  Deputy Proinsias De Rossa gave me notice of his intention to raise the subject matter of the provision of residential care and other facilities for Samantha Webb.  The matter is in order.  The Deputy has ten minutes to present his case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment. Surely the hallmark of any civilised society is the way it treats its weakest members.  It would be hard to think of a more vulnerable and defenceless group than those with mental handicap who are generally not in a position either to defend themselves or fight for better conditions or medical care on their own behalf.  If it were not for the thousands of parents, relatives and care workers who look after them they would indeed be in a dire situation.</P>
      <P>The appalling case of Samantha Webb, a 22 year old woman with severe mental handicap whose plight has been highlighted recently in the media, shows that not even people in this category have been spared the lash of the health cutbacks.</P>
      <P>The case shows that the promises made by the Minister for Health during a Dáil debate in December, to provide additional resources for the care of the mentally handicapped, have not been honoured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Dáil on 5 December last, the Minister stated that Government policy &ldquo;aims to ensure that services appropriate to their requirements are available to people with mental handicap&rdquo;.  He added that he accepted there were gaps in the service and that &ldquo;further developments in the services are required to bring about the full realisation of the aspirations of that policy&rdquo;.  He also insisted, however, that he could not envisage a situation <Col N="569" /> where, if a parent died or something happened suddenly, that a mentally handicapped child or adult would not be looked after.</P>
    <P>This case shows that what the Minister cannot envisage is actually happening. Since her mother's death before Christmas, it has not been possible to find a permanent residential place for Samantha Webb.  Care workers have, on occasion, had to accommodate her overnight in their own homes and she has also had to sleep in the day care centre which she has been attending for the past 18 years.</P>
    <P>Neither is this just a temporary crisis. One month after her mother's death the problem still has not been resolved.  The case shows clearly that the claims made by the Minister that there is no crisis in the health service is pure nonsense.  The Minister indicated last night that a place would be available quite soon for this young woman.  Yet St. Michael's House have categorically denied that and have said that if a place becomes available there are at least six urgent cases on top of a list of 112 criticial cases with which she will be competing for a place.</P>
    <P>The allocation in yesterday's budget in no way addresses the problem.  What is required is an allocation sufficient to provide an additional 330 residential places in Dublin and another 800 places across the country.  It has been estimated that that would run to something like £7 million, not the £2 million that the Minister has allocated.  Indeed, St. Michael's House have pointed out that it would cost something like £2.5 million simply to cope with the demand on them for urgent placements, never mind the demand for places right across the country.</P>
    <P>The allocation in yesterday's budget of £2 million in the current year is welcome in so far as it goes and in so far as it recognises that there is a problem.  There are however, 16,000 families caring for mentally handicapped people and at least 2,000 of those are severely mentally handicapped.  Most of these require <Col N="570" /> almost 24 hour care.  There is a serious problem which £2 million cannot hope to address.</P>
    <P>I therefore call on the Minister to make immediate arrangements to ensure that provision is made, in the first place, to cater for the needs of Samantha Webb and, indeed, to cater for the other critical cases.  St. Michael's alone have six critical cases for which they are awaiting places on top of a list of 112.</P>
    <P>In addition to funding residential care, according to the Commission on Health Funding, a majority of the 2,000 people in psychiatric hospitals are suitable for transfer to community hospitals and residential centres and about 1,900 of the 5,000 in special residential centres require only hostel accommodation or, in some cases, day care.  These again are services which are not being provided and will not be covered by the £2 million the Minister has allocated.  Institutional care has been cut back and, presumably, will continue to be cut back and starved of resources.  The community care services we were promised as an alternative form of care have not been developed.</P>
    <P>In December the Minister also referred to the question of legislation to give specific rights to persons with mental handicap.  If the case of Samantha Webb is not an example of deprivation of rights, it would be hard to find one.  There is urgent need for the kind of legislation the Minister referred to and I would urge him to address that matter as well.  If the Minister or other Members of the Cabinet were unaware of the problem, then clearly this case, which has come to the public attention as the problem has never come to their attention before, must surely demonstrate for them that there is a real problem.  There is an obligation on the Government to act now and to act decisively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. O'Hanlon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy De Rossa about the importance of providing for the needs of <Col N="571" /> the disadvantaged, including the mentally handicapped.  As the Deputy is aware the provision of services to people with mental handicap is the statutory responsibility of the health baord, in this case the Eastern Health Board.  Services which are provided directly by the health board and a number of voluntary organisations which are funded by the Exchequer are co-ordinated by a central co-ordinating committee.</P>
      <P>In cases such as that of Samantha Webb the policy of the Eastern Health Board is that the most appropriate permanent residential care would be provided as a matter of urgency and that in the meantime immediate crisis short-term residential care would be made available if necessary.  In the case in question such immediate crisis residential care was available through the Eastern Health Board, if it was required.  I have been assured that those are the facts and that this residential care is always available through the Eastern Health Board.</P>

The Eastern Health Board who have premises of their own had a place available for Samantha Webb but because she was attending the day care centre in St. Michael's House and members of the staff voluntarily decided to take her home to their houses &mdash; she also stayed in the respite care facilities available in St. Michael's House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but as I have pointed out to the Deputy long-stay places cannot be kept vacant.  I might add for the sake of the Deputy that since I came into Government the funding of services for the mentally handicapped has been protected in real terms over the past three years.  Indeed St. Michael's House have been able to provide well over 100 new day care places as a result of the extra funding allocated by me as Minister. They have also been able to provide respite care facilities from which 57 mentally handicapped people have benefited. All of this has been done within the past three years despite the crying and wailing by the Deputy and others who have come in here and said there have been no developments, only cutbacks.  The <Col N="574" /> Deputy spoke about telling the truth in this House but he said this was the result of cutbacks.  There are no cutbacks at all&mdash;&mdash;</P>

St. Michael's House has assured us that a number of people, including Samantha Webb, who are at present in short-stay crisis care will be offered full residential places in the very near future.  My commitment to the mentally handicapped has been honoured.  I would love to get £17 million or £20 million, if the economy of this country could afford it, because I could make very good use of it for the mentally handicapped.  My interest in the mentally handicapped did not start when I came into this House; it goes back a long time.</P>

It will provide for an increase in the number of staff working with the mentally handicapped, more short-stay care, crisis care and long-stay places, a number of day places and many other facilities for the mentally <Col N="575" /> handicapped.  I will deal with these matters next week.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of mentally handicapped in psychiatric hospitals, it is now the policy that the mentally handicapped should not be admitted to psychiatric hospitals.  That was never the ideal solution but it has been happening for the past 60 years since the foundation of the State.  A decision has been made in principle that this will not happen any more and places will be provided outside. A number of new day and residential places have been provided in Dublin over the past three years.  I will deal with these more specifically on another occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="576" /> While the availability of a place in St. Michael's House for Samantha Webb would have been the ideal solution it is understandable why one was not available; places are not left vacant waiting for a crisis to develop.  The health board were prepared to offer her a place but in all the circumstances they accepted the arrangement made as the most appropriate in her case and the least disruptive to her.  They put the patient's interest first.</P>

      <i>Notes</i>
    </P>
    <P>1.  The figures in column II show the surplus of income over expenditure arising on sales in Aer Rianta duty free outlets.  These figures do not represent profit in the strict commercial sense.  It is necessary to compute the information in this manner because certain commercial charges &mdash; for example interest on borrowings and depreciation provisions &mdash; do not arise in the case of Aer Rianta's accounts in the same manner as they would in a normal set of commercial accounts.  This accounting treatment arises directly from the fact that the assets at the State Airports which include the duty free outlets are owned by the Minister for Tourism and managed on his behalf by Aer Rianta.</P>
    <P>2.  The figures shown in column III represent estimated sales of goods to intra EC travellers.  If duty free sales within the EC were to be abolished over 85 per cent of this revenue would be lost to Aer Rianta.</P>
    <P>3.  Sales of non-dutiable goods at the Aer Rianta duty free outlets are included in the above figures.</P>

      <P>The transport and tourism programme which I will be pursuing as President of the EC Council of Ministers is as follows.</P>
      <P>The key elements of the Presidency Programme in relation to transport, which I have drawn up following consultation with the Commission, are: the second phase of liberalisation in air transport &mdash; both passenger and freight &mdash; and related dossiers concerning harmonisation of airline technical and social conditions, external policies in air transport and air traffic congestion; further liberalisation of road freight transport; liberalisation of road passenger transport; the development of the Community's railway policy; the Commission proposals for an integrated transport infrastructure programme for the Community; the ongoing negotiations about transit problems with Austria, Switzerland and Yugoslavia; further harmonisation of conditions of competition in road transport, and road safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to tourism, I am disappointed at the lack of progress to date in the development of the Community <Col N="503" /> tourism policy, particularly having regard to the single market objectives.

I will be convening an informal meeting of EC Tourism Ministers in Ireand on 10-11 March next and I propose to use this opportunity to press for increased momentum in the development of Community tourism policy within the framework of Commission proposals.</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to the Government's decision last August to make available a special allocation from within my Department's Vote in 1989 of up to £5 million for a special joint marketing campaign involving Bord Fáilte and the tourism industry.  This special allocation was additional to moneys already provided for Bord Fáilte in the 1989 Estimates.  The special allocation was to be used for a revamped tourism advertising and promotion campaign to increase tourist numbers and revenue in autumn 1989 and into 1990.  It was conditional on the tourist industry providing at least a matching £5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord Fáilte submitted the joint programme agreed by them with the industry in late November.  The total value of the programme was in excess of £10 million, including initiatives which were more long-term in nature than originally envisaged. Three million pounds of the proposed Bord Fáilte expenditure in the programme related to marketing activities appropriate to the 1989 accounting period and, accordingly, was included in <Col N="504" /> a Supplementary Estimate for the Tourism and Transport Vote.  The remaining proposals will be considered in the context of Bord Fáilte's and the industry's joint plans for this year.</P>
    <P>It has always been my intention that all moneys available for tourism are allocated and spent to develop the industry. Where moneys made available by the Government for this purpose are, however, as in the present instance, conditional on a matching provision by the industry, the Deputy will appreciate that the total amount which can be provided by the Exchequer is determined by the corresponding amount provided by the industry.  The Deputy may wish to know that I have invited the industry to work out, with Bord Fáilte, a promotional programme for the three year period 1991 to 1993, with agreed strategic targets and detailed costings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. S. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>As announced by my predecessor in reply to questions on 23 February 1989, it is proposed to close the weather observation stations at Renmore, Galway, and at Roches Point, County Cork.  The decision to close the stations was taken following a review of the Meteorological Service which was carried out by senior officers of the Departments of Tourism and Transport and Finance including representatives of the Meteorological Service.</P>
      <P>The review was wide ranging and took full account of the needs of the service in the modern environment.  It made comprehensive recommendations for maintaining the general level and standard of the Meteorological Service operations, but at substantially reduced costs.  The recommendations also focused on the scope for improved structures, greater use of automation, and general rationalistation with a view to achieving a more efficient and cost effective Meteorological Service.  The review also pointed to the possibility of increasing revenue by means of a more commercial approach to marketing its services.</P>
      <P>The meteorological station at Galway will be closed later this year and the station at Roches Point will be phased out by 1992.  Neither station has a formal role in the dissemination of meteorological information and it is planned to install automatic observing systems in both areas so that routine climatological information will continue to be available to those who require it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently announced a new commercial focus for the Meterological Service <Col N="507" /> and the commissioning of a comprehensive study of the commercial potential of the weather forecasting service. My intention is that revenue earned by the service should be maximised in order to reduce the cost of the service to the taxpayer.  It is not my intention that the commercial approach will lead to the closure of stations or the imposition of other restrictions; rather will it help to provide additional revenue to support the activities of the Meterological Service.</P>

      <P>Climatic conditions are never entirely static.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Meteorological Service that climatic records available for a number of meteorological stations in Ireland for periods exceeding 100 years indicate that there was a gradual rise in the mean annual temperature from the turn of the century until the mid-forties. From then until the end of the seventies there was a slight downward trend. Annual mean temperatures for the eighties were very similar to those of the seventies, and other parameters such as rainfall and cloudiness showed no significant trends.</P>
      <P>In recent times, concern has been expressed about the so-called &ldquo;greenhouse effect&rdquo; but I understand that while average global temperatures during the eighties showed a modest but detectable rise, this trend has not been apparent in Ireland.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47, 54 and 94 together.</P>
      <P>The Government have decided that financial assistance on a once only basis and up to an absolute limit of £500,000 in grant and £500,000 loan may be made available to Swansea-Cork Ferries Limited for the provision of a service in 1990, subject to a number of conditions concerning vessel suitability and the achievement of budgeted targets.  Before any Exchequer moneys are advanced, I must be satisfied that the necessary arrangements and structures are put in place to ensure that an effective service can be provided by the company in 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the longer term, I fully support the maintenance of all ferry services in the interests of tourism and our exporters.  I must stress, however, that it is Government policy that access transport services should operate on a commercial basis.  In those circumstances, Swansea-Cork Ferries Limited have been informed that the <Col N="513" /> Government have decided that no further Exchequer assistance will be available to the company from 1990 onwards.</P>
    <P>I want to remind the House that the Exchequer assistance available in 1990 and the offer of assistance in 1989, which was not taken up by the company, followed earlier Exchequer grants in 1987 and 1988.  The Government have done all they can reasonably be expected to do in assisting the provision of a Cork-Swansea service.  It is now up to the operators of the service and the people of the Cork-Kerry region to prove that a commercially self-sustaining service can be operated in future years.  I very much hope that they succeed in that endeavour.</P>

      <P>The Government are fully aware of the essential nature of transport in the overall successful performance of the economy and it is our objective to improve as far as possible the competitive position of Irish hauliers <i>vis-á-vis</i> foreign hauliers.  The Deputy will, however, appreciate that, as has been said in this House on previous occasions, control over many of the costs involved for hauliers &mdash; vehicles taxes, port charges, insurance etc.  &mdash; do not lie within my remit as Minister for Tourism and Transport.</P>
      <P>There are other factors which militate against fair competition for Irish hauliers. The inadequate state of the Irish road system for instance has been acknowledged as a significant cost element for Irish hauliers.  In recognition of this fact the State, aided by EC Structural Funds, proposes to spend £662.7 million (at 1989 prices) in improving national and access roads to the principal ports and airports in the period 1989-93.  Plans are also in hands for the improvement of the ports at Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Rosslare.</P>
      <P>It is obviously essential that in order to compete effectively with their foreign counterparts, Irish hauliers should be able to arrive at their European destinations at the lowest possible cost and in the shortest possible time.  It is important, therefore, that suitable access transport should be readily available.  In that connection, I have arranged for a feasibility study to be undertaken by a firm of consultants to examine how access links between Ireland, Britain and the continent can be improved.  Apart from considering proposals for investment in sea and air freight services, the study will examine factors in the Irish transport sector which impose excess costs on Irish exporters.  The consultants' report is expected to be completed in about four months' time.</P>

      <P>So far Bus Átha Cliath have extended the localink bus service in Tallaght, as planned.  I am informed that their proposals for new peripheral bus services linking Tallaght to areas such as Blanchardstown and Dún Laoghaire will be introduced later this year.</P>
      <P>The Iarnród Éireann plans include proposals for a new commuter rail service from Clondalkin to the city centre with a feeder bus service being provided from Tallaght to Clondalkin rail station.  The Clondalkin project, which would cost about £27.3 million and involves the construction of eight new stations and the building of railcars, has been included in the transport operational programme under the <i>National Development Plan 1989-1993</i> for assistance from the EC Structural Funds.  The Clondalkin project will be considered further in the light of the outcome of the application for EC aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should inform the Deputy that I recently had a meeting with representatives of CIE, Dublin Corporation and Dublin <Col N="518" /> County Council, at which the Department of the Environment were also represented, to consider the various proposals which have been put forward for a light rail system or busway on the old Harcourt Street line and the needs of Tallaght for improved public transport services.  Following that meeting, I set up a small working group comprising representatives of the various interests involved to examine these matters in greater depth and requested them to report back to me quickly.  On receipt of the group's report, I will consider this whole matter further in consultation with the Minister for the Environment.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the National Development Plan contains proposals for major EC assisted investment in sea and air freight services linking Ireland with Britain and the European mainland.  The consultancy firm, Stokes Kennedy Crowley, have been commissioned to undertake a major feasibility study into these proposals over the next four months.  The study, which is steered by a committee representative of the Departments of Tourism and Transport, the Marine and Finance and the European Commission, under the chairmanship of a senior officer of my Department, has the following terms of reference:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the proposals in the Irish Government's National Development Plan for EC-assisted <Col N="519" /> investment in sea and air freight services in the context of Ireland's peripherality within the Single European Market</P>
    <P>(1)  To examine and report on the existing demand for, and provision of, infrastructure and services for the movement of freight in both directions between Ireland and (a) Britain and (b) the other EC Member States;</P>
    <P>(2)  To project the evolution of needs and opportunities, at five-yearly intervals, up to the year 2010 and to describe and assess the intentions and plans of providers of infrastructure and services within Ireland and elsewhere (in so far as relevant);</P>
    <P>(3)  To make recommendations for measures required within Ireland and (in so far as necessary) elsewhere to improve or to create infrastructure and services and to evaluate such measures by reference to their effectiveness, feasibility, capital and operating costs and commercial viability, secondary effects (e.g. displacement effects, environmental impacts);</P>
    <P>(4)  To make proposals for other measures which could be taken to improve the efficiency of sea and air freight services and in particular those required to achieve reductions in the transport costs borne by Irish exporters.</P>
    <P>Recommendations arising from the feasibility study will be given careful consideration with a view to appropriate action being taken to improve Ireland's freight links with Britain and the Continent.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there is no refund of tax due to the taxpayer.  In fact, when his liability is reviewed at the end of the current tax year there may be an <Col N="522" /> underpayment of tax because the taxpayer did not declare that he was in receipt of an old age pension from the Department of Social Welfare until 16 November 1989, i.e on his return of income form for 1989/90.</P>
      <P>As the social welfare pension is paid in full without deduction of tax, the tax attributable to it is being collected under PAYE by restriction of his allowances by the estimated amount of that pension in the current year.  Accordingly, an amendment certificate of tax free allowances for 1989-90 was issued by the inspector of taxes on 1 December 1990 effective from date of issue only in order to avoid undue hardship to the taxpayer.  The inspector will now write to the taxpayer for full details of his pension and on receipt of same, the tax free allowances will be amended, if necessary.</P>

      <P>The US authorities have recently ceased to purchase any Community beef for US military installations in Europe.  This is part of the continuing disagreement between the US and the EC on matters relating to international meat trade.  The Commission has already taken up with the US authorities the question of beef purchases for the US Defence Forces.  I, as President of the Council, am in close touch with the Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development with a view to finding a solution.  The US authorities have not so far responded to the Community's approaches.</P>
      <P>As regards the actual supply of beef to the US forces the position is that a central purchasing agency awards contracts on foot of tenders received from EC meat companies.  In recent years, Irish firms were not awarded contracts until the last quarter of 1989 when some 900 tonnes were purchased and exported.  While welcome, this quantity is relatively small in the context of total Irish beef exports of approximately 420,000 tonnes annually.</P>

      <P>As I have previously stated, I initiated a review of the common contract in September, 1987.  An agenda was agreed with the Irish Medical Organisation. Included on this agenda was the issue of `B' and `C' factor payments.  In June 1988 agreement was reached on the scheduling of consultants' commitments.  It was agreed that local management and individual consultants would immediately proceed to agree the scheduling of this commitment.  Despite this agreement, reflected in a joint press statement, the organisation subsequently instructed members not to proceed to agree or record their specific schedule or commitments of local level.  In this context, and having regard to the emphasis which had been placed upon a satisfactory resolution of this issue as a prelude to further progress in the discussions, the Government decided in May 1989 that a review of the conditions of employment appropriate to consultants, including remuneration, should be referred to the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector.  I understand that the IMO have made a submission to the review body.  I will consider the matter <Col N="530" /> further when the review body furnishes its report.</P>
