    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2 and 3 together.  An informal EC summit will be held in Dublin on 28 April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I informed the House on 20 February, the main purpose of the meeting will be to enable EC leaders to take a collective view of the evolving situation <Col N="1098" /> in Central and Eastern Europe and its implications for the European Community, with particular reference to the progress towards German unification. My discussion with Chancellor Kohl on 28 March and with other Heads of State and Government subsequently will be in preparation for the summit meeting in Dublin on 28 April.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Taoiseach specifically to Question No. 1 and ask if he will be discussing with Chancellor Kohl the likely implications for Structural Funds for the less developed countries and regions, including ourselves, and if this will be specifically on the agenda.  Does the Taoiseach consider this matter should be discussed and that we should be worried at the obvious consequences of German unity on the limitations of funds to be spent by Germany on the rest of the Community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will understand that I am in a little difficulty.  It is not the custom to say in advance what specifically will be on the agenda of one of these meetings.  The whole impact of German reunification and its implications for the Community will certainly be discussed at the meeting in Dublin. My own assessment of the situation at the moment is that there would not be any particular fall-out as far as the Structural Funds are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the Irish Government on behalf of the Presidency and/or the European Commission requested that the intergovernmental conference on economic and monetary union be brought forward from December? If so, what is the reaction to this request and will that matter be discussed at the April Summit?  I gather that the European Commission are studying the implications at the integration of East Germany into the Community.  Has any separate assessment been undertaken by the Irish Government on behalf of the Presidency or on their own behalf on the possible repercussions of German economic and monetary union, particularly <Col N="1099" /> in relation to the possible effects of an increase in lending rates, increased inflation and a possible realignment within the EMS?  If so, what are the results of such a study?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised a number of matters.  There were some suggestions that the date for the intergovernmental conference should be brought forward but there was not agreement on that.  It is not likely that it will be brought forward to any extent.  The view would be that it is better that it should do its work quickly when convened rather than that it should be brought forward.  On the question of the impact of German reunification, that is primarily a matter for the Commission and they are preparing a paper on the implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we not studying the implications?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have done our own assessment from a national point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach give an indication of the results of that assessment with regard to inflation, lending rates, possible realignment with the EMS and the whole question of monetary stability?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is quite an extension of the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be better if the Deputy would wait.  It is a very complex situation.  The Commission paper is not yet ready.  Before giving any view about it, I would rather wait to have that Commission paper.  Members might agree that in a way we are fortunate that this situation has happened to West Germany because of all the member states West Germany is certainly best equipped from the point of view of financial and economic resources to undertake the task of absorbing East Germany.  All our experience of the German financial authorities is that they will make every effort to <Col N="1100" /> ensure that the operation will be carried through with the minimum fall out for the rest of Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the knock-on effects as far as we are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the enormous implications of German reunification in economic and fiscal matters, does the Taoiseach feel that this will slow down the completion of the Internal Market, a fear which has already been voiced by the President of the Commission, Jacques Delors?  Does the Taoiseach share that fear and will he take steps to ensure there is no slow down, irrespective of what is happening in regard to German unification, in the completion of the Internal Market?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That worry has been expressed but I can assure the Deputy that there is a fairly widespread determination that it will not have any such effect.  The opposite will be the case. Most member states would be of the view that whatever about the unification of Germany, certainly the developments in Eastern Europe would indicate that the whole process of Community integration and unification should be speeded up rather than the reverse.  The Community will have such an important role to play in future in regard to Eastern Europe that it is essential that its own coherence and integration be expedited rather than the reverse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the topic for the meeting at the end of April will be the unification of Germany, does the Taoiseach, as President of the Council, propose to consult with the special committee of the European Parliament who have been established to consider that matter as well?  If not in that form, does he propose to consult with the European Parliament in any form prior to that meeting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there has been <Col N="1101" /> quite an amount of discussion with different groups in the European Parliament and I am at the moment considering some other initiatives in that regard so that the full view of the Parliament can be had in advance of the meeting in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the European Parliament itself has asked for a pre-conference consultation on these issues between the Parliament, the Commission and the Council?  Will he as President of the Council ensure that this takes place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Parliament is seeking by way of pre-conference conference, so to speak, to deal not with the Dublin Summit and German unification; it is seeking that pre-conference in advance of the inter-governmental conference on economic and monetary union.  It is very likely that something along those lines will be worked out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to come to deal with other questions.  A brief and final question from Deputy Dick Spring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the widely held view that the timetable for the completion of the internal market has already slipped quite severely given the events in Europe in the last number of months, is the Taoiseach concerned about this and is he taking any steps to avoid any further slippage in the timetable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so sure that developments in Eastern Europe in particular are holding up the completion of arrangements for the single market.  I would like to assure the Deputy that in so far as the Irish Presidency is concerned, we are making every possible effort in all the different areas right across the agenda to expedite the work and to achieve as much progress as possible.  We have been able to advance the preparations fairly considerably.  Of course, it will be up to the Italians who follow us and the other Presidencies to keep up the <Col N="1102" /> momentum.  In so far as we are concerned we are keeping up the momentum and making every effort to ensure that the different dossiers, directives and so on are dealt with.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to reactivate Bord Scannán na h-Éireann, the Irish Film Board.</P>
      <P>I informed the House on 21 February last of the various tax incentives which have been introduced to facilitate the development of the Irish film industry and of the assistance being given to the industry by various State agencies.  As a result, the industry has become progressively more professional and commercially successful over the past three years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that the worldwide publicity given to this film and the speeches by Daniel Day Lewis and Brenda Fricker last night have done enormous good for Ireland, for the tourist industry, for our national reputation and even for economic development in the future?  If he accepts this, surely he must accept that it is grossly unfair to rely on the creative efforts and hard work of a few individuals to put Ireland on the world stage.  Surely he must be willing to rethink his attitude on State support for the Irish film industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very happy to join with the Deputy in offering our congratulations to all those who are connected with this very successful film and particularly to the winners of the Oscar awards.  We are all very proud of them. They certainly merit our best thanks and congratulations for what they have done for our country.</P>
      <P>I would like to suggest that the incentives we have for film making are very generous and, indeed, were widely availed of in the making of this film. However, if, as a result of the experience of making of this film and of its success, there is any further way in which the incentives can be developed or extended, we are prepared to consider that.  I would not like the Deputy or anybody else to be under the impression that there are not already very considerable incentives for film making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not accept the the success of &ldquo;My Left Foot&rdquo; can be repeated many times over given the very large number of talented people we have in Ireland and the range of production and marketing skills that are already available?  Will he not accept that what these people need most is the understanding that if they have good ideas they will get the financial support they need without having to go abroad to look for this support?  I would add that past experience has shown that it is clearly beyond any doubt that Irish produced films to name a few, &ldquo;Ryan's Daughter&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Dawn&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Quiet Man&rdquo;, have done more for the expansion of Irish tourism than Bord Fáilte could ever attempt to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, I would put it that investment in the Irish film industry has tremendous potential for the future of the industry as an employment agency.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is making a very good case, but I would like to point out to him that three recent films, &ldquo;My Left Foot,&rdquo;&ldquo;Eat the Peach&rdquo; and &ldquo;Rattle and Hum&rdquo; have all benefited from the fairly considerable incentives which are there.  As the Deputy knows, there is another film &mdash; I am not sure if it is completed but it is well on its way to completion &mdash;&ldquo;The Field&rdquo; which has also had access to these incentives.  What the Deputy says about the value of these films is, of course, quite correct and that is recognised in the system of incentives we have.  I can ony repeat that if as a result of recent experience in the making of these films there is some way in which the incentives might be improved or extended, that can be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me join with the other Deputies who have spoken in extending congratulations to the people involved in the success of &ldquo;My Left Foot&rdquo;.  Will the Taoiseach agree that the few small examples that have been given here are really examples of excellence but that there is a whole range of other people coming out of film school and elsewhere who have nowhere to turn so that there is a great deal to be done by the Taoiseach in providing start off capital for those who may not have the good fortune that perhaps some of those involved in the more recent examples that have been quoted here had in finding finance from abroad or elsewhere?  Will the Taoiseach agree that this whole area needs to be looked at in terms of encouraging and developing a film industry in this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but last Sunday I read an article in one of the British Sunday newspapers in relation to a recently produced British film, &ldquo;Henry V,&rdquo; that British support for its film industry was the worst in Europe.  That must mean we are not the worst anyway.  I should also like to point out to the Deputy that Australia is held up to us all as an example but the success of the Australian film industry is primarily due to a tax incentive based system of support.  We <Col N="1105" /> are on the right lines here in offering tax incentive investment support but, if any improvements can be made, I am perfectly prepared to listen to any suggestions and I am sure the Minister for Finance would listen sympathetically.</P>

      <P>In associating myself with the congratulations already rendered inside and outside the House in regard to this great achievement, I wish to draw the Taoiseach's attention to the description of the Irish film industry by Brenda Fricker last night as a cottage industry which leaves a lot to be desired.  In referring to Australia, will the Taoiseach agree that there is a need to show positive initiative on the part of the Government by setting up a film commission as has already been recommended by no less a person than Noel Pearson?  Will the Taoiseach offer some positive gesture today in relation to our great achievements last night?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>My Department have recently received a copy of the consultant report in question. The trustees are now preparing proposals on a revised management structure for the library in the light of that report and of a separate report they commissioned on artistic and professional aspects of the library.  When I receive these proposals, I will discuss them with the trustees with a view to ensuring that a management structure satisfactory to the trustees and the Government is established in the library.</P>
      <P>I welcome the actions being taken by the trustees which reflect their concern to develop the full potential of the library in view of the world importance of its unique collections.</P>
      <P>I have already, on 6 December last in reply to parliamentary questions, emphasised the independent status of the trustees and my belief that the terms of Sir Chester Beatty's will in that regard must be scrupulously observed.</P>

Will he indicate whether it has been transmitted with the agreement of the trustees to co-operate in negotiation <Col N="1108" /> with the Taoiseach's Department in regard to any changes that might be suggested by him or his officials for the future development and management of the library?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not want to interrupt the legal cross-examination.  As a result of the resolution of the problem which existed between the director of the library and the trustees, which involved a contribution from the Department of the Taoiseach, was the substantial sum of money given over three years conditional on certain levels of co-operation between the trustees of the library on the one hand and the Department of the Taoiseach on the other in the light of the recommendations of the consultants' report?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that an arrangement was arrived at between the former director of the library and the trustees and that the dispute has now been amicably resolved.  It involved, among other things, the Department of the Taoiseach making a financial contribution above and beyond the normal sum which the Taoiseach's Department give to the library.  Do I understand that the Taoiseach's Department, in consideration of this contribution which was <Col N="1109" /> made to resolve the personnel dispute and the trustees of this library, with its unique and significant collection, have agreed in principle to implement the recommendations of the consultants' report to which Deputy McCartan's question referred?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that a lot of concern has been expressed in academic and other circles about the way in which this unique collection &mdash; and the library which houses it &mdash; has been operated over the last number of years?  Certain difficulties in the operation of the library were contained within the present structure of the deed of trust which was set up a long time ago.  It is in the interest of everybody &mdash; particularly the citizens of this country &mdash; that those difficulties in the deed of trust should be resolved and the Taoiseach's Department have a particular role to play&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I gather it is going to take at least a month to get the answers to these questions.  Would the Taoiseach not agree that what we are seeing now is a process of non-government by long-fingering issues to committees?  Is the Taoiseach aware, for example, that 23 committees are currrently due to report at some time in the future in the Department of Health, that there are several committees due to make reports to the Department of the Environment, that there are at least two committees that are due to report to the Department of <Col N="1111" /> Labour, and that that is the case in Department after Department?

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Labour I have had numerous meetings with representatives of the staff in Great Southern Hotels, the most recent of which was on 1 February.  At all these meetings I have clearly stated that my primary concern is to secure the long-term future of the group and its employees.</P>
      <P>With the commitment and effort of all those involved &mdash; the board, management and staff &mdash; the group has now reached the stage where a substantial capital injection is needed to maintain its commercial momentum, to increase profitability and to enable it to make its full contribution to tourist development. This, in turn, should help to maintain and increase employment and to provide a solid basis for further growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While retained profits can be a partial source of funding they are not sufficient to provide the necessary capital to carry through the board's proposed development programme.  Thus, other avenues have to be explored.  The board has put forward certain proposals and I am considering them at the moment.  As I stated in this House on 8 February, there are several possible options such as joint venture or Stock Exchange flotation &mdash; each <Col N="1123" /> with its own particular merits.  I am looking at all possibilities.</P>
    <P>I am on record as saying that we shall do all we can to hold the group in majority State ownership.  I have explained the position in detail to the staff representatives and others concerned.</P>
    <P>I am also on record as saying that my plans for the group will be entirely in accordance with the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the Programme for Government.</P>
    <P>I hope to be in a position to put proposals to the Government shortly which will be in accordance with the assurances I have given to the staff representatives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reminded of the reply given by a previous Government to a question on the Great Southern Hotels Group which was that they felt obliged to privatise it because it was running up losses, but now that it has returned to profitability and making a major contribution to the tourism industry, apparently that is being reconsidered.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither is true.  The group has been turned around from a loss making position.  This was achieved through the investment of £16 million of taxpayers' money by the previous Government to save the hotels.  The <Col N="1124" /> board have drawn up a development programme the final cost of which has not been notified to me, but it will be well in excess of £10 million.  The Deputy seems to be indicating that he is in favour of development but we either forget about that, putting jobs in jeopardy and letting buildings, which are old, decline, or we look elsewhere for money.  The Department of Finance have made it clear that they do not have another £16 million to give the group and have suggested that we look elsewhere.  I am considering this option which is totally in line with the aim of developing State enterprises and increasing employment in them.  In fact, it would be irresponsible of me if I did nothing, which is what the Deputy seems to be indicating.</P>

Will he give an undertaking to the House today that the majority share-holding in this hotel group will not pass out of the State's hands?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me repeat what I <Col N="1125" /> said to this House on 8 February.  It is my intention in the proposals I will put to Government that the majority of shares, which as the Deputy is aware are lodged with CERT, will remain in the hands of the State.  The right thing to do is to seek additional funds elsewhere, which is in keeping with the policy of Congress, the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the Programme for Government, to try to ensure that the company will continue to make profits and is kept viable.  I am aware that a number of the hotels were sold for a song but it is debatable whether they would be as successful if they had remained in the hands of the group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The development of managers, including personnel managers, is the responsibility of top management. There has been considerable improvement in the standard of personnel management in recent times through the introduction of relevant third level courses and the development of professional programmes by the Institute of Personnel Management in Ireland.  For my own part, I have continually supported the work of the institute at all levels since I became Minister for Labour.  In so far as funds are concerned, the Government provide subvention to the IMI and the College of Industrial Relations and the third level system generally.</P>
      <P>As a general comment on the quality of Irish management, I would refer to the findings of the Advisory Committee on Management Training which I set up that over 50 per cent of the top 1,000 companies spent less than £5,000 per year on management development.  Foreign owned companies were found to have spent on average 50 per cent more than Irish owned companies.  There is a lack of commitment to management development and it is the job of management itself &mdash; particularly top management &mdash; to rectify this situation.  I will continue to provide support to professional bodies with the brief of improving the quality of Irish management such as the Institute of Personnel Management and the Irish Management Institute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that in companies where there are frequent disputes it is almost always the case that there is bad management?  Furthermore, would he not agree that when a dispute arises we, as a society, tend to automatically blame the trade unions <Col N="1127" /> when frequently the blame rests with the other side?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my experience both inside and outside the House that this is so.  Files on industrial relations disputes never seem to leave my desk as one dispute seems to be followed by another and often the blame rests on management. The figures show that half of the top 1,000 managements spend more on morning newspapers than they do on management development.  This is one of the reasons I set up the Advisory Committee on Management Training in 1987 who reported, the Galvin report, last year.</P>
      <P>I have endeavoured in conjunction with other Government Departments, semi-State organisations, the IMI and the IPM, to implement the findings of that report.  This is a long process but it would be well worth the time of any management to try to implement its findings. The committee set down in great detail how many of the difficulties mentioned by the Deputy could be overcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not too sure how one could do it by way of legislation but I should point out that the advisory committee was made up of senior managers and they produced a report about themselves. The chairman, Paddy Galvin, is one of the most senior managers in the country and previously was involved with Waterford Glass and Guinness Ireland. He is a very successful person but he was scathing in his remarks and views on management.  I have been around the country highlighting the contents and conclusions of this report and making sure that they are known to the various employer organisations.  I will continue to pursue this matter.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>The present industrial dispute in my Department has arisen out of disagreement between my Department and the Civil and Public Service Union over the union's demands for the filling of a substantial number of posts in my Department.</P>
      <P>The Department have met with union officials on a number of occasions and have made a number of offers to the union in order to resolve the dispute. These offers have been rejected by the union.</P>
      <P>Subject to overall staffing policy and within current public expenditure constraints, I am continuing my efforts towards resolving the dispute.  The Deputies will appreciate that it would be inappropriate to go into further details or to comment further at this time, as mettings are still taking place.</P>
      <P>The industrial action undertaken by CPSU members comprised a ban on telephone contacts with the public and nonperformance of certain duties normally undertaken by these staff.  The difficulties created related mainly to telephone inquiries, delays in postal communications and issue of payments, I regret the inconvenience to the public caused by this industrial dispute.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 24, 40, 67, 68 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>In the Industrial Relations Bill, 1989, now before the House, I have attempted to take account of the all-out picketing policy of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The issue was once again raised during Second Stage reading of the Bill and I am giving the matter further consideration.</P>
      <P>As regards inter-union disputes, poaching and demarcation, the ICTU have established rules and machinery to deal with these issues which I feel work well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that in the past decade the most troublesome disputes were those where there was at least one non-Congress union involved?  Will he agree that there is a need for some mechanism to provide for inter-union disputes or disputes with employers which have an inter-union dimension?  They are covered adequately when the unions are members of Congress but are not when one union involved is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>If I understand the <Col N="1132" /> Deputy correctly he is saying that the mechanisms that Congress have, such as the industrial disputes committee, the demarcation tribunal and so on, are fine for Congress unions but are not for non-affiliated unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that Congress have no obligation for non-affiliated unions and that that is one of the key problems in industrial relations?  Will the Minister agree that non-Congress unions where they are involved are not subject to any demarcation committee or any disputes procedure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will look at that issue. I should like to remind the Deputy that the definition of a trade dispute has been amended in the Bill before the House to exclude workers versus workers disputes and that will help.  I accept that we have always allowed the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to deal with the other matters and that where there are non-Congress unions it raises a difficulty but I will have a look at that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister as surprised as I am that judging from the number of questions it is obvious that many members read my Second Stage speech?  Does the Minister agree that the all-out picket would be in jeopardy if the Bill is enacted in its present form?  Does he agree that it will make a major contribution to ordering industrial disputes? Does he agree that it may not now be necessary to consider the balloting provision to apply only in respect of workers involved in the primary strike?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, not to take in any way from his lengthy and excellent Second Stage speech, that we have spent many months talking about this issue at official level and with representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and of employers.  Yes, there is no doubt about it but that the all-out picket policy which was born out of the maintenance strike in February 1969 has worked extremely <Col N="1133" /> well and we are very anxious that whatever we have in section 14 does not in any way break that.  We are examining this issue following the contributions of Deputy Rabbitte and other Deputies to see what we can do.  From what the Deputy said it appears to me that the idea of dropping section 14 altogether would be wrong because the practice of having a ballot prior to a strike is one that all Members who contributed to the recent debate are in favour of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the kernel of the problem is missed by the provision in the Industrial Relations Bill?  Will he agree that there is not a real problem where Congress unions are involved because of the very effective procedures within that body such as the inter-union consultations, the all-out picket procedures and so on?  Will the Minister accept that the problem really lies where there is one union outside Congress?  There is not a mechanism to decide who should or should not ballot, who should or should not be consulted and who should or should not be granted an all-out picket.  Will the Minister, therefore, not seek to bring forward amendments to his Bill to make the same provision for all unions as the existing Congress provisions make for their unions?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have stated, I will have a look at that provision but the matter is not as simple as the Deputy makes out.  It is not just an issue of whether the unions are affiliated to Congress. In section 14 we are talking about everybody requiring a ballot but that would not apply in all cases, regardless of whether a union is affiliated to Congress. However, I undertake to have a look at the point made by the Deputy about Congress procedures, demarcation disputes and inter-union disputes.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for his reply.  Does he accept that people who are long-term unemployed have become so demoralised that there is now an unemployment culture? Will he agree that as a result some of the aspects he has raised seem very academic to them?  Does the draft resolution the Minister referred to propose to address in any practical way that demoralisation and debilitation of people who have been out of work for more than one year, and in many cases five years and more?</P>

      <P>We are attempting in our resolution to take the black spots that the Deputy has referred to, where there is a lack of morale, and try to tackle the unemployment problems in them in a different way by using the statutory agencies, the educational institutions, the voluntary bodies and so on.  It is our intention to help to fund them in their efforts to attack the root causes of unemployment in those black spots.  In our resolution we propose a range of measures and we are asking the Department of Finance to have a number of pilot schemes throughout the member states using the ERGO and LEDA programmes to tackle unemployment.  Apart from all the other schemes envisaged this is in an attempt to tackle unemployment in the black spots.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider abolishing the upper age limit as a special initiative, thus taking into account the plight of people who have been made redundant and who are now over the age of 50 years?  That could be done rightaway in Government Departments. If there is a vacancy in any Government Department, people who have worked for the greater part of their lives find that they are ruled out, simply because they are over the age of 50. There is no justification for having an upper age limit in the present climate, and would the Minister be prepared to give some consideration to this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is a slightly different question but let me say that the age limit does not apply except where there are superannuation regulations. Ancillary staff members, in certain grades, are not affected.  It is only where there is a superannuation scheme that the age bar of 25, 26 and 27 applies in different categories.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure there are ways and means of addressing this issue. If superannuation is the only reason the matter could be resolved by changing the pension code.  If we want to wipe out <Col N="1137" /> unemployment we must protect the jobs we have.  The redundancy payment scheme was very good initially but eventually it became a means of shedding jobs.  The time is now ripe to have a second look at the redundancy payments scheme as at present constituted.</P>

      <Quest>in view of the findings of the major FÁS report, published in January 1989, that Irish firms will have to provide more training for employees if their companies are to survive and thrive after 1992, the steps he intends to take to improve the level of training in Irish firms; if these firms will be required to make a more significant financial contribution towards such training; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are very conscious of the need to ensure that Irish industry is properly equipped to meet the challenge which will be presented through the opening up of the EC Internal Market in 1992.</P>
      <P>Continuing training for those at work is essential if workers are to be able to keep up with changes in skill requirements and other technologial developments. Employers and employees alike must become more aware of the importance of training.</P>
      <P>The Government have, at my request, allocated £4 million approximately to FÁS in 1990 for an industrial restructuring training programme to be directed at those in employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme is designed to help industry prepare for 1992.  In the context of the programme, FÁS plans to enable employees to avail themselves of training under a wide range of headings.  While <Col N="1138" /> FÁS will part fund the training costs of firms availing themselves of the programme, firms will also have to bear significant costs, both in actual training expenses and more generally in respect of the wage costs of their employees. Government policy has always been, and continues to be, that the prime responsibility for employee training rests with firms and that, accordingly, they must bear the main costs.</P>
    <P>As President of the Council of Social Affairs Ministers, it is my intention that a community action programme on continuing vocational training will be adopted at the Council meeting in May. The aim of the programme is to support and complement the policies and activities of the member states in the area of continuing vocational training and to involve all those concerned such as employers, employees and public authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that notwithstanding what he has said that the thrust of the FÁS report is that we compare very poorly in this area with other member countries of the EC? Would he agree that this absence of suitable training facilities and lack of emphasis on the need for training is one of the serious impediments to competitiveness in the context of 1992 and, indeed, one of the greatest impediments to this economy becoming a highly paid economy with sustainable productive jobs?  Would he be prepared to comment on the specific proposals made to him by the CII in this context?</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B Ahern Mr. B Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Briefly, I should like to say that is why we have started an industrial restructuring training programme for employees apart from about £35 million from the Exchequer and about £60 million from European social funds that is already being spent on training. I hope that the FÁS will put several thousands workers through their training schemes.  The present restructuring training programme is in conjunction with CII.  The views of the CII and the FIE will be taken into account in our plans.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason we are out of line with some countries &mdash; not all countries &mdash; in the EC is that employers have tended to put far more money into training.  Under the industrial restructuring training programme they will also be obliged to pay the people involved while they are on training and also to pay some of the costs towards maintaining training schemes.  The Government have, for their part, allocated £4 million.</P>

You, Sir, disallowed the question on the basis, and I quote &ldquo;The Taoiseach has no official responsibility to the Dáil in relation to this matter which is one for the House itself&rdquo;.  I find that extraordinary because long custom and practice has it that it is, in fact, the Taoiseach who proposes the date of the Adjournment and the date on which the <Col N="1222" /> Dáil shall reassemble.  I wish to have this information because my impression over the past few weeks has been that the Government are contemplating having a recess for the month of April, sitting in May, having a further recess for the whole month of June and then sitting in July.  Both of these proposals are absolutely outrageous.  I ask you, Sir, to reconsider the issue and allow me to put that question to the Taoiseach because it is a matter of some interest to the House.

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Resolution of the Dáil of 7th November, 1989, relating to Questions nominated for priority is hereby amended by the substitution of `until the adjournment of the Dáil for the Summer Recess' for `until the adjournment of the Dáil for the Easter Recess'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The motions before the House today continue, up to the summer recess, the arrangements for priority questions and Private Members' Business which were agreed by the Dáil on 7 November last, having been previously recommended by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
      <P>On that occasion, I outlined the Government's position on the matter. Basically, our view is that while the arrangements for priority questions and Private Members Business are primarily the concern of the Opposition parties and the Government have no direct input into them, we support the present arrangements on the basis that they are the fairest to all sides of the House.  In deciding our stance, we have taken account of the wishes of the vast majority of Deputies, as well as the deliberations of the Committee on Procedures and Privileges.</P>
      <P>We recognise that these arrangements do not have the unanimous support of all the Opposition parties.  Last November, when the original motions were being debated, the Leader of The Workers' Party suggested that the other parties were conspiring to change the rules so as to exclude his party from priority question time.  I must reject emphatically this suggestion as it implies that the Government would tolerate a situation which is blatantly unfair.  The Government support the present arrangements because we deem them to be the fairest way of allocating priority questions and Private Members' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1238" /> The Workers' Party must realise that they do not have the numerical strength of the other Opposition parties and as such they cannot reasonably expect to have the same status as them when it comes to the allocation of Dáil time.  The concept of proportionality has always been central to the organisation and arrangement of Dáil business.  I am sure that, despite their protestations, The Workers' Party recognise and accept this fact.</P>
    <P>When these motions were being debated last November, the Labour Party Chief Whip suggested that the Government were somehow responsible for the rancour and disagreement between the Opposition parties over this issue.  This was because we would not agree to his party's proposal to extend Question Time to allow an extra priority question to be taken each day.  At the time, I said that I did not feel that this was justified.  Since then, I have been looking at how the Opposition parties have been exercising their rights in relation to the putting down of priority questions and the statistics are quite revealing.  In the current Dáil session, there have been 23 occasions on which the Opposition parties have had an opportunity to put down priority questions. On only 11 of these occasions did the combined Opposition put down their full complement of five questions. indeed, on 1 March last &mdash; at a time when the Opposition were pressing the Government for more Dáil time to debate the health services &mdash; amazingly, they only put down one priority question to the Minister for Health for answer on that day.</P>
    <P>I will leave it to the Opposition parties to debate among themselves as to how that situation arose.  I merely mentioned it to point out &mdash; as I did last November &mdash; that the extension of Question Time is not the solution to the problem.  In my opinion, the main obstacle to agreement on the matter is the unwillingness of the three Opposition parties to adopt a constructive and co-operative approach to the issue.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would just like to say <Col N="1239" /> that the Government support the continuation of the existing arrangements for priority questions and Private Members' Business on the basis that they uphold the long established principle of proportionality, they are supported by the vast majority of Deputies and they have the approval of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  If the Opposition parties decide at some later date to agree on a different arrangement, within the existing question time framework, the Government would naturally be delighted to support any such proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The arrangement being put in place by this motion has been thrashed out both publicly and in the House before.  Thankfully the Opposition parties have some small scope within the rules and strictures of the House for personal or private initiatives.  Private Members' time is the main vehicle for this, albeit a mere three hours each week. We must, therefore, put in place some agreed arrangement for the allocation of this small but significant facility.  As the Minister of State rightly said, it is primarily a matter for resolution among the Opposition parties.</P>
      <P>I want to emphasise that when this matter came before the House last November every possible option was looked at.  The only matter that could not be resolved was who got what amount of time.  At the end of the day we had to have recourse to the numerical strength of the parties.  Fine Gael have 55 seats, the Labour Party have 15 seats and The Workers' Party have 7 seats.  Fine Gael therefore have two and a half times the combined numerical strength of the other two parties &mdash; 55 as against 22.  The Labour Party have more than double the number of seats held by The Workers' Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Working on the basis of 77 combined Opposition seats, Fine Gael are entitled to five out of every seven Private Members' debates, and Labour are entitled to twice The Workers' Party's entitlement.  While The Workers' Party <Col N="1240" /> may, as the Minister of State said, protest, that they should be entitled to more, I have not heard one valid, cogent argument to justify that.  Of course, every party would like to have a bigger slice of the action, but at the end of the day it has to be decided by the numerical strength of the parties or proportional representation.</P>
    <P>On the issue of priority questions, Fine Gael sought vainly to accommodate all sides.  There are five priority questions each day.  Fine Gael with the other two parties tried to prevail on the Government to increase this to six by which one would have to concede three additional minutes of Government time to Question Time.  The breakdown of that arrangement would mean that Fine Gael would be prepared to have three questions, the Labour Party two and The Workers' Party one.  This, however, did not meet with the agreement of the Government and, finally, we had to revert to proportional representation or numerical strength of the parties.  This was the deciding factor.</P>
    <P>The formula, therefore, is to give each party their precise entitlement and any deviation from this disadvantages some other party.  When the numerical strength of The Workers' Party increases, then and only then will we be prepared to look at any rearrangement of the existing breakdown of both priority questions and Private Members' time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that we set the record straight on an issue like this, although we already decided on this matter some time ago.  The Opposition have very limited scope in relation to the organisation of this House to test the policy decisions of this Government.  A number of the institutions that operate in this House are archaic, are not in tune with modern democracy and should be reformed.  However, we have some functions here and Private Members' time and questions afford the Opposition the opportunity to test the attitudes and actions of the Government.  For that reason opportunities to have Private Members' discussions here or to table <Col N="1241" /> questions, particularly priority questions, are important for Opposition parties.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State made some disingenuous remarks at the outset about priority questions.  The one opportunity we in the Labour Party get on a daily basis to table a question is used on every occasion.  I concede to the Minister of State that on no occasion since this Dáil was convened did the Labour Party not table a priority question.  On occasion, unfortunately, the one question we are allowed is ruled out of order and the Order Paper would appear without a priority question.  That is causing great frustration to all the Opposition parties when questions we table are ruled out of order and there is no opportunity to submit another question.  Some questions are ruled out of order for reasons that need to be re-examined.  I would have brought in a breakdown of questions over the last six months had I known the Minister of State had such a keen interest in it.</P>
      <P>A huge proportion of ordinary questions, way out of alignment with our numerical strength in the House, have been tabled by the Labour Party, so anxious are we to keep the pressure on this Government.  The Minister of State mentioned a day when the Minister for Health had only one priority question, and that was tabled by me.  I tabled it in the name of Deputy Ferris because on the day the Minister was to answer questions I was in London in the company of the Minister of State present in the House on business related to the broadcasting of this House, as the Minister may well recall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are pressures on all of us to try to make the greatest possible impact on the business of this House.  The Labour Party have used our time very wisely in the past.  We have used Private Members' time to save the National and Social Services Board something I was very proud to do as Labour's spokesman on Health; we raised the haemophilia issue which ensured ultimately that a proper settlement was arrived at for those unfortunate people who contracted the HIV virus through contaminated blood.  It is <Col N="1242" /> important that we have the maximum input into this area.  Ultimately the only way to do that is by proportionality unless we can extend the time.</P>
    <P>I regret that the proposal I made on the last occasion to increase the number of priority questions to six &mdash; that would take only three minutes of Government time a day &mdash; was not accepted by the Government.  The Minister of State cannot come in here, wring his hands and say it is a matter for the Opposition when he had the opportunity to give representation to everybody on an equitable proportionate basis.  The Government refused to do that.</P>
    <P>More requests are coming in to us now. The Committee on Procedure and Privileges will tomorrow debate a request from An Comhchoiste don Ghaeilge to have more time for debating questions as Gaeilge sa Teach seo.  That is an important move that we must make and will require additional time.  That request came from all parties on that committee.</P>
    <P>There are many things that need to be looked at in relation to the reform of this House and making this House more answerable.  As far as the Labour Party are concerned, it is our objective and our practice, as the record shows, to bring as much pressure as possible to bear on this Government and on any other Government who will be sitting over there to advance the policies we espouse for a fairer society and we will use all the mechanisms this House affords to advance that aim.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose on behalf of The Workers' Party to oppose both motions.  I stated in November that I regarded the motions as an outrageous assault on the rights of The Workers' Party in this House and I continue to hold that view.  If the Minister reflects on it he will realise that this House has not always approached the allocation of priority questions or of Private Members' Business strictly on the basis of proportionality. That is only a recent innovation in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is probably no point going over all the details &mdash; indeed, I do not have <Col N="1243" /> the time to go over all the details I mentioned on the last occasion &mdash; but it has to be acknowledged, and we intend by way of challenging a vote on this to emphasise that we regard ourselves as being discriminated against by the weight of Deputies who belong to the other parties. What is of most concern to us is that, having been effectively robbed of our right to put down priority questions on particular days, we find that other parties frequently do not have their allocation of priority questions taken up.  I recognise that that can happen as a result of a question being ruled out of order, as Deputy Howlin points out, but it has to be pointed out that on more than ten days when priority questions were due to the Fine Gael Party, their full allocation was not used and on more than three days the allocation to the Labour Party was not used.</P>
    <P>It is also clear that there is a great deal of dissatisfaction among Deputies generally about how priority questions operate.  The original procedure for priority questions when they were introduced was that they would come at the end of Question Time, and this meant priority questions were sometimes taken into ordinary Question Time because they were linked to earlier questions.  In order to overcome that, priority questions were slotted in at the beginning of Question Time.  The effect of that is that Deputies who do not have the access to priority questions &mdash; most of the Deputies of this House &mdash; now find their ordinary questions for oral reply taken during priority questions with no opportunity for them to ask the Minister supplementaries. While that may be all right for Deputies who belong to a party who already have the related priority question tabled, those of us who do not belong to those parties are frustrated because we are not able to press the Minister on issues which perhaps will not be raised for a variety of reasons by the party who have the priority questions.  There is a need for a full review of the operation of the priority questions system in the light of the dissatisfaction to which I have <Col N="1244" /> referred.  Part of the solution could be to increase the time available for Question Time generally, giving more time to priority and ordinary questions.</P>
    <P>I have not done a specific count but I am quite certain &mdash; judging by the Order Paper &mdash; that the number of Dáil questions tabled for oral answer has increased enormously in recent years, certainly during the last year.  However, there has not been a proportionate increase in the parliamentary time allocated for the questions.  Given that it is virtually the only opportunity Deputies have to put direct questions to the Minister and having an expectation of a direct answer, it is clear that there is a need for a fresh look at that area.</P>
    <P>We want to restate our position on the question of Private Members' time. When the original motion went through the Dáil in November we expressed the view that account has to be taken of party size when allocating time for Private Members' Business but what is being done here is clearly aimed at putting The Workers' Party at a disadvantage.  For instance, today is the first time in nine years that The Workers' Party had the opportunity to move a Private Members' motion in the House.  I accept that because we were a party of fewer than seven Members our right to do so only occurred last June but we had to wait roughly nine months for the opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>The effect of the motion today in extending the present procedure will be that a new rota, on which we come tenth on the list, will start when the summer recess is over so, effectively, the likelihood is that we will not get another slot in Private Members' time until around this time next year.  Regardless of arguments about proportionality it is hardly fair to claim that a party of seven Deputies may only have access to Private Members' Business once each year.  It is hardly a proportionate way of allocating time.</P>
    <P>We are opposing both motions today. The democratic procedures of this House are being threatened and thwarted by what are effectively administrative <Col N="1245" /> procedures introduced in order to restrict our access.  I do not believe that this kind of activity reflects any credit on Government or Opposition parties involved in this affair.</P>

      <P>I consider the regulations, their status and how they will be dealt with by this House subsequent to the Bill being passed into law the central and most important issue to be considered by the House.  The Workers' Party sought to insert an amendment of a new section after section 1.  The Ceann Comhairle ruled &mdash; and I am bound by that ruling &mdash; that we must put our amendments with regard to the regulations on section 7 because that is the structure of the Bill. However, I was advised by the Ceann Comhairle's office and I am now seeking to move, in accordance with Standing Order 96, that we take that section first and deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The importance of doing this is that it would throw a greater light on the whole debate and deliberation on this Bill.  We <Col N="1247" /> would be to some degree, for the purposes of debate, putting the cart before the horse if we were to leave to the end of this legislation the issue of the regulations and how they are to be dealt with.  There is also the risk, in a debate that is proposed to be guillotined tomorrow evening, that we might not reach discussion on the regulations.  Therefore I ask that the House agree to the proposition that we debate the regulations first.  We would then know in what context we are debating the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The central issue here is whether or not the regulations, once agreed in discussion with the bodies, as have been referred to by the Minister in winding up Second Stage, will come back to this House and whether there will be a positive resolution in the House before they are passed into law.  In other words, the issue is whether this House will have the opportunity to debate in fuller detail the importance of these regulations and what they represent. I hope the Minister will agree that we take the regulations first.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy McCartan on this matter.  It is important at this stage to continue with the very conciliatory approach taken by the Minister on Second Stage.  In order to do so it is necessary to deal with the most relevant section first, section 7, which deals with the regulations.  The amendments put down by the Opposition refer to the core of the Bill.  It is important that we get support for the Bill from the members of the Defence Forces so that we can all move together to resolve the other aspects of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy McCartan referred earlier to the time factor.  The eye message I get from the Minister for Defence is that he does not seem to have any strenuous objections to what was proposed by Deputy McCartan. Perhaps we could save time by inviting the Minister to comment on it, and if he agrees, we could then proceed to do what <Col N="1248" /> is proposed in Deputy McCartan's motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We start with section 7.  Amendment No. 32 is in the name of Deputy Nealon; Amendment No. 33 is in the name of Deputy McCartan and amendment No. 34 is in the name of Deputy Ryan.  Amendment No. 33 is similar to amendment No. 32, and amendment No. 34 is an alternative. It is proposed therefore, for discussion purposes to take the three amendments together.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 32:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 7, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;7.&mdash;Every regulation proposed to be made under this Act shall be laid, in draft, before each House of the Oireachtas and shall not be made until it has been approved by each such House.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 7 is very much a negative version as far as the presentation of regulations to the Dáil is concerned.  Contrary to my wishes &mdash; and that may be the way it will work out if the Minister does not agree to some of the positive amendments I have tabled &mdash; most of the new structures for the establishment of associations will be governed by regulations as distinct from legislation passed by the Dáil. Therefore the regulations section will turn out to be extremely important.  As envisaged in section 7 of the present Bill, we will not have the opportunity to discuss or to debate the regulations in this House and, of course, we will have no opportunity to all to amend them.  My amendment reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every regulation proposed to be made under this Act shall be laid, in <Col N="1249" /> draft, before each House of the Oireachtas and shall not be made until it has been approved by each such House.</P>
    <P>In other words, this is a positive amendment which would enable debate to take place and will enable all the regulations to be teased out in the House, as they should be, before they come into operation. It is by no means satisfactory and it is not what I would like to see because, as I have indicated in my earlier amendments, many of the more important provisions should be incorporated in the legislation.  I hope the Minister, in his new found sense of conciliation, will be able to accept some of these amendments which embody the main provisions of the legislation and that the regulations, while still very important, will become less important than they are at this stage.</P>
    <P>If the Minister does not accept the amendments, then virtually everything will be covered by regulations, but I would like whatever remains to be covered by regulations to have to come before this House, and subsequently before the Seanad, so that they will be fully debated and discussed.  I know it will not be possible to table amendments but at least the Minister would be accountable to the House if the regulations came before us.  That would be much more satisfactory and would result in a much better association and a greater feeling of confidence that the appropriate association would be set up.</P>
    <P>As the Chief of Staff said, this is an historic progression as far as the Defence Forces are concerned.  I think the Minister should be willing to accept my amendments or the amendments in the names of Deputies McCartan and Ryan, which are similar, but the detail is spelled out more elaborately in Deputy Ryan's amendment.  One way or another, it is imperative that the regulations should come before this House and that they should not automatically become reality before being discussed by the most important House in the land.  The Minister has introduced these regulations in such a way as to by-pass this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak on behalf of The Workers' Party in support of amendment No. 33, which is similar in all respects to the amendment tabled by Deputy Nealon on behalf of the Fine Gael Party.  The purpose of the amendments clearly is to ensure that, once consultation has taken place and the officials in the drafting section have laid down the regulations, this House and the Seanad will have the opportunity to debate, discuss and give their support for whatever will ultimately be put in place.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Labour Party amendment in the name of Deputy Ryan, I have no difficulty with it either.  I recognise that undertakings were written into the record of the House at the conclusion of the Second Stage debate that the representative groups will be consulted and that agreement will be reached with them on the eventual structures and regulations once we have passed this legislation. To borrow the Minister's words on the earlier stage, &ldquo;....the Oireachtas must be supreme and that the Legislature must stand first and foremost on the issue&rdquo;.  I could not agree more with him in laying the legislation before the House and ensuring that the legislation ultimately will be in all respects acceptable.</P>
      <P>The Bill is described as enabling legislation and I understand that is meant that the regulations will put the flesh on the organisations to be established.  Borrowing from the Minister's first proposition that the Oireachtas and the Legislature must be supreme in this development, we say that we should have the opportunity to debate and discuss them in this House.</P>
      <P>I propose to deal with what I anticipate will be the two points that, from my gleaning of the Second Stage debate, will be advanced by the Minister &mdash; if there has not been some eye contact that we are in agreement at this stage.  I assume by your silence, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that you have not received optical or telegraphic communications.  I regret to say that that bodes poorly for our debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the kernel issue and I thank the Minister for agreeing to debate it first.  If <Col N="1251" /> the Minister is not agreeing to accepting the unanimous request of the Opposition, I anticipate that the first argument he will put forward is that he is legislating for the Defence Forces in exactly the same way as was done for the Garda Síochána in the 1977 Act.  That is the first myth I wish to address in advancing the reasons that things should be different for the Defence Forces.  I accept that the Garda Síochána Act, 1977, provided for the negative form of resolution.  Section 2 of that Act says that the regulations will come before the House and that it will be a matter for a motion to annul the order within 21 days.  That Act was amended with a new subsection (4) being inserted in section 2.</P>
    <P>However the circumstances which prevailed in 1977 with regard to the Garda Síochána and which exist today in 1990 with regard to the Defence Forces are vastly different.  In introducing the 1977 Act Deputy Collins, who was then Minister for Justice and is now Minister for Foreign Affairs, had this to say and I quote from column 1109, volume 300 of the Official Report of 25 October 1977:</P>
    <P>This is in essence an agreed measure in that it proposes to implement policy decisions taken by the previous Government to which I and my colleagues in the present Government fully subscribe.</P>
    <P>Let me point out that it was the Coalition Government who passed out of Government in 1977 that drafted and advanced this Bill.  As we know, there was a general election in that year and Deputy Collins when appointed Minister for Justice on the coming into office of the new Government brought before the House legislation originally agreed on and cobbled together by the Coalition Government. He presented that legislation on the basis that there was all-party agreement for it.  He acknowledged that there was no opposition to it or reservations being expressed by the Opposition who happened to be the instigators of that legislation. In relation to a second element of <Col N="1252" /> the agreement which existed at that time he had this to say:</P>
    <P>It is an agreed measure also in the sense that it reflects an agreement reached earlier this year with two of the Garda representative bodies following negotiations between the Department of Justice and the bodies initiated by my predecessor.</P>
    <P>Since 1924 there have been representative associations within the Garda Síochána; there are no such associations within the Defence Forces.  Therefore there are bodies available with whom the Minister can consult and negotiate.  The involvement of Deputies Kitt and Hillery was required in this matter on behalf of the Minister because there had been no negotiations, consultation or agreement up to the eleventh hour.  The matters which had to be considered with regard to the 1977 legislation are vastly different from those which have to be considered with regard to this Bill.  Let me quote Deputy Collins once more:</P>
    <P>As will be fairly clear to Deputies, the main purpose of the Bill is to make certain amendments in the existing law governing the establishment and functioning of the Garda Representative Bodies.  The amendments proposed are those which are necessary to enable effect to be given to an agreement with the Representative Body for Inspectors, Station Sergeants and Sergeants and the Representative Body for Guards.  That agreement, as I have said, was concluded during my predecessor's term of office, and I would like to pay tribute to the role which he played in bringing about the agreement.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence had no such accolades for the Opposition spokespersons on this occasion and this illustrates yet again the vastly different conditions prevailing then as against now.</P>
    <P>The next point of difference is encapsulated in that paragraph.  The 1977 Act merely amends, in a small though significant way, section 13 of the 1924 Garda <Col N="1253" /> Síochána Act, subsection (1) of which reads as follows:</P>
    <P>For the purpose of enabling the members of the Garda Síochána to consider and bring to the notice of the Commissioner and of the Minister matters affecting their welfare and efficiency other than questions of discipline and promotion affecting individuals, there shall be established, in accordance with regulations to be made under this Act, a representative body or bodies for all or any one or more of the ranks of the Garda Síochána below the rank of surgeon, consisting of representatives elected by the members of the ranks or rank represented from amongst their number in manner to be prescribed by the regulations aforesaid.</P>
    <P>One of the points missed and rarely mentioned in this debate is that since 1924 the members of the Garda Síochána have had the right to establish representative associations the importance of which within the Garda Síochána is very well illustrated in Conor Brady's book entitled <i>Guardians of the Peace</i>.  In the epilogue to that volume he outlines the role played by the representative associations and the degree to which they have been able to raise issues on behalf of their members. As Mr. Brady illustrates, following the debacle of the Macushla Ballroom in the mid-sixties they were brought very much to the forefront.  Under the stewardship of the General Secretary, Mr. Jack Marrinan, they were able to bring the Government often unwillingly to the negotiating table using go-slow tactics or the tactic of a dispute which no member of the Defence Forces could ever dream of.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Deputy, but it seems to me that he is making a rather wide-ranging speech far more appropriate to a Second Stage reading than to Committee Stage. I would much prefer if the Deputy applied his mind to the section before us and the amendments thereto, amendments Nos. 32, 33 and 34.  The Deputy <Col N="1254" /> is deviating and going into the Garda Síochána measures and all these things which seem to be quite inappropriate at this time.</P>

      <P>The Minister made the point on Second Stage that he was introducing legislation in relation to the Defence Forces similar to that introduced in relation to the Garda Síochána in 1977. I was merely trying to illustrate why I believe it is inappropriate to use that legislation as a precedent.  What I am saying in short is that the matters which had to be considered in 1977 when the Government decided to amend the regulations with regard to the Garda Síochána, in a small although significant way, are vastly different from those which have to be considered now.  It is correct to say that the regulations brought in were negative in the context of the form the Minister has proposed in this Bill but this is an argument which has no regard for the debate which took place or the conditions prevailing at that time.  In short, in 1977 there was agreement both inside and outside the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 34, tabled <Col N="1255" /> by me, on behalf of the Labour Party reads:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 7, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;7.  &mdash;(1)  Where the Minister proposes to make regulations under this Act subsection (2) shall apply.</P>
      <P>(2) (a)  The Minister shall consult&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  any existing association (or, if no association has been established under this Act, any other body established for the purpose of representing members of the Defence Forces which was in existence on the date of the passing of this Act), and</P>
      <P>(ii)  such other persons as he considers appropriate,</P>
      <P>concerning the matters which are the subject of the proposed regulations.</P>
      <P>(b)  A draft of the proposed regulations, together with a report by the Minister on any consultations held under paragraph (a), shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>(c)  The regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each House of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal with the merits or demerits of section 7.  This is the kernel of the issue.  I am happy that we had a coming together of the Minister and the members of the Defence Forces who joined PDFORRA and that following that meeting their position was recognised. I am pleased that we have had an agreement following a meeting between the representatives of PDFORRA and two Deputies on behalf of the Minister. It is worth reading into the record the statement which was issued after that meeting.  It was as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After an 11-hour meeting in Dublin with Government Deputies Hillery and Kitt the association agreed to suspend their forthcoming elections in order to facilitate discussions with Mr. Sexton to work out an agreed electoral <Col N="1256" /> procedure for their members.  Talks will include the structures under which members will be elected and the means whereby open and honest consultations can take place with all interested parties.  The association reserves the right at any time to proceed with their own elections should an accepted solution not be found in consultation with Mr. Sexton.  For the purpose of consultation the association will continue to operate as PDFORRA.</P>
    <P>I accept that great progress has been made since Deputy Lenihan was appointed Minister for Defence but notwithstanding that 8,000 members of the Defence Forces want a say in the preparation of the regulations.  I agree with Deputy McCartan that before the Macushla affair there was an established organisation who had an input into the preparation of regulations.  Members of the Defence Forces are asking why they should join an organisation if they do not have an input into the regulations that will govern it.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage the Minister gave a commitment to facilitate the views of the members of the Defence Forces.  He adopted a conciliatory approach.  The concerns that many people have can be solved by the Minister adopting our amendment to section 7.  Section 7 states:</P>
    <P>Every regulation made under this Act shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the regulation is passed by either such House within the next 21 days on which that House has sat after the regulation is laid before it, the regulation shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have accepted the views expressed during the Second Stage debate and amended that section accordingly. He told us he would deal on Committee Stage with the problems that were highlighted during that debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was anxious to highlight the fears of members of the Defence Forces and the failure of the Minister to introduce the amendments he promised. The Minister may say that there will be consultations and that members of the Defence Forces will be involved but it is important that that is written into the Bill.  I support the Fine Gael and The Workers' Party amendments, it is important to take them on board.  We have gone a little further in our amendment and there is no reason the Minister should not accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our amendment we are suggesting that the Minister shall consult any existing association, or, if no association has been established, any other body established for the purpose or representing members of the Defence Forces which was in existence on the date of the passing of the Bill.  The Minister has made a commitment that following the holding of elections he will engage in consultations and for that reason I do not know why he has any difficulty in accepting that part of our amendment.  We also suggest that the Minister shall consult such other persons as he considers appropriate.  There is nothing controversial in that.  We also suggest that a draft of the proposed regulations, together with a report by the Minister on any consultations, shall be laid before <Col N="1258" /> each House of the Oireachtas.  That is similar to a provision in the original section. We also suggest that the regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>There is a need to develop on the progress that has been made so far.  We must give members of the Defence Forces an opportunity to comment on the proposals contained in any documents that are published. I cannot think of any reason for not having that.  Furthermore, it should be incorporated into the Bill.  The Bill would then be much stronger and would meet the various needs and aspirations of the personnel of the Defence Forces.  I hope the Minister will take cognisance of what we are saying here.  If we can overcome this aspect and have the consultation provision written into the Bill, I have no doubt that the remaining provisions of the Bill could be passed very quickly and that, consequently, there would be great rejoicing in the Defence Forces.  I hope the Minister will look favourably on these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>My concern here is to ensure that we have real and meaningful discussions and consultations with the members of the Defence Forces who will have been duly elected by their fellow members in a representative capacity to act on their behalf and to incorporate into regulations the proposals agreed with them as to their future structures and the purposes of their association or associations.  Those regulations can then be placed before each House of the Oireachtas in accordance with section 7 of the Bill.  That is very clear and straightforward and it meets the wishes of the members of the Defence Forces for whom Deputies in this House purport to speak.  I want to emphasise that.  I am acting in the interests of PDFORRA or of any group within the Defence Forces or outside the Defence Forces who have a real interest in setting up appropriate structures, after an agreed form of election, that can be incorporated in the regulations. That is what I am doing.  It defies my comprehension as to how and why <Col N="1259" /> members of The Workers' Party, the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party should adopt an attitude here which, in fact, amounts to an impediment in the way of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have listened carefully to the Deputy so perhaps he would listen now to me.  What will be placed before each House of the Oireachtas in the way of regulations is what the elected representatives of the Defence Forces will have agreed on and are recommending and suggesting.  At this stage the Deputy is pre-empting their decision. The essence of what is proposed in the three amendments is a rejection of the idea of consultation with these representatives. I propose to have the fullest possible consultation and discussions with them and then to lay the agreed recommendations by way of regulations before each House of the Oireachtas as provided for in section 7.  That is the position which exists in regard to the equivalent section under the Garda Síochána legislation governing regulations.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCartan may say that the situation in 1977 was different from that of 1990.

We have reached a situation where a measure of agreement has been reached, where representatives of PDFORRA, other Army personnel representatives and so on now accept that a process of consultation is under way; it has already started.  In regard to the holding of elections very constructive progress has been made.  In accordance with my promise of last week, discussions with Mr. Tim Sexton, the principal officer in charge of the election procedures, have commenced in regard to the election, structures and matters relating to the election.  We have now embarked on a process of consultation.  Let us leave aside whatever disagreements we may have had until now.  The fact is that consultations are now on stream.  This House should be very careful in its whole approach to a matter that is now, thankfully, moving reasonably well.  I want to thank everybody in this House in that respect.  I thank the spokesmen on behalf of the three parties with whom I have had discussions, apart from the debates in the House, for adopting a constructive approach.  In this respect I pay tribute to Deputies Nealon, McCartan and Ryan and in particular to my two colleagues, Deputies Hillery and Tom Kitt.  As a result of their efforts and suggestions we now have a situation where the representatives of PDFORRA and other interested parties are now adopting a very constructive attitude towards this subject. Talks have commenced with the principal officer in the Department of the Environment in connection with the election procedures.  The amendments proposed would frustrate the progression of the constructive discussion I envisage.

      <P>I am asking Deputy McCartan not to do any damage.  I want to pay tribute to him for the constructive work he has done but let us not spoil it. It is a bonus to all of us in the Dáil that this matter is now proceeding step by step.  Let us acknowledge that.  This Dáil has a very real purpose in bringing in enabling legislation of this kind, that is where the primacy of the Dáil resides. Once the framework has been brought in, surely it is the wish of all of us that the detailed consultations, discussions and negotiations that will take place, and which will eventually be encompassed by regulations, should take place after the elections, which will be very soon.  It is the input on the part of the elected representatives of the Defence Forces personnel that will be the all important aspect of the regulations.  Why should we try to impose any solution on the Defence Forces personnel in regard to the representative structures?  That is for them to establish.  I am suggesting that this House can establish its primacy by bringing in the enabling legislation, by establishing the enabling legislation but also by making provision that the precise structures to be established under this legislation are such as will be reached in agreement with the personnel for the Defence Forces duly elected.  That is what I want to achieve.  Any attempt, such as envisaged in these three amendments, would frustrate that purpose.  It immediately casts doubt on the regulations that will have been agreed upon by consultation with the Defence Forces representatives.</P>

      <P>That is exactly my point. Then why does the Deputy need to have a debate here to interfere with the regulations? Is not the purpose of these amendments to have the draft regulations brought in here for full discussion and to be amended by us whereas what I want to achieve is that once the form of the regulations has been agreed on with the Defence Forces representatives, they then become the regulations?  Of course, they can be annulled under section 7 leaving the ultimate power with the Oireachtas.  Each of the three amendments suggests, that proposed regulations would be debated here in the House, regulations that would have been agreed upon with the representatives of the Defence Forces.</P>

What is the point in putting down these three amendments when they amount, in effect, to casting doubt, reflecting upon, wishing to have a debate upon, change, amend or reject regulations which have been agreed upon by the elected representatives of the Defence Forces?  This is the context in which we are talking.  I should like Deputy McCartan in particular who has an appreciation of what is in the Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy McCartan has an appreciation of what is in the Bill &mdash; sometimes I am at a loss to understand why people cannot argue this point home <Col N="1263" />&mdash; when he says that every matter of this kind should be looked at in the context of the particular time.  I am not talking about a situation where there is conflict. That was last week's, or last month's business.</P>
      <P>I am talking now in the context of where daily talks are taking place between the representatives of PDFORRA and Mr. Sexton on the arrangement of the election; we are reaching agreement in that area, there is absolute understanding.  The mistrust which was there and which was played upon by some members of the Opposition parties has been removed to a large extent &mdash; I want to thank Deputy Hillery and Deputy Kitt in this respect &mdash; and the representatives of PDFORRA are in consultation and regular touch with us already.  I am thankful to them for their trust in us and I am very grateful to them for the attitude they are adopting.  I want to pay tribute in this House and in public to the people who are acting as spokesmen for the military personnel at present. They are making the arrangement for the elections in a most constructive manner and they understand and appreciate exactly what I am saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us adjust our minds not to what happened last week or a month ago but to the present reality which I hope will develop constructively during the weeks ahead.  The regulations I will be laying before each House of the Oireachtas under section 7, amendments to which we are discussing at present, will be the regulations agreed upon by the representatives of the military personnel.  It is their regulations I will be laying before each House of the Oireachtas.  Each House of the Oireachtas will have the right under section 7, which is on all fours with a similar section in the Garda Síochána legislation, to annul such regulations and such an annulling resolution must be passed within 21 days.  This wording in section 7, is almost the same as the wording used in the section in the Garda Síochána legislation.  This type of wording is used in most forms of legislation <Col N="1264" /> and there is plenty of precedent for it in legislation down through the years.</P>
    <P>The regulations under section 7 will not be my regulations; they will be the regulations of the Defence Forces representatives who will have agreed to them with me.  As a final saver, the House can annul the regulations within 21 days if there is something really objectionable in them.  That is the procedure which will be followed and I cannot see any logic in the objections to proceeding along those lines.  For that reason, I must oppose the three amendments and ask the House to agree the section as it stands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>During the course of my Second Stage speech I appealed, not in any threatening way, for restraint in discussing this legislation because of the sensitivities involved and the obvious desire to encourage PDFORRA to come into the official machinery.  As the Minister has pointed out, the context has changed for the better during the past week or so, consultations are under way in the official direction, goodwill is clearly growing, and we should facilitate progress in that direction on the basis of accord.</P>
      <P>I want to echo what the Minister has said.  The very essence of this Bill in practice will be consultation, consensus and agreement.  The Minister is leading in his consensus approach and he is making every possible effort to show his goodwill. I can confirm that people genuinely believe he wants this legislation to work. The very essence of the Bill is that what is agreed will form the basis for progress. Therefore, the Army personnel must agree to what is proposed and have ownership of it.  This must take place long before the regulations are put before the House.  The best possible chance of the regulations working is to have the most detailed and honest discussions between the two sides and then agree the regulations. Then and only then will they appear before us as draft regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the draft regulations &mdash; and the Garda machinery is relevant in this regard &mdash; what is proposed here is identical to section 13 of the Garda Síochána Act, 1937.  Whatever about associations existing before that, as they did in the twenties, the reality is that the regulations as formulated under the Garda legislation would be identical to what is formulated here and they have stood the test of time.  They have proved entirely satisfactory to the Garda.  They have not, to my knowledge, sought change in the form of the regulations before the House.  That arises precisely because the most exhaustive discussion <Col N="1267" /> takes place before the draft regulations are actually put together.  The Minister has said again and again that every possible facility will be given by the Army personnel, the Minister and the official side to work out regulations which will actually work.  In concluding on Second Stage he said that he does not intend to activate the Act, as it then will be, until such exhaustive discussion and agreement has actually been achieved. Frankly, I fail to see the grounds for concern on the part of Opposition speakers about this, given the practice in the case of the Garda, given the goodwill that is now growing and given the essence of consultation and agreement that will in any case precede the laying of the draft regulations before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to answer some of the questions the Minister's contribution has raised.  This whole process leads, for the first time, to the establishment of a representative association within the Defence Forces.  It is not simply amending the terms of reference as was done in 1977 &mdash; I will come back to that in a moment for the benefit of Deputy Hillery &mdash; it is laying the ground for the establishment of representative associations within the Defence Forces.  What this House is asking for is no more than what the Minister himself suggested should be done.  Setting out the relevant article of the Constitution and referring to Aughey v Ireland and the views of the High Court the Minister said:</P>
      <P>The need to regulate the right&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>that is, the right to form associations</P>
      <P>applies, I suggest, <i>a fortiori</i> in the case of the armed forces of the country and there can be no question of allowing unregulated development.  This House has a particular responsibility in that connection since under the Constitution &mdash; Article 15.6.1 &mdash; the right to raise and maintain military or armed forces is vested exclusively in the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1268" /> Those words underline the importance of the unique role in regard to the institutions of the State that the Oireachtas plays with regard to the Defence Forces. The Minister went on to talk about control and regulation:</P>
    <P>This controlled and regulated system of the exercise of command and authority is fundamental to the raising and maintenance of a defence force in a democratic State.  We live in a Parliamentary democracy which implies that the armed forces are subject to civil control.</P>
    <P>I cannot put it any better than that.  We are talking about the establishment of institutions within the Defence Forces which will impact in some way upon the regulation and control of those forces for the future, and we are doing it for the first time.  We are breaking new ground entirely.  How then can there not be a role for this Parliament to play?  The purpose of our amendments is to ensure that once the negotiations and discussions have taken place the important role of the Oireachtas in that whole process will be taken into account and we will have the right to impose our seal of approval on the regulations once they are finalised. That is the Minister's own argument and we borrow it here in our defence of these amendments.</P>
    <P>We argue that the regulations should be brought before the House so that we can have the opportunity to debate them. The Minister's suggestion that any Member of the House can, within 21 days, have the opportunity to regulate something that is fundamentally wrong is irrelevant; there is no scope for Members to have any negative influence on the regulations because of the way in which Private Members' business is dealt with. On numerous occasions within the life of this Dáil, Deputies have asked the Government for time for such motions to be debated because Private Members' business could not be regulated to allow a group in.  There just is not the scope for us to move in the way that the Minister would hope we could.</P>
    <P>The point I made at length on Second <Col N="1269" /> Stage is that there is no trust on the part of the Defence Forces in what has been happening.  In advancing these amendments I am unequivocally advancing the demands of all 8,000 members of PDFORRA, because I have had the opportunity to meet with them and discuss these matters at length.  At our meeting in the Minister's office on 12 March last I put that proposition to the Minister as coming from them.  I will say no more about it at the moment as I do not proposed to embarrass the Minister on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a principle here.  The suggestion that we are not making the case of PDFORRA is not correct.  The reason they have adopted the position they have is because there was no consultation or negotiation until the eleventh hour.  As a Parliamentary legislator I would be derelict in my duties if I signed a blank cheque that enabled the Government to go away and later fill in the rest of that proposition.  I insist upon the right to come back here after the Minister's job has been done to look at the end product and decide whether it meets the wishes of the soldiers and the responsibilities that we as legislators have <i>vis-à-vis</i> the armed forces.  It is not, as the Minister has said, that we are showing a lack of confidence in the members of the Defence Forces.  That is a ridiculous suggestion when the Defence Forces themselves are asking us to ensure that we have the right to come back and debate these regulations so that there is contol or at least a safeguard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not.  No one <Col N="1270" /> would be happier than I if this matter could go through without disagreement arising in this House or elsewhere as to the detail of the structures to be put in place.  The reasons for the worry about the detail of the structures are contained in the document disseminated by the Chief of Staff entitled &ldquo;Permanent Defence Forces Representative Groups&rdquo;. That was the clear thinking of the Government up to the past two weeks. It was circulated under the hand of the Chief of Staff but it was acknowledged by the Minister in his Second Stage speech and in the correspondence from his office as representing at that time the thinking of the Government for the purposes of discussion.  This was as far as they had brought their ideas at that stage, without any consultation or discussion with the soldiers' representatives, even though since July 1989 they had written to the Minister on numerous occasions asking for his views and asking for a meeting.  There is a certain element of uneasiness and uncertainty about where the negotiations will go from here. The Minister is a very adept man and a Government with all their resources is a powerful force to deal with.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage, indications were given that the Minister was amenable to meeting us about the regulations.  The record did not suggest that the Minister was absolutely with us but he told Deputy Nealon to put down an amendment and that he would have a look at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>The record is there and I cannot make anything more of it than is stated in black and white.  There was in that gesture an indication that the Minister would be receptive to amendments. That is why we rushed to put in our amendments.  I made my first contribution in anticipation and I am very disappointed that we have not agreement on this vital element.  I am glad that we took the issue as a first stage because it throws into relief the other debates we will have on this Bill.  The Minister also <Col N="1271" /> suggested that in advancing this proposition we were pre-empting discussion and decision.  There could not be anything further from the truth.</P>
      <P>We would hope that this Bill would meet some of our desires and we wish the Minister well on his journey to meet representatives of the officers and other ranks.  We would wish him to come back here with a package representing everything the soldiers want which the Minister can accommodate.  Such a package would meet with the approval of this House and there would be no need for further debate.  There should be no suggestion that reserving for ourselves at the end of the negotiating process an opportunity to review, comment on and amend if necessary the regulations means that we are being in any way pre-emptive or seeking to curtail the negotiating or decision-making process.  That is not what we are about and I hope the Minister will not pursue that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made the final point that this is similar to the Garda Síochána legislation as introduced.  I have already dealt with this at length.  There is no comparison between what was happening in 1977 <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Garda Síochána and what is happening today.  For Deputy Hillery's benefit, if not for the benefit of the Minister, the 1977 Bill was amending the basic conditions of the terms of reference and powers of the representative associations of the gardaí.  It was doing by primary legislation what we are asking should be done for the Defence Forces at the end of the regulation stages.  In 1977 the powers of the Garda representative associations were extended from the 1924 Act which dealt with simple matters affecting their welfare and efficiency.  It was amended to provide in a wide ranging way for a different régime and new words were included.  It dealt with the right of associations to have external contacts and involvement.  It also dealth with ways in which the Minister would regulate.  Under the 1924 Act the decision on associations and unions was the decision of the Minister finally, <Col N="1272" /> without appeal, but the 1977 Act provided that those decisions in the form of regulations would have to come before the House and would be subject to the negative annulment of the House before they could pass into law.</P>

      <P>The 1977 Act went much further than the Deputy was leading this House to believe.  A different matter was being debated in a different context.  To draw a parallel is totally disingenous.</P>
      <P>The contributions we are seeking to make are constructive, seeking to put right something which is considered not adequate and not in accord with the desires of those for whom we are seeking to legislate.  I cut short my contribution on Second Stage because I believed Deputy Nealon had laid the ground for some constructive compromise.  I hope the Minister, having listened in more detail, will agree to reflect on this matter and come back to us on Report Stage. We cannot go on endlessly about this matter in view of the time constraints. Having put it as fully as I can with the help of other Deputies, I would urge the Minister to reflect on this matter and not to precipitate a division at this stage. The Minister should undertake to do this before Report Stage on Thursday in the context of the historic steps being taken. He should allow this House the opportunity at the conclusion of the entire process to reflect on and to debate again what he proposes to put in place.</P>

      <P>I have detected a degree of consensus being reached here, which I welcome.  It is important to repeat that Deputies opposite should absorb what the Minister has said, which is very significant. This is an enabling Bill and I do not want to see the matter complicated any further by suggestions that the regulations should come back to the House. Much activity is going on outside the House, initiated by the Minister.  Careful consultation is taking place.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ryan referred to Mr. Sexton and the discussions with Deputy Hillery and me.  The whole process is an open door, step-by-step, consultative approach and the discussions are going on at present with Mr. Sexton to work out an agreed electoral procedure for their members, including structures under which the members will be elected. That is step one.  The doors are open and they are being facilitated.  People are talking.  The atmosphere is changing.</P>
      <P>Another step we are talking about in relation to this amendment is very much in line with the whole process of democratic consultation where the elected representatives of the Defence Forces will talk to the Minister and his officials. It is a separate issue but it is progressing towards what I envisage as very successful legislation.  The Bill itself will not be put in place until there is agreement. I have been asked for a brief contribution. I ask the Deputies to get into their heads what the Minister is about.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCartan pointed to the right in relation to the Defence Forces that is vested in this Oireachtas.  He is correct, but surely the procedures that have been initiated by the Minister ensure full consultation on regulations.  Let us get the best set of regulations in place, bring them back, as Deputy McCartan said, to the Dáil and then we can deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McCartan referred to new ground.  He talked about a very historic stage in the history of the Defence <Col N="1274" /> Forces.  He is right.  It is new ground but so many positive things are happening that the whole atmosphere has changed. I, too, would like to pay tribute to the representatives of PDFORRA for the manner in which they have accepted the sense of co-operation.  It is all about trust and the Minister has initiated this process of trust.  I ask Deputies in the Opposition to fall in line &mdash; if I might use that analogy &mdash; with the spirit of trust that has been initiated by the Minister.  We are about something very important.  Nobody is being cautioned but let people understand what is being attempted.  It is all about democratic consultation.  Let us proceed on that basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>Like any cute lawyer, Deputy McCartan with a weak case seems to conjure up difficulties and smokescreens.  I listened very carefully to the language he used and at the outset he used very informative language.  I wrote it down.  He said: &ldquo;What we are speaking about is our right to impose our views&rdquo;. There is no doubt that we are in discussion as to the constitutional role of the Houses of the Oireachtas but our right to impose our views lies very hard beside the whole concept of consultation, conciliation and bringing people round.  We are not here about our right to ultimately impose our views.  I think one or two of the Deputies here listening to Deputy McCartan were a little shaken by those words too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have often wondered throughout this debate whether obduracy, innocent failure to comprehend or a wish to do mischief lay at the bottom of some of the contributions.  Let us have a look at precisely what the impact of the amendments would be.  The precise impact and effect of the amendments would be to provide that regulations should not be made until after they are approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  What is proposed here creates more inflexibility than any of the spokespersons here want to create.  As Deputy McCartan characterises it, it would result in an imposition on the 8,000 members of the Defence Forces.  That is precisely what we do not wish to do.  We <Col N="1275" /> do not want to create more difficulties in reaching agreement on this matter.  It is worth reflecting on yet again and repeating what we are about here.  This is enabling legislation.  It will ultimately lead to regulations, but those regulations will come here, as the Minister has said, after there has been agreement with a representative of the Army personnel.</P>
    <P>We are discussing here a group of amendments that will impose flexibility on that system, that will put a continued doubt there.  We have had smokescreens and doubts conjured up here, but the Minister has made it clear that the regulations will first be discussed with the elected representatives of the Army personnel. I cannot see Deputy Ryan or Deputy Nealon objecting to that.  I wonder a little at the wording used by Deputy McCartan.  Perhaps it was imprudent.  Perhaps I am being unfair to him, but those were the first words of the sentence I picked up.</P>
    <P>Common sense should surely prevail in this.  The Oireachtas does not want to pre-empt the input the Defence Force personnel in the drafting of the legislation. Surely that is not our purpose. Surely that is not what Fine Gael, the Labour Party or any other party in this House want to do.  The 8,000 people within the Defence Forces will elect their representatives.  They will have a say in the regulations.  When all are agreed the regulations will come before this House. That is the scenario the Minister is spelling out.  Surely that is entirely reasonable. The Houses of the Oireachtas have, as the Houses of the Oireachtas must always have, a right at the end of the day to review those regulations if there is something in them which is untoward, and I do not reckon that any political spokesperson would say they are a spokesperson for the Army personnel.  Members of all parties will then be able to reflect their political views on that.  The appropriate people to represent the Army personnel's views in these matters are not politicians in this House.  They are the elected representatives of the Army personnel.</P>
    <P>It strikes me that the case the Minister <Col N="1276" /> has outlined is entirely reasonable, one that should commend itself to any reasonable person.  I do not see the point of introducing inflexibility which would be the effect of these amendments.  A great deal has been achieved.  There are now the beginnings of goodwill and understanding. For goodness sake let us not throw up smokescreens which cloud that understanding and goodwill.  I cannot believe for a second that the Labour Party wish to pre-empt the rights of the Army personnel's elected representatives to have an initial and major input into these regulations.  They are the appropriate people to discuss these regulations, and that is the appropriate forum at which it should be discussed.  It should not be politicised, as it will be if we go the route the amendments propose.  I do not think the amendments have anything to commend them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I resent very much the fact that Deputy Roche seems to read into our amendment something that is not included in it.  At all stages we are talking about consultation which we want to facilitate between the Army personnel, the Minister and senior officials in the Army.  That is what we are seeking and have been seeking for the last four months.  This afternoon Deputy Kitt comes along and says there is a changed environment.  Of course there is and we are delighted that it is so, but we have been trying to move in this direction on this side of the House for the last three months and the Government have not listened to us.  They come in at the eleventh hour and acknowledge that what we stated consistently is what is required, an acknowledgment that 8,000 people out there had joined an organisation and were seeking recognition and involvement. PDFORRA said very clearly that there should be consultations if they were not happy with the way things were going.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister saying that conciliation and arbitration will be involved if there is not agreement?  It is very easy to say that but the elected representatives will not have the same power as the establishment in that regard.  What is wrong with accepting some of the amendments to the Bill?</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the regulations because they were the framework for discussion on Second Stage.  The Minister had a conciliatory approach to the points made by all sides of the House.  In his contribution on Second Stage Deputy McCartan said that the document and the covering letter from the Minister's office seemed to outline the Government's proposals for the establishment of a representative structure.  He said that he was happy they were a basis for discussion once they had a clear understanding that they could come back to the House to debate the proposals after consultations with the representatives of the soldiers in due course.  The Minister said that he would take that point on board.</P>
      <P>Deputy Nealon and I also referred to this matter on Second Stage because we wanted to be able to put it before the House.  Notwithstanding what the Minister said on 13 March, he is now saying that there is no necessity for these amendments. However, we feel we should be able to come back to the House and it is a safety valve which should be incorporated in the Bill.  Perhaps the Minister will reconsider some of these points with a view to implementing them on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>When I sat down I discovered the passage to which Deputy Ryan referred.  When I made the point that we should have the right of consultation in the House the Minister is <Col N="1278" /> clearly on the record as saying that he took the point.  The Minister and the Deputies behind him seem to be proceeding on the basis that there is general agreement between the Minister and the soldiers' representatives and that our job is done.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, the conclusion of the meeting with Deputies Kitt and Hillery referred to by the Minister was exactly the same conclusion which had been arrived at two weeks earlier when I met PDFORRA and I conveyed those conclusions to the Minister on 12 March. There was agreement to negotiate, consult, discuss and arrive at a formula.  That is all we have agreed to so far, we have not agreed on the structures themselves, how many representative bodies there will be, how they will be organised and funded, how they will exist <i>vis-à-vis</i> the chain of command and everything else that affects us.  There is a huge amount of matter and detail to be decided upon and there is strong evidence to suggest that there are very wide differences between what the other ranks want&mdash;&mdash;</P>

For that reason this House must and should reserve to itself the right and opportunity to review what will be long and difficult negotiations.  That must be said in case anyone might believe that the Minister will hand over for the asking to the soldiers and their representatives what they are looking for, which I do not believe is the case.</P>

      <P>We are making a very constructive effort in this regard.  I am delighted to report that over the last seven days there has been great appreciation of these efforts by members of the Defence Forces and, since the meeting between the two Deputies behind me <Col N="1279" /> with the representatives of the association one week ago, the atmosphere has improved dramatically.</P>
      <P>They are now taking at face value all the matters to which I referred on Second Stage regarding the basis of the mandate and the objectives of the Defence Forces associations, including their own will as to how they should be structured and whether there should be one association for other ranks and NCOs and another for officers.  Matters in regard to their financing, a mandate to talk to the media, the whole range of welfare services in which they are interested and the provision of conciliation and arbitration must be agreed on.  These matters form the main part of a number of amendments which have been tabled and which should have been taken before these amendments. I agreed to take these amendments first in order to be constructive but now the Deputy is trying to put the House into reverse in this matter.  Please &mdash; this is not intimidation &mdash; have respect for the members of the Defence Forces.  They are now in a constructive mood and I know that.  We and they are practically in 100 per cent agreement on what will be incorporated in the regulations, so please do not make mischief.</P>
      <P>It is quite clear from what I have said in reply to and in introducing Second Stage that broadly speaking, I am going the whole way in regard to what they want but the detail has to be worked out with them and they must be seen to be the people who will decide the detail with us.  We have given them a guarantee that they will be fully consulted in every area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite confident at this stage that agreement will be reached and that <Col N="1280" /> agreement on detail as well as on principle will be incorporated in the regulations. That is the way it will be and I will be here for the next two months to make sure of that.  I am giving that assurance to the House.  Let us not frustrate that legitimate constructive process.</P>
    <P>Deputy Nealon in particular, and other Deputies seek to incorporate into a series of amendments precisely what will be in the regulations.  My approach is that I will agree with the spirit of the amendments but they will be incorporated in regulations after discussions with the representatives of the Defence Forces.  It would possibly be more logical to proceed in that way.  We will then see the futility of having these amendments inserted in view of that approach.</P>
    <P>I intend to say very little else in the debate because my position is clear.  I must oppose these three amendments for the reason I have mentioned.  As regards a number of the other amendments &mdash; we will go into detail on them later &mdash; I will be agreeing in principle with the spirit of them and they will be incorporated in the regulations after discussions with the representatives of the Defence Forces.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There were a number of important issues contending for this first ever allocation of Private Members' time to The Workers' Party. The reason we resolved to progress our Bill, the Protection of Part-time Workers (Employment) (No. 2) Bill, 1989, is that we recognised that this is an area of widespread exploitation and abuse of employment practices and the ongoing failure to introduce legislation to protect part-time workers is tantamount to condoning their exploitation.</P>
      <P>On 2 November 1989 the Minister for Labour told me in reply to a parliamentary question that there were 72,000 part-time workers, in the sense defined in this Bill, within the workforce. He said more than 60 per cent of these were women although in his definitive study for the Department and the IPC, Mr. John Blackwell, concluded that for 1987, 72 per cent of all regular part-time workers were female.  The point is that the number of part-time workers in the labour force has almost doubled in the last 10 years and the current ICTU estimate is that there are 100,000 regular and occasional part-time workers.  The vast majority of these have no protection against unfair dismissal or redundancy and have no entitlements to holidays, maternity leave or minimum notice.  Frequently they endure poor working conditions, lack of job security, are afraid to join trade unions and suffer low pay &mdash; sometimes to the point of scandalous exploitation.</P>
      <P>On this dimension of low pay, in the course of an address to the joint ICTU-Combat Poverty Agency Conference in December 1989, ITGWU economist Rosheen Callendar commented:</P>
      <P>One of the main effects of the continuing exclusion of part-time workers from the scope of most existing protective legislation (unfair dismissals, redundancy, insolvency, etc.) as well as from most social insurance cover, is to dramatically reduce the total value of their work.  In the vast majority of cases, the rewards for part-time working are grossly disproportinate to the rewards for full-time working and discrepancy can in no way be accounted for solely by the differences in hours worked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Usually, even when hourly rates of pay are the same for full-time and part-time workers, the latter's conditions of employment are inferior: they tend to be excluded from pensions cover, various kinds of paid and unpaid leave, <Col N="1285" /> valuable fringe benefits, access to training and promotion and so on.  Add to these factors the less immediate, long-term effects of their exclusion from PRSI and most employment legislation and you get a &ldquo;total job package&rdquo; which is considerably less valuable than their actual working hours would tend to imply.</P>
    <P>Also on 2 November 1989 the Minister for Labour seemed to indicate that he accepted these facts and said he hoped &ldquo;to have a Bill ready for introduction to the Oireachtas in the new year&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In an exclusive interview with the <i>Sunday Independent</i> on 4 February this year the Minister promised to &ldquo;wage war on employers who exploit part-time workers&rdquo; and noted that &ldquo;even highly reputable companies are taking advantage of the current unprotected position of those who don't work a full day&rdquo;.  I acknowledge that this represents a significant step forward for the same Minister who, as recently as 30 April 1987 completely espoused the employers' line when he told my party colleague, Deputy Proinsias De Rossa, that &ldquo;it would not be possible to bring more part-time workers into the protection of the legislation governing dismissals and redundancy payments&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Let me give one example to illustrate the reasons part-time workers require the protection of this legislation.  I have a letter here from a part-time worker who first gives me her name and then goes on to say:</P>
    <P>I am 19 years old and I am a low paid part-time worker.  I started my career as a part-time worker at 15 years of age in a restaurant in one of Dublin's leading stores south of the Liffey.  I worked a nine hour day on Saturdays and on holidays from school for which I was paid a pittance.  I had no control over the work which was expected of me and I don't know what I was employed as.  Was I a waitress?  Was I a cleaner?  Was I a porter?  Was I a cashier?  Was I a cook's help or was I all these things for just £15 a week? After a year and a half's work the <Col N="1286" /> restaurant closed down.  I was given absolutely no notice, just my day's pay. When I left the store that evening I had no social welfare cover, no job prospects and no come back, nothing.</P>
    <P>I have since worked in two major establishments, one a leading bakery with a chain of restaurants and the other a restaurant in another big department store north of the Liffey. These jobs were no different to the one that gave me my first taste of part-time work in catering, no job security, no social security, no job description and low pay.</P>
    <P>One other thing they all had in common was that they all started by telling me the same two things, &ldquo;at any stage of your employment we can let you go and because you work part-time you have no right to ask for an explanation; being a part-time worker you will have no need to join a trade union, if you have any problems you can always come up and have a chat with us about them&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There were plenty of problems but there was no time to chat about them. This experience is typical of what a part-time worker in this catering industry can expect.  You just have to look down along O'Connell Street where we are surrounded by fast food joints.  Many of these places subject their workers to disgraceful conditions.  They give them no staff facilities and for their days slog they get £1-odd per hour.  Yesterday I inquired about a vacancy on O'Connell Street and was offered £1.70 per hour.  It must be made clear that neither I nor any other part-time workers choose to work under these conditions.  Economic necessity forces us to do it.</P>
    <P>The employers' line in response to that, when dressed up by the FIE, is that &ldquo;the great benefit of part-time work is its flexibility&rdquo; and then they threaten that any changes in national legislation which inhibit flexibility would have extensive and lasting negative effects by which is meant that such changes would adversely impact on job creation.</P>
    <P>The General Secretary of the ICTU, <Col N="1287" /> Mr. Peter Cassells, at the summer conference on this issue, opened by the Minister for Labour, made clear that he did not accept that extending labour legislation and social insurance cover to part-time workers would inhibit job creation. To underline his point he invoked the Department of Labour's own survey of August 1986 on employers' perceptions of the effect of labour legislation which showed that less than 1 per cent of respondent firms raised any issue related to the area of labour legislation.  In his study John Blackwell agrees with this and calls this factor, &ldquo;hardly a major influence&rdquo;. Of course, those countries in Europe with the best track record in job creation such as Germany and Sweden are also the countries most heavily regulated with regard to job creation.  Indeed, it is instructive that it was the countries with the highest proportion of part-time employment &mdash; Britain and Denmark &mdash; that buried the 1982 Draft Directive on Voluntary Part-time Work as published by the European Commission.</P>
    <P>If the Minister has a copy of that Draft Directive to hand he will note that The Workers' Party Bill draws heavily on it for definitions and interpretation and stays as close as possible to the definitions in the existing labour legislation to which we have referred.</P>
    <P>In Part I we deal with the short title and provide that the provisions of the Bill should come into operation not less than six months from the date of enactment. On the question of interpretation each of the terms stays as close as possible to the definitions in the Acts that will require to be amended if the Bill is passed.  Part II contains the specific provisions to afford part-time workers equal treatment on a <i>pro rata</i> basis with their full-time colleagues. The final section contains a provision for disputes arising as a result of entitlements under the Bill.</P>
    <P>The major study in this area was carried out by John Blackwell and it showed that in 1987, of 1,093,000 persons in regular employment, 65,600 had a part-time job.  Since 1984 the number of regular jobs had fallen from 771,400 to 736,100; <Col N="1288" /> in the case of men with part-time regular jobs the number increased from 14,800 to 18,400.  In the case of females over the same period the number of regular jobs has gone up from 344,300 thousand to 356,900, most of this comprising an increase in part-time regular jobs, from 39,100 to 47,200.  In other words, the number of males at regular work is declining but part-timers are increasing and almost all the increase in women is due to the part-time phenomenon.  So much for the economic miracle.</P>
    <P>Blackwell found that half of part-time workers are found in the group consisting of distributive trades, insurance, finance and business services.  By contrast transportable goods industries account for only 10 per cent supporting the OECD trend that mass production and capital-intensive industries employ a lower than average proportion of part-time workers. Part-time working, Blackwell found to be &ldquo;almost non-existent in the public sector, in the security area and in many Government Departments&rdquo; even where private contractors have increasingly been hired for cleaning work.  If part-time workers are classified by occupation, he found that four occupations account for the bulk of part-time workers: service workers, including catering and cleaning occupations, account for 25 per cent of all part-time work; agricultural workers for 19 per cent; commerce, insurance and finance workers, who include shop assistants and bar staffs, for 16 per cent of all part-time work, and professional and technical for 16 per cent of the total.</P>
    <P>Although he acknowledges that between 1977 and 1987 the proportion of all employment in services increased from 48 per cent to 57 per cent, Blackwell concludes that, on balance, he does not find &ldquo;persuasive the argument that a great deal of the rise in part-time working can be explained by the shift to services sector activity&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Some of the increase in part-time working has reflected the demand on the part of employers.  Some has mirrored an increase in labour force participation. Some of that increase in the labour force has consisted of people who &mdash; at least, <Col N="1289" /> for the moment &mdash; only wish to work part-time.  On this point, the labour force participation rates of married women in Ireland are currently well below those of other European countries.  There is a potential labour force which is at the moment hidden in part by the combined effects of attitudes in society and the discouragement due to the high unemployment and emigration rates.</P>
    <P>One does not need the evidence of available research to conclude that it is the large gap between the total value, hour for hour, of part-time and full-time work that attracts employers to defending the <i>status quo</i>.  Despite the increase in part-time work in recent years it is still the least preferred option &mdash; availed of mainly because of the lack of full-time opportunities.</P>
    <P>I believe that employers are being short-sighted.  Unless part-time work is fairly rewarded, in proportion to full-time working, in all respects &mdash; I must emphasise that &mdash; its potential economic and social value will not be realised, either by employers or employees.  I would argue that if the FIE were to co-operate in placing part-time work on a truly equal footing it could open up many interesting and mutually advantageous possibilities in the future.</P>
    <P>One of the major areas of discrimination against part-time workers is their eligibility for social insurance cover. The majority of people who work for less than 18 hours per week are considered to be part-time workers for social insurance purposes.  Many part-time workers are not allowed to be in the full PRSI &mdash; class A, therefore, they are not entitled to employment benefit, disability benefit and other social insurance payments. This discriminates against women because the large majority of part-time workers are women.</P>
    <P>In a recent case the Court of Justice of the European Communities has held that a rule which discriminates against part-time workers, where such a measure affects a much larger number of women than men, is in breach of the EC directive on equal treatment for men and women in social welfare unless it can be justified <Col N="1290" /> on grounds unrelated to sex.  It would, therefore, appear likely that the exclusion of part-time workers from full insurance cover by the Department of Social Welfare is in breach of the directive since this affects far more women than men and since it is difficult to see what objective grounds could be advanced by the Department to justify this blanket exclusion.</P>
    <P>The recent budget announcement and the provisions in the Social Welfare Bill introduced by the Minister for Social Welfare basically provide that workers' gross earnings which are at or below £60 per week will be exempt from their share of the PRSI contribution from 6 April 1990.  Therefore, part-time workers whose gross earnings are £60 or less per week if reclassified by the scope section, in the light of the European case, would be fully insured for all benefits and would not have to pay any additional contributions. I am quite satisfied that the measures proposed in the Social Welfare Bill do not obviate the likelihood of a challenge in this country.  In Ireland the vast majority of part-time workers, working less than 18 hours per week, only have class J insurance if, indeed, they have that at all, and this only covers them for health benefits and occupational injuries.  The only exceptions are where people work less than 18 hours per week but can establish that their part-time employment is not &ldquo;of a subsidiary nature&rdquo; or of &ldquo;inconsiderable extent&rdquo;. Since this is normally the case only where a person's hourly earnings are well above average and constitute the person's only or major means of support, it is rare for women workers to work less than 18 hours per week and be insured at the full class A rate.  There is an entire major category of part-time workers for which there are major implications for Ireland.</P>
    <P>In the Ruzius v. Willbrink decision the Dutch Government was found to be in breach of article 4.1 of the EC directive 79.7.  This relates to a provision whereby part-timers were paid lower social welfare benefits when suffering from incapacity for work and was found to be <Col N="1291" /> indirectly discriminatory as more women than men were affected and was not &ldquo;objectively justified&rdquo;.  This would seem to have very specific implications for the situation in Ireland and in this context the German case, which was decided only last week, of Rinner v. Kuhn similarly will have implications here in terms of the minimum notice, unfair dismissals and Holidays (Employees) Act.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to the report prepared for the National Pensions Board entitled <i>Changing Employment Patterns in Ireland &mdash; Recent Trends and Future Prospects (1989),</i> prepared by Donal Dinneen which concludes that:</P>
    <P>Employment has been declining, unemployment rising and aggregate output increasing in recent years. Hence fewer people are required to provide the needs of the market place. The spectre of jobless growth for the next few years, especially in manufacturing, looms large.</P>
    <P>He goes on to make the following projections:</P>
    <P>Growth in the relative importance of part-time employment as women increase their participation in the labour force and services employment expands; limited overall employment opportunities to slow down the expansion of female participation rates so that part-time employment is unlikely to expand to more than 10 per cent of the total at work outside agriculture. Total atypical employment forms to account for between 35 per cent and 40 per cent of the total at work, perhaps growing towards the upper figure.</P>
    <P>Dinneen records that these projections are based on a slowly growing total employment level and concludes that:</P>
    <P>... if employment grows more rapidly the recent UK experience may be replicated, where most of the increased employment was part time.  Based on international comparisons this is the one typical employment form which <Col N="1292" /> has most potential to grow rapidly in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Therefore regular part-time workers are likely to expand to about 10 per cent of the total at work by about 1996 and I think the Minister for Labour is on record as accepting this likely trend.  The current legislation is not neutral but actually encourages employers to convert full-time jobs to part-time jobs.  The FIE is being less than honest when opposing the extension of protective legislation because they said:</P>
    <P>Part-time work is an important element in labour market flexibility... which in turn is considered essential to ensure competitiveness and to maintain employment.</P>
    <P>After the success of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> in securing unprecedented wage restraint, it would be manifestly absurd to continue bleating about wage costs in the Irish economy damaging competitiveness.  Nonetheless this resistance to equal treatment for part-time workers is merely a continuation of the &ldquo;competitiveness chorus&rdquo; of the seventies by employers because part-time workers are bluntly a source of cheap labour.  They can reorganise their work schedules at will, hire and fire with impunity and are liable to minimum indirect costs.  The experience shows that &ldquo;flexibility&rdquo; can too easily become for many employers, synonymous with exploitation and expendability.</P>
    <P>Flexibility can and should be preserved and can be mutually advantageous to employer and employee alike provided that part-time workers are fairly rewarded and properly protected.  Indeed the FUE &mdash; they are now the FIE, the Federation of Irish Employers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When it comes to a definition of &ldquo;Irish&rdquo;, the FIE take an even more expansive view than the FAI.  The <Col N="1293" /> FIE would, in my opinion, more properly be concerned that those employers who have company-union agreements which provide <i>pro rata</i> benefits to part-time workers should not be put at a competitive disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> non-union employment not covered by such agreements. It should be the primary responsibility of the FIE to protect good employers who treat part-time workers fairly, rather than fighting a discredited rearguard action for sweatshop employers who are only interested in part-time workers as a source of cheap labour.  I will give some examples in a few moments.</P>
      <P>I referred earlier to the Minister's commitment in the House on 2 November to bring forward a Bill in the New Year. This has not happened and being realistic, given the scheduling of business in this House, it is unlikely that the Minister will be able to bring forward any such legislation before the summer recess and perhaps even before the end of this calendar year.  Therefore, I plead with the Minister not to engage in technical objections to this Bill.  The Workers' Party will be delighted to take on board any amendment from the Minister consistent with the objectives of the Bill.  I ask him to support the Bill which I have moved on behalf of The Workers' Party because of the extent of exploitation of so many defenceless part-time workers and the urgency attaching to this matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said elsewhere that it is his objective to attempt to achieve a practical balance between the two viewpoints of the unions and the employers. The Minister will have to wait forever if he expects all employers to voluntarily forego the benefits which currently attach to the use and abuse of part-time labour. I submit that this Bill is well balanced and seeks to do no more than provide equal treatment on a <i>pro rata</i> basis for part-time workers as compared to full-time workers.  There is no middle way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was surprised and disappointed that the Minister, when confronted with questions concerning the extension of legislation to part-time workers and a national minimum wage, has on more than one <Col N="1294" /> occasion hinted that his middle way may consist of extending the role of the joint labour committees.  Surely the Minister is well aware of the very limited success of the joint labour committees up to the present.  For example, the data produced by John Blackwell illustrates beyond doubt the failure of joint labour committees to eradicate low pay in the industries covered by them.  This has been confirmed by my union in an exercise carried out by their research department. An exercise was carried out recently to establish what proportion of available wage rates for each industry were below £140 per week.  The highest by far, 77 per cent, was in industries covered by joint labour committees and joint industrial council agreements.  This was followed by 53 per cent in the textile industry and 47 per cent in services.  The remaining groups were all below 27 per cent and ten were below 17 per cent.</P>
    <P>The evidence from other countries appears to be that while low pay is a major problem in countries without a statutory national minimum wage, such as Ireland and the UK, it is usually less so in countries which have adopted one. Furthermore, there is no record of countries abandoning this form of regulation once it is introduced.  I am all the more surprised at the Minister apparently persisting with the joint labour committee mechanism as an effective method of tackling the low pay problem when as recently as 4 February this year in the exclusive interview with the <i>Sunday Independent</i> to which I have already referred the Minister is quoted as saying &ldquo;there is a high danger of exploitation&rdquo;.  He also said &ldquo;I have lots of evidence that the most sophisticated systems are used to keep people below the hours threshold and thus unprotected.&rdquo;  I fully agree with the Minister in this analysis and I presume he is well aware that the sophisticated systems to which he referred are also used to effectively avoid the impact of negotiations in some of the joint labour committees.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the £30 million per annum contract cleaning industry.  I am sure every Deputy knows of individual <Col N="1295" /> cases of exploitation in this industry.  In recent years the trade unions belatedly made a more concerted effort to organise this predominantly part-time female workforce and the hourly rate was painfully and slowly increased to the not very princely sum of £3.10 per hour today. Up to a few years ago the norm in that industry was 20 hours per week. Employers gradually began to evade the impact of the improved wages by reorganising work schedules so that the norm now is from 15 to 17 hours.  Accordingly, these workers are predominantly not covered by the usual protective legislation.</P>
    <P>This trend was bitterly accelerated by the manner in which the then Minister for Social Welfare, Mr. Barry Desmond, chose to belatedly implement the EC equality directive.  The House will recall on that occasion that when women became so entitled to an arbitrary ceiling on earnings of £50 their male spouses who were in receipt of social welfare benefits could not claim their wives as dependants, which meant their benefits were reduced by a substantial amount which varied with the circumstances.  As a result there is the horrific prospect of employers on the one hand preventing this type of contract worker in the contract cleaning industry, contract security industry, contract catering industry, etc., rescheduling their work so that they would have fewer hours and fall outside the scope of the legislation and evade the effect of wage increases by giving them fewer hours to work and on the other hand these unfortunate women colluding in this practice because they are afraid that if they go over the £50 ceiling their husbands will lose a good deal more than the few pounds they earn in excess of £50 per week.  There are several examples of this.</P>
    <P>Part-time workers in some of the major multiple stores are told to clock out after 17½ hours work each week and to continue working.  This is in order to avoid social welfare and other protective legislation. One of the workers involved was owed 90 hours.  Young part-time workers who one day worked from 8 a.m. to 4 <Col N="1296" /> a.m. the following day, in some cases against the law, had just one break and after they had completed their work they had to walk home.  Part-time night crew workers who could not use the canteen at night because of the alarm system had to take their breaks sitting on the shop floor.  This week I heard about part-time workers in a major store in Dublin who come in at 9.30 a.m. but are told there is no work for them and to come back when it is busy.  They come back when it is busy and their domestic arrangements require them to knock off at 6 p.m. but they cannot do so because their employer wants them to stay on.  In the case which came to my attention recently the part-time workers were locked inside the store because the security man closed it at 9 p.m. and the manager had hopped around to the local pub and did not return until 11.30 p.m.  This is a good example of how many employers regard their part-time workers.</P>
    <P>I know of several instances where part-time workers are given soft drinks and biscuits in return for working additional hours of overtime in supermarkets.  In one case a part-timer was given a tin of paint and paint brush and told to paint the outside of the shop for £1.20 per hour. Part-time workers who turn up for work are often told to go home because they are not needed.  The new emerging independent group of retailers who employ part-time staff for £1 per hour are paying their part-time employees out of petty cash, not giving them holidays, sick pay, pay slips, etc.  Part-time staff are working between 12 and 16 hours per day for flat rates of pay.  All hours are treated as equal in respect of pay.</P>
    <P>A number of trade union agreements given to me today show that some extraordinary practices are being required of part-time workers who have to sign contracts which virtually sign away any minimal rights they have.  Everything is at the company's absolute discretion and each new employee must accept and agree to the concept of change in practices and procedures and agree to co-operate positively.  The best example is where any part-time employees who are <Col N="1297" /> suspected of dishonesty in any way are required to submit themselves to a polygraph test to establish whether or not they are telling the truth.  These trade union agreements give some idea of the contracts part-time employees are expected to sign.</P>
    <P>One agreement states:</P>
    <P>Due to the nature of the business shift times may change with little or no notice and employees may be required to work alternative times to those originally posted.  It is intended that all of our locations will trade on either a minimum 16 hour day, or a 24 hour day, 365 days a year basis.  All employees whether part-time or full-time will be expected to work shifts and for the purposes of this employment all days of the week are considered to be equal....</P>
    <P>Because of the nature of the trading hours of our business your hours will vary from week to week....</P>
    <P>Employees have a collective responsibility to meet the Company's commitment to provide a public service, therefore employees must be available to work additional hours/overtime should the Company request same.  The Company has the right to request reasonable levels of overtime....</P>
    <P>The holiday year of the Company is the 1 April to 31 March and all accrued holidays must be taken within the relevant year or within six months after it ends failing which they are lost....</P>
    <P>No payment will be made during the period of sick leave, injury and/or leave of absence.  You must notify your manager immediately of any infectious/ contagious diseases in your family.</P>
    <P>Any such disease would probably result from poverty if people have to sign an agreement like that.</P>
    <P>The Company accepts no liability whatsoever for any accident not correctly reported, howsoever caused....</P>
    <P>You are required to give a minmimum of two weeks' notice in writing <Col N="1298" /> should you decide to terminate employment failing which the company will impose a penalty of pay due.</P>
    <P>That is a fine one coming from a company that gives absolutely no rights to the employees, but should they fail to give two week's notice they are liable to be punished by the imposition of a penalty of pay due.</P>
    <P>In addition to any of the warnings in paragraphs 1-3 and if the company feels it appropriate, the company may suspend the employee with or without pay for such period as the company feels appropriate.</P>
    <P>Needless to recall, in all of these agreements I have in front of me, the workers concerned are clearly given to understand that they may not join a trade union. Depending on the professionalism of the advice available to these employers, that is worded in different ways, the net effect is that there is no union in this employment and if an employee should attempt to join a union he will get his cards, presuming, of course, that he has cards to get in the first place.</P>
    <P>The company operate extended hours retail stores under a licensed agreement with another company and the employees must be on call at all times should the business of the store at the time require it.  The employee will be expected to devote his entire working time and attention to the company's business and so may not, without the consent in writing of the personnel department, be involved in any outside business or enterprise.  This is an agreement to be signed by part-time workers receiving, in this case, £1.40 per hour.  They virtually have to sign their entire lives away and be available on call should this particular employer require it.  The last clause to be initialled by the employee in this particular agreement is:</P>
    <P>The Company has no agreement with any Trade Union and does not recognise the right of any trade union to represent any employee....</P>
    <P>Employees will pay a deposit to the Company, deductible from wages at source, for the use of the uniform, this <Col N="1299" /> deposit is refundable two weeks after termination of employment provided the uniform is returned to the Company in good reusable condition.</P>
    <P>So, even if the nature of the work requires protective clothing the employees are required to pay a deposit to the company deductible from wages at source.  Then if they return the uniform in good reusable condition, having brought it to the local dry cleaners, they will get the deposit back.</P>
    <P>The Company has the right to question, test or search an employee and his possessions and to search any vehicle on Company property.  An outside body may also do this on behalf of the Company.</P>
    <P>It also goes on to say that they must submit themselves to a polygraph test if the company deems it necessary.</P>
    <P>The Company reserves the right to change the terms and/or conditions set out above on giving seven days notice to its employees.  The above terms and conditions ... set out all the terms and conditions of your employment for the purposes of the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act.</P>

      <P>I was merely trying to illustrate there, by those examples which are by no means exhaustive, how necessary to part-time workers and how urgent is the extension of such protective legislation as exists.  These people are seriously exploited.  I would hope that the Minister could take this Bill on board rather than promising, in the never never, a Bill from the Government.  This is urgent and is in the interests of many workers who are enduring great hardship as a result of the conditions I have described.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <Col N="1300" /> When this Bill was discussed in the autumn of 1988 I indicated that we would have to review various pieces of legislation, and we commenced discussions to follow this through to produce a programme of legislation covering about five different Acts.  At the time I said it was important to get a balance and to conclude consultations with both sides of industry before putting forward my own proposals.  We are much further down the road now and I welcome this opportunity to discuss the matter in the House.  I will take careful note of what is said throughout what I hope will be a constructive debate.</P>
      <P>I cannot argue with what Deputy Rabbitte had to say.  In my capacity as Minister and previously outside the House I was involved in the issue of part-time workers.  In the early seventies I was involved in the conferences and branches of Deputy Rabbitte's union when the issue of part-time working was being discussed. I remember being involved in the debates about the contract cleaning issue in 1972-73.  Because of the growth in difficulties the issue is now more intense, particularly in the food and retail outlets. I have given details in this House several times relating to incidents I have come across with as Opposition spokesman and as Minister for Labour.  I know Deputy Rabbitte's colleague, Deputy De Rossa, has attended a number of the conferences organised both by me and by the trade unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like all legislation in the labour area this legislation is particularly urgent.  The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, has made it clear that in accordance with EC Directives, etc., he intends to bring in amendments in regard to social welfare issues.  For my part it is incumbent on me to consult with both sides of industry in discussions.  I accept that, as Deputy Rabbitte said, it is not possible at any time to get conclusive agreement between employers, trade unions interests and part-time workers.  Our obligation in the Department of Labour is always to involve ourselves in discussions and to come to some conclusions with the social partners in the safety area, worker <Col N="1301" /> participation in the State area, in discussions on unfair dismissals, the Payment of Wages Act and the Equality Act, which is still under discussion.  We have gone through the same process.  I organised the May Conference and we are following it through.  This debate is useful in that process.</P>
    <P>There has been a significant increase in the number of part-time workers entering the labour force in Ireland over the past decade.  The number of regular part-time workers increased from 39,400 in 1977 to 72,000 in 1988.  In addition, a further 15,200 people were working as occasional part-time workers in 1988.  The growth of part-time work is further illustrated by the fact that in 1977, 4.4 per cent of the workforce were regular part-time workers, whereas by 1988 this figure had increased to 7.8 per cent.</P>
    <P>The growth of part-time work is associated with the increase in labour force participation by women.  Studies throughout the EC have shown that in all member states the overwhelming majority of part-time workers are female.  The same has been found in relation to other atypical forms of work such as temporary working and home based working.  In Ireland 70 per cent of regular part-time workers are female and almost two-thirds of these are married.  Part-time working allows many women to fulfil a dual role in society, continuing to work while engaged in child rearing and other family responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Data collected in the 1987 labour force survey showed that 40 per cent of women worked part-time because of family responsibilities and a further 25 per cent because they did not want a full-time job. Many women find that part-time work and other atypical forms of work allow them the flexibility to fulfil the varied demands which they face.  Similarly, many employers find that part-time working and other new forms of atypical working provide them with the flexibility they need to compete effectively in the market place.  Because flexibility in work paterns is now often required by both employer and employee, it is likely that part-time work and other atypical forms of work will continue to increase into the <Col N="1302" /> 1990s.  What may have appeared some years ago as a transitory form of employment arising from an economic recession now looks as if it will be a permanent and growing feature of the employment scene.</P>
    <P>Given the problem of unemployment, and particularly youth unemployment, which developed in this country throughout the 1980s we must be careful of the way in which we address the whole issue of labour market regulation.  Part-time work offers a valid and useful entry point to the labour market for many people who are excluded from it.  Despite the growth in part-time work in this country, it is still at a relatively low level by European standards and we can expect to see significant employment growth in this area.  Part-time work will, for many, be a valid and long term employment form. As legislators we must ensure that safeguards exist to protect part-time workers while simultaneously avoiding the danger of over regulation, which would hinder employment growth.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of balance in this debate I must add that I have received delegations and deputations from workers in the supermarket trade, an area of which I have been quite critical at Question Time recently, and from the hotel trade, some areas of which I have also criticised.  In my own constituency there are a great number of part-time workers.  Women have outlined to me the benefits to them of such work, the flexibility and the advantages to employers.  While I have several times been quite scathing about supermarket employment, very recently I had a deputation from the constituency represented by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and Deputy De Rossa.  They outlined the considerable benefits, advantages and perks organised by their employer.  The point they made was that when talking about this issue I should recall that not all employers are in this category in the supermarket and fast food trade.  I said I would keep some balance in the argument. I am not too sure if my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, would consider that all the perks they had were <Col N="1303" /> totally within the range of the Social Welfare Act, but I will not go into that now.</P>
    <P>I mention this point only because most of the people I come across in supermarket work, retailing, the fast food area, cleaning and the security trade tend to be people who have difficulties because of contracts.  I have seen many short-term contracts but I am not sure if I have seen any quite as bad as those mentioned today.  I have no doubt they are authentic and it would be interesting if such companies were called on by the inspectorate of the Department of Labour.  Some of the clauses in the contracts mentioned are extreme even compared to some of those I have seen in the cleaning companies.</P>
    <P>The present position is that some labour legislation, for example in the areas of occupational safety and health, employment equality and payment of wages, makes no distinction between full-time and part-time employees.  However, a requirement that the individual must work at least 18 hours per week applies in a number of statutes.  This was originally designed to exclude persons whose employment was of a subsidiary nature or of inconsiderable extent.  The primary protective employment Acts which currently exclude workers who are not employed for a minimum of 18 hours per week are the Unfair Dismisals Act, 1977, the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts, 1973 and 1984, the Maternity Protection of Employees Act, 1981, the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts, 1977-88, the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967-84 and to some extent the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984. Based on 1988 Labour Force Survey figures, the 18 hours threshold has the effect of excluding approximately 20,000 employees, of whom 83 per cent are women, from the benefits of the legislation which incorporates that threshold.</P>
    <P>The Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973, does not apply an 18 hour eligibility threshold. Instead it excludes from annual leave entitlement those who do not work at least 120 hours per month or 1,400 hours in the leave year and in order <Col N="1304" /> for a part-timer to gain entitlement to a public holiday, he must work for at least 120 hours in the preceding five weeks. The higher hours thresholds which apply under the Holidays Act have the effect of excluding approximately 45,000 part-timers, of whom 76 per cent are women, from annual leave entitlement, and an estimated 38,000, 78 per cent women from public holiday entitlement.  These are substantial figures.</P>
    <P>Because I was concerned about the adequacy of existing labour legislation, in a situation where part-time employment was growing rapidly, I initiated a review of this issue and I sought the views of the social partners.  As part of the process of consultation, my Department organised a seminar on the subject of part-time work, which was held in May 1989 and was very well attended.  The Federation of Irish Employers, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and a number of leading academics in this area outlined their views and examined the possibilities for, and implications of, legislative change with respect to part-time work.  As a result of the discussion and debate arising from the seminar, I think it is fair to say that a measure of agreement has been reached that real steps need to be taken to give stronger legislative protection to persons employed on a regular part-time basis.</P>
    <P>The review process was interrupted by the general election of last year but, subsequent to that, proposals for legislative change were drawn up in my Department. These were then circulated in October 1989 to other Government Departments for their views, as is the normal procedure when new legislation is being put forward.  The views of other Departments have since been received and considered and my final proposals will be put to Government shortly.  Since this area involves Finance, Social Welfare, Industry and Commerce and other Departments, there have to be discussions and consideration at official level.  Because labour issues and the rights of trade union members are <Col N="1305" /> involved there was considerable discussion with the ICTU and the Federation of Irish Employers.</P>
    <P>Before proceeding with any detailed legislative changes in relation to part-time workers I will have to give due regard to changes which are on the horizon at EC level.  Following the adoption of the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers in Strasbourg last December the European Commission has been engaged in the preparation of a social action programme to implement the charter.  A social action programme has now been drawn up by the Commission and as President of the Social Affairs Council I have been working to ensure that the programme is implemented as quickly as possible.  As part of this programme, I now expect that the Commission will be in a position to publish a draft directive on atypical work in May or June of this year.  Obviously, I will have to take cognisance of these proposals and in as far as possible minimise any areas of conflict which may exist between the draft directive and my own proposals.</P>
    <P>We have had an interest here at national level in the whole area of atypical work because it is an issue that has been raised continually over the last year or so both in the House and by the ICTU, though I have to say that in 1987 and 1988 I was one of the few speaking about it. Now there has been a great deal of debate on it and I have pushed and pursued to get a directive on atypical work high on the agenda of the social action programme.</P>
    <P>The objective of my proposal will be to significantly improve the position of regular part-time employees without impeding the growth of this sector of the employment market.  I am strongly of the view that the major area of concern on this issue relates to part-time employees who are heavily dependent on this form of employment and who are employed permanently or semi-permanently on a part-time basis.  I am concerned that regular part-time workers who are employed on a long-term basis are denied entitlement to the most basic protections which <Col N="1306" /> are afforded under labour law.  It is this inequity I am seeking to address.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Bill which is before the House tonight addresses issues in the area of labour law and social welfare and is attempting to bring about change in both areas in a short Bill.  The reality of this issue is, I am afraid, much more complex. The Minister for Social Welfare has, as I mentioned at the outset, indicated that he is concerned about the position of part-time workers under the social insurance system.  He is currently examining the question of changing the present criteria for insurability so as to provide a greater degree of coverage for workers in this situation.  This is, however, a very complex matter and one where there could be considerable financial and other implications for the social insurance system, depending on the course of action which is taken.  As part of the broader consideration of this issue the Minister for Social Welfare has asked the National Pensions Board to examine the question of pension entitlements of part-time workers and it is expected that the board will report on that issue in the middle of this year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte outlined to the House tonight a number of areas on the social welfare code where difficulties arise.  I will not in any great degree differ from the content of a number of his remarks on social welfare.  We have all dealt with individual cases where people who are on part-time work over a number of years run into serious difficulties.  Regrettably, the most serious difficulty of these issues is that often they are insurmountable when people come to raise them.  I remember six or seven years ago having long discussions with people in different categories of employment in my constituency when I was spokesman for youth on the A.1 &mdash; J.1 benefits and the various related problems and issues. They are significant, but the Minister for Social Welfare has given a clear commitment to the House that these matters in social welfare legislation will be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that the proposals the Government will be putting <Col N="1307" /> forward later this year will have resulted from a comprehensive review involving detailed considerations with interested parties.  The Bill before the House tonight must go through a process of consultation but I have to say that this Bill does not represent a balanced solution to the problem at hand.  I am sure the Deputy will agree with that.  While he is right in that there can be delays, a Bill of this nature, covering both labour law and social welfare issues and involving a number of Acts cannot be taken as simply as that, regardless of the benefits.  There must be financial accounting and the question of what is right for the labour market must be considered as well as all the other aspects.  I do not believe that is fudging the issue in any way but these are important issues where a balance has to be found.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will know that the basis of this Bill in the autumn of 1988 was formulated by one document which was put forward to me at that stage by the ICTU.  That document which was based on a European document and on a totally one-sided view, put the social welfare issues and the labour issues together.  Whatever about the rights involved, those issues have to be taken alongside the other circumstances that affect employment, such as the social welfare code, the pensions code and other relevant matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is giving an undertaking to bring forward his own Bill later in the year, surely some of this work has already been refined in his Department.  If there is necessity for legal clarity then amend this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that in a minute.  The scope of this Bill is far too wide in that it attempts in a single, brief piece of legislation to deal with the whole <Col N="1308" /> area of labour law and social welfare. Secondly, the proposed Bill is also indiscriminate in relation to the target population it seeks to address.  It seeks to regulate in the same way the conditions of employment of the student on a summer job, of the secretary doing a couple of weeks' work through an employment agency and of the long term part-timer, with whom I am mainly concerned.  I would argue that within the group of workers this Bill seeks to address there is a variety of employment situations which require different types and levels of regulation. The Bill tries to provide everything for everyone in a way which I feel is inappropriate and which would result in a significant reduction in employment growth in this area as it would increase the non-wage costs and bureaucracy associated with short term and casual employment.  It would reduce flexibility in the labour market and again tip the balance in favour of machines rather than jobs.  Thirdly, the Bill is vague in certain respects.  It seeks to determine issues related to remuneration which I firmly believe are best dealt with through the existing collective bargaining system.</P>
      <P>There is at present a growth in all forms of atypical employment across Europe and new forms of work are emerging which are providing the main areas of employment growth in many countries. It is vital that as legislators we are fully aware of the possibilities for maximising the employment growth potential of these new forms of work and that we do not kill them off with a blunt legislative instrument before they have reached any great potential.  The world of work and the whole employment scene are changing and yesterday's legislative responses may not be appropriate for tomorrow's world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A recent paper on part-time work in Ireland prepared, as Deputy Rabbitte said, by John Blackwell of University College, Dublin showed that Ireland has a very low level of part-time work compared with international standards.  Part-time work in Ireland is only about half the average EC level.  Developed countries such as Denmark and the Netherlands <Col N="1309" /> have very high levels of part-time work with between a quarter and one-third of their labour force being engaged in part-time employment.  Ireland is grouped with Greece, Italy and Portugal as having the lowest proportion of part-time employees in the European Community.</P>
    <P>Much has been said and written about the reasons some employers favour part-time employment but it must also be recognised that many part-time employees also prefer to work on a part-time basis.  Information obtained in the 1987 labour force survey showed that 67 per cent of women worked on a part-time basis, either because they wanted to or because they could couple part-time work with their family responsibilities. The point is that for many part-time employees part-time work is the desired employment form and we must not do anything which would reduce the employment opportunities of these people.</P>
    <P>The detailed research on part-time work shows that there is great diversity in its form and in the situation of part-time workers.  No broad brush blunt approaches or sweeping generalisation apply in dealing with this subject.  All the indications are that the continued expansion of the labour force and the increasing participation of women in the workforce will mean that part-time employment will continue to increase and account for a larger proportion of total employment.</P>
    <P>In order to understand the growth in part-time employment it is necessary to consider the advantages &mdash; and the disadvantages &mdash; which it offers to employers and employees.  I would be concerned if the debate on the issue focused only on the disadvantages of part-time employment.  There is another side to this and one must have balanced legislation, particularly in the labour area when you are dealing with other people's jobs, circumstances and livelihoods.  It is incumbent on all Deputies to make sure that every Bill is properly discussed, documented, ironed out and drafted in a way which means it will be properly implemented.</P>
    <P>As I said, I would be concerned if we merely talked about the disadvantage of <Col N="1310" /> part-time employment and that as a result action would centre on an approach which would seek to outlaw this form of work or to regulate it unduly.  This would be unfortunate.  Of course I am fully aware of the disadvantages that are currently associated with this form of employment for many people.  Nobody in this House has spoken more about them, researched the problem or spoken at more conferences than I have.  Indeed I accept that some part-time workers have been exploited by employers who deliberately limit the working hours to keep them below various hours thresholds. Deputy Rabbitte gave examples.  I agree that part-time work poses problems of protection for many workers and I accept that these must be addressed.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us seeks to provide greater regulation for part-time employment agency workers than currently exists for their full-time colleagues.  The Bill also seeks to involve the Employment Appeals Tribunals and the Rights Commissioners in areas in relation to part-time workers where they are not currently involved for full-time employees. In addition the definition of equal treatment in the Bill is vague and could result in part-time employees having greater entitlements than their full-time colleagues. What we must keep in mind in relation to part-time employment is that some of it is carried out in the black economy.  If we legislate in the sweeping manner proposed in this Bill we will drive even more of it into the black economy, to the detriment of employees and the State.</P>
    <P>It is clear from what I have been saying that, in responding to the growth of part-time work, we must, as legislators, delicately balance the need to stimulate employment growth in all areas with the equally valid need to safeguard against exploitation.  Such balance in legislation only comes through widespread consultation and debate.  As I have outlined, the Government are engaged in such a process, of which I have given details, and I hope that the views put forward by Deputies in this debate will help us to finalise our proposals.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1311" /> I agree with Deputy Rabbitte that there are many Bills before the House but I have continually said that I will give priority to this matter.  I discussed it today with the Congress of Trade Unions and I have had numerous discussions with employers.  Perhaps some employers would prefer if there were no regulations but they realise that some issues must be covered and they are aware of the content of some of the contracts to which Deputy Rabbitte referred.  They are willing to compromise on some of the views which they previously held but they &mdash; as well as the Congress of Trade Unions and I &mdash; argue against sweeping changes which would tilt the balance to one side, which would not help anyone.  It would be the old story of two wrongs not making a right.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the Industrial Relations Bill is already before the House and there are a number of other legislative measures which I wish to introduce this year on payment of wages, unfair dismissals and employment equality. Nevertheless, as I said at Question Time three or four times in the last few months, I assure the House that my proposals for the protection of part-time workers will receive priority.  In the circumstances I hope that The Workers' Party could see their way to withdrawing the Bill under consideration in favour of the more balanced and considered proposals which I undertake to bring before the House later this year.  The Opposition parties and their spokespersons are aware that the Congress of Trade Unions and the FIE, as well as academics, have put a considerable amount of time into the Department of Labour proposals and it is incumbent on me to bring them forward. We will be ready to do this before the Industrial Relations Bill is passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a welcome Bill as it provides for a very important issue. I welcome the opportunity to have a discussion on the principle of legislating for the protection of part-time workers.  I congratulate Deputy Rabbitte and The Workers' Party for introducing the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1312" /> I very much regret the Minister's slowness in regard to this Bill.  For many months he has been telling us that he will be bringing forward a Bill dealing with the position of part-time workers. However, he seems to treat it as if it was an ordinary Bill.  Of course it is not because it deals with an area central to the major problem facing us at the moment, the question of unemployment. I am disappointed, therefore, that the Minister is not agreeable to accepting the principle of the Bill on Second Stage and to propose amendments to it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Of course the Bill is not perfect and there are provisions in it which might, unintentionally have the effect of making the employment of people more difficult instead of less difficult.  However, if the Minister perceives such defects in the Bill surely they can be corrected on Committee and Report Stages?</P>
    <P>One of the few questions reached by the Minister for Labour at Question Time today was the one in regard to his proposals as President of the European Council of Social Affairs Ministers to deal with the long-term unemployed.  I am as amused as many European Ministers for Labour are that the Irish Minister for Labour is bringing forward proposals to alleviate the problem of the long-term unemployed for Europe when he is presiding in this country over the worst percentage of long-term unemployed in any of the Twelve EC countries. I asked the Minister about this today but he was notably silent on the matter.  What secret proposals has he to solve Europe's problems when they have not already been applied at home?</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the biggest failure of this Government, the Government who have been in office since 1987, has been to deliver jobs.  There has been a background of low inflation for the past five years.  I am glad to see a noted economist, Deputy Dick Roche, coming into the Chamber and he will be able to verify, as he did in writing in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> last Sunday week, that inflation has been down to below 4 per cent since 1985.</P>
    <Col N="1313" />

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>We have also had a balance of trade surplus for the past five years and we have had competitive interest rates, until fairly recently, for the past number of years; yet the mystery, if it is a mystery, is that this has not generated anything near the number of jobs we need or that should have been generated. That indicates that there are certain structural problems which the Government have singularly failed to address.  The Bill proposed by The Workers' Party has the merit of giving some thought to that question.</P>
      <P>It would be wrong to say there has been no reduction in the unemployment register, there has been a small reduction but the extent to which that has been achieved by emigration is open to debate. The Central Statistics Office figures suggest that in the past five years &mdash; up to 15 April last, the last date for which figures are available &mdash; 152,000 people emigrated. We do not know yet what the figures will be for current year, which ends in a fortnight's time, but we do know that emigration is continuing.  The unemployment register is down by less than 20,000 over the past three years.  We know from the unemployment register that a lot of the jobs created are part-time. The question arises, for the purpose of statistics, as to what is a job.  I will come to statistics and Dr. Blackwell, to whom the Minister referred, in a moment.  In this context a job is when a person works a 40 hour week.  We must be clear about this because we must know we are comparing like with like and not fooling others and ourselves with false statistics.  In this contribution the Minister confirmed that there has been a very significant growth in the percentage of the workforce who are working part-time &mdash; I think he said the figure is close to 8 per cent now whereas a number of years ago it was close to 4 per cent.  Those on part-time work do not appear on the unemployment register and that makes the unemployment register look a little better, bad and all as it is at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1314" /> Nonetheless, unemployment remains the central economic problem facing this country.  If we were able to solve the unemployment problem we would at the same time solve the Exchequer problem, because there would be fewer payments flowing out and more taxes flowing in. This would also solve the poverty problem. These are our three major interrelated economic problems but in a sense they are the same problem, that is, unemployment. Therefore, that must be the central focus of attention of all the parties in this House.  In a sense the only party that have not made this their central focus in their policy proposals or in their actions are the Fianna Fáil Party who happen to be the predominant party in Government. The Workers' Party have made suggestions and proposals, even if one disagrees with some of them, as have the Labour Party and the Progressive Democrats, even though they are profoundly different from some of the other proposals. We in this party have also made our proposals regarding unemployment.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment briefly on how I think these problems should be addressed.  It is no harm to recall that, notwithstanding the fact that the approach of the present British Government is one that would not have very much appeal in this House, in the past 46 successive months in the United Kingdom they have been able to bring down unemployment each month, including last month.  Despite the fact that for the last year or two or three, their inflation rate has been virtually double ours and their interest rates have been higher than ours, they have more than halved their unemployment figure, from over three million to less than one and a half million, and they have not had emigration on the same scale as in Ireland.  We have to ask then why the same trend has not manifested itself here.  Of course there is one big difference and that is the demographic trend.  The position is different here because of a higher birth rate and because we are now at a stage where there is a growth in the labour force, but in a number of years that will begin to decline whereas Britain have long since <Col N="1315" /> got over any baby boom and their workforce in terms of numbers is in decline. That is only a very partial explanation for the decline in their total registered unemployment figure.  Some people would say with a certain amount of merit, that some of the figures in Britain, like here, have been manipulated because certain categories have been pushed off the register, but again that is only a partial explanation.  The reality is that in Britain, despite higher inflation and higher interest rates, they have managed to more than halve their unemployment figure and we should aim to do likewise.</P>
    <P>In Britain there is a Department of Employment but in Ireland there is no department of employment.  That was illustrated some months ago when I tabled questions to the Minister for Labour asking him to make comparisons across the board on certain issues that affect employment.  The Minister, in his normal gracious way, answered about half the questions and said in respect of the other half that they were matters for the Ministers for Industry and Commerce, Finance or Social Welfare.  I asked him if there was no Minister in the Government who could take a composite overview, and the fact is there is no such Minister.  There is nobody taking the whole picture into account because of the way we in this State and this Government organise ourselves.  We need a department of employment.  There is an overwhelming case to merge again the Department of Labour and the Department of Industry and Commerce, or at least major sections of them, and probably the unemployment payments section of the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>We need one Minister leading the attack, a Minister who does all the research and presents the facts to Cabinet, a Minister who knows the interaction of social welfare with pay, who knows the poverty traps but has the power and the authority to eliminate them.  The fact is &mdash; and at a recent Question Time the Minister for Labour more or less agreed with me &mdash; that there are <Col N="1316" /> enormous anomalies and traps in our system.</P>
    <P>We need to make a powerful attack on them in order to make employment possible for more workers and for more employers.  Given the fact that for a long time to come we will have fewer long-term jobs than we need, part of the solution is part-time work.  That is why I welcome wholeheartedly the principle of the Bill presented by Deputy Rabbitte tonight.</P>

      <P>I wish to give notice to the House that I propose to introduce a technical amendment to this section on Report Stage.  The principal Act provides the Minister with powers to make regulations on various matters, but only in two instances does it require that such regulations be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The two exceptions are regulations dealing with deductions from pay and regulations dealing with the investigation and summary disposition of charges.  Section 7 of the Bill as it currently stands would alter this situation and the amendment which I propose to introduce will maintain the <i>status quo</i>.  We merely wish to maintain consistency with the principal Act, no more no less than that.  It is purely a drafting amendment which I will bring in on Report Stage but I am obliged to give notice to the House of my intention to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, lines 11 and 12, to delete &ldquo;under section 2 (1) of this Act&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;for the purpose of representing members of he Defence Forces&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to address the definition proposed by the Minister in regard to &ldquo;association&rdquo;.  Section 1 states that the definition is to be applied to an association established under section 2 (1).  In my amendment I am seeking to define &ldquo;association&rdquo; by including the words &ldquo;for the purpose of representing members of the Defence Forces&rdquo;.  That will be tied into a debate we will have later in regard to the limit the Minister seeks to impose on association, co-operation, collaboration or whatever between a representative association as formed under the Bill and any other association, either internal or external, within the State or elsewhere. It is important that we should clarify what is meant in section 1 because the consent of the Minister is required in certain circumstances in advance of any such association taking place.  That will vary, <Col N="1321" /> depending on our success with subsequent amendments.  I hope the Minister will see the reasoning behind my amendment and accept it as an exercise seeking to clarify the section.  I want to make the Bill more specific.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must emphasise that this is an enabling Bill.  Earlier I outlined the step by step approach which is envisaged in it.  Following that logic through, the Bill incorporates in its Title precisely what Deputy McCartan is seeking to incorporate in section 1.  We are seeking to provide for the establishment of associations to represent members of the Defence Forces for certain purposes and for connected matters.  That is in the Title of the Bill.  The section gives a more precise definition of what is in the Title. Section 2 (1) states that the Minister may provide by regulation for the establishment of an association or associations for the purpose of representing members of such rank or ranks of the Defence Forces as may be specified in the regulations. The definition of &ldquo;association&rdquo; in the Bill correctly refers to an association established under section 2 (1).  We tie in the general principle in the Title and the definition of &ldquo;association&rdquo; in section 1 in section 2 (1).  What the Deputy is seeking to achieve is included in the governing Title.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I did not tie the definition down to section 2 (1) I would be making for potential damage to the representative bodies eventually established under regulations by the Minister.  I want to ensure in tying the definition into section 2 (1) that the Bill will correctly refer to an association established under section 2 (1) thus ensuring that only such associations as are established under regulations made by the Minister will be set up.  I want such associations to be protected. That is the central point to my argument.  I want such associations, after proper elections, after proper agreement between the men and consultations, incorporated in the regulations.  That is in the interests of the associations of military personnel we are seeking to establish. It will be of great benefit and help <Col N="1322" /> to the members of PDFORRA or any other Army, Navy or Air Corps grouping that is not official.  We will be legitimising them after the elections.  We will be ensuring that this new group to be established as a result of the election and incorporated in the regulations will be protected by the Title, by section 1, which is the definition section and by section 2 (1).  This is the guarantee for the association or associations.  There will be one for the officers and one for the NCOs and privates.  Whatever is agreed upon by them will be protected by regulation and by statute.</P>
    <P>In effect the new association or associations will be safeguarded against any proliferation of other bodies.  We are stopping any mad gallop towards setting up two, ten or 20 other associations or bodies in opposition to them.  If that happened it would be crazy.  The whole purpose of the Bill is to permit the members of the Defence Forces, with the agreement of the Minister and Army Headquarters, to set up bodies to represent them and we want those bodies protected by statute.  The regulations will be flexible and they can be changed or amended as the months and years go by at the request of the representative body or bodies.  We would ruin everything if we had associations or bodies formed for this and that reason competing against each other.  I want the definition in section 1 and section 2 (1) tied together to ensure that the associations established at the end of the process of consultation will be protected. Deputy McCartan seeks to delete a portion of section 1 which is covered in the Title.</P>

      <P>While I welcome contributions from other Members I must point out that we are on Committee Stage.  I would like to comment on the point made by the Minister that the Title of the Bill indicates what we are about.  I accept that.  It is not for the purposes of judicial construction but it may be an aid in some circumstances.  The point I am trying to address is linked to section 2 (4) where the word &ldquo;association&rdquo;, which we seek to define, emerges.  In this subsection the Minister proposes to limit the number of associations a member may join.  My purpose in putting in the definition is to directly incorporate into the definitions section what is the Title because the Title is not part of the Bill for the purposes of judicial construction.</P>
      <P>I accept that there is a link between section 1 and section 2 (1) where the Minister may permit the establishment of associations for the purposes of representing members of the Defence Forces.  When one comes to subsection (4) the importance of what I am talking about emerges because there the Minister indicates that a member shall not become or be a member of a trade union, or of any other body other than an association. I seek the Minister's advice on this issue.  Suppose within the representative association or within the barracks of any particular command an informal committee or group was formed for the purposes of agitating within the representative body their cause for, say, the barracks' interests to be pursued, or if there was a committee, an association or a coming together of people on a command level calling themselves an <i>ad hoc</i> group seeking to advance, for example, a youth interest, a female interest or a welfare or housing issue, am I correct in thinking that under the current definition of &ldquo;association&rdquo;, in the context of subsection (4), they would be courting with illegality, being outside to the provisions of the Bill?  Would the Minister not agree that it would better in the interests of clarity to give the definition of &ldquo;association&rdquo; in the definitions section?</P>

      <P>In practical terms, as long as they are members of the representative body any legitimate activities such as those mentioned by the Deputy, would be part of the normal course of membership. Naturally people would agitate and put forward representations and points of view for various improvements in their welfare, etc. and form groups or committees to push a point of view within the ambit of their particular association or associations.  I would see nothing wrong with that; that is a perfectly legitimate democratic activity.  What I am talking about is where people would set up counter-bodies to the body which is pursuing the men's interests under the regulations.  Certainly all the committees in the world can be established within the body to push for various points of view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the position of members who elect not to become members of the representative body? Suppose they were to assemble for the purposes of simply calling themselves the <i>ad hoc</i> committee of non-representative members who, under the Constitution, have a right not to be members and would equally have a corollary right to be heard in some respect?  I agree with the Minister that it is desirable &mdash; and I have a later amendment to that effect &mdash; to keep the number of associations to the minimum, for reasons which I will advance.  Nonetheless, I am concerned about the position of those members of the association and representative bodies who would not be members of the formally established representative association. Where do they fit into the order of things? If the definition of &ldquo;association&rdquo; was amended in the way I propose, it would safeguard their interests in a limited way.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is in danger of riding two horses at the same time; we are either concerned or we are not concerned about having a legitimate representative body established, safeguarded and protected by legislation.  I will not go into the rights and wrongs of the aspirations of other people who may not agree with that &mdash; that is another <Col N="1325" /> day's work &mdash; but in so far as we can, what we are seeking to say in this legislation is that we are giving a chance to the majority within the Defence Forces to express their point of view and to advise us on how their representative body should be structured.  We will go along with a reasonable mandate upon which we both agree but if we start writing into law opportunities for all sorts of other bodies to start, then we are getting off the main target.  I appeal to the House to stay on target with what we are trying to do.</P>

      <P>I would be deeply concerned if what Deputy McCartan is even remotely suggesting were to happen.  It would not be in the best interests of the Defence Force and would be highly dangerous.  I would like to see one umbrella organisation representing the Defence Forces.  I would not like to see anything built into the Bill or the regulations which would allow for <i>ad hoc</i> groups to be set up to discuss this, that and the other.  If that were to happen one could end up with an <i>ad hoc</i> group in every barracks and every unit in the country.  I do not think the Defence Forces at large would welcome that.  It would weaken the structure of any organisation which would be formed or elected, and it would get away from the idea of a democratic organisation representing the entire force.  I would be totally and utterly opposed to any such development.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1326" /> In page 2, line 15, before &ldquo;task&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;military&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment proposes to refine the definition of &ldquo;operation&rdquo; in section 1. One has to see where the word &ldquo;operation&rdquo; appears in the body of the Bill to understand the importance of the amendment. It appears specifically in section 2 (1) at line 29.  Subsection (1), while giving the Minister power to establish an association for the purpose of representing members of the ranks, goes on to state the areas where it would apply:</P>
    <P>in relation to matters affecting their remuneration and such other matters (if any) as the Minister may specify in the regulations, but excluding matters relating to any operation and the raising, maintenance, command, constitution, organisation and discipline of the Defence Forces....</P>
    <P>The use of the words &ldquo;any operation&rdquo; is imprecise and much too wide in its meaning.  For that reason I suggest as a means of getting over the difficulty that we amend the definition of &ldquo;operation&rdquo; in section 1 to mean &ldquo;any military operation&rdquo;. I cannot see any difficulty with that and I hope it will commend itself to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the point the Deputy is making but I must oppose the amendment on the grounds that it would introduce a very unnecessary complication. I will explain my reasons for saying that.  The Defence Forces are a tremendous asset to this country and have been even more so in recent years when they have stepped into the breach in all sorts of situations, particularly in aid of the civil power.  It could be argued that some of the tasks they are called upon to undertake in the national interest from time to time are not necessarily military tasks.  I do not want to confuse the situation by entering into that realm.  They render assistance to the community in various forms, at various times during various emergencies.  The Defence Forces have rallied to the call, as it were, on numerous occasions in undertaking <Col N="1327" /> operations which are not normal military operations, for example, flooding, storm damage&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Bin strikes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Army have stepped in in a whole range of social relations, so to speak, and have been in the final group the Government of the day can rely on. The Army have stepped in during snow drifts, flooding, bin strikes, industrial strikes, natural hazards and accidents. When emergencies arise in different areas the first reaction of the Government of the day is to send for the Army, who have performed their task for society excellently over a number of years.</P>
      <P>I do not want to insert just the word &ldquo;military&rdquo;.  Most of the tasks I have just mentioned are not, within the strict dictionary definition, military operations but command and discipline have to be maintained. In some of these cases where quick action is required more often than not command and discipline are just as important, if not more important, than during a war.  Alertness, quickness and immediacy are all-important in a situation where there is a degree of urgency.</P>
      <P>While I understand the rationale behind what the Deputy is advocating I believe it is much better to leave the word &ldquo;operation&rdquo; open so that it is a task undertaken by the Defence Forces in the discharge of their duties.  To tie it down to a military task, as the Deputy suggests, would be very restrictive and would not cover enormous areas of beneficial help which the Defence Forces give from time to time in urgent cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's elaboration on the concept of what might be involved in the word &ldquo;operation&rdquo; as he sees it.  I purposely stayed back from the issue to see how far the Minister envisaged the matter running. Having heard what the Minister has said I am convinced that my amendment should be pursued.  If the matter is not pursued to the full extent proposed in my amendment, then we need to look at it again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1328" /> I believe there are three separate categories which can and should be looked at within the operations of the military in aid of the civil power.  I do not think any of us have difficulty in recognising the need for strict military order to apply in cases where the military power come to the aid of the civil authority in the pursuit and suppression of crime, as provided for under the Offences Against the State Act and the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976.  There is equally no difficulty where the military authority come to the aid of the civil authority in disasters and difficulties occasioned by acts of God, as they are so called, for example the need to clear fallen trees and snowdrifts from highways, deliver food, rescue fishermen off our coasts and the like.</P>
    <P>However, there is need for closer examination of the instances where military personnel are called to the aid of the civil power in industrial disputes.  Soldiers drove military vehicles about the city in defiance of busmen who were seeking the resolution of an industrial dispute.  They also drove fire brigades during the firemen's dispute and collected bins during the binmen's dispute.  This phenomenon gave rise to resentment among the workers involved in the dispute.  No doubt the beleagured people who were conveyed to work and whose bins were emptied appreciated the work carried out by the soldiers but to others, particularly those seeking a resolution of the disputes on behalf of the workers, they were an annoyance.  As a matter of principle I have no hesitation in advancing the case that it should be the exception rather than the rule, and that in civil disputes between the Government, a Minister or employer and employees the military should rarely, if ever, be called in aid of the civil authority.</P>
    <P>That is my view on the matter and I want to bring it into perspective in regard to the Bill.  Are we proposing that the staff representative association of the soldiers and officers should be excluded entirely from making any representations or heard in any way in the third category of strike to which I have referred?  I have no difficulty about the military coming to <Col N="1329" /> the aid of the Garda Síochána in the pursuit and suppression of crime or their being called upon in aid of the civil authority in cases of distress or other acts of God as I have described them.  Soldiers are proud to carry out that type of duty and to be able to come to the rescue of people in trouble.  However, I have no hesitation in saying that they have grave doubts about being called in, as some workers have called them, as strike breakers.  This matter should be addressed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I am not going to pursue this issue unduly but I ask the Minister to have regard to the third category to which I referred.  We should at least provide in this legislation that the Army representative association should be heard and involved in discussions and decisions if they are ever called upon to act as strike breakers.  As the European Parliament has told us, we are legislating to give civil and democratic rights to the protectors of the civil and democratic society.  Soldiers are entitled to be given proper regard and I do not think it is asking a lot of us to ensure that they should at least be given the opportunity, when they are called upon to intervene in the third category of strike to which I referred, to make representations and/or be represented through their commanding officers.  This should be a function of that association. For that reason I sought to confine their operations to &ldquo;military&rdquo; operations. Strikes under categories one and two would be clearly covered in that definition, but I do not agree that they should become involved in strikes under category three.  It might well require military discipline in its execution but at least in that scenario the representative associations should be entitled to be heard on behalf of their members.  That is why I pursue this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Having worn both hats, as a national trade union official and as a serving officer, I would have to disagree again with Deputy McCartan.  My experience has been to the contrary.  I am just giving Deputy McCartan the benefit of my experience; if I needed legal help I <Col N="1330" /> would be asking for his advice.  From personal experience I am in a position to give the Minister some advice.  In trade disputes it is only as a last resort that the troops are brought in, and one of their main gripes was that they were never paid the rate for the job.  Under the broader terms of the section I would see the representative association being in a position to negotiate on behalf of the men providing the service so as to secure a decent payment for them in that respect. I agree that troops get a special allowance in such cases but it has never been equal to the moneys paid to the people who normally do the work.</P>
      <P>Generally, the trade unions, the Department, the Minister and the soldiers do not want a situation where the Army have to do this work.  There are times, however, when the national interest has to be put before sectional interests.  As a trade union official I have had to stand up on platforms and defend that, and I would have no hesitation in doing it again.  There must be a certain amount of flexibility and that will be in the interests of the troops rather than to the contrary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>It strikes me that going the route suggested by Deputy McCartan would be to narrow this down to a dangerous point.  There is a great deal of common sense in what Deputy Bell said.  It is true that one could categorise the three or four different things one would see the Army doing.  I would not like to see the Army being retrospectively classed as strike breakers and I do not think that is what Deputy McCartan meant to do.  I do not believe he meant to say that what the Army did in the past during bus strikes or refuse collection strikes was strike breaking.  Those things happen in extremis, as Deputy Bell said, and only in extremis.  To limit the meaning of &ldquo;operation&rdquo; here to &ldquo;military operation&rdquo; would certainly incorporate category one.  It is questionable whether it would incorporate category two.  For instance, in Bray we have had the Army out twice. <Col N="1331" /> We had them out for mopping up operations at the end of floods when the disaster was over and there was work to be done on humanitarian grounds which should have been done by council workers; but the council workers worked side by side with the troops and were pleased to do so in the interest of the greater public good.  This is precisely the common-sense approach which has been adopted by Deputy Bell and, I presume, by the Labour Party.  It strikes me that inserting &ldquo;military&rdquo; would be a mistake. I think it would be wise for Deputy McCartan to consider that and withdraw his amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly oppose this amendment.  If we were to narrow this definition we would be doing a great disservice to our Defence Forces.  Deputy McCartan supports the position with regard to support from the Garda in disasters but he has a problem with refuse collection strikes or bus strikes.  My understanding is that when the associations are up and running part of their brief will be to cover pay, allowances and conditions in relation to all of these duties.  Deputy McCartan's position is a negative one.  It is against the positive spirit of the Bill.  I would strongly urge the Deputy and, indeed, the members of the other parties, to consider their position on this.  The whole purpose of the Bill is to set up associations to cover these very matters.  I want to see a broad definition because that is in the interests of the Defence Forces.  They are respected because of their involvement in difficult times for the State which is a very central issue.  I would ask Deputy McCartan not to impinge in any way on that core issue.  Narrowing this definition would greatly interfere with this and with respect for the Defence Forces.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies Bell and Kitt have said precisely what I wanted to say. This definition which includes any task undertaken by the Defence Forces makes it quite clear that once these associations are up and running they can, and should, <Col N="1332" /> negotiate for allowances in particular situations, perhaps of undue hazard, undue hours, any one of a number of situations where urgent aid to the civil power is involved.  That is precisely the type of situation for which they should be compensated to a reasonable degree. The definition will cover the whole ambit of their conditions of service and provide for negotiation on their behalf.  That is one aspect that adds force to the whole idea of setting up a representative body or bodies.  It is precisely the sort of work in which they would be engaged.</P>
      <P>Let us be more positive about this Bill and let us not be restrictive.  An Army is an army and they have to do work under command and discipline, all sorts of work in the national interest and in all sorts of situations.  If they have to do that, let them be appropriately compensated. If we had members of the Defence Forces here, I am sure they would nod their heads and agree with me and argue as best they could for allowances or facilities for doing such work.  That is the way the matter should be approached.  Let us not approach it in an academic way.  We are talking about a practical measure which is designed to do the right thing by the members of our Defence Forces, so let us not tie it up in knots.</P>

      <P>The last thing I seek to do is to tie anything in knots.  What I am trying to do is to clarify some aspects of the Bill and to assure myself that what we are doing here is the correct thing in the long run.  I am sorry if people's patience is getting a bit strained at this hour.  If that is the case let them go home and let those who are interested in teasing out this Bill get on with the job.  I do not want to be lectured any more by people who say that I am being disagreeble about this or approaching it in an uncommitted spirit.  What I am arguing for here is good legislation in an area which we have addressed for the first time, where we have no precedent or other debates to borrow from.  For that reason I want to get it right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With all the different hats that he wants <Col N="1333" /> to wear, Deputy Bell is missing the central point.  I understand from my reading of section 1 (1) that a representative association once established will not have the power or authority to discuss debate or represent its members in regard to &ldquo;any operation or any aspect of that operation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I cannot see any other reading of it and the Minister's words in explaining the provision would seem to suggest that &ldquo;operation&rdquo; has the broad scope which some Deputies think is useful and better. I do not think so.  One of the reasons is the issue of principle.  If we are recognising the right of soldiers to establish a trade association within the Defence Forces they should be allowed to have regard to their position <i>vis-à-vis</i> other trade associations or trade unions.  They should not be marched into a trade dispute simply on the command of a Minister of Government who thinks it is expedient to resolve a stalemate by relying on the Defence Forces, as in the past.  In that one narrow area, soldiers as tradesmen represented by their trade association should have at least the right to be consulted, to be heard, and to make representations.  Section 2 (1), following the definition contained in section 1, does not allow for this.</P>
    <P>I worry that there should be respect and understanding of what a trade association of soldiers should be.  I am not suggesting, nor does any member of the Defence Forces suggest, that in the face ultimately of a command being delivered they should hold up their trade association card and say &ldquo;wait a minute, mate, it's down tools time&rdquo;.  I am merely saying that in principle they should have the right to be heard if they have a point of view to state.  We are legislating against that right of audience in the definition of &ldquo;operation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The second point relates to the major annoyance caused to soldiers on operations in aid of the civil power.  They lie in the ditch for hours on end and watch members of the Garda Síochána &mdash; or in the prisons, members of the Prison Service &mdash; heading off for canteen facilities and other facilities which they are <Col N="1334" /> denied because they are not provided for under their organisational regime.  They are laughed at when they compare their wage packets at the end of an exercise to those of the Special Branch men, the security policemen or the prison officers in Portlaoise.  No doubt such stories have been recounted to every Deputy and to the Minister's emissaries.  Under the definition section their right to negotiate and to debate remuneration in regard to such operations is excluded, as I read the Bill.  If there is a doubt about it and the Minister tells me I am wrong, let us provide specifically for it.</P>
    <P>The definition of &ldquo;operation&rdquo; is clear and section 2 (1) states that the representative associations may deal with matters affecting their remuneration and such other matters as the Minister may specify, but excluding matters relating to any operation.  Matters relating to an operation are pay and conditions and the length of time a soldier is expected to lie in a ditch, stand in a turret or stand at a crossroads.  Food, clothing and other ancillary matters such as reliefs and billeting are all matters relating to an operation. I cannot see any other construction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are defining &ldquo;operation&rdquo; as a task.  Conditions and the payment of compensation are separate matters.  We are talking about a task and that is the word the Deputy is seeking to restrict in his amendment by adding the word &ldquo;military&rdquo;.</P>

The phrase &ldquo;excluding matters relating to any operation&rdquo; excludes any consideration surrounding or involving that operation. <Col N="1335" /> I cannot see any other way of explaining that phrase.  I am simply asking the House to clear up the ambiguity by amending the phrase to read &ldquo;excluding matters relating to any military operation&rdquo;, so that all other operations involving the Defence Forces can be dealt with by the representative associations.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bell has done us a great service by drawing attention to the fact that these are all covered by the regulations.  For some reason Deputy McCartan seems to be irritated by the presence of anybody here.  On other occasions Deputy McCartan and his fellow travellers have pointed to empty seats; he cannot have it both ways. Deputy Bell has covered the point with crystal clarity.  Everybody other than Deputy McCartan can see the clarity.  It is obvious that the insertion of the word &ldquo;military&rdquo; as proposed in the amendment would have a very limiting effect and could hamper us in the case of flooding or a coastal clean up.  I cannot understand the logic of Deputy McCartan's point when he says he is not suggesting that somebody could produce a trade union card and refuse to carry out a task.  I cannot understand how the two things <Col N="1336" /> lie together.  Perhaps I am being dull &mdash; everybody is dull in this House but the Deputy.  A far more clear and logical definition is the one suggested by Deputy Bell.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have to agree with Deputy Bell in the way he has addressed this amendment.  I appreciate Deputy McCartan's sincerity but the introduction of the word &ldquo;military&rdquo; at that point could at some stage involve members of the Defence Forces in something which they would not want to become involved in, namely a non-military type of industrial dispute.  The Army do not want to become involved in such matters.  They are trained and have a very proud tradition in meeting emergencies and providing fire, ambulance and other services in times of distress, and they have done so on numerous occasions. Responding quickly and unequivocally is part and parcel of the proud tradition of the Army.</P>
      <P>It would lead to a certain amount of ambiguity if the amendment proposed by Deputy McCartan were to be accepted simply because there then would be a question as to whether, in certain circumstances, they should or should not respond.  The Army people I have met and dealt with do not wish to create any ambiguity, and I am sure other people have had the same response.  They, and we, are all in favour of improving their conditions generally.  I do not want to repeat anything that was said on Second Stage, but in this area I think they would feel strongly that they should represent them, as was said by Deputy Bell and others.  I support that theory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with the elements that are excluded.  Because of other aspects, particularly conciliation and arbitration, does the Minister envisage that areas, such as discipline, would be discussed or is he excluding principles governing discipline for consideration at any stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am following the suggestion made by PDFORRA that <Col N="1337" /> discipline should be excluded from this legislation.  That is common case right across the board.  Anybody who has paid any attention or has any concern about what goes into this Bill or the regulations knows that that is out.  It has to be.  We are dealing with Army personnel.  You join an Army for certain reasons and military personnel cover the Navy and the Air Corps.  When dealing with an issue involving military personnel we are going the whole way in this Bill short of the command and discipline areas that are the essence of what a military force is all about.  That is accepted by all the representatives I have met and who have made submissions to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask for clarification of that. I have read that the Garda conciliation and arbitration system allows for discussion of principles governing discipline and there is a mechanism in that conciliation system for discussing principles governing discipline as against discipline itself.  I appreciate that the members do not want to be involved with discipline. I want that point clarified.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy McCartan, I resent any criticism of people over here which suggests that just because we do not agree with his position we should go home.  That is comical.  On the point he made, I think it is legitimate to say he adopted a narrow, negative position. Consider it against the points made by Deputy Bell and others.  The Bill refers in section 2(1) to &ldquo;.... matters affecting their remuneration and such other matters (if any) as the Minister may specify in the regulations....&rdquo;.  The Minister said that no Bill will be put on the Statute Book without the agreement of the representatives of the Defence Forces. Take all that in a positive manner and you see that that statement covered the points and the concern expressed, in other words, anything to do with pay, remuneration or conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know about the grievances that have been expressed by members of the Defence Forces.  Taken from a positive viewpoint all those issues are covered <Col N="1338" /> because there would be no regulations or Bill without the agreement of the representatives.  That has been stated by the Minister.  I consider that a legitimate argument and I ask the Deputy to accept it.  Narrowing the definition is doing damage to the Defence Forces.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Deputy Kitt, I do not understand the suggestion; how you could do damage by narrowing the definition is lost on me entirely.  For the benefit of Deputy Durkan, who perhaps was not here for the earlier part of the debate on this amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am seeking this amendment only to ensure that in nonmilitary situations requiring the command discipline, representative associations will have the right to be heard on behalf of their members.  For that reason I believe &ldquo;operation&rdquo; here needs to be clarified.  I have sought to do it by confining it to military operation and I have put forward the proposition that there were different degrees and tasks required by the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>In the light of what has been suggested let me ask the Minister if it is proposed or suggested that there is a difference in military understanding between a task which is governed strictly by command and a task which is contributed to on a voluntary basis &mdash; say, for example, a dispute arises that needs the aid of the military and there is a procedure where members can volunteer for involvement in an action, such as clearing snow or clearing bins in an industrial dispute.  Is there a difference in the concept?  Is one a task and the other not?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but he is not here now.  All tasks are military tasks.  That goes without saying.  The Bill provides that, &ldquo; `operation' means a task undertaken or intended to be undertaken by the Defence Forces in the discharge of their duties;&rdquo;.  To that extent they can be regarded as military tasks.  It is restrictive, superfluous and unnecessary to add &ldquo;military&rdquo;.  Once they volunteer, whatever they do is in discharge of their duties and they are under the command/ discipline framework.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">

For the purposes of clarity, is the Minister's reading of section 2 (1), which includes this broader definition of &ldquo;operation&rdquo;, that it will be open to a representative association in respect of any operations to be heard on the pay or conditions of such an operation?  Will they not be restricted by the wording here?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3.</P>
      <P>In page 2, subsection (1), line 22, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is an enabling section and the use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; reflects the reluctant attitude of the Government as a whole to this Bill.  They had to be brought to the starting line and, even at that, they came to it very reluctantly.  It reflects a very negative kind of thinking.  I notice later on that where an association would have to be dissolved because of an emergency, its re-establishment is governed by the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and rightly so.  The word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; should also be here.</P>
      <P>This has been described by the Minister and the Chief of Staff as an historical progression.  It is a very important Bill but we have a situation where the Minister of the day or his successor may bring it in more or less if he feels like it as he is governed exclusively by the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;. We have been told that most matters will be dealt with by regulation and we also find that the major enabling section is totally at the discretion of the Minister. He may bring it in if he feels like it.  I know the Minister will say that it makes no difference, that of course he will bring it in.  However, it should be enshrined in the legislation that the Minister &ldquo;shall&rdquo; bring it in.  I take it that the Minister will accept this amendment.</P>

Given the <Col N="1341" /> fact that the Minister has adopted a conciliatory approach he should take this amendment on board.  &ldquo;Shall&rdquo; expresses a definite obligation on the Minister as against &ldquo;may&rdquo; which gives the impression that there is merely a possibility of it or that it can be delayed.  We need a positive approach to this and the suggested amendments would strengthen the Bill. I hope the Minister will take them on board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the proposal put forward by Deputy Nealon and Deputy Ryan.  In amendment No. 4 in the name of The Workers' Party I propose a simple addendum &mdash; that the regulations not only shall be brought into being but will be brought into being within three months of the passing of this Act.  A definite time should be set to exercise the minds of the Ministers and others involved in the negotiations to ensure this is back before the House and will not go on interminably.</P>
      <P>The importance of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;may&rdquo; might be lost on those who believe that Ministers or Governments never change and that we all go on happily here for ever.  It is not long since the Minister for Defence was implacably opposed to the establishment of a representative association.  The current Minister of State who, no doubt, is a prince in waiting as the Minister hopes to move on to higher and greater things in the near future, held and reiterated the view of his previous Minister for Defence no later than July last year.  He said in the Estimates debate that the idea of a representative association for members of the Defence Forces was not in keeping with the traditions of command and discipline within the Defence Forces.  He has not changed his views although he remains in office as Minister of State in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is grave concern on this side of the House that if the Minister is not available &mdash; as the only Minister on record in support of the principle of representative associations &mdash; to see the negotiations through, it would be open to another Minister simply to announce <Col N="1342" /> at a meeting in Athlone or elsewhere his plans for the future with regard to the principle and idea of a representative association.  In debating this historic time in the life of the Defence Forces we are simply asking that it should not be just enabling legislation but that it would be mandatory legislation and that whatever Minister holds office, he or she will be subject to the dictates of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  In other words, we should unanimously record the view of the Oireachtas as requiring &mdash; not hoping &mdash; that a representative association will in time be established through regulations.</P>
    <P>The Minister said earlier that he would be back in this House in two months time to see the regulations through and to deal with the matter and I earnestly hope that he will.  Nonetheless, I am not convinced that there is universal agreement among the aspirant holders of his office if, for any reason, he is unavailable to pilot this legislation through in accordance with the principles and ideas contained in it.</P>
    <P>I propose a reasonable period to enable that to be done.  A substantial amount of work has been done in the form of this document which has been circulated.  It goes through the nuts and bolts of the representative structures which will be in place.  The Minister indicated on Second Stage &mdash; and repeated tonight &mdash; that he proposed taking on board some of the more important principles which we advocate.  A period of three months would be more than adequate, although I might be convinced that it should be longer.  It is of the essence that we move as quickly as possible because the Garda Síochána have had a representative body since 1924 and the Defence Forces have waited long enough.  We should be moving with all speed in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche</NameTxt>
      <P>The substitution of &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for &ldquo;may&rdquo; as suggested by Deputies Nealon and Ryan is inappropriate in an enabling Bill.  I remember when I was a civil servant listening to many debates and discussions in drafting legislation as to whether one put in the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; or &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  In enabling legislation the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is inappropriate.  I have not heard <Col N="1343" /> the concept of mandatory enabling legislation introduced in the House.  It is a novel concept and mandatory and enabling do not seem to go terribly well together.  There is a more serious problem in regard to the three months cut off point.  Deputy McCartan is correct in suggesting that speed is of the essence and I hope we will get this Bill through provided that there is goodwill and that people do not interfere or introduce unnecessary hares in this issue.  I hope we will have a negotiated set of regulations which will commend themselves to everybody and that the whole matter will be happily under way within three months.</P>
      <P>It would be imprudent and unwise to insert a cut-off point because when you put people to the wall, so to speak, you produce a different reaction.  I am not suggesting that the Minister, his officials or indeed the representatives of the Army personnel should be dilatory or leisurely in this matter but at the same time it would be unwise to lay down a cut-off point of three months.  I would suggest that there are many precedents for the use of &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  It is fairly standard practice as anyone who has worked on drafting in the Civil Service or in a Minister's office is aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should consider inserting the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; because it is much more positive.  I think that is his intention anyway.  We are only asking for an amendment to that section which would be designed to carry out what he intends to do in any case.  I have reservations about the three months cut-off point.  I appreciate Deputy McCartan's point of view.  I hope it would not take three months, that maybe the consultations could be carried out in a month, but anything could happen in the meantime.  If that provision was built into the section it would be in conflict with section 8 (3) which effectively states that the Minister has the right to put it into operation.  We would be putting a clause into section 2 which would be in conflict with section 8 (3) and would nullify it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1344" /> I am also concerned that it might have the opposite effect and might react against PDFORRA or whatever group might be carrying out the negotiations. They would have to go back and have consultations and that would be a big task.  There are many people all over the country who would be involved in consultation and the delay could very well be from their end rather than from the Minister's or the Department's side.  I think it would be dangerous to insert that provision because it might tie the hands of the people whom we are trying to help. For that reason I oppose it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I take the view that we should leave the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; on the understanding that it is based on agreement. Deputy Bell has said the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; would be more positive and I appreciate his view but &ldquo;shall&rdquo; has mandatory connotations whereas &ldquo;may&rdquo; is a word that is used when talking about reaching agreement.  The commitment is there and the whole process of consultation and discussion has been initated, in that talks are taking place with Mr. Sexton.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is quite common in parliamentary language and is used by the parliamentary draftsman's office on a regular basis.  I understand it is also used in the Garda Síochána Act, 1977, and throughout the Defence Act, 1954.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Nealon has said this is of major significance but I do not agree on the basis that the commitment is well and truly there and on the basis of what the Minister has said on Second Stage and so far this evening.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; fits more comfortably into the whole process of consultation and reaching consensus. I support Deputy Bell's view on the question of three months.  To put down a marker of that nature could run contrary to the process of agreement and reaching consensus.  My view is that we will reach consensus and agreement prior to the date referred to but if we start specifiying dates it will not be helpful on the basis that we will be undertaking something that is very much in the area of consultation. I think the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; fits <Col N="1345" /> more comfortably into the whole thrust of what the Minister is trying to do.</P>

The last speaker has outlined that this is an agreement but if the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is used I do not see that there is any agreement because obviously it is at the discretion of the Minister to decide; if he feels in the humour or if things go right he may do something.  I would accept the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; but to insert the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; would be a contradiction.  I referred in my Second Stage speech to section 5, which I am not going to discuss now, and I called it the &ldquo;may&rdquo; section.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; appears three times in that section. I think that could be taken out of the Bill because it makes no sense.</P>
      <P>Deputy Roche has mentioned the language of civil servants.  There are times when I wonder whether they are competing with the insurance advertisement on television about how complicated insurance bills are made by certain companies. It is time we came into 1990 and forgot the language of years gone by.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; has been used in the past but maybe it is time we forgot what was done in the past.  I do not think it would be a major problem for the Minister to accept the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  The Bill would still come into force.  I am sure it is only a technical dispute but it would mean the Dáil had some relevance and that the Government side did not say, as I am sure the next speaker will, that what I am saying is rubbish.  It makes no sense to insert the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in regard to the setting up of a new body.</P>

      <P>With regard to the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; I would just make one point, PDFORRA, as is well known, regard the Garda Síochána model as the one they want to pursue.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is used in the legislation governing the Garda arrangements and as far as I know it has <Col N="1346" /> not presented any difficulty.  The second issue is of more substance and that relates to Deputy McCartan's amendment.  In terms of industrial relations practice, flexibility is of the essence.  It seems that setting a time limit is precisely what PDFORRA or any other representatives do not want.  What they want is the fullest possible opportunity to thrash out everything with the official side and reach agreement.  If the regulations are finalised within three months, all to the good but I think this provision would remove a necessary flexibility, especially for people who are entering organisations for the first time.  For precisely that reason they need more freedom and flexibility than might ordinarily apply.  On grounds of logic and practicality, and the wishes of PDFORRA, I would be opposed to any time limit.  At the same time both sides should work hard to achieve consensus on the regulations as rapidly as possible.</P>

      <P>The corresponding legislation to the current Defence (Amendment) Bill, 1990, which for the first time is establishing a defence representative association, is the Garda Síochána Act, 1924.  When representative associations for the Garda Síochána were established for the first time under that Act, the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; was used.  It states: &ldquo;there shall be established, in accordance with regulations to be made under this Act, a representative body or bodies&rdquo;.  The precedent is there and I wish people could be accurate when they make contributions to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianJHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>For the second time I have to say I was referring to the 1977 Act and practices since then.  There is no point in putting an interpretation on something I did not say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was addressing the proposition Deputy Roche had made that there is no precedent.  I accept that the 1977 Act substitutes a subsection that incorporates the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; but in the original legislation which established Garda Síochan representative associations, as this Bill proposes to do for the <Col N="1347" /> Defence Forces, the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is used. It is remarkable that all the provisions in the Bill relating to the Minister contain the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;&mdash; the Minister may do this and the Minister may do that &mdash; but if we look at the next subsection, which refers to the association and what the association shall do, everything is in the imperative &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  In section 2 (3) the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is used and subsection (4) states &ldquo;a members shall not become ...&rdquo;.  What is good for the Defence Forces should, I believe, be equally good for the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the notion of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is inappropriate to grounding legislation why should it apply to what the Defence Forces and their members should do? The importance &mdash; and it is not a play on words &mdash; is that the judicial interpreation of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is that it gives discretion, whereas the judicial interpretation of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is that it creates an obligation.  It must be acted upon.  I have made the point that there will be a difficulty lest there be a change in office.  In my view there is not universal agreement about the idea of a representative association either among the Government or among the higher echelons of the Department.  More particularly there is no such agreement among the commanding structures of the Defence Forces.  There are people in very influential positions who, if given half the chance, would tear this Bill up and would not hear of any suggestion of a representative association whatever.  In amendment No. 4, my addition to the subsection is &ldquo;three months&rdquo;.  In producing that I have said I have no difficulty in accepting a good argument for extending it to six months or whatever number of months is required, but I am very firmly of the view that we must set a date by which the regulations and the associations should be in place.  The reason I say that is that if one looks at how we are now operating on a single piece of historic legislation which is establishing for the first time representative associations, we are in fact giving the entire operation over to the Minister to put the regulations in place <Col N="1348" /> outside this House.  We have, in a unique way, handed over the entire debate to other quarters and for that reason we should have some right of regulation even if at the end of the day we can do no more than set the date as to when the regulations will be brought back to the House.  If the Minister who will be leading these negotiations tells me that three months is tying his hands too tightly, I will accept that by all means and I will withdraw my amendment in favour of something better on Report Stage. However, I am very firm that we should know when the finality is expected to this House.</P>
    <P>With regard to the disingenuous suggestion that this is in conflict with section 8 (3), Deputy Nealon has an amendment down that the subsection be deleted, which I fully support as I do not see any need to duplicate it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Browne made the point earlier that this is like a debating society, but I suppose that is what we are.  We have had contributions ranging from forgetting the past in the matter of words to going back to the past to justify the words.  Perhaps we might agree that we have devoted a fair amount of time to the words, &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and we might be aware that we have to move on to other business. However, that is merely an exhortation to anybody who will make a further contribution to be as brief as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that, on the basis of experience, I will have to come down on the side of &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  All public representatives, and particularly members of local authorities have had countless experiences of having various sections pointed out where in one case the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is used and in other cases the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is used and we are then informed that the definition of &ldquo;may&rdquo; is that if there is a commitment by the Government of the day the Minister &ldquo;may&rdquo; introduce regulations or whatever the case may be or in certain circumstances the Minister &ldquo;may&rdquo; carry out certain instructions or &ldquo;may&rdquo; respond in <Col N="1349" /> a certain fashion.  The amendments that have been tabled are very reasonable and I think they should be accepted.  I ask the Minister to accept them on the basis that they leave no grey areas.  It is quite clear that the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; means that the Minister is giving a commitment on behalf of the Government in relation to this section.  While we could talk about it for a long time I will be brief as I appreciate the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's request for expedition.  I fully support the amendments tabled by Deputy Nealon and others and I ask the Minister to take them on board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the manner in which the Bill is being debated is evidence of the commitment on the part of the Government to this measure.  There is no question about that.  It is what has been communicated to the representatives of the Defence Forces, who are fully aware of that commitment and are now engaged in discussions with a view to having elections to get the whole procedure going in the manner I envisage.  There is no going back on that.  I am acting on behalf of the Government.  Collective responsibility is involved and there is no question of what this Minister or that Minister thinks.  It is a Government decision that will be implemented through legislation in this House.  I want to make that quite clear. Whether I am here or somebody else is here, that is the fact of the matter.  It is what was envisaged by my colleague, Deputy Vincent Brady, Minister of State at the Department of Defence who, in regard to this point of Defence Forces representation said, as reported at column 760 of the Official Report for 20 July, 1989:</P>
      <P>.... I intend to have the situation examined in a thorough-going way and to do so as quickly as the complexity of the subject will allow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned that to show there is an ongoing progression in this matter and to show what we are determined to do. Otherwise we would not be here with this Bill which marks a new departure in the attitude to the Defence Forces so far as <Col N="1350" /> all Governments since the formation of the State have been concerned.  It is an historic occasion in that respect.  This is serious business.</P>
    <P>The reasons that &ldquo;may&rdquo; is used instead of &ldquo;shall&rdquo; are very simple: first this is enabling and not mandatory legislation. I am advised by the draftsman that the language used is in keeping with the standard correct legal drafting practice for such a Bill and that &ldquo;may&rdquo; is the word used in the Garda Síochána Act, 1977 and throughout the Defence Act, 1954. Changes from that legal usage only raise questions in the eyes of the legal profession and in the courts who interpret these matters.  They would be likely to ask why &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is used while &ldquo;may&rdquo; is used in similar sections in the Acts of 1954 and 1957.  We in this Oireachtas or people in any parliament have to have regard to the consistency of phraseology in drafting.  We are not engaged in a literary exercise, sometimes drafting can be ugly but it is precise in terms that it follows precedents from Act to Act.  That is the way it works and I want to emphasise that point here.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is most appropriate here because this is enabling legislation.  If, for instance, we use the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and we do not get agreement, and the whole essence of this enabling Bill is to get the agreement of the representatives of the military personnel&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">

      <P>That is my opinion but I am not pre-empting discussions.  The Deputy should not put words into my mouth.  That is my opinion and that is what I would say if I were sitting across the table in discussions with the duly elected representatives.  However, they may not agree with me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is for that reason also that the amendment put down by the <Col N="1351" /> Deputy proposing a limit of three months would be prejudicial to the interests of the representatives of military personnel, as was pointed out by Deputy Bell.  One of the reasons the Gleeson committee have until next June to report is that the men, through their various teams, in their representations to the committee asked for time to prepare their case.  When it comes to discussing the nitty gritty and the details of the regulations, I am sure that many points which neither I nor anyone else in this House has yet considered will be raised by the elected representatives of the military personnel and they may wish to see them incorporated in the regulations.  I may not agree with them but if there is something in their case we should incorporate it in the regulations.</P>
      <P>There has to be flexibility and the essence of this legislation is its flexibility. To ensure that this legislation will be as flexible as possible I have embodied a provision in section 8 under which the coming into operation of the Bill can be postponed to allow for delays, making representations or suggestions on the nitty gritty and what should be incorporated in the regulations so that they can be teased out fully.</P>
      <P>If the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; was included in the legislation it would, to some degree, pre-empt the ultimate decision on what should be incorporated in the regulations. It would also carry the implication that the Minister must bring in regulations irrespective of the views of the representatives of Defence Forces personnel.  I do not want that to be the case.  I want to be in a position where I can tease out the matter in the greatest possible detail and obtain agreement on what should be incorporated in the regulations. At that stage they would come before the House.  I do not want to be mandated to bring in regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies cannot have it both ways. They cannot expect to have a provision which would make it mandatory on the Minister to bring in regulations and have the maximum amount of consultation at the same time.  What I want is the <Col N="1352" /> maximum amount of consultation to take place with the representatives of the men; and I want the legislation coming from this House to be as flexible as possible to ensure that the maximum amount of consultation will take place and that the fruits of that consultation, an agreement, are incorporated in the regulations.  That is the spirit in which we should be debating this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to disagree with the Minister.  There is no conflict between what we have been saying since the introduction of this Bill on the necessity for consultation on what should be included in the regulations and what we are proposing in this amendment.  This is the first debate on a Bill to which I have contributed and I feel it is up to us, in the Opposition, to try to convince the Minister on Committee Stage of the necessity to take on board the points being made by us.  Having listened to the contributions from the other side of the House this evening, I regret to say that they came into this House with preconceived ideas and not prepared to move on this amendment.</P>

      <P>The argument has been made that we need the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in the legislation to allow us enter into consultations but we should remember that it is we who decide what legislation is passed.  In relation to this historic legislation, the strongest possible wording should be inserted and in this case the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; should be included.  There would then be a responsibility on the Minister to negotiate and to come up with an agreement.  If there is no argument about the terminology why, as Deputy McCartan asked earlier, is there inconsistency in the wording in the Bill?  There is no point smiling&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is not a literary exercise or a debating point but rather the central point on the central section of this Bill.  The reason I put down my amendment is that I wish to make it mandatory on the Minister to bring in regulations. The Minister is relying on two arguments, the first of which is that if we press ahead and insert the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; this would be to the detriment of the members of the associations.  However, if we leave the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;, this would be far more detrimental. His second argument is that the draftsman so advised him.  The draftsman looks up legislation going back to the foundation of the State to see what is contained in it and then advises the Minister on the way it should be done.  Everyone in this House knows the meaning of the words &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and &ldquo;may&rdquo; and logic says that we should opt for &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  We <Col N="1354" /> owe it to the Defence Forces to do this. This is an important and historic Bill and the very least we should do is ensure that there will be a Bill.  I will certainly be pressing my amendment.</P>

The Minister has argued that much discussion and debate are needed but this shall still take place regardless of which word is inserted.  If the Minister got a note from the Taoiseach saying that the Tánaiste may resign he would be very happy but if he got a note saying that the Tánaiste shall resign he would sit up and take notice.

      <P>As you will see, a Cheann Comhairle, the word &ldquo;remuneration&rdquo; deals exclusively with money matters, but these, as all of us will agree, are exceedingly important to members of the Defence Forces as well as to Members of Dáil Éireann or to any other person.  The wording of this section indicates the Government's thinking on all the sections in the Bill.  It is very much a limiting section.  The word &ldquo;remuneration&rdquo; deals exclusively with money matters.  There is the addendum &mdash; but it is not a clear cut addendum: &ldquo;and such other matters (if any) as the Minister may specify in the regulations&rdquo;.  This is a confining provision seeking, in every line and in every section to curtail the exposure of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment suggests the addition of the words &mdash; Deputy McCartan and Deputy Ryan have suggested other excellent wording in their amendments &mdash;&ldquo;welfare, schemes of medical benefit and family support systems&rdquo; in section 2 (1). The document entitled <i>Permanent Defence Force Representative Groups</i><Col N="1358" /> with contains the Government proposals, as conveyed by the Minister &mdash; one could not have any greater authentication of a document than that &mdash; is excellent in this respect.  In defining welfare, the document mentions such matters as saving schemes, assistance funds, recreational facilities and educational facilities aimed at developing the individual socially and culturally, including courses to aid adjustment to civilian life.  All these are very laudable matters and would be covered by the word &ldquo;welfare&rdquo; in my amendment. My amendment also proposes the inclusion of &ldquo;schemes of medical benefit and family support systems&rdquo; in section 2 (1).</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will say that these matters will be included, that they have been specified in the Government's proposals &mdash; which we found very inadequate and threatening in other respects &mdash; and that it is not necessary for us to write them into the legislation, but I believe we should copperfasten these elements in order to give proper scope to what is intended here.  If it is intended to include these matters why not put them in the Bill so that, irrespective of who is the Minister this is the Bill the Defence Forces will have in the future so that they can say &ldquo;this is our Bill and these are the matters covered in it&rdquo;.  The Minister could include the words &ldquo;and such other matters (if any) as the Minister may specify&rdquo; after elaborating further and dealing with matters other than remuneration.</P>
    <P>I believe my amendment is very reasonable.  The Minister has so far shown himself to be in a very unreasonable mood and he should make a readjustment as early as possible by accepting what will not only be good so far as he is concerned but what will be a major addition to this Bill.  I know the Minister would like to have as perfect a Bill as possible and I am seeking to help rather than frustrate him in this respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment moved by Deputy Nealon.  My amendment and Deputy Ryan's amendment on behalf of the Labour Party seek <Col N="1359" /> to work towards the same end.  We are seeking to include in the Bill a broader base upon which the Defence Forces representative association will be able to operate and organise.  It is clear from the Bill that the Minister is fully committed to the concept of remuneration and all that it involves under section 1.  He believes it is an important and central role of the representative association but curiously subsection (1) says &ldquo;... and such other matters (if any) as the Minister may specify in the regulations...&rdquo; and what I can only describe these as infernal regulations in view of the fact, that they have been removed completely from the ambit of our consideration as a result of what happened on the earlier debate on section 7.</P>
      <P>If we go along with the Minister's proposals and if he decides to establish the regulations, we will not have the opportunity to discuss them and, in so far as we are dealing with enabling legislation, we will for the time being be enabling the representative association to work in the area of remuneration as defined in the Bill, but nothing else.  So far as this House is concerned remuneration is being provided for explicitly in the Bill and everything else will depend on what the Minister deems to be relevant as time goes on.</P>
      <P>Members on the Government side have quoted the Garda Síochána Act, 1977, to their benefit and advantage on numerous occasions and said this is the precedent on which we should be proceeding. This Act incorporates additional wording to the narrow remuneration concept. The Garda Síochána Act, 1977, provides that the representative association can deal with all matters &ldquo;affecting their welfare and efficiency&rdquo;.  That is a repeat of the wording in section 13 of the 1924 Act which refers to welfare and efficiency.  The question has to be asked: why we are not providing a similar formula in this legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fear that the Bill has been drafted in a different context entirely and is a response to the representations and campaign on pay and other issues taken up <Col N="1360" /> on behalf of the Defence Forces, and now before the Gleeson Commission.  There is a suggestion that the Defence Forces are concerned only with the rate for the job.  It has emerged during many debates in this House that there are wider issues of equal importance to the Defence Forces than pay and remuneration, which we seek to cover in our amendments.</P>
    <P>My amendment proposes the inclusion of the words &ldquo;welfare, health, education, housing and all related matters&rdquo; in section 2 (1).  It is important that this House, which has been denied an input into the regulations which will eventually be put in place, should at least have some opportunity to identify areas in which we believe the representative associations, as eventually established, will have a role to play.  I say that on the basis that these have been active issues not only by the soldiers but by the National Army Spouses Association who have argued that these issues have to be dealt with and addressed.  During the last general election these issues were raised on the doorsteps with candidates from the National Army Spouses Association and other parties.  These issues were not picked from the air.  They are very real issues and I will deal with them one at a time.</P>
    <P>I have raised at Question Time the issue of welfare and schemes of welfare, such as psychological and psychiatric schemes, which are needed for those soldiers who have been in the long-term employment of the Defence Forces and who are now returning to the community. I have also referred to the fact that the provisions of the Health Acts and the medical card scheme are not available to members of the Defence Forces.  The fact that they are not entitled to access to a doctor of their choice under the general medical scheme is a burning issue.  There is nothing more urgent than housing. There must be vast areas of the barrackland accommodation of the Defence Forces needing the urgent attention of the bulldozer.  There are many other related matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for the opportunity to raise this matter.  Could the Minister explain the long delay in submitting Ireland's application to the EC for an extension of the disadvantaged areas scheme?  The time of reckoning has come.  The Government must make up their minds what areas they will include in the application to Brussels.  What is all the secrecy about?  It is obvious that areas qualifying under the criteria laid down in the Council Directive 85/350/EC concerning less favoured areas within the meaning of the Council's Directive 75/268/EC must be included.</P>
      <P>It is 13 years since some of those areas applied for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme.  Farmers in South West Cork, North West Cork, North East Cork, Tipperary, Waterford, Carlow, Monaghan are all entitled to be considered for inclusion in the scheme.  The whole country could be included.  Agriculture is our primary industry, our major source of revenue.  When the last litre of gas is drawn out of the Celtic Sea agriculture will still play an important role in our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The morale of the farming community is at a low ebb.  The Minister's handling of the extension of the disadvantaged areas is appalling.  Fifty eight per cent of Ireland's farmland has been classified as a less favoured area subdivided into three <Col N="1362" /> sub regions: (a) more severely handicapped areas; (b) less severely handicapped areas; and (c) mountain sheep areas in the eastern part of the country. Payments of headage grants are moderated between the three regions according to the severity of the permanent natural handicap.  This classification into the three types of less favoured areas is a national decision, not an EC decision. In 1986 the Coalition Government led by Deputy Garret FitzGerald proposed to treat all areas as more severely handicapped areas with the highest rates of payment made to those areas.  However, after the 1987 general election Fianna Fáil amended this proposal and retained the three categories with different rates of payment.</P>
    <P>It is clear that Ireland is not getting a fair share of the cake under the disadvantaged areas scheme when one considers that Luxembourg has 100 per cent of its territory included, Greece 78 per cent, Portugal 65 per cent and Spain 67 per cent.  That was prior to the extension which those three countries sought recently.  The method of inspection by the Department is a complete farce.  It was carried out in a haphazard fashion and more often than not the small farmers whose lands were inspected were never visited.  The Minister has failed to tackle the problem.  He has kept thousands of farmers from benefiting from the cattle and sheep headage grants in 1990. The Minister led these farmers to believe that they would be included in this scheme but he as done little about formulating Ireland's case in Europe for the extension of the disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot add much to the case which was strongly presented by Deputy Sheehan.  Among the many hundreds of farmers that I have dealt with who have applied for inclusion under the scheme, there is total disillusionment with the Government.  Many of them feel they have been led up the garden path by the present Coalition Government.  In many instances three or four years has passed since application was made and there has been scarcely any action since. <Col N="1363" /> There has been no action, only words, for the past two years and unfortunately the same tune still seems to be on the record.</P>
      <P>I want an assurance from the Minister as to when the file will go to Brussels and if there will be enough money provided by the Government to properly finance the farmers who are included in the scheme.  It was publicly stated by a Fianna Fáil MEP that we would have this information by St. Patrick's Day.  Perhaps he means St. Patrick's Day in 1993 or 1994 because St. Patrick's Day 1990 has come and gone and there has been no action. The same gentleman has also stated that the amount of acreage included would not be determined by the conditions of the scheme but by the amount of finance made available by the Government.  It is a disgrace if people who are entitled to be included in the scheme are kept out because of the lack of finance being made available by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>The promised extension of the disadvantaged areas is long overdue by a number of standards, from Fianna Fáil election promises to commitments made by Ministers in the Chamber at Question Time last November and promises made by an MEP in Munster with regard to St. Patrick's Day as a deadline.  The disadvantaged areas scheme goes some way towards ensuring the continued viability of many of the most marginalised in agriculture.  The Minister should take into consideration that since 1983 more than 34,000 dairy producers alone have been forced out of milk production because they could not eke out a living, not to mention those who have not got a milk quota to bolster their farming income.  In 1989, 7,000 farmers, milk producers and non-milk producers, were forced to leave the land, according to the CSO.  Apart from the immediate consequences for those families, the viability of life in rural Ireland is under threat in the long term.  Unless an extension of the disadvantaged areas is announced in the very near future far greater numbers of farmers will be forced <Col N="1364" /> to seek a livelihood elsewhere.  That has grave social consequences.</P>
      <P>I would urge the Minister to make every effort to grant the maximum possible extension in order to ensure the viability of those farmers about whom I have spoken.</P>

      <P>The present review of the disadvantaged areas is the fourth review since the original designation of areas in 1975 and is by far the most detailed and comprehensive survey carried out to date.  The following outline will give Deputies some idea of the magnitude of the task undertaken by departmental staff.  As regards the volume of representations made, requests from various sources to have all parts of the existing disadvantaged areas outside the more severely handicapped areas reclassified had been received together with requests for inclusion by interest groups representing areas outside the disadvantaged areas.  The areas involved covered east Cavan, mid-Clare, east Galway, north Kerry, most of Longford, Monaghan and Offaly, south Roscommon, all Westmeath and parts of Wicklow.  Requests to have large tracts of Carlow, Cork, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois, Limerick, Louth, Tipperary, Waterford and Wexford and smaller tracts of Dublin and Meath included in the survey were also submitted to the Department.  In all, 900 submissions and representations by public representatives, county councils, farm organisations, local interest groups and individuals were made to the Department on behalf of some 75,000 farmers and in respect of 86,000 holdings.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1365" /> A further indication of how formidable the task was can be gauged from the fact that the area submitted for survey represented 40 per cent of the 55 per cent of all land in the country outside the more severely handicapped areas.  The fourth review was by far the most comprehensive in coverage and extent of all boundary reviews undertaken to date.  It is estimated, for example, that the work load involved was four to five times that of the third review which took place between 1981-85.  Deputies will also appreciate that the decision taken in 1981 to replace the DED by the townland as the basis for review increased the survey work considerably.</P>
    <P>I will briefly outline the criteria for the survey: That less than 7.8 per cent of the area is ploughed; stocking rate is less than one adult bovine livestock unit per forage hectare; the family farm income per male farm worker does not exceed 80 per cent of the national average; not more than 27 people per square kilometre and at least 30 per cent of working population engaged in agriculture.  All those points will have to be observed if areas are to be included.</P>

      <P>The nationwide review I have referred to involved two surveys &mdash; one by livestock agricultural officers and the second by Land Commission inspectors. The first part of the survey commenced on 29 January 1989.  The amount of raw data to be processed following this very extensive review was extremely large and the processing and analysis of it had to be done in a very short period of time.  This work is now nearing completion and it is hoped to present to Government in the very near future a list of the areas throughout the entire country deemed eligible for designation as disadvantaged or for reclassification to a more favourable status.</P>

      <P>As soon as the Government approve this list of areas it will be submitted to the EC Commission for their approval of the areas concerned.  It is our hope that this approval can be obtained before the end of the Irish Presidency and that the relevant EC regulation listing the successful areas can be published in mid-1990. When that is done the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the classification of new and existing areas will be revealed.</P>
      <P>It has not been the practice in the course of any previous reviews of our disadvantaged areas to disclose which areas are being submitted to the EC Commission for approval prior to publication of the EC regulation approving those areas and I do not propose to depart from that practice of non-disclosure now. I am sure Deputies would agree that it would not be proper or in accordance with protocol to anticipate EC decisions of this nature before the relevant regulation was published.</P>

      <P>It would be appropriate to start by saying cad a dhéanfaimíd feasta gan adhmad.  This is a problem peculiar to small sawmills.  There is a perception of unfairness in the present practice by Coillte.  A total of 970,000 cubic metres are produced per year, of which 600,000 cubic metres are reserved for the bigger sawmills.  Last year the small sawmills got an increase of 50 per cent over the amount given previously but this amounted to only 70,000 cubic metres. This is not enough for them.  They need at least 300,000 cubic metres to keep going.</P>
      <P>Over 1,000 people are employed in this industry and another 1,000 are indirectly employed.  Most of the saw log material they require is for post rail fencing and pallet making.  These products are made to customer design on a local base.  They are designed towards the customer, not mass produced.  They are particularly suitable for small farmers and particularly for those stud farms which require fencing.  The vast majority of these are in rural areas where not only is the service needed but the job is appreciated.</P>
      <P>There is a great sense of grievance because most of the job lots available from Coillte are perceived as being sold in such a way as to knock out the smaller man.  The lots are far too big for a small man to buy.  Not only is the sum of money too large but the area is too big and the time required to clear it too long.  It is geared in a sense towards the bigger man and to the detriment of the smaller man. The danger here is of a monopoly.  The average price of logsaw last year was £31.50 per cubic metre.  As lately as two weeks ago some of these people paid £57 per cubic metre which suggests that somebody in the area is trying to push the price up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These people were in this country even before the State was founded, before the forests were planted.  Three and four generations of these families have been in the business.  They are not gearing towards the construction business nor are the vast majority of them gearing towards wood that meets the SR 11 standard. However, because people on the board <Col N="1368" /> of Coillte represent the bigger sawmills the perception is that there is an attempt to cut out the smaller man.  I am frightened by this.  It takes only seven cubic metres of logsaw to keep one man employed in a sawmill per week but it takes 100 cubic metres to keep him in a mass production unit.  Unfortunately, the perception is fairly soundly based that there is a campaign against the small sawmillers, the family associations whom we all hold very dear.  I hope the Minister will ensure through his representations that the family firm, the small man who is employing six or seven local people, will be provided with the timber.  At present most of them have not enough timber to continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Mr. Jacob Mr. Jacob">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jacob</NameTxt>
      <P>The wellbeing and contribution in business of the small, family timber operator has been of great concern to me for several years.  I have voiced this concern on a number of occasions in this House and in other appropriate fora. This type of operation is providing in all several thousand worth-while jobs nationwide. For that reason alone all efforts must be made by all concerned to ensure the continuity of these jobs.  This is of particular significance to my county of Wicklow which percentagewise has more areas planted with forestry than any other county in Ireland.  Forestry and the timber business in general play a huge role in County Wicklow's economy.  The timber business is the county's largest employer.  The small, family type business in Wicklow is currently providing several hundred jobs, the equivalent of a substantial factory.  If such a factory were to close down in Wicklow, or anywhere in the country for that matter, there would be a furore and public outcry, yet all the signs are that the small operator is being frozen out with similar disastrous job losses.  The silence is deafening with nobody appearing to notice or to take appropriate action to avert such a disaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am calling on the Minister and all others concerned to look at this and to take the necessary action.  The many small, family timber business operators <Col N="1369" /> in Wicklow and throughout the country have been involved in the timber business for generations, long before any of us were born.  They know their business extremely well and most of them know no other business.  The livelihood of these small operators is of paramount importance. They must not be neglected or maltreated in the progress towards improvement for the larger operators.</P>
    <P>It is gratifying to see the major improvement in the fortunes of the larger, more sophisticated units.  The move towards added value and the emphasis on quality are to be welcomed and applauded.  However, there is nothing whatsoever to be gained by punishing the small operators by imposing unrealistic and unattainable conditions on them or by preventing them from having ready access to a regular supply of timber of the type necessary for their operations.  Most of these small, family type timber men are experienced and responsible.  They know their job; they know their timber.  They know their markets and they are fully aware these markets would disappear speedily if they did not maintain a high level of quality.</P>
    <P>Heretofore local foresters, great, accomplished and under-recognised as they are, had discretion with regard to distribution and allocation of timber.  I suggest here to the Minister that that discretion be reintroduced so that those local foresters can, if they wish, distribute blocks of timber to these small local operators. I appeal to the Minister and to all concerned to take all steps promptly to ensure that the small, family type timber businessmen, working effectively and efficiently and within the law, are furnished with their timber supplies in the quantity, quality and type appropriate to their requirements at a non-disadvantageous price <i>vis-à-vis</i> the larger units.  Then we can be assured that these traditional people will carry on for further generations and that the jobs at present imperiled will be saved.  Then we can be assured that ordinary common sense is prevailing.</P>

      <P>I propose to give one <Col N="1370" /> minute of my time to Deputy John Browne.  I rise in support of the previous speakers.  If we are not careful the small family sawmillers will become, if they have not already become, an endangered species.  If the Minister does not review the workings of Coillte we will run into a monopoly position which will be unhealthy not alone for the forestry business but for the sawmilling business.</P>
      <P>Some red herrings have been thrown out by various organisations about the small family sawmillers in the area of taxation.  The history of forestry in the black economy is legendary.  However, I think Coillte are correct in their attitude that anybody seeking to buy a product from them must have a clear certificate from his local tax inspector.  Now the small family sawmillers are getting their act together, but unless they get some support from the Minister and Coillte they will not last.  All over the country small, family sawmillers have been providing a very good service to the local community.  Their product is not highly finished; they leave that to the bigger operators.  What they produce is fencing and pallet work.  There is a niche in the market for this type of product and it will be a sorry day for this country if they are allowed to go out of business.  The Minister should set down criteria whereby local foresters will be empowered to sell products to the local small sawmillers.  Provided these local sawmillers hold their clearance certificate, they should be given the raw material to allow them continue in business.

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I thank Deputy Nolan for allowing me a minute of his time.  I concur with the previous speakers and I ask the Minister to investigate why the small sawmillers are either not getting timber from Coillte at present or are getting it in very small supply. In County Wexford the small sawmillers have been told in no uncertain fashion by Coillte that by the end of this year they will be getting no further supplies of timber and they may as well close down. <Col N="1371" /> If this happens it will have serious consequences for a number of small, family sawmillers in the Wexford area with a serious loss of jobs.  The small sawmillers provide a very valuable service to the local farmers in pallet making and to the local timber merchants.  The system of tendering is totally working against the small sawmiller.  A bone of contention among the small sawmillers there is that because the large sawmillers are represented on the double on the board of Coillte they are being squeezed out.  I ask the Minister to assure us here tonight that that is not the case, but I find it very difficult as a public representative to get any satisfaction whatever from Coillte. They have been telling the small sawmillers they are wasting their time going to their local politicians that they were in the clutches of politicans for far too long and should be kept away from us.  That is an absolute disgrace.  I ask the Minister to investigate that also.  As public representatives we have a right to make representations on behalf of the sawmillers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very interested to hear the points that have been raised.  I am disappointed in a way that only tonight these points have been made to me.  I cannot recall having had any representations from any of the Deputies who have spoken about the points they have raised here other than the matter being raised today.  I assure them that as far as I am concerned the small sawmills will continue in existence. Certainly they will not go out of existence because of any big brother deciding they shall not have supplies.  That will always be my position in the matter as long as I am Minister.</P>
      <P>Coillte Teoranta operate a number of sales methods with the objective of ensuring continuity of supply to the sawmill industry and allowing the industry to plan more effective output and managing strategies. These include a contract allocation scheme for small as well as large sawlog.</P>
      <P>A contract allocation scheme for large sawlog was first introduced in 1982 to improve industrial efficiency, achieve additional added value and contribute to import substitution in the construction sector.  The scheme was revised in 1986, placing greater emphasis on the standard of sawing, drying, grading and preservation of timber.  A pilot scheme introduced for small sawlog in 1987 proved to be a success and was extended in 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The top grade sawmills are all <Col N="1373" /> achieving record throughputs and Irish timber now dominates the market for sawn timber with an estimated 50 per cent share.  It goes without saying that the production of quality timber is a major requirement and to encourage this all structural timbers &mdash; both Irish and imported &mdash; will have to meet the requirements set down in the National Standards Authority of Ireland's Standard Recommendation SR11/88 from 1 January 1989.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, timber supplies will increase substantially in the near future, as an increasing percentage of the forest estate reaches maturity.  Forecasts are that production from public forests will rise from 1.5 million cubic metres in 1989 to 3 million by the turn of the century.</P>
    <P>Currently demand in the sawlog sector exceeds supply.  Demand in the pulpwood sector is also buoyant.  There are two pulpwood plants in production and the possibilities for a third are being explored, as the House knows.  Irish timber now dominates the domestic market for construction timber with a 60 per cent share, which is expected to increase to 80 per cent by 1993, a dramatic turnaround from the position which existed ten or 15 years ago.</P>
    <P>Quality and added value are the key components of a policy aimed at exploiting the valuable national resources that Irish forests represent.  The extent to which the sawmilling sector is dominated by a small number of large mills is indicative of the capital intensive nature of the industry in terms of its capacity to exploit the demands imposed by the production of quality products.  It is a fact of life that the resources necessary to compete at this level will not be available to many of the small sawmill operators.  This is recognised fully by me and my officials. I understand that Coillte also recognise this fact.  Indeed Coillte's response in the short term has been to increase the volume of timber made available through local sales by 50 per cent in 1990.  That is a change in policy which will be implemented through out 1990.  The small sawmilling operators will benefit immediately from this increase.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1374" /> Now that Coillte Teoranta have completed their first full year of operation and negotiations with the Commission in Brussels are nearing completion on the operational programme for forestry, I want to proceed at full steam with the preparation of a strategy for the development of the timber industry of the year 2000.  This will cover both the pulpwood and sawmilling sectors.  An interim strategy for the sawmill industry, aimed at encouraging investment in mills which have the capacity to precess at least 25,000 cubic metres per annum, meets the highest standards and are export oriented is already in place.</P>
    <P>In preparing this strategy to the year 2000, the development needs of the small sawmilling sector will be fully considered. The essential purpose of these strategies is to ensure that the future development of the Irish timber sector is focused on the needs of the Irish and international market place.  By concentrating on market driven development and by using all the resources of the State, including the IDA and their company development programme, Eolas and their technology programmes, and Coillte Teoranta and their planting and silvicultural and marketing programmes, the industry as a whole can more easily prepare itself for the challenges and opportunities of 1992 and beyond.</P>
    <P>There are compelling reasons for small operators to look towards upgrading their technology in order to compete in the more valuable end of the market.  One way of approaching this would be through rationalisation.  This approach has the value of economies of scale and not only will it guarantee the protection of existing jobs but will generate new jobs arising from the greater exploitation of home and export markets.</P>
    <P>In moving ahead with a development strategy for the timber industry, I would like Deputies to be assured that the development of the industry will be examined from the ground up.  That includes large mills and small mills.  In this regard the needs of the small sawmillers will be fully taken into account.  I feel sure that in our future strategy we <Col N="1375" /> can, together with those involved, identify niche areas which will exploit market opportunities to generate greater wealth and jobs in our country.</P>
    <P>I want to respond to the point made by some Deputies in regard to representation of some of the larger sawmilling industries on the board of Coillte Teoranta.  I assure the House that there are special procedures adopted by the board of Coillte to ensure there is no possibility of any conflict of interest or influence being implemented by way of the representation that is there.  I <Col N="1376" /> inherited this situation.  If there is a conflict of interest with regard to representation on the board it will certainly be a matter of very great concern to me and I will ask those who are members of the board to examine the position themselves to see if they consider there is any conflict of interest in their membership of the board and their representation of the companies they belong to.  That matter would be of concern to me if it was seen to be borne out as seems to have been suggested here in this debate.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.35 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 28 March 1990.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25, 35, 42, 50, 55 and 57 together.</P>
      <P>Since 1 January 1990, I have had a number of meetings with other Community Social Affairs Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 20 February 1990, in the context of the Troika of Social Affairs Ministers, comprising the current and two succeeding Presidencies, I had a meeting with the Italian and Luxembourg Ministers, at which the Irish Presidency work programme was discussed.  The main item <Col N="1141" /> for discussion was a timetable for dealing with Commission proposals under the action programme following adoption at the European Council in Strasbourg in December, 1989, by 11 member states, of the Charter of Fundamental Social Rights.</P>
    <P>On 22 February 1990, I met Mr. Michael Howard, who had recently been appointed to the post of the UK Secretary of State for Employment.  We discussed the Social Affairs Presidency programme, in particular proposals to tackle long-term unemployment and to assist Hungary and Poland to develop vocational training.</P>
    <P>An informal meeting of Social Affairs Ministers held in Dublin on 1 and 2 March was attended by Ministers from all Community member states except Luxembourg. At that meeting, we discussed the Presidency paper on long-term unemployment, proposals to assist vocational training in Hungary and Poland, particularly through the establishment of a European training foundation.  Commissioner Papandreou also gave a progress report on the social dialogue, which involves consultations between the social partners at Community level.</P>
    <P>Concerning the European Social Charter, the position is that this will be implemented by way of series of individual measures based on an action programme of proposals presented by the Commission.  I decided that, in addition to advancing the individual Commission proposals as they arose, there was a need for an initiative that would bring a longer term coherent perspective to bear on the Council's work in this area.  The action programme is complex and substantial, comprehending as it does almost 50 items, many of them proposals for legal instruments.  I considered that a programme of work covering a number of Presidencies was essential if the programme was to be completed within a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>At the meeting of the Troika on 20 February, Commissioner Papandreou indicated the proposals the Commission would put forward in 1990 and those which she would endeavour to present in <Col N="1142" /> 1991.  Following the consultations with my Troika colleagues, I prepared a timetable containing particulars of the proposals which the Commission proposes to present.  The procedure was an attempt on my part to ensure that by the end of 1992 all the proposals in the action programme would have been examined and decided.  The other Troika members agreed to co-operate through their Presidency programmes to facilitate the achievement of that target.  I believe that the initiative which I have taken will ensure that maximum progress is made in implementing the action programme.</P>

      <P>The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, was formally enacted in April 1989.  I made a commencement order bringing the Act into operation on 1 November 1989 and the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health were also established on the same date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provision for a separate grant for the Authority has been included in the Draft Estimate 1990 for my Department.  In January the Authority submitted to me their programme of work for 1990-92. The programme sets out the proposed activities and priorities and emphasises the preventive philosophy included in the Act.  The Authority will continue to monitor safety and health in the traditional sectors including manufacturing industry, construction and mines and quarries. In addition, the Authority will extend their operations to the new entrant sectors, giving special attention in 1990 to the health sector and to the complex problems of safety and health in the farming and forestry sectors.  The Authority are using the powers in the 1989 Act to set up several advisory committees to <Col N="1143" /> undertake specific tasks.  In this way the Authority are availing themselves, on a consultative basis, of a wider range of advice and expertise from various interest groups.</P>
    <P>At the formal launch of the Authority's programme on 24 January 1990, I expressed my satisfaction at the prompt production of a wide ranging action plan. I would expect that the programme will make a progressive contribution towards the creation by employers, in co-operation with their workers, of a safe and healthy environment at all our workplaces.</P>

      <P>All applications for funding by non-statutory groups which provide services for Irish emigrants to Britain are considered by DÍON, the emigrant welfare advisory committee, which makes recommendations to me on the distribution of State aid.  Last year, £500,000 was allocated to my Department for the purpose of grant aiding such groups.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of DÍON state that they should make recommendations on the provision of financial assistance towards the employment of professional workers dealing with the welfare problems of Irish workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>DÍON, on the basis of their experience and consultations with a wide range of Irish community support organisations, have identified a range of priority concerns, which they have published and according to which they assess and evaluate grant applications and submissions received from voluntary organisations. The key priorities identified by DÍON are as follows: front-line advice services for emigrants and outreach services for unemployed youths, travellers, women <Col N="1144" /> and children in temporary accommodation, day care centres for the elderly and special projects to assist the unemployed.</P>
    <P>I understand that DÍON take the view that provision for single homeless people should properly be identified as a local authority responsibility and that the development of special provision for Irish needs, in terms of hostel accommodation, should proceed only on the basis of clear commitment by the appropriate borough.  The attention of local authorities in London is being directed to the shortfalls in their provision for homeless Irish people.</P>
    <P>I am advised that the Kerry Association (London) did make an application for funding to DÍON in 1989 and this application was considered in accordance with the criteria set out above.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 31, 56 and 70 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there is a significant imbalance between male and female earnings.  Progress has been slow, if steady, and while we may draw some comfort from that, I am not satisfied that the gap is closing.  Neither am I satisfied that replacing or amending the law is the only answer.  The fact is that the differences in industrial earnings result from a wide range of factors.  These include wage rates but, also, hours worked, overtime payments, shift or unsocial hours premia, payment by results, bonuses for output levels and payments for length of service.  There is also the point that the statistics which we normally use cover only a percentage of women who are at work and relate to women in manufacturing industry where there is a tendency for women to be segregated into certain low pay areas and confined to a restricted range of jobs.</P>
      <P>The solution to the differential in pay between men and women does not lie in equal pay legislation alone but in improved access for women to a wider range of jobs.  Nevertheless, there are a number of changes which I propose to make to the provisions of the 1974 Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, in the context of the general review of the employment equality legislation.  These changes will simplify and make more effective the procedures for the pursuit of equal pay for work of equal value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The employment of women in a wider range of jobs and at higher levels in the jobs they hold is essential to reducing the imbalance between male and female earnings.  In this regard several steps are being taken, particularly, in the areas of <Col N="1146" /> improved training and access to employment, positive action and equality of opportunity in our educational system.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to alter the present situation in regard to the burden of proof; our present practice is that once a <i>prima facie</i> case has been made by the claimant the onus then rests with the employer to prove that a pay difference is not based on the sex of the employee.  This is broadly in accord with European thinking.</P>
    <P>I am giving priority to the preparation of legislation which will extend the benefits of a range of labour laws to most regular part-time employees who are currently excluded because of the application of minimum hours thresholds.  The process is now at an advanced stage and it is my intention to introduce a Bill to the Oireachtas this year.</P>

      <P>The question of decentralisation of the Labour Court has been raised from time to time.  The number and distribution of Labour Court hearings would not, however, justify the location of a division of the Court in Cork or elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The Court held 856 hearings during 1989 of which 567 &mdash; 66 per cent &mdash; were in Dublin and 90 &mdash; 11 per cent &mdash; were in Cork.  The remaining 199 hearings were held in different locations throughout the country.</P>

      <P>My Department and the Department of Education are jointly involved in the development of our human resources and, to this end, mount a number of training initiatives, either individually or jointly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Joint initiatives include apprenticeship training, hotel catering and tourism industry training, Youthreach and the community and young traveller training workshops for early school leavers.  In addition, both Departments are involved in initiatives sponsored by the European Community, including Eurotechnet, Petra, young worker exchange and the youth for Europe programmes.  There is also close contact between the schools <Col N="1149" /> guidance service of the Department of Education and FÁS.  The provision recently of a new series of career leaflets resulted from this co-operation.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education are also represented on the Councils of CERT and FÁS.</P>
    <P>Both myself and the Minister for Education appreciate the importance of close co-operation between both our Departments and their agencies to improve education and training provision for young people who have completed compulsory schooling and for adults.  We, accordingly, established an education and training joint planning committee representative of the two Departments and their appropriate agencies to futher such provision in co-operation with each other.</P>

      <P>In 1990, CERT will train over 9,000 people which represents an increase of 16 per cent on the numbers trained in 1989.  The CERT non-capital budget for 1990 is £7.5 million, compared with £6.2 million in 1989, comprising £3.2 million Exchequer, £3.9 million European Social Fund and £0.4 million own income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main private interests in the hotel, catering and tourism industry are represented on the council of CERT and can thus influence the type of training and other services provided.  This of necessity ensures close liaison between the private sector of industry and CERT.  This liaison is essential to ensure that CERT provides the right type of training and that the industry provides employment conditions <Col N="1150" /> that will attract people to stay in the industry in Ireland when trained.</P>
    <P>I might add that the private sector increased their financial contribution to CERT in 1989.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to announce what I consider will be a significant improvement in the overall numbers and quality of SES <Col N="1151" /> supervisors.  This improvement will come about as a result of the following changes which will be implemented by FÁS with effect from 30 April 1990: all private/ voluntary projects of five to 14 workers will be paid a flat-rate of £155 per week to employ a supervisor, and all private/ voluntary projects of 15 workers or more will be paid £175 per week to employ a supervisor.  These new wage levels will be guaranteed for the 52 weeks of the project.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>Work permit applications are considered in accordance with the provisions of the Aliens Act, 1935, Aliens Orders, 1946 and 1975 and the European Communities (Aliens) Regulations, 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Policy in relation to the granting or refusal of a work permit is based on the need to ensure that employment opportunities arising here are reserved, as far as possible, for Irish and EC nationals. The granting of a work permit is not considered unless an employer can show that, despite all reasonable efforts, no suitably qualified Irish or European Community nationals are available for the position in question or unless the application falls into one of the following categories: (a) the prospective employee is a key worker and a substantial amount of high quality employment for Irish/EC <Col N="1152" /> nationals will arise as a result of his/her employment; (b) the prospective employee is married to an Irish or EC national or a dependant or child aged under 21 of an Irish or EC national; (c) the person is coming as part of an officially recognised exchange programme; (d) the prospective employee is an officially recognised refugee.</P>
    <P>Non-EC nationals in respect of whom work permits are issued must also satisfy immigration regulations.</P>
    <P>The main change in recent years is that the spouses, dependants and children of workers who are nationals of other EC countries are now accorded the same treatment as if they were relations or dependants of an Irish national.  This is in accordance with European Council Regulation 1612/68.</P>
    <P>In general, my Department are more vigorously ensuring that work permits are not issued except where it is clear that EC nationals are not available for the employment in question.  As well, permits are issued only for the exact period of employment.  This has contributed, for example, to the increase in the number of permits issued to the medical sector &mdash; more work permits have issued but for shorter periods.</P>
    <P>In relation to the number of work permits processed, the situation is as follows: Before 1986, records kept by my Department related only to work permits actually issued each year.  Since then, records are also kept of the number of work permit applications refused, and the task of extracting information about application refusals prior to 1986 would be very costly and could not be justified.  Subject to that limitation the number of work permits issued each year during the period 1980 to 1989 and the number of applications refused each year since 1986 are as follows:</P>

      <P>I would like to inform the Deputy that there are no plans to phase out the enterprise scheme.  There have, however, been some changes in the operation of the scheme which I announced last September. Allowances paid to participants have been increased from £30 to £40 per week for participants without dependants and from £50 to £65 per week for those with dependants while the duration of payment has been reduced from 52 to 40 weeks in order to give greater financial assistance at the start up phase of enterprises. The scheme has also been integrated with FÁS training programmes whereby participants normally undergo <Col N="1154" /> FÁS training before commencing on the enterprise scheme.</P>

      <P>In seeking to prevent occupational accidents and diseases, the primary focus of my role as Minister for Labour is directed towards limiting exposures to toxic substances and to risks from physical hazards at the workplace.  There are various provisions under current occupational safety and health laws aimed at protecting workers where smoking and other hazards would place them at risk in specific working activities.</P>
      <P>However, it must be recognised that workers share equally with the wider population the risks from lifestyle diseases. The adverse effect of smoking is a general public health issue and I welcome the measures taken by my colleague, the Minister for Health, in that regard.  I believe that employers, in co-operation with their workers, can contribute much in helping to reduce the overall levels of lifestyle diseases such as smoking related cancer.  I know that several companies have health educational programmes in operation and I would encourage others to consider the promotion of similar voluntary schemes.  I will maintain contact with the Minister for Health on the development of his general health programme on smoking.</P>
      <P>I do not have immediate plans to amend the two statutes referred to by the Deputy.  However, the new National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health will have the task over the coming years of reviewing and putting forward proposals for updating existing occupations safety and health legislation including the two statutes mentioned.</P>

      <P>The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, which came into operation on 1 November 1989, applies to all employers, their employees and the self-employed. It also relates to the safety and health of other persons who may be affected by work activities.  Earlier legislation, including the Safety in Industry Acts, 1955 and 1980, the Office Premises Act, 1958, and the Dangerous Substances Acts, 1972 and 1979, will remain in force &mdash; except for a limited number of repeals &mdash; in their respective areas alongside the 1989 Act.</P>
      <P>Under the 1989 Act, the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health have overall responsibility for administering an enforcing occupational safety and health legislation.  The Authority also have the function of keeping relevant legislation under review and of submitting to me proposals for improvements. I will be giving careful consideration to any such proposals which the Authority may submit, based on their observation of the operation of the existing legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over time, I would expect that a number of provisions of the existing enactments on safety and health will be repealed and replaced by regulations and-or codes of practice, as provided for in the 1989 Act.  We must also expect changes arising from developments at European Community level in the occupational safety and health area.  These will be incorporated into our national legislation on an ongoing basis through the implementation of the provision of EC Directives.  That process will help to establish a unified code of primary <Col N="1159" /> legislation, regulations and codes of practice on safety and health at work.</P>
    <P>In January last, I received the proposed work programme 1990-1992 of the authority. On the basis of this programme, I am satisfied that arrangements for the development, review and enforcement of occupational safety and health legislation are being tackled progressively.  I expect that the activities of the authority will provide an inpetus for employers, in co-operation with their employees, to work towards a continuing improvement in safety and health at all workplaces.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 75 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>The Dauphin helicopters were acquired primarily as a replacement for the Alouette III helicopters which have been operated by the Air Corps since 1963.  The Alouettes are basically fair weather machines which cannot operate in circumstances of reduced visibility or at night and are limited in their operations over the sea because they are single engined aircraft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dauphin helicopters have provided a vast improvement in the air sea <Col N="1164" /> rescue capacity of the Air Corps, particularly in terms of operations at night and over the sea.  Since the Dauphins were acquired they have flown 252 search and rescue missions as a result of which 187 people were rescued.  They have also carried out 97 air ambulance missions including 20 island relief missions.</P>
    <P>A programme for the upgrading of helicopter re-fuelling sites at a number of locations on the west coast is at present in progress.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in reply to Question No. 19 on 8 March 1990, the question of the adequacy of this country's helicopter resources for air/sea rescue purposes is likely to be considered by the Government in the near future in the light of the report of the Committee on Air/Sea Rescue Services which was recently presented to the Minister for the Marine.</P>

      <P>Conflicting reports from Government and opposition sources as to recent military gains make an accurate <Col N="1165" /> assessment of the current situation extremely difficult.</P>
      <P>Fighting, since the resumption last November of hostilities in the south, has been concentrated in two main regions &mdash; Western Equatoria and the Upper Nile. The Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) has launched several attacks on Government army convoys and has claimed to have captured a number of army garrison posts both in the southern border region (Torit, Yei, Nimule) and in Western Equatoria (Amadi, Wau). Earlier this year SPLA forces were reported to have penetrated further north to within reach of the town of Marakal, about 800 km from Khartoum, but according to Government sources in mid-March the attack on the town has been repulsed.</P>
      <P>The southern capital of Juba came under SPLA attack in December but following Government action earlier this year the threat to the city now appears to have receded.  In January, the Government allowed the resumption of relief flights to Juba and other cities, such as Wau and Malakal, despite threats by the SPLA to shoot down any unapproved flights.</P>
      <P>Ireland, together with its partners in the Twelve, has repeatedly called for a cessation of hostilities and urged all parties to the conflict in Sudan to resume efforts aimed at the peaceful resolution of the civil war.  Under Ireland's Presidency of the European Community, Foreign Ministers of the Twelve, renewed this appeal in their statement of 20 February and called once again for all necessary steps to be taken to launch Phase II of the successful operation lifeline Sudan relief programme, which aims to bring much needed relief to those suffering the devastating effects of the war.  We will continue with our European partners to promote the cause of peace in Sudan.</P>

      <P>The main ways in which bilateral <Col N="1166" /> aid can be made available to the Sudan are the bilateral aid programme, the disaster relief fund and the Agency for Personal Service Overseas.</P>
      <P>The bilateral aid programme (BAP) is the major source of Irish assistance to the Sudan.  Budgetary provision is being made for expenditure of £610,000 in the Sudan in 1990.  This represents a significant increase on the actual expenditure of £345,200 in 1989.</P>
      <P>It is not possible at this stage to anticipate what disaster relief assistance, if any, will be provided in 1990 but the situation in the Sudan is being monitored on a continuous basis.  Expenditure under disaster relief for 1989 amounted to £375,000.</P>
      <P>The Agency for Personal Service Overseas (APSO) fund a number of assignees in the Sudan and expenditure in 1990 is estimated at £108,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister for Finance provides the coinage, the minting of the coinage is a matter for the Central Bank.  I understand from the bank that there will be a requirement in 1990 to mint approximately 125 million coins. This is double the amount minted in each of the last three years.  To meet this exceptional demand, the Bank proposes to import 20 million of the 50 million new £1 coins.  Nonetheless, over 100 million coins of various denominations, including the new £1 coin, will be minted in Ireland this year.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank inform me that the minting programme will provide full employment for the 12 staff in the Mint plus considerable additional work in the form of overtime.  No job losses will result from the importation of coins.  The temporary arrangement is not being made at the expense of extra employment.</P>
      <P>There will be no cost to the Government from the importation, since the expenses of the issue of the coinage are borne by the Central Bank.  The matter was not discussed by the Central Review Committee.</P>

      <P>It is a condition for continued receipt of deserted wife's payment that a recipient continue to make reasonable efforts within the means available to her to seek maintenance from her husband if he is in a position to support her.  As the husband of the person concerned is employed she was requested to provide evidence of her efforts to seek maintenance but to date has failed to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the level of maintenance is as described by the Deputy, the recipient would no longer be entitled to receive a desertion payment.  There is no legal provision within social welfare legislation to pay the difference between a desertion payment and the maintenance received. Where a deserting spouse fails to honour a maintenance order, the deserted party should seek enforcement proceedings. The ongoing entitlement to deserted wife's payment is reviewed in the light of the outcome of such proceedings.  The <Col N="1191" /> rules and procedures applicable to maintenance payments to deserted spouses are being reviewed in the context of provisions to pursue deserting spouses for contributions towards the cost of income maintenance payments provided to their families by the Department.</P>

      <P>Payment of disability benefit was disallowed to the person concerned from 5 October 1989 following an examination by a medical referee who considered him capable of work.

    <P>The case was then referred to an appeals officer who held an oral hearing on 28 February 1990.  The person concerned attended the hearing alone although he was advised of his right to <Col N="1192" /> have his own doctor present in support of his appeal.</P>
    <P>Having regard to all the facts available to him, the appeals officer decided that the person concerned was capable of work within the meaning of the Social Welfare Acts from 5 October 1989 and is not entitled to be paid disability benefit from that date.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the problem referred to and I have taken a number of measures to alleviate it.</P>
      <P>A major part of the problem is in relation to the removal of stray animals to the pound.  A four wheel drive jeep and a double horsebox have been purchased recently for the use of the Garda in the Dublin metropolitan area to enable them, from within their own resources, to transport wandering animals, particularly wandering horses, to the pound. The use of these vehicles by the Garda will supplement the activities of Dublin Corporation and county council who also of course, have a responsibility in this respect.</P>
      <P>Several members of the force attached to the northern division of the Dublin metropolitan area, which includes the Finglas and Ballymun areas, are at present undergoing training in the handling of the new equipment which the Garda authorities expect to have operational within the next few days.</P>
      <P>I have approved by ministerial order, with effect from 22 January 1990, significant increases in the pound fees which are imposed on owners when they come to retrieve animals found wandering (Statutory Instrument No. 4 of 1990).</P>
      <P>In the case of horses, these charges have gone up from £18.40 to £23 per day.  I intend to keep these charges under regular review.  I should also point out that the owner will be required to defray the full cost of any expenses incurred in removing the animal to the pound before it is released.</P>
      <P>The wandering animals problem is not confined to the north Dublin area although it is acknowledged to be most acute there.  The Garda authorities are monitoring the situation closely and are keeping my Department informed of developments.</P>

    <P>As is evident from these figures there has been little variation in the level of reported indictable crime in the county in the years in question.  The Garda authorities have informed me that the increase in the level of reported indictable crime in the Athlone sub-district relates mainly to burglary, larceny from vehicles and larceny from shops and that charges have been brought against persons in connection with a significant number of these crimes.  The Garda authorities have assured me that the position is being kept under review and that whatever further steps may be appropriate to deal with the situation will be taken.</P>

    <P>The block grants at column 1 above, apart from those for Dublin County Council, were allocated strictly in proportion to the mileage of regional and county roads in each county.  They are, on average, 37 per cent higher than the equivalent grants notified in 1989.  In the case of Dublin County Council, the total grant, while higher than would be appropriate on a road mileage basis, represents an increase of 3 per cent compared with 1989.</P>
    <P>The other categories of grants were allocated on the basis of needs identified in relation to the improvement of the roads in question.  I am satisfied that all county councils have received their fair share of the funds available to me for regional and county roads in 1990.</P>
    <P>A traffic counting programme operated by the environmental research unit of my Department provides an estimate of total vehicle miles of travel on all regional and county roads in the State on the basis of a sampling system.  The system was not designed to provide an estimate of the proportion of this travel undertaken in each local authority area. Accordingly, reliable figures of the average volume of vehicular traffic per mile of regional and county road per local authority area are not available.</P>

      <P>E &mdash; Science; or a language other than Irish and English; or Commerce; or a subject of the Business Studies Group</P>
      <P>F &mdash; Civics</P>
      <P>Physical education should form part of the curriculum.  The programme should be based on the approved syllabus and teaching hours should be registered on the school timetable.</P>
      <P>The curriculum should also include provision for singing.  The provision made for singing should be included in the school timetable.</P>
      <P>Home economics and music are optional subjects on the approved course for both junior cycle and senior cycle pupils.  Woodwork at junior cycle and construction studies, the corresponding subject at senior cycle, are optional subjects. Physical education is a non-examination subject for which there is a syllabus designed to cater for pupils following a full post-primary programme.</P>

      <P>The day-to-day running costs of national schools are met by the provision of State capitation grants and contributions from local sources.  The capitation grant is not intended to meet operating costs in full.  Each board of management is responsible, under the Rules for National Schools, for making arrangements for the collection of such funds locally, in supplement of the State grant, as will ensure that the school premises will be adequately heated and cleaned and kept in a proper decorative condition.</P>
      <P>The capitation grant scheme is of general application and it was concluded, after an examination of the matter in 1985, that it would not be possible, within the existing resources available, to depart from the present system of school financing.</P>
      <P>An increase in the capitation grant for national schools is being provided for in 1990.  The standard rate of grant is being increased from £26.50 to £28.00 per pupil.  Furthermore I have secured an increased allocation of £1.5 million for the support of national schools in disadvantaged areas in 1990.</P>
      <P>Special provision for second level schools in disadvantaged areas has been made previously by way of additional teachers.  Moreover, in accordance with the Programme for Government and the current <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> the Government hve decided that extra resources will be made available to provide additional teachers in specific disadvantaged areas.  Appointments will be effective from the start of the 1990/91 school year.  Officials of the Department are at present engaged in discussions with the interested parties on the question of criteria to be applied in determining disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>I would also like to point out that the <i>per capita</i> grant for secondary schools generally has been increased from £140 to £150 with effect from 1 January, 1990.</P>

      <P>I have sanctioned during 1989/90 30 additional remedial teachers in primary schools.  The application in question was unsuccessful on this occasion.  I will, however, be keeping the appointment of further remedial teachers in primary schools under review.</P>

      <P>Applications for payment in respect of the employment of substitutes by school boards of management are made to my Department by the chairpersons of the boards.  Payment, less the appropriate rate of PRSI, is made by my Department to the chairpersons who, in turn, recoup the teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Substitute teachers are employed in respect of absences by full-time teachers on (a) paid sick leave, (b) paid maternity leave, (c) jury service and (d) official <Col N="1219" /> courses.  The daily rates of payment are £38 (trained) and £33.57 (untrained).</P>
    <P>My Department are in regular discussion with all the teachers' associations with regard to their conditions of employment. Currently, a claim on behalf of substitute teachers in relation to pay rates is the subject of arbitration hearings.</P>
