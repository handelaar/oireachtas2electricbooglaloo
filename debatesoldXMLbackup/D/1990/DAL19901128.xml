      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 3, 4, 5, 8 and 17.  It is also proposed, subject to the agreement of the House, that (1) business shall be interrupted not later than 10.30 p.m. tonight and (2) No. 8 shall be taken without debate. It is further proposed that under Standing Order 41 statements shall be made at 3.45 p.m. in connection with the CSCE Summit in Paris.

      <P>May I now ask if the proposal for the 10.30 p.m. sitting tonight is agreed?  Agreed.  Is it also agreed that No. 8 be taken without debate?  Agreed.  Is it further agreed that Private Members' Business shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m? Agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Taoiseach two questions this morning. First, in view of the fact that it is likely that the United Nations Security Council are today going to adopt a resolution sanctioning the use of force in the Gulf will the Taoiseach be prepared to engage in consultations with all parties in the House, through a foreign affairs committee or otherwise, on the position <Col N="306" /> in which this now places the Irish people who still remain in Iraq?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would much prefer if we had special notice of that matter, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask that question in the context of special consultations through a foreign affairs committee or otherwise.  I am sure the Taoiseach would wish to respond in view of the seriousness of what is likely to transpire over the next short while.  The other question relates to legislation.  May I ask the Taoiseach, in view of the imminence of the promulgation of the draft register of electors and in view of the court decision of yesterday that students are entitled to register in two locations, if any arrangements, by way of legislation or otherwise, will be made urgently to ensure that the new draft register takes full account of that court decision and allows students to register in the town in which they are living during their academic year?  Is any legislation contemplated or necessary to deal with the granting of this right which the court has decided students have?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No legislation is promised in respect of the latter matter. I suggest that quite clearly it is a matter for a Dáil question which I would be very happy to answer.  On that score we will have the constituencies revision Bill which will give Deputies an opportunity to talk about that and similar matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of some urgency in view of the imminence of the completion of the draft register.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1990 which is before the House today will the Taoiseach not try to provide time to make the necessary changes as recommended by the Supreme Court yesterday, otherwise further legislation will be necessary?  It would be timely to try to bring it in with <Col N="307" /> the Electoral (Amendment) Bill on which the Minister for the Environment is looking for a Second Stage debate today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

      <P>It is obvious that the Christmas holidays are coming up. When I asked the Taoiseach yesterday about the likely decision of the Security Council of the United Nations, and the impact this may have on Ireland's role in the Gulf crisis, he indicated that he would consider the issue.  May I ask him if he has had an opportunity to consider the matter, if he will take the opportunity to make a statement on it to the House and enable Deputies to put their views.  In my view, Ireland's role should be to insist that a peaceful solution be found to the Gulf crisis.</P>

      <P>The earlier question related to its effect on Irish people in Iraq and Kuwait whereas my question related to its effect on this country and its role in the Gulf and the United Nations. While I am on my feet may I also ask the Taoiseach if he has considered when item No. 14, the fourth Lomé agreement which requires ratification by this House, will be debated in the House?</P>

      <P>I appreciate that we have a new procedure but it is a very urgent matter and I do not think a one minute discussion tonight at 11 o'clock is really adequate to deal with it.  It is an issue of major national importance.</P>

      <P>Is there any relevance in the fact that the explanatory memorandum to the Exchange Control (Continuance) Bill, 1990, contains details of the constituency breakdown applicable to the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1990?  Similarly, the explanatory memorandum to the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1990, contains details of the Exchange Control (Continuance) Bill, 1990.  Will the Taoiseach give an explanation as to how this occurred and ensure that proper explanatory memoranda are circulated in relation to both Bills?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is most definitely legislation that has been proposed.  If you wish I will quote from a question by the former Deputy, Miss Colley, in which she asked whether the Minister for Justice had any proposals for legislation to tighten up on the licensing of moneylenders. The answer was that the legislation was in the early stages of preparation.  Also on the same day the reply to a question was as follows: &ldquo;In that context the Minister for Industry and Commerce will introduce the necessary legislation to implement the EC directive on consumer credit which will encompass moneylending.  The directive is to be implemented by January 1990&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Deputy and draw the Taoiseach's attention to the fact that it was also promised in this session by the Minister for Social Welfare when dealing with the problem in relation to his brief.</P>

I should like to ask the Taoiseach if he is aware of the complete lack of medical and treatment facilities in the doctor's room in Leinster House.  In short, they are pre-Edwardian.

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (4), between lines 37 and 38, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(c)  it is taken in the presence of a solicitor, where such presence has been requested by the detainee and after his right to such a presence has been <Col N="314" /> explained fully by the member requesting or seeking to take the sample.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 1 would be a very important addition to the Bill.  The purpose of the amendment is to establish whenever a sample is to be taken under the provisions of section 2, that the person detained, of whom the sample is required, should have the right to have his or her solicitor present for the purposes of observing the taking of the sample.  There should be an onus on the member who is seeking to take a sample to advise the detainee of his or her right to have a solicitor present for that purpose. Let us remind ourselves that the purpose of this legislation is to enable gardaí to take a large number of samples of the body of the detainee who, for the purposes of our law, is a person presumed to be innocent of any crime.  The legislation provides that a sample of blood, pubic hair, urine, saliva, hair other than pubic hair, a nail or any material found under a nail, a swab from any part of the body other than a body orifice or genital region, a swab from a body orifice or a genital region, a dental impression, a footprint or similar impression of any part of the person's body other than a part of his hand or mouth.  All of these samples can be required of and taken from the person detained.</P>
    <P>There is a general principle in our law that no person is obliged to incriminate themselves, and this Bill is, to some degree, an invasion of that position.  It has been established that police are entitled to this type of authority in the investigation of other types of crime, particularly in the investigation of road traffic accidents involving drunk drivers. It is important that in the process of seeking the assistance of the suspect detainee in complying with these requirements by a member of the Garda Síochána, the suspect detainee is given the fullest possible protection.  The only real effective protection a suspect can hope to have is the advice, presence and independent observation on his or her behalf of the activities of a garda by a solicitor.</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to <Col N="315" /> ensure that the interests of a suspect are protected, that no untoward excess is used in the taking of the sample and that procedures are complied with as far as possible.  This is not to suggest that there will be wholesale abuse of this sort but it is to protect against mistakes which might occur and to protect against the occasional and inevitable rotten apple, a term often used to describe a member of the Garda Síochána who might be inclined to take shortcuts, who might be inclined to doctor or interfere with or set at nought the veracity of the process or a sample being taken.  Penalties are provided in the legislation for persons accused of obstructing the officer seeking to make the request or in any way impeding or refusing to comply with the request.  Therefore, it is important that there be independent observation of the process being undertaken.</P>
    <P>There is a precedent for this type of presence in such cases, particularly when members of the Garda Síochána seek to hold identification parades.  It is the practice and the duty of the Garda to advise the person who is required to stand in an identification parade that they are not obliged to do so, but if they do, whatever conclusions are drawn from the parade can and may be used in evidence against them.  If the detainee requests a solicitor to be in attendance then the Garda are obliged to notify the solicitor and to wait a reasonable period until he attends.</P>
    <P>During the time I worked as a solicitor in this area I attended many identification parades as an observer.  I could not interfere with the holding of a parade or the way it was conducted other than to advise the suspect of the position he or she might take in the parade or advise the sergeant in charge that the parade was not a fair representation of the general demeanour, presence or appearance of the suspect. Often a solicitor may request that all the suspects be attired similarly, for example, in shirt or jumpers.  On occasion he can ask that the people on the parade swap their clothes so that no reference can be made to any garment <Col N="316" /> a suspect might be wearing before the witness comes in.  I did that on one occasion and I remember three of the witnesses watching one pullover as it was moved from person to person &mdash; it appears they had been advised at the time that the colour of the pullover might help them to reach a conclusion.  Perhaps, coincidentally, the three witnesses watched the pullover as it travelled from one person in the parade to another along the line.</P>
    <P>A solicitor has a very important function to play in such cases.  He also has a respected function to play in the conduct of these identification parades.  When a trial comes before the court and all matters have been properly complied with and no complaint is being made from a defence point of view, obviously this greatly facilitates the prosecution in the presentation of their case.  Equally, when questions are raised &mdash; this often happens &mdash; the solicitor is in a position to instruct counsel on the shortcomings which might have appeared in the way the parade was conducted.</P>
    <P>It can be argued that there is a vast difference between an identification parade which involves all the different variables and the taking of a precise bodily sample, for example, a sample of the hair of the suspect, blood and so on &mdash; there can be no argument about the size, colour and shape of the sample taken from the suspect; it is put in a bag and taken away &mdash; but I do not accept that proposition.  This Bill will probably be the hallmark legislation in that it proposes a major commitment and involvement by the investigation authorities &mdash; the Garda Síochána &mdash; in forensic evidence found on the body of a suspect in crime investigation.  This is a new departure and, as was stated on Second Stage, it is a very serious commitment putting the emphasis on the carrying out of police investigations in police stations.</P>
    <P>Once this Bill is passed inevitably there will be a far greater emphasis on police stations as a place of criminal investigation. Much of the work will be carried out in police stations and many of the clues looked for there.  It is essential that <Col N="317" /> when such investigations directly involve a person or the body of a suspect, he or she is entitled to a minimum amount of protection.  I have put down other amendments which deal with the use of videos as an independent record and the need for the proper storage and record of samples once taken, but this is probably the most important protection in that a suspect can opt to have his or her legal adviser present so that on the one hand they can get advice and on the other, they can ensure that the taking of a sample is independently observed.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to include this amendment as a provision of the law, recognising the hallmark development this legislation represents in the new departure in criminal investigation.  I do not believe I am asking too much.  This right probably exists in common law, and in constitutional law, as it stands.  I believe a suspect would, in general, have the right to ask a solicitor to be summoned to a police station to give advice as to whether he or she is obliged to comply with the provisions of the Act, whether and in what circumstances he or she is obliged to submit to the various different tests set out in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is only a small step more to argue that the solicitor should have the right to remain in the room as an observer on behalf of the suspect while the tests are being taken.  There are very important functions which the solicitor can fulfil. He can ensure that excessive force is not engaged in when taking the sample and can ensure that the sample once taken is not tampered with but is put into a sealed container.  If further amendments are accepted by the Minister, the sample will be divided in two, one portion being tendered to the suspect or the solicitor for retention for their independent examination. Things can go wrong in those circumstances and it is important that there should be an independent observer to see that the sample is properly taken, conveyed to the container, sealed properly and taken away in part by the solicitor or the detained person and in part by the police officer for delivery to the <Col N="318" /> forensic science laboratory.  There must be confidence in this process.</P>
    <P>It is a significant development in our law because we are recognising statutorily that the forensic examination of samples of the suspect is an important feature in establishing the guilt or innocence of that suspect.  It is vital that there should be the fullest possible confidence in the process on the part of all agencies and persons involved in the criminal prosecution process.  It would be a great pity if when this legislation is passed the accounts given by suspects of the procedures followed showed that they were not up to the best standards or alternatively if forensic scientists on the part of the defence criticised the conditions in which the sample was retained or claimed that it was interfered with or even destroyed.</P>
    <P>It would be a great pity if criticisms of that type were made, undermining confidence in the process.  It is not an unreal fear.  The Minister may recall the very serious undermining of thumb print impression evidence that occurred in the past decade.  Probably the strongest incontestable forensic test that could be taken for identifying the suspect, the imprint of the finger, was seriously challenged because it was exposed that the best standards were not complied with within the forensic laboratory retained by the police for such examination.  Mistakes were found.  The photographing <i>in situ</i> of the imprint before it was lifted so that it could be independently assessed had been abandoned.  The two officers who went to the High Court to challenge their unfair transfer, as they alleged, from the finger print department exposed at length the collapse in standards within the finger print laboratory.  It was ultimately exposed in the investigation of the death of the late British Ambassador, who was brutally blown up on the way from Glencairn, that the most senior officers, because of a lapse of standards, had made mistakes.</P>
    <P>If anything like that is allowed to happen with regard to this forensic evidence, particularly in the early stages, we will have done a huge disservice.  One of the best ways to ensure that this type <Col N="319" /> of thing does not happen is to give the right to the detained person to be advised by the officer taking the sample of his or her right to have a solicitor present. Where that is requested, the sample should be taken only in the presence of the solicitor.  This is reasonable and I hope the amendments will be agreeable to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke) Raphael P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would preface my remarks on these amendments and others which the Deputy has tabled by reiterating a point I made on Second Stage.  The Garda, if they are successfully to fight crime, need to have available to them the most up-to-date detection techniques that science can provide.  The purpose of the Bill is to provide them with the power to avail of such techniques in the forensic science area.  I recognise that the granting of the powers proposed in the Bill will impinge on personal rights and freedoms and for that reason I have taken very great care to ensure that no power is conferred that is not absolutely necessary and that adequate safeguards will be provided where such power is exercised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that I have achieved a reasonable balance in this Bill and while I accept that these amendments are tabled as a result of genuine concern, I believe they are unnecessary and would upset the balance of the Bill.  The effect of amendments Nos. 1 and 2 would be to give an accused the right to have a solicitor present when a sample is being taken from him and to have a portion of any sample taken given to him or to his solicitor.  As to the presence of a solicitor while samples are taken, I do not see what purpose this would serve.  The Bill provides that an intimate or intrusive sample can only be taken with the appropriate consent and by a registered medical practitioner.  It is hardly necessary for a solicitor to be present to ensure that the doctor adheres to proper ethical standards.  In the case of samples that may be taken without consent, the solicitor would have no right to advise the <Col N="320" /> person in question to resist the taking of the sample.</P>
    <P>Far from providing an additional safeguard by requiring the presence of a solicitor when a sample is taken, it would create practical problems, some of which would be contrary to the interests of the accused.  For example, an accused might have to be detained in custody for longer than would otherwise be necessary simply to await the attendance of his or her solicitor.  How would an accused feel about having his or her solicitor present if a sample was to be taken from an intimate part of the body, particularly if the solicitor and the client were of opposite sexes?  In any event the general rules laid down by the court in accordance with the Constitution and the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, as to the rights of detained persons to consult their solicitors will not be affected by the legislation. In summary I believe that these amendments are unnecessary and impracticable.</P>
    <P>The Deputy touched upon an area included in amendment No. 8, that is the whole question of the integrity of the samples and of non-tampering with them. I will try to explain how samples are treated at present.  The garda who takes a sample or to whom one is given by a doctor generally delivers it by hand to the forensic science laboratory where it is personally received and entered in the records by a scientist.  This is done because the courts insist on continuity of custody of such material.  There is no question of such material being left lying around the station or being handled in any slipshod way.  Once the sample reaches the forensic science laboratory its movements and the tests carried out on it are meticulously logged.  These are the arrangements which have been operating since the forensic science laboratory was established some 15 years ago.  They have operated successfully and without challenge and I see no need to interfere with those arrangements.  It is not relevant to the particular amendment before us but it was touched on by the Deputy in his contribution.</P>
    <Col N="321" />
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the Minister's reply and I am not fully convinced that this is something that will give rise to serious difficulties.  We are dealing with a fundamental right of a person who is brought to a Garda station, and this legislation will have a serious effect on practices in Garda stations.  It is not asking too much that a detainee, an alleged offender, be given an opportunity of inviting a solicitor or legal adviser to stand at his side and proffer whatever advice the circumstances might ordain. The Minister stated that perhaps it was unnecessary that such a right be afforded. On the other hand, I fail to see how the presence of a legal adviser would in any way impede the work of the Garda Síochána, of the prosecuting team in the Garda station, the investigative team, or indeed the registered medical practitioner who will attend.  I fail to see how the innocent presence, purely as an aid, would act as an impediment to the proceedings.  The Minister quite rightly states that we are dealing with something in the nature of a revolution in the area of crime detection. This is a major step forward.  I contend it is right and proper that every opportunity be afforded a detainee to be advised of the circumstances surrounding his detention and the questions put to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the experience of the 1984 Act, particularly the regulations and the statements at the time regarding the tape recording of interviews, the video recording of interviews and the tardiness that followed that is well known, having regard to the fact that these regulations or those envisaged at the time for the introduction of such technology in Garda stations have not been put into effect, I contend further underlines the need for a detainee, an alleged offender, to be given an opportunity of inviting in his legal adviser.  Again, looking at statements from the Garda forensic laboratory, I note it was stated that initially at any rate this new technique will not be used on a daily basis; it is fair to say it will be used in the case of serious crime only.  Perhaps we will not have the introduction of DNA fingerprinting on a measured scale on the Irish criminal law <Col N="322" /> scene.  That underlines the fact that, as far as the Garda Síochána are concerned, the technique will be used only on somewhat rare occasions.  Because of that, because it will not be an ordinary, everyday occurrence in Garda stations I contend it is not asking too much and is not unreasonable to allow the presence of a solicitor at the option of the detainee.</P>
    <P>There may be occasions when a detainee reckons there is no need for him to have a legal adviser at his side.  It is purely optional in that technically the absence of a solicitor or legal adviser will not render the proceedings null and void. It is purely an option, one which can be exercised at the behest of the offender. I fail to see the difficulty the Minister envisages as far as the procedure is concerned. It is my hope he will give the matter further consideration before deciding finally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I must emphasise to the House and to the Deputies concerned about this that I am not saying a solicitor cannot be present.  However, I am saying I am not prepared to make it a condition that a solicitor must be present before a sample can be taken.  Of course the rights of the individual are protected under the Constitution and the Criminal Justice Act, 1984; those rights as to consultation with solicitors will not be in any way affected by the provisions of this Bill.  I want to emphasise that I am not preventing a solicitor from being present but I am not prepared to include it as a condition that a solicitor must be present at all times.  Many of these examinations will be undertaken by a doctor.  There is nobody suggesting that there would be anything improper or that a doctor involved would break any of the ethical rules; indeed the same would apply to Garda operations also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the point the Minister is making in terms of the rights under the 1984 Act but there is a fundamental difference involved between the 1984 Act and what is proposed here, indeed between the right provided under the 1984 Act and what is <Col N="323" /> being sought by way of this amendment. The 1984 Act deals with the right to detain for the purpose of questioning.  It is proper and I have no difficulty with that provided that, in time, we make provision for the video recording of interviews. I do not think it is ever something one would like to do, as a lawyer, that is to be present when a detained person is being questioned.  That is a matter between the interrogator and the detainee.  The suspect has the right to be advised as to his or her rights under the legislation and in general law.  That is there but that does not provide in any way the right that a solicitor can insist on being present when a sample is being taken; there is not that extension there and there is a difference.  The 1984 Act would provide a right for a person detained, for the purposes of this Bill, to have consultation, to be advised, but then I believe the Garda could request the solicitor to leave the room and they would then carry on with the taking of the tests.</P>
      <P>I am saying that we should provide the right in the Bill that, first, where legal representation is requested by the detained person, then that right should exist.  I am not saying that it is a must in every circumstance.  That is not what is being sought in the amendment.  I am saying that where the detained person requests it then there should be an obligation, then the &ldquo;must&rdquo; enters into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason there is a need for it is to have an independent record.  The Minister makes the point that many of the samples will be taken by a medical practitioner, that therefore no one can suggest there would be any impropriety. Even if there is never an element of impropriety entering into the circumstances, even if one were not to argue in that fashion, the need to maintain confidence in the process still demands some form of independent observation. Doctors who are retained by the Garda Síochána as doctors on call to go to police stations for the purpose of taking samples under the provisions of the Road Traffic Acts, or when there are allegations of assault to come and look at a suspect, a <Col N="324" /> detained person, to ensure there are no marks on them, or to carry out an examination to ascertain the precise position are cross-examined repeatedly in the Dublin Criminal Courts before juries, often with the allegation: are not you a police doctor?  In my experience it is something which has an impact, that these are men and women, invariably men, who are on call, are available to the Garda, and that a substantial portion of their practice and time is taken up with that type of work.  That is a tag of which one must be wary lest it creep into the taking of forensic samples here because it can create a problem.</P>
    <P>I have to say to the Minister that the mere fact that a person is a professional does not get rid of the unfortunate risk, problem or element of dishonesty.  The number of professional people found to be dishonest in various disciplines, if we are to believe any of the salacious stories reported in the English tabloids, for instance, doctors who prescribe drugs when they should not, lawyers, even accountants who are found with their hands in the till can be substantial.  Being a professional does not by definition mean one is absolutely honest all the time.  I want to make that point without labouring it.  I am not suggesting there is a great pattern of dishonesty, but the problem is there.  It is a risk that can emerge and we should guard against it and ensure the integrity of the procedure that question marks, as with the fingerprint experience we had, cannot creep into this process.  It is, as was correctly pointed out, vital and revoluntionary and it is important that it be allowed to develop unhindered.</P>
    <P>On the other point, delays are one of the practical problems.  I accept that making it an absolute precondition where requested could cause problems.  Perhaps a solicitor has a busy practice &mdash; or he may be dishonest &mdash; and delay going to the station and in that way seek to frustrate the taking of the sample.  If there was a proviso to my amendment No. 1 that a reasonable period be made available for the solicitor to attend and at the expiration of that time the test can <Col N="325" /> proceed without supervision, without the attendance of a solicitor, would the idea be more attractive to the Minister?  I would have no objection to that.  Practical difficulties could arise and as a result the delay element should not create a problem. Under section 30 of the 1939 Act a person can be in custody for two days and under section 4 of the 1984 Act a person can be there for 12 hours and, as has been well illustrated in debates here, that can often amount to much more than 12 hours, a day or a day and a half, depending on the time of day the suspect is detained.</P>
    <P>There should be no difficulties.  There are many practitioners in the criminal field, many solicitors are available, and by and large there have been no complaints from the Garda to date that their investigation processes of question or holding identification parades are in any way hindered or unduly held up by their having to wait for a solicitor to give advice and to consult with the detained person. Therefore, delay is something we can get over, and if the proviso I have suggested is included, to the effect that no unreasonable delay by a solcitor can be the reason for not taking the sample, would that meet the Minister's requirements?</P>
    <P>In regard to the taking of intimate tests, the other practical difficulty mentioned is that quite often the intimate tests may have to be taken by a male doctor of a female detainee or <i>vice versa.</i> The presence of the solicitor during the taking of the tests arises out of the request of the detained person.  It is not an absolute imposition, and if the detained person decides that he or she will sacrifice intimacy in the interests of ensuring an independent assessment of what is happening, then on balance it is better that we get over any conservatism in this area and recognise that the right of the detained person should be respected and honoured. If there is agreement there should be no difficulty.  Again I remind the Minister that we are professional people and if doctors can do this work I do not see why lawyers cannot observe, and see things are done correctly. <Col N="326" /> In the course of any trial particularly a rape trial, where the public hair of the victim is found and how intimate it was to the genital area of the suspect can be vital.  That can be as important as the time the witness spent before picking a particular person out of the identification parade.  For the suspect, it can often be an important ingredient recorded by the solicitor, asking, &ldquo;did it not take you two minutes?&rdquo;  as opposed to an instantaneous recognition.  There are facts that can be observed, recorded and then brought to the aid of the defendant at a subsequent hearing.  That can arise even in the most clinically taken and professionally administered test.  That might not come immediately to mind here in the rather remote location of the Dáil Chamber, but from experience, I believe this is an important right.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to think about it again.  I ask him to consider accepting the principle with the proviso I have talked about, that undue delay on the part of the lawyer should not be an impediment to the taking of the sample in his or her absence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There are written rules laid down by the courts in accordance with the Constitution and the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, as to the rights of detained persons to consult their solicitors.  These will not be affected by this legislation.  A person from whom an intimate sample is taken must first consent in writing to having that sample taken.  Therefore, there can be no question of a doctor being involved in forcible taking of samples. Let me emphasise that, and I feel that matter has been blown out of proportion.</P>
      <P>If a blood sample is taken, that is that. What has to be observed is how a blood sample is taken?  Again the Deputy is moving into this area of tampering, and suggestions of tampering, with samples. It is well that I bring the discussion back to what we are talking about.  The Deputy's concerns are based on a misunderstanding of what is involved in the taking of samples for forensic testing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again we are moving into other amendments &mdash; amendments Nos. 3 and <Col N="327" /> 4.  Let us look at blood sampling.  If a sample of blood is taken from an accused to establish his blood group or to obtain DNA for forensic testing, there would be no point in tampering.  If the accused wants to have an independent test at any time he can do so.  It is not like the case of a drunk driver where, under the Road Traffic Acts, a test is taken to determine the alcohol content of the blood at a particular time.  That is not what we are talking about here.  You take blood for a forensic test now, or in a week's or a month's time and if the accused, in consultation with his solicitor, feels something <Col N="328" /> has been done that should not have been done, he can have an independent test of his blood carried out at any time and he can argue with the DNA test and the result thereof.</P>
    <P>I cannot go along with the amendment. I recognise fully that it was tabled from genuine concern but I believe there is a misrepresentation here.  I hope I have succeeded in convincing the Deputy.  I regret I am not able to accept the amendment in its present form or in the amended form he is suggesting he might put down on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (6), between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) that the detainee or his solicitor may take possession of a portion of the sample or a copy of the sample or test for the purposes of his assessment or examination,.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have discussed in part the importance of this amendment.  It is a provision that must stand on its own irrespective of the failure of the argument that a solicitor be present.  Amendment No. 3 proposes that the detainee or his solicitor may take possession of a portion or a copy of the sample or test for the purpose of his assessment or examination.  Deputy Flanagan's amendment No. 4 is similar in principle.  It deals with the concept of <Col N="331" /> facilitating an independent assessment by the detainee of the sample taken.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 in my name provides that there is an obligation on the member who takes or causes to be taken any test or sample to provide the detainee or his solicitor with a copy or portion of the sample or test for retention by the solicitor.  The amendment further suggests that such sample or copy of the test should be supplied as soon as is immediately practicable to the solicitor or detainee.  There cannot be any undue delay or obstruction on the part of the member who takes the test or causes it to be taken.  The failure by the member to provide the test as soon as is immediately practicable shall render any evidence from the test inadmissible in evidence at a court of law.  Failure to provide the detainee with the sample for the purpose of having an assessment carried out shall carry with it a sanction that the evidence sought to be relied upon by the member at the trial will be rendered inadmissible and unusable.</P>
    <P>As I have said, this provision stands on its own irrespective of the earlier discussion. The Minister made some observations in response to amendment No. 1 which are pertinent to this amendment. He is of the view that simply because blood is blood, urine is urine and public hair is pubic hair, the detained person can, once released from prison, carry out an independent assessment of the items in question.  The detained person will carry his blood with him all the time.  The same applies in other cases, although not all cases.  Urine, if it is used for DNA purposes, can be constant but it is not always so.  I presume &mdash; I am not entirely clear about this &mdash; the same applies in regard to saliva.  Material found underneath a nail will always be different; it need not necessarily be constant.  Swabs that are taken of any orifice of the body need not be constant or fixed.  Therefore the provision of a copy or a portion of the sample is important.</P>
    <P>We should at least introduce into the legislation a provision which would give absolute entitlement at all stages to the <Col N="332" /> detained person or suspect to carry out or have carried out on their behalf an independent assessment of what is being alleged against them, remembering that the detainee is an innocent person whose rights, as the Minister has said, are being fundamentally impinged.  They are required to comply with a law that may involve an element of self-incrimination. In those circumstances, it is vital that the balance about which the Minister spoke is maintained by ensuring that whatever the suspect is required to surrender to the prosecuting authorities can be independently assessed and retained, if necessary, for evidence purposes, by the detained person.</P>
    <P>Even if you leave aside those tests under the section which are clearly not constant, fixed or permanent, such as blood, swabs and material underneath nails &mdash; and the Minister cannot make an argument that a sample, where possible, should not be made available to the detained person or his solicitor &mdash; the conditions under which other samples are taken can have an impact on the quality or indeed the conclusions which would arise if, for example, containers cleaned with an improper detergent are used.  If they are not properly sterilised they can have a very profound effect on the conclusions in regard to the subsequent analysis of the blood, urine, saliva or traces which would be sought to be examined from the swabs taken from the body. The conditions under which they are taken in the cell or police station can have a very profound effect on the sample. Consequently, the departure from the station by the suspect and the subsequent examination of the suspect in other clinical conditions, by another independent person, can lead to contradictory conclusions. Then the issue at the trial is whose evidence the jury accept.</P>
    <P>This debate is relevant if one has regard to the course of the evidence in the Birmingham Six case where, for days, one forensic expert argued against another about how one could read and draw conclusions from evidence.  They argued over the minutiae of decimal points, whether the solution used was .01 or .0001.  This <Col N="333" /> is the kind of finite scientific evaluation which takes place in this context.  Atmospheric conditions may well have an impact on some of the tests and samples involved, and it is important, where possible, to facilitate the suspect or the defence with a sample, or portion of it. There cannot be any argument by the Minister against this principle and I hope he will not talk about impracticalities, such as the difficulties which may arise in delivery.  Where it is practical and possible it should &mdash; and must &mdash; be done.  I do not want to be repetitious but I must come back to the process of ensuring confidence in the system.  If you allow a regime where you can introduce argument, debate and attack on the system, you are doing a disservice to the whole concept of the Bill.  We have now lost the argument on the right of a lawyer to be present and if we are to lose the argument on the right of the suspect or lawyer to have portion of the sample, we are getting close to scrapping the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>On reflection, there is a difficulty in relation to amendment No. 4.  Amendment No. 3 in the name of my colleague &mdash; with a little addendum &mdash;  would satisfy the requirements of Opposition parties in regard to this matter.  My amendment requires a portion of the sample to be taken because, obviously, if the detainee takes the entire sample it will be a setback for the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should, of course, be an opportunity for an alleged offender to engage in an independent sampling process because it represents an element of balance. We are dealing with legislation which is bringing forward extraordinary changes and which will significantly interfere with the personal rights of the individual.  There is no choice for the victim in the Garda station.  Of course he can refuse to give his consent but such refusal will be taken as an indication of his guilt.  We must face facts.  There cannot be an element of choice since there is compulsion and to allow the party to have an independent examination of the sample could not be regarded as being <Col N="334" /> unreasonable.  The process of DNA fingerprinting is maturing and there is still some doubt in relation to it.  I recall the notorious case of the Australian policeman who was charged with a number of rape offences following genetic fingerprinting. It was only about a year later, following his commission of an independent blood test, that all charges were dropped.  I am not up to date on the present position but I know that the authorities instituted a sworn public inquiry into the matter.  I do not know if their findings have been reported but it is an indication that the DNA process is not foolproof.</P>
    <P>If there is an element of doubt a person is entitled to have a sample of a sample given to him so that he can have it examined independently.  Of course, he does not have to exercise that option if he does not want to but it removes the element of doubt over the whole proceedings.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in reply to an earlier amendment, talked about blood, and he said it would always have the same properties. However, he must acknowledge that blood is the least likely property of those mentioned in section 2 to produce a positive or satisfactory result from the point of view of the prosecution.  Items such as pubic hair, urine, saliva, hair other than pubic, and material found under nails, have proved to be far more beneficial to the prosecution than blood. Even the founding father, Professor Jeffreys, cast some doubt on the usefulness of the blood test.</P>
    <P>The amendment is perfectly laudable and I hope the Minister will consider including it in the Bill instead of leaving the matter to be dealt with by regulations at a later stage.  It is far too important to be left until then and it should be written into the legislation now.  The individuals have the option of proceeding if they wish to do so.  I look forward to the Minister's response in defence of his position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We had touched on amendments Nos. 3, 4 and 7 in the debate on amendments Nos. 1 and 2.  They seem to be based on the belief that the Bill as it stands could allow samples to be <Col N="335" /> tampered with.  This is simply not the case.  The Deputies' concerns in this regard are based on a misunderstanding of what is involved in the taking of samples for forensic testing.  Deputy Flanagan touched on the question of a blood sample.  If a sample of blood is taken from an accused to establish a blood group or obtain DNA for forensic testing there would be no point in providing the accused with part of the sample to have it independently checked.  He is carrying the same blood in his body to have a sample taken for independent testing at any time.  It is not like a blood sample taken under the road traffic legislation to establish alcohol content.  There, the level of alcohol in the blood at the time the sample is taken is all important.  With other samples such as scrapings from the nails or swabs from suspect areas of the body there could be practical problems in dividing what could be minute samples. Even if it were practical to give the suspect a portion of any sample, what purpose would it serve?  The court must be satisfied that material which is forensically tested has been properly handled.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCartan in some of his proposed amendments goes even further to ensure that this is the case. What then of the portion which is given to the defendant? How will that be safeguarded from alteration or tampering?  While I appreciate what Deputy McCartan and Deputy Flanagan are trying to achieve, they do not appreciate the difficulties inherent in what they propose.  The very nature of the samples taken, and the tests for which they are taken, must make deliberate tampering in order to falsify results very difficult.  The tamperer would need to be an expert in chemistry or biology to have any hope of success.  We have to be practical in our legislation and provide safeguards against reasonably likely dangers. If the evidence at the trial showed any possibility that a sample was tampered with, the judge would be in a position to take whatever action was necessary in the interests of justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="336" /> What we are trying to do is to be practical. One can only judge the operation of the forensic science laboratory.  When a sample is taken the garda who takes the sample, or to whom a sample is given by a doctor, will deliver it by hand to the forensic science laboratory where it is received and entered into the records by scientists.  This is done because of the continuity that the courts insist on.  There is no question of such material being left lying around or being handled in a slipshod way.  When it reaches the forensic science laboratory its movement, and the tests carried out on it, are meticulously logged.  These procedures have operated for 15 years, since the laboratory was established, without challenge.  It is important to emphasise that in the debate.  Our forensic science laboratory has not been queried in relation to its procedures. There is not any need to interfere with those arrangements.</P>
    <P>A practical problem with giving a sample of a sample is that the sample may not be consistent.  If a number of hairs are taken, there might be traces of residue on some but not on others.  If they are split and some are given to the accused it might be hair which does not have the same residue.  Expert advice given to me from the Forensic Science Laboratory is that what is proposed in these amendments is not workable.  I would emphasise that the policy of the laboratory is to be completely open with the accused.  The personnel of the Forensic Science Laboratory will meet with the suspect, his solicitor or experts and will show them how the sample has been tested and the procedures used.  They are quite happy to have their procedures and standards independently verified in any case.  I will go further this morning to try to assure Deputies of my good faith in this.  If Deputies with an interest in this area wish I will arrange with Dr. Donovan, the director of the Forensic Science Laboratory, to show Deputies the facilities in the laboratory and have the workings explained to them.  Such a briefing might be beneficial to spokesmen on this legislation who have shown such <Col N="337" /> an interest in their area of responsibility in Justice.</P>
    <P>I also assure Deputies that the Forensic Science Laboratory provide training for gardaí as to how samples should be handled to ensure that there can be no tampering with them.</P>
    <P>I want to be as helpful as possible to Deputies but I regret that, on foot of technical advice from the Forensic Science Laboratory, I am not in a position to accept their amendments.  I regret that while in theory the point made is a reasonable one, in practice it would not work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party support amendment No. 3 in the name of Deputy McCartan.  That is not to say that we have any doubts about the professional capacity and bona fides of the forensic science laboratory, its director and staff or by and large the members of the Garda Síochána.  We have complete confidence in them.  Nonetheless, when a procedure like this is being introduced it is incumbent on us in so far as is practicable to do what we can to ensure that justice is not only done but is seen to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister drew a distinction between a sample taken to detect alcohol in the blood under road traffic legislation and other samples.  To an extent I take the point the Minister made.  Is it a fair analogy to make?  If one were to take the point that everything is carefully logged, that the examination by the laboratory is completely reliable so far as the alcohol test is concerned, there would not be a necessity for the legislation to provide that a sample taken should be divided and a proportion of it given to the accused.  Why?  It provides it because it appears to be right that an opportunity be given in a case like that to the accused to have his own analysis carried out if he wishes.  That is the basic principle.  The fact is that there is a case to be made for the giving of a sample taken to the accused where it is practicable to do so.  I appreciate that there may be times where the sample taken is so minute that it would not be capable of division.  If it <Col N="338" /> would help, I have no objection to including a saver to say that where practicable the sample taken should be divided, accepting that in some cases it might not be practicable.</P>
    <P>On the blood question, it is not quite right to say that a person can go off and have a sample of his blood taken at any time and have it analysed.  There could be a substance in blood other than alcohol, that might be relevant, and, for the same reason that applies in drunk driving cases, it could be important that a proportion of the sample taken should be given to the accused.  It is done as a matter of course under drunk-driving legislation and does not give rise to any practical difficulties.  The procedures are already well established.  The doctors who take the samples do it as a matter of course, so why raise any difficulty about it?  If it were practical to do it with other types of samples, why not do so?  The accused could not complain that he did not have an opportunity to conduct an independent test on the specimen.  It would give rise to a clear appearance of justice and fairness.  I cannot see that, if we put in a saver to say it could be done where practicable, it would cause any undue concern for the Minister or for the laboratory staff.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the point that, for example, in taking samples of hairs it could well be that one specimen would give one result and another specimen would give a different result.  That might well be.  It could be very important to show that there was a variation in the samples taken in one way or the other. That could be an important matter of evidence in a case.  The fact that the Minister concedes that there could be variations reinforces the position taken up by the amendment.  If we provide for this it is not a question of suggesting that there would be tampering with any of the specimens although that is not to say it could be regarded as out of the question that on rare occasions strange things happen. It should not be put in on that basis although the fact that it was provided for would take away from an accused any opportunity of alleging that there was <Col N="339" /> tampering with a specimen.  If the opportunity is not given to the accused he could claim that the sample was tampered with. If a portion of the specimen is given it would defuse that argument.</P>
    <P>What is the big problem about it?  If a specimen, sample or swab is divided and if an accused or his representative feels it would be helpful to have their own test done, where is the problem with that? The specimen could be divided into two jars, one for the prosecution and one for the defence.  It would not involve any extra expenditure and would be no great deal.  Why not agree to do it in a case where it is reasonably practicable to do so?  I do not follow this reasoning.</P>
    <P>Without in any way impugning the skill and professionalism of the laboratory staff or the director, the fact remains that some tests on substances are on the borders of scientific development.  At the end of the day the director and his staff are professionals.  Surely the Minister knows that professional opinions and interpretations differ.  All professionals, be they doctors, engineers or scientists disagree with each other and give different interpretations on evidence or findings in the courts.  The good thing about these scientific opinions is that they are not scientific at all.  They are an opinion on interpretation.  There is no reason to suppose that the interpretations and constructions put on findings from these specimens are different from the findings or opinions of doctors, surgeons and so on.  In any court case you will find that they give different opinions on tests and findings.  That is a fact of life and must be accepted.  One scientist could give a different interpretation from that given by the director of the laboratory, and the court would have to decide, taking all the other evidence into account, which view to accept.</P>
    <P>To go down the road the Minister suggests would be a one-sided approach to the issue.  It would take away from the accused the benefit of getting his own professional opinion on the specimen.  It is patently unjust to put an accused in <Col N="340" /> that position, particularly when it presents little or no difficulty to do so.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look at it again.  I accept there may be cases where it would not be practical to divide the specimen. If it cannot be done, it cannot be done and I concede that, but where it can be done it should be done.  It would just be a matter of providing two bottles or two jars instead of one.  They would be labelled in the same way and established procedure would be followed.  It seems logical and appropriate to do so.  It would not cost the State anything and would be little or no trouble.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear from what the Deputy said that this is all brand new but the procedures for taking specimens for forensic testing are not being introduced now.  There is power under the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, to take specimens and samples.  The Garda have obtained blood samples, for example, on a voluntary basis.  No problems have arisen.  All the Bill does is to give the Garda power to take the samples. Nothing else has changed.</P>
      <P>As regards the samples, it is not quite as simple as cutting a swab in two or taking one portion of blood and another of urine, etc.  For example, in the case of public hair there may be residue on one piece which would not be the same as on another.  It is not just a question of dividing it in two.  When the Forensic Science Laboratory bring evidence before the court, if the evidence at the trial showed any possibility that the sample was tampered with, the judge would be in a position to take whatever action was necessary in the interest of justice.  If an accused wants an independent test carried out, the full specimen which has been worked on by the laboratory will be made available.  The accused can have an independent test carried out on it by experts brought in by the accused.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a possibility and I <Col N="341" /> accept that.  As I said earlier on the question of transparency in the laboratory, each phase of each test carried out is meticulously logged for court and this can be made available to experts.  We have to very careful when discussing this subject &mdash; I fully appreciate that Deputies are expressing genuine concerns &mdash; not to say anything which in any way would cast even the remotest shadow on the record and behaviour of the forensic science laboratory which has served the country well since its establishment 15 years ago.  It has operated successfully without its integrity being challenged.  I am sure it is not the intention, and it is well that I clarify it, that nothing should be said which would cast any doubt on the integrity of the forensic science laboratory, its director and personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty with the proposition put forward by Deputy Taylor, that is, that the words &ldquo;where practicable&rdquo; should be included in the amendment.  That is a very reasonable and sensible proposition, and it is my fault they were not included in the amendment.  I am disappointed, nonetheless, that the Minister is not even going to look at it.  The precedent and practice is there in the road traffic legislation. As Deputy Taylor asked, what are the difficulties, problems and reasons against the inclusion of the amendment?</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear that I have nothing but the highest regard for the State forensic science laboratory and nothing in the amendment or what I have said should be taken to suggest that the problem I wish to deal with rests with the State Forensic Science Laboratory.  I am happy that the highest standards are applied in that laboratory but to suggest that its integrity or performance has never been challenged is to deny that legal argument and cross-examination occur invariably at trials about the methods used, records taken and standards applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge that I have always found the State Forensic Science Laboratory <Col N="342" /> to be open, available and willing to accommodate any approach from defence lawyers and experts retained on their behalf to look at, observe and access work done there.  However, to suggest that the problem of tampering will not arise is to ignore the range of events which can occur from the time a police officer asks a person to give a sample in a police station to the time it gets through the door of the State Forensic Science Laboratory because there will be a range of opportunities to tamper with samples, not simply designed tampering but also tampering by accident.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that if there are delays samples will deteriorate.  I recall in the Kerry Babies Inquiry the State forensic pathologist, due to a lack of facilities, carried samples around in an ice box in the boot of his motor car.  I have no doubt that in many instances members of the Garda Síochána who take samples place them in their lockers in the police station.  Because of pressures on time, work and duties it can be days before a sample eventually gets to the State Forensic Science Laboratory.  This is a fact.  I have come across this practice daily in my work where the locker is used as the safe repose until the officer has all the exhibits in a particular case assembled, be they from the room in the police station, the scene of the crime, the hide-out, or the location of the proceeds. It is only when the 20, 30, 40 or 50 exhibits have been assembled that they are delivered to the State Forensic Science Laboratory from the locker of the police officer.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be aware that at an early stage in most criminal investigations the officer in charge designates one of the members as &ldquo;exhibits officer&rdquo; and it is his or her duty to collect from all the investigating police officers in the inquiry the various samples and exhibits and to give them exhibit numbers.  He or she also has the sole responsibility of delivering them to the State Forensic Science Laboratory.  An exhibits officer is appointed in an effort to address the chain of evidence issue which the Minister has spoken about and to make it <Col N="343" /> clear that one particular officer involved in the investigation is responsible for the safe keeping and delivery of samples.</P>
    <P>Sometimes it takes days or weeks to conclude the investigation and during that time any number of things can happen either advertently or inadvertently. I do not want to be unduly contentious but it does not take a great deal of imagination or reflection to realise that an officer, if so inclined could tamper very easily and neatly with samples. Unfortunately, there has been an era &mdash; I am not suggesting that this is the case now and in my experience there is certainly no such evidence &mdash; when there was a view within senior circles of the Garda Síochána that the rules could be broken because of the pressures involved or the perceived difficulties within the community at the time.  There was a view that it was all right to break the rules and that statements could be manufactured and obtained by bringing undue pressures to bear or through the use of improper procedures.  That was a sad chapter in the history of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>If a police officer was so inclined, could there possibly be a more simple, clinical or neat way to stitch the case against the person who is undoubtedly believed or perceived to be the offender than to take a sample, for example, a sample of hair or a swab, and pepper it with the type of residue, evidence or indicators which the officer believes would incriminate the accused in an effort to get away from the pressure to have statements signed? What is to stop an officer taking a sample, going to another room to do whatever doctoring is necessary, put it in a bag and seal it and then deliver it to the State Forensic Science Laboratory who, in all good faith, will receive it in a sealed container and work on it on the basis that it is the sample as taken from the body or person of the suspect?  It is so easy that it is frightening to think about it.</P>
    <P>One of the safeguards I proposed was that a lawyer should be present to see the sample being taken, put into a bag, sealed and labelled.  This would provide a chain <Col N="344" /> of security which would enable the Forensic Science Laboratory technician or scientist to say he received the bag with the seal intact.  This is the process employed in relation to blood or urine samples; it is put in a sealed container in the presence of the accused.  One of the necessary elements of the certificate issued by the State Forensic Science Laboratory is that the seal was intact when the sample was received.  However, that safeguard is no longer there and a solicitor will not be present in a police station as of right.  Therefore, the only possible conceivable safeguard is to have the sample divided where practicable&mdash; I accept that point &mdash; and a portion delivered to the suspect or his lawyer.  It is in the interests of all of us to ensure that things do not go wrong or otherwise, whether or not things are right, one will be opening up contention and the opportunity for questions to be raised.  As I mentioned earlier the best illustration of that is that even to this day lawyers in cross-examination attempting to discredit fingerprint evidence will remind the jury and the court of trial, about the unfortunate mistakes that were made and the lack of standards that existed in the fingerprint laboratory in the last decade, as illustrated by the famous case we talked about.  We are talking about facts as they can emerge.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made an interesting observation that in theory what we are talking about is good but that in practice it is not so good on the advice of the Forensic Science Laboratory.  If the Minister accepts the proviso suggested by Deputy Taylor &mdash; and I think he should &mdash; and include the words &ldquo;where practicable&rdquo;, then our theory which is good, and which has been accepted as such, can also be good in practice because we say it should apply only where it is practicable. I urge the Minister to look at this issue again before Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of practicality or otherwise, who is to judge at any particular time what is practicable? Is it the garda who is taking the sample? <Col N="345" /> So far as the sample of blood is concerned, there is no difficulty as I have already explained.  It is irrelevant whether the test is taken today, tomorrow or next week as the accused carries the same blood.  It is not as if a test is being carried out for an alcohol content under the provisions of the road traffic legislation.  This is a different type of test. These tests are being done in any event. The difference in this legislation is that the gardaí are given power to carry out the test.  Until now it had been done in a different way.  In relation to the blood sample there can be a division, and an independent analysis, but that is pointless because if an accused wants to have independent blood samples taken at any time it can be done.  It is when other samples are being taken that we come to the practical problems I outlined earlier.</P>
      <P>I should like to re-emphasise that the Forensic Science Laboratory is available to the accused, to the accused's solicitor and experts to see how the tests are being done, the logging of the tests, and, where practicable, samples will be made available for further tests.  The gardaí have clear instructions on how forensic samples are to be handled.  If they depart from those instructions disciplinary action can be taken against them.  If there is any suggestion or information of any member of the force doing other than in accordance with instructions I would like to get it.  I know the Garda Commissioner would want to take immediate corrective action against any suggestion of improper behaviour but that has not arisen.  As I emphasised earlier &mdash; it is worth repeating &mdash; the arrangements in the Forensic Science Laboratory have operated successfully for the last 15 years since it was established.  They have operated without challenge.  I suggest that what we are involved in here is really about common sense.  I have made an argument which cannot be answered in relation to the three amendments.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6.</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (10), lines 45 and 46, to delete paragraph (c) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(11)  The provisions of this Act shall not apply to a person under the age of 14 years.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment was put down with a specific purpose in mind, to challenge the fact that in this day and age we still treat persons of 14 years and under as criminals. In section 2 (9) it is suggested that consent can be obtained on behalf of a 14 year old by the parent or guardian of the person delivering the consent.  I am utterly opposed and appalled by the fact that in this society we consider children of 14 years and under as criminals.  As a consequence, with or without the consent of the parents, this Bill should not apply to children of that age.  It is time we had a fundamental look at how we should deal with children in trouble who are considered to be criminals when taken before our courts.  A sad event occurred only one day ago where a young boy of 16 years of age, locked in St. Patrick's Institution, took his own life in desperation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This helps to illustrate in a very sad and startling way the consequences of applying a code of law which instead of recognising children of a very young age as being in need of care and help regards them as criminals to be prosecuted and dealt with before our courts.  It is time we got away from the whole concept of arresting children, taking them to a police station, interrogating them, taking samples, taking them to court, charging them <Col N="348" /> and eventually locking them up.  This is a very rare occasion on which this point can be made, and I wanted to make it in the context of this legislation.  As I have stated in this House time and time again, children of 14 years and under are not criminals and should not be so treated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this amendment would be that the power to require a person to provide a sample could not be exercised where the person is under 14 years of age.  It is regrettable that serious offences such as burglary, robbery and assault are committed by children.  Deputies will be aware also that boys under 14 years can and have carried out acts which amount to rape.  This is the main reason why the irrefutable presumption which exists in law at present that that horrible crime cannot be committed by an under 14 year old is being removed in the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Bill which is at Report Stage at present.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances I believe it is right that it should be open to the Garda to obtain a sample from any person who is suspected of a serious crime whether they are under or over 14 years of age. It must be borne in mind that what is involved in any criminal investigation is finding out who was responsible for a particular act or set of acts.  I do not think this process should be thwarted by the introduction of a rule such as that proposed by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully accept that when we are dealing with the taking of samples from children cognisance must be taken of their immaturity. For this reason the Bill provides that where a child is under 14 years a sample can only be taken with parental consent.  It is natural to expect a parent to be best fitted to act in the interests of a child of that age.  Furthermore, it is provided under section 3 (4) that where a parent does not consent to a sample being taken in such circumstances, no adverse inference can be drawn against the child from that refusal.  That is a very important protection.  I believe that in so far as children are involved the provisions <Col N="349" /> of the Bill are fair and provide adequate and very important safeguards.  For the reasons I have given I am opposing this amendment.</P>
    <P>I share the Deputy's abhorrence at the idea of crime being committed by children but the unfortunate fact in the real world in which we live is that serious crimes, for example, burglary, robbery and assaults, are committed by children under 14 years of age.  Even in the context of the rape legislation which is currently before the House the presumption which exists at present that that horrible crime cannot be committed by a child under 14 years is being removed.  Therefore, I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment.</P>
    <P>With regard to the young boy who died tragically in St. Patrick's Institution we discussed this matter here last night.  I want, as I did last night, to express the sympathy of the House to the parents and family at that terrible loss of life. Unfortunately, such tragedies are not restricted to prison life; they are part and parcel of our daily lives.  As public representatives we come across tragedies of premature deaths in our constituencies on a regular basis.  I do not want to comment any further on the case referred to by the Deputy as there will be an inquest and an inquiry into it.</P>
    <P>In the context of the amendment before us, it is a regrettable fact of life that very serious crimes can be committed by children under 14 years of age. In recognising that fact, we must provide the maximum possible protection and safeguards for these children.  Very important safeguards are written into this Bill to protect the rights of 14 year olds. I want to emphasise that it is only with parental consent that a sample can be taken from a child under 14 years of age. If parental permission is not given for such a sample to be taken no adverse inference may be drawn from that at a subsequent trial.  This is a very important safeguard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not for a moment seek to deny the unfortunate facts of life in this country and elsewhere, that serious crimes are committed by children <Col N="350" /> of 14 years and under, and I accept the point the Minister made in regard to the rape Bill.  My argument is that we do not live in an ideal society; these young children are in need of help and should not be prosecuted before our criminal courts.  While recognising the serious crime committed by these children, we, as a community, should be endeavouring to establish a caring system which will help people of this age and not be perpetuating a criminal prosecution process which will render them no better or worse than other criminals dealt with before our courts.</P>
      <P>That is the point I wished to make.  I do not anticipate that I will win the debate on this occasion.  The Bill provides for the application of the most detailed forensic testing and it is remarakable that children between the ages of seven and 14 should be subjected to that kind of regime in legislation introduced in 1990.  This is wrong and we should not be doing it.  For that reason, I do not think the provisions in this Bill should apply to these children. The sooner we address the fundamentals and recognise the need for an entirely different approach and emphasis in dealing with young children in trouble the better.  This was a useful opportunity to put down that marker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government and I share the Deputy's concern about the need to provide care and attention, other than imposing the rigours of the law, for children.  This is why the Children's Bill which will protect children will be passed before the Christmas recess.  However, side by side with that we also have to protect victims.  During the past few weeks we spent two very fruitful days here discussing the rape Bill and making major, progressive changes to it, changes caring for the victim.  We recognise that the crime of rape can be committed by someone under 14 years of age.  A victim has rights and if the accused in a rape case is under 14 years of age, the position of the victim should be protected as far as possible.  If a test can be carried out to prove guilt or innocence, then the victim <Col N="351" /> has the right to that as well.  While recognising at all times the rights of the victim we also recognise, even in this legislation, that the child under 14 years must be protected.</P>
      <P>For that reason we have the safeguard that it can be only with parental permission and that no adverse inference can be taken in the subsequent trial.  I share the Deputy's concern that as a society we must do everything we can to care for and look after the needs of our young people.  Side by side with that must be the care and protection of society as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>A very substantial admendment in my name, amendment No. 10, has been ruled out of order.  It has profound implications for section 2. Perhaps we can tease this out with the director of the Forensic Science Laboratory. My understanding is that without a criminal evidence Bill which will deal with the whole issue of hearsay and the admission of evidence by way of certificate it will be virtually impossible to make section 2 operable in the courts.  In a small way this was illustrated in the recent prosecution of a certain Mr. Haughey where the evidence of the doctor, though delivered to the court by way of certificate, could not stand on its own in the absence of the doctor, on the basis that the proof of what was in the certificate, if challenged, had to be sustained by way of oral evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 10 arises out of the Law Reform Commission reports.  This point was mentioned in the report on receiving stolen property.  It was not ruled out of order in the context of the Larceny <Col N="352" /> Bill but that is not the case in respect of this Bill.  I accept the ruling but I find it curious.  Without a criminal evidence Bill section 2 will be virtually inoperable because of the current rules of evidence. It will put a huge onus on the State Forensic Science Laboratory to produce all the people who engage in the whole process. While we agree to the passage of this section, I would urge the Minister to move as quickly as possible in the preparation of a criminal evidence Bill which he told us about during the debate on the Larceny Bill earlier this year so that full effect can be given to this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has referred to the Larceny Bill.  Following that debate I circulated proposals to make business and administrative records admissible in criminal cases.  I circulated proposals to this effect to other interested Departments for their observations, together with provisions dealing with the competence and compellability as witnesses of spouses of accused persons.  Proposals have now been revised in the light of the observations received.  I have also added provision to give effect to the recommendation for amendment of the rules of evidence in the recent reports of the Law Reform Commission on child sexual abuse and on sexual offences against the mentally handicapped.  As soon as the observations of Departments have been received and dealt with I will seek Government approval to have a Bill drafted.  Everything that can be done to speed it up is being done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (2), between lines 38 and 39, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="353" />&ldquo;(c)  make provision for the following:</P>
    <P>(i)  the attendance, where requested by the detainee, of a solicitor at the taking of any sample or test,</P>
    <P>(ii)  the obligation of the requesting member to explain fully the right of a detainee to have a solicitor present at the time of the taking of any sample or test,</P>
    <P>(iii)  the obligation of the requesting member to provide a copy or a portion of the sample or test to enable a detainee or his solicitor to effect an independent analysis or evaluation,</P>
    <P>(iv)  the provision of clinical conditions and equipment for the proper and safe taking, receiving and storage of all tests or samples obtained,</P>
    <P>(v)  the video tape recording of all proceedings leading to and arising from the taking of tests and samples, including the actual taking of such tests and samples,</P>
    <P>(vi)  the establishment of a Central Register of all tests and samples taken in the State,</P>
    <P>(vii)  the establishment of a National Forensic Bank where all tests and samples shall be safely and properly stored and retained, and</P>
    <P>(viii)  the establishment of a post of Director of the State Forensic Laboratory and Forensic Bank with sole responsibility for the testing, evaluating and safe and proper keeping of all tests and samples taken under this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment carries with it a further subsection (c) to the section dealing with regulations and sets out eight matters which I believe the Minister should also provide for under regulations.  Some of them have become superfluous on the basis that we have lost the issue with <Col N="354" /> regard to providing for the attendance, where requested by a detainee, of a solicitor at the taking of any sample or test. I understand from the Minister that the 1984 Act allows for that in part, if not entirely.  Perhaps it could be dealt with by way of regulation so that the issue could be clarified on an administrative level by the Minister.  Other matters refer to what might emerge on Report Stage with regard to the taking or delivering of a sample to a defendant or his solicitor.</P>
    <P>The fifth provision is crucial and essential. We have legislated the solicitor out of the room as of right.  We have some major difficulties in regard to the delivery of a sample.  The only remaining safeguard is that the video tape recording of the taking of forensic samples must be kept for the purposes of viewing by the court to ensure proper standards and fair play.  The need for video recording is well established in the area of interrogation, as first dealt with by Circuit Court Judge Barra Ó Briain in his report commissioned by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1977.  It established the need for tape and video recording of interviews. It is more strongly dealt with in the 1984 Criminal Justice Act where the Minister is enabled to move in this area when regulations are brought into play.  It has been dealt with more recently in the Martin report on the Guildford Four case, where video tape recording was established as an important and inherent concept in the regime of fairness and fair play within police stations.  Under this legislation the police station will become far more important, given the powers contained in this Bill, and it is essential that video tape recording be established without delay.</P>
    <P>The Minister should advise the House, perhaps to the extent that is relevant, what has become of the Martin report which has been with him for so long, which was delivered to him so rapidly and directly in response to his request.  If I am correct I think it has been in his Department almost six or more months while important provisions and recommendations, <Col N="355" /> such as video tape recordings, are left dormant.</P>
    <P>Before the provisions of this Bill are implemented &mdash; and I have another amendment on the list of amendments contending that its provisions should not be implemented until obligations established thereunder on the Minister are complied with &mdash; I contend we should not embark on the use of forensic testing and the taking of samples in police stations until there is the means of a proper independent record available.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not advance the suggestion that the intimate taking of samples is something that perhaps should not be recorded by way of video taping. I argue strongly that, in the balance of protection, it is important that the record be there, that it be kept by a proper custodian in the police station and not available for public and salacious view, and is then made available, on request, to representatives on behalf of a defendant and/or the court as and when required. It is in those very confined circumstances that, at any stage, a record will be available. Whereas we have agreed, under the preceding section that a sample is to be destroyed, equally the tape recording can also be disposed of contemporaneously. There will be no question of building up a library of salacious video tape recordings.  I hope that argument will not be advanced here.  It is a crucial matter and should be dealt with before the provisions of this Bill are implemented.</P>
    <P>I argue, in subparagraph (vi) of my amendment for the establishment of a central register of all tests and samples taken in the State.  Here I am immediately concerned that locker rooms in police stations do not become recognised as places for the retention of samples. Contrary to what the Minister suggests, my understanding is that, while samples can be taken at the various different stages of investigation, they do not all go immediately or directly to the State Forensic Laboratory.</P>
    <P>I have already talked about circumstances in which there can be a delay, when an investigation might range over <Col N="356" /> days if not weeks.  Equally I understand that, in some investigations, samples may be taken and, when a charge is not immediately obvious or imminent, the sample need not be delivered, and often is not delivered to the State Forensic Science Laboratory.  I argue that the State Forensic Science Laboratory must be recognised as the place of safe repose of all samples and that a central register should be maintained there.  This is a very important feature that should be built in to safeguard the proper retention, record and access to samples once taken.</P>
    <P>I contend that the proposal is eminently sensible and possible in a country as small as ours.  There cannot be any arguments advanced that it would not be practicable, or that it would impose serious obligations on the Garda to have to do so.  It is a short journey from any part of this country to the State Forensic Science Laboratory at John's Road. There should be proper, safe retention of such samples because they are crucial. I contend the system must be given all the attributes to enable it to enjoy and retain the highest respect and confidence among all of us.</P>
    <P>At subparagraph (vii) of my amendment I seek the establishment of a National Forensic Bank where all tests and samples shall be safely and properly restored and retained &mdash; again in the State Forensic Science Laboratory unit at John's Road.</P>
    <P>At subparagraph (viii) of my amendment I seek the establishment of a post of director of the State Forensic Science Laboratory and Forensic Bank with sole responsibility for the testing, evaluation and safe and proper keeping of all tests and samples taken under the provisions of this Bill.  Dr. Donovan is the obvious appointee since it would involve a small extension only of his role as director of the State Forensic Science Laboratory.  I contend that the State Forensic Science Laboratory should also be given that attribute, which it has in any event, but which I argue, under the regulations, should obtain in all cases, so that, whenever a detainee or suspect has had a sample taken, he or she will know that <Col N="357" /> that sample will go post haste into a proper bank where it will be lodged and recorded, where it will be within the safe keeping of the director, and where it will be available for independent access and assessment as and when required.</P>
    <P>The day of the locker room, or of such items being left lying in paper bags in rooms in police stations, must be left behind.  We are now moving into high technology scientific investigation, when the rights of a detainee &mdash; and as Deputy Flanagan said even of the rights of the Garda themselves &mdash; can be established on the finiteness of a shift of a decimal point in a test or examination.  When we get into that arena of establishing truth beyond doubt, based on the expert and scientist, it is essential that we have a regime clinically safe, sound, respected and trusted by all.</P>
    <P>For those reasons I believe these further safeguards should be included in the regulations being provided under the provisions of this Bill and which will be dealt with by a further amendment.  Indeed, I contend that such regulations should be brought back before us in this House for debate and that the provisions of this Bill will not be implemented until such regulations have been complied with by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy said at the outset, we have already discussed a number of provisions under subparagraphs (c) (i), (ii) and (iii) of his amendment in relation to the presence of a solicitor and the question of apportioning samples.  As we will revert to that matter on Report Stage, I will not go into that in detail now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to subparagraph (v) of the Deputy's amendment contending that the taking of samples should be recorded by way of video tape recording, I am sorry to have to disappoint him &mdash; I do not think he will be too surprised &mdash; but I am going to say that, in my view, I do not think it would be appropriate or practicable.  For example, it would seem to me to be completely inappropriate to take a video tape recording of the taking of a swab from a genital area.  This is <Col N="358" /> something which I think an accused person would find unacceptable whatever the motivation for so doing.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Martin Committee, I replied to a question on this topic in the House yesterday.  The committee recommendations in relation to the questioning of suspects in Garda stations &mdash; that such should take place with audio-visual recording &mdash; is being examined by my Department and the Garda authorities, in particular in regard to the question of introducing the arrangement on a pilot basis in selected Garda stations, as was envisaged by that committee.  I can inform the House that that will take place early in the new year.</P>
    <P>With regard to the remaining provisions of the Deputy's proposed subsection (c) relating to the taking, receiving and storage of samples, I have a number of times this morning outlined just how samples and materials for forensic testing are treated at present.  A garda takes a sample &mdash; whether it be he who takes it or the garda to whom a sample is delivered by a doctor &mdash; he then generally delivers it by hand to the State Forensic Science Laboratory where it is personally received and entered into the records by a scientist.  I will go over the procedure again.  I might add it is done in this way because the courts insist on the continuity of custody of such material. There is no question of such material being left lying in a Garda station, or being handled in any slipshod way.  Once a sample reaches the State Forensic Science Laboratory, its movements and the tests carried out on it are meticulously logged.  These are the arrangements which have obtained since the establishment of the laboratory 15 years ago and have operated successfully, without challenge.  I see no need whatsoever to interfere with those arrangements.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I oppose the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister is opposing my amendment. I would have no objection to subparagraph (v) being qualified to deal with the view of a suspect, if he or she indicated that they did not want the taking <Col N="359" /> of a sample recorded by way of videotape recording.  A great number of tests do not involve intimate invasion of the body, and it is an important principle that should be laid down here as a safeguard.</P>
      <P>There is no universality in terms of what happens to a sample once taken. No standard procedure is applied.  Interestingly, the Minister used the word &ldquo;generally&rdquo; in regard to delivery by hand to the laboratory, but there are occasions when it is not and those occasions should not be allowed to exist.  We should also have at the laboratory the bank or reservoir for the reception and retention of all the samples and they should be kept there under proper clinical conditions.</P>
      <P>For those reasons this legislation should provide for these crucial issues.  I do not see the difficulty for the Minister in accepting the concept of a central repository of all samples and that a person would be appointed &mdash; or the position that already exists of director of the laboratory would be extended &mdash; to cover the bank or repository of the samples once delivered.</P>

      <P>I assure the Deputies that the system that has operated for 15 years has stood the test of time.  If it is not broken do not fix it.  The laboratory have laid down clear guidelines for the handling of samples and the Garda are operating those.  In the passing of this very important legislation I would ask the Commissioner in a letter to each member of the force to restate and re-emphasise the importance of sticking rigidly to the regulations and instructions as laid down for the handling of samples, which I think would be appropriate in the light of this legislation.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to labour a point which has been well put by Deputy McCartan.  My only difficulty with the amendment &mdash; if it is a difficulty &mdash; is that I felt the Minister's response was going to be that these were matters he was going to incorporate in the regulations. To my disappointment he has not done that.  Does he not feel there is an avenue <Col N="360" /> for incorporating the spirit of some of the amendments in the regulations which will be the key to the legislation and which we will be discussing in a few moments?</P>

      <P>On the question of videotape recording of tests and samples, I am not convinced that that would be appropriate, necessary or advisable.  The system of taking samples in the drunk driving ambit does not provide for videotaping and that system has worked very well over the years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy got a copy.  I maintain we should get a copy here too, but I do not really feel it would be either necessary or appropriate to videotape all the taking of tests and samples.  One must do the best one can in ensuring justice being done and seen to be done, but there are limits from the point of view of practicality.  I thought the ones we discussed this morning were really more necessary and more appropriate than this one.  The Minister may yet come up with something on that before Report Stage.</P>
      <P>However, I would have thought the previous item in the amendment, that is subparagraph (iv) rather than (v) was worthy of perhaps more emphasis.  It states that the regulations should make provision for the clinical conditions and equipment for the proper and safe taking, receiving and storage of all tests or samples obtained.  I would have thought that rather necessary and appropriate and that the Minister would have wished to make provision for dealing with those matters. For example, some of these samples might require refrigeration or some particular conditions and so on in order that things be done properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know we are not on the section generally but as it stands provision is made for the taking of samples, logging the refusal to give samples and so on, but no provision is made for the disposition of a sample once taken.  I expected the Minister to give consideration to adding an additional item in his section <Col N="361" /> under which there would be an obligation to log also in the Garda station particulars of the disposition of each sample taken, in other words indicate how long it was kept in the station, when precisely it was forwarded to the forensic laboratory and so on.  Perhaps that could be considered in due course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In this area I feel I must rely on the guidance and advice of the technical personnel in the Forensic Science Laboratory, but I will have an opportunity of discussing this on Report Stage and in the meantime I hope to have the opportunity of discussing a number of issues with Dr. Donovan and his people in the laboratory as a group.  I want the maximum possible consensus on this.  We can discuss a number of these issues with them when we are there, consider them, and if it is necessary, come back to them on Report Stage in relation to storage of samples, etc.  I will not agree to videotaping but in relation to storage we are working at the moment on guidelines prepared by the experts themselves. If they need to be revised I am willing to be as helpful as possible.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 9 in the names of Deputies McCartan and Flanagan.  Amendments Nos. 9 and 11 form a composite proposal so Nos. 9 and 11 may be taken together, by agreement. Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 6, lines 39 to 45, to delete subsection (3) and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(3)  Where it is proposed to make regulations under this section a draft of each regulation shall be laid before <Col N="362" /> each House of the Oireachtas and shall not come into effect until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is very important and perhaps this will be the last opportunity we shall have to see what regulations the Minister proposes to draft, how he deals with them and how the whole regime will be established for the purposes of the working of this legislation. The Minister proposes that the regulations, once drafted will be laid before the House and will become law unless a motion is moved to disallow them, whereas we are arguing that they should be laid before the House and not come into law until a positive motion is passed accepting them.  Of necessity that will require debate at some level in this House.</P>
    <P>It is the age-old row.  Every legislator does not want to have their regulations reviewed and every Opposition wants an opportunity to look at them and comment on them.  The Minister's negative proposition and the way the House works make it virtually impossible for a Member of the Opposition to move an annulling motion, and for my party it is utterly impossible.  Even for the Fine Gael Party it is virtually impossible given the way Private Members' time is made available.</P>
    <P>I remember in this House a very short time ago debating an amendment to the Intoxicating Liquor Bill when the regulations about giving licences for restaurants were brought before the House and we spent a morning debating them and making some important changes to them.  If we can find the time and the political will and desire in this House to debate such an important issue about the regulation of the ante-chambers and seating arrangements of restaurateurs who are to get licences for the sale of intoxicating liquor, then when the regulations are drafted by the Minister, giving vast powers to the Garda to take steps that represent a substantial invasion into the privacy and integrity of the individual, there should be no question about giving the House the opportunity to review them briefly and satisfy <Col N="363" /> ourselves that they are in order, particularly in view of the discussion we had this morning during which the Minister assured us that he would be providing for a lot of the issues we have raised; and seeing that Deputy Flanagan and I have withdrawn amendments in the face of his reasoning and in the hope that we will hear more and understand more about the workings of the legislation after discussions with the director and after consideration of the matter again on Report Stage.  I would ask the Minister, in that spirit and because of the way we have shown an earnest concern in this debate, to meet us on this issue and give us the opportunity to look at the regulations when they are drafted and impart our observations and views to him further in the circumstances of the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy says, this is the debate that takes place regularly in relation to nearly all legislation that comes before this House.  I am not accepting amendment No. 9 because I do not believe that the type of regulations that will be made under this Bill are such as to warrant the need for positive approval by the House before they come into force.  The regulations will not contain any matters of principle but will merely provide for the detailed administrative procedures to be followed in relation to the taking of samples in garda stations.  All the necessary safeguards to obviate any abuse of the powers being granted to take samples are provided in the Bill itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me summarise them for the Deputies. First, a person must be in detention under section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, or section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939 and must be suspected of complicity in a serious offence.  Second, the taking of a sample must be authorised by a member of the Garda Síochána of at least superintendent rank who must have reasonable grounds for suspecting the involvement of a person in a serious offence and also for believing that the sample will tend to <Col N="364" /> confirm or disprove the person's involvement in the offence.  Third, where a sample is of an intrusive or intimate nature the consent of the person concerned must be ascertained in writing. Fourth, in the case of a person under 17, parental consent would be required. Fifth, blood and other intrusive samples must be taken by a doctor or a dentist as appropriate.  Sixth, before a sample is taken the person concerned must be informed of the offence in respect of which the sample is required and that the sample may be given in evidence.</P>
    <P>All the most important elements of the procedure to be followed in the taking of samples, including the safeguards I have just detailed, are specifically provided for in the Bill and I do not see the need to require that the regulations, which will only deal with matters of procedure, should first have to be approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 11 it is completely unnecessary.  There is simply no question of the powers provided for in the Bill being brought into operation before appropriate regulations are made and I do not see any need for a specific provision to this effect to be put in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister has not departed from recent precedent and allowed the House to discuss the very important aspect of the Bill that will be contained in the regulations. I certainly would not like to call into question the competence of the Garda technical staff or the skills that would be employed.  It is important, however, that we would have a step by step account of the exact procedures that will be carried out in a garda station on an arrest under the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Bill where the taking of a swab or sample is going to be employed.</P>
      <P>I would point the Minister to the precedent of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984. There are a number of questions that we did not have an opportunity of discussing at sufficient length on Committee Stage simply because they were matters that would be best left for the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="365" /> The exact procedures to be employed, for example, in the sealing of the samples, would have warranted more discussion. Will they be sealed in bottles or plastic bags and will that be done in front of the accused?  When will it be done and who will do it?  Will it be done in front of the medical supervisor?  Is the medical supervisor to stay in the garda station until everybody goes home or until there is a formal arresting procedure or charge laid against the alleged offender?  How speedily the tests should be done could be laid down in the regulations.  The phrase &ldquo;as soon as is practicable&rdquo; has been bandied about somewhat glibly this morning.  What exactly does it mean?  The procedures that are to be employed by the members of the Garda Síochána in the taking and, indeed, the destruction of samples, are the essence of the legislation. <Col N="366" /> They are to be addressed by regulation and it is somewhat sad that we, as Members of the House involved in processing the legislation, will not have an opportunity to discuss those regulations. That is unfortunate and I would urge the Minister to reconsider the matter between now and Report Stage.</P>
    <P>Members on all sides of the House have expressed their support for the Bill. Notwithstanding that the regulations will be of fundamental importance, it would be beneficial to everybody concerned if we had an opportunity to discuss certain aspects of the regulations when published.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 6 and 7 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following consideration of military proposals in the matter the officer rank structure in An Forsa Cosanta Áitiúil was reorganised in 1989 in order to bring it more into line with the structure in the Permanent Defence Force.  The main features of the restructuring were: the upgrading of the company commander appointments in the Infantry Corps from captain to commandant &mdash; a total of 83 appointments; the upgrading of the staff officer appointments in the corps units in the cavalry, signal, supply and transport, medical and military police corps from captain to commandant &mdash; a total of 21 appointments; the consequential upgrading of the second-in-command appointments in the infantry companies and appointments in the relevant corps units from lieutenant to captain; and the gradual phasing out of the <Col N="375" /> commandant appointments of area commander and the redistribution of those appointments as the company commander and staff officer appointments already referred to.</P>
    <P>The organisation also involved the redeployment of a number of commandant appointments from command FCA staffs.  The appointment of area commander was deleted from FCA establishments and the officers who held sole appointments of area commander <Col N="376" /> were gradually absorbed into the new structure.</P>
    <P>On 31 October 1990 there were 101 commandants and ten captains holding appointments of company commander. No lieutenants held such appointments. The other information sought by the Deputy is in the form of a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
    <P>The number of second-in-command appointments vacant and held by captains and lieutenants on 31 October 1990, is as follows:</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 46 together.</P>
      <P>The Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1990, which was presented to the House on 23 November 1990 and has been circulated to Deputies provides for the implementation of the recommendations of the Dáil Constitutency Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it was only after the little political accident at the end of October when the Progressive Democrats almost pulled out of Government that he finally accepted there was a need to bring forward that legislation as a matter of urgency?  Would he not further agree that it was not until that little political accident took place that the Government agreed to publish a Bill to implement the commission's report?  Will the Minister indicate whether it is intended that there will be a further census of population within the next two years which could result in a <Col N="381" /> further Bill to amend the constitutencies having to be brought before this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the Deputy's first question is that a Bill is being brought forward in the normal way to implement the recommendations of the independent commission which was set up earlier in the year.  With regard to the Deputy's second question, there will be another census.  Obviously we cannot pre-empt any changes which might take place because of that census but it is possible that there will be a need for us to look further at this matter.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that some private landlords, renting out furnished flats in the Dublin area, have given notice to quit to tenants with newly born children, or have refused accommodation to families with children; if he is prepared to take any action to deal with this problem in view of the rising housing crisis; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 72 together.</P>
      <P>The Bill to provide for the establishment of the Environment Protection Agency will be published in early December and will set out details of the agency's constitution and powers.  It is intended that the agency will be operational next year.</P>
      <P>As was made clear in the outline of the Government's proposals which has already been published, the agency will be fully independent in performing its functions.  It will operate under a small full-time executive board appointed through procedures which will be seen to guarantee its independence and competence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that this Bill has had an unnecessarily lengthy gestation period?  Would she further agree that she made a grave political error in voting against the Environment Protection Agency Bill published by the Fine Gael Party and that if she had not done so the agency would be established by now?  Finally, would she agree that the delay of one year on the part of the Minister in even publishing legislation has meant that a large amount of necessary environmental protection work has <Col N="383" /> been put back for a period of 12 months unnecessarily?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I would certainly agree that I have made a lot of political errors in my day but I would not agree that one such error was voting against Deputy Shatter's Bill which I did not believe was adequate for the job which had to be done.</P>
      <P>In relation to this Bill, I regret very much that it has taken such a long time for it to be published.  It is a comprehensive and complex piece of legislation which has involved much discussion and negotiation with many groups.  I am sure the Deputy is aware that we held a seminar with all the interested parties &mdash; the first time such a seminar was held &mdash; and got a number of good ideas from that seminar which led to some changes.  However, I am happy to be able to tell the Deputy that the Government have agreed to the text of a Bill which as I said, will be published in early December.  I do not accept that the delay in publishing this legislation has led to any environmental protection measures not being taken.</P>

Will the Minister indicate by what date she envisages the Bill completing its passage through this House?</P>

They will be appointed on the same basis as the board of An Bord <Col N="384" /> Pleanála and the Deputy will agree that that is a satisfactory system.

      <P>The advisory expert committee on local government reorganisation and reform are due to submit their recommendations to the Cabinet Sub-Committee chaired by me before the end of the year.  It is not possible to anticipate at this stage what proposals will emerge from this process.  It is not proposed to publish a report; instead legislation to give effect to the reorganisation programme will be prepared and published as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Under existing law, local elections are due to be held in June 1991.  The question of fixing a polling day will be considered in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The committee were asked to report by the end of September of this year but during the month of September they asked for an extension of the time because of the complexity of the matters under consideration, because of the summer holiday period, because they decided to invite submissions from interested individuals and organisations, and because quite a lot of people responded.  An extension of time was agreed to.  I understand from them now that they will be able to meet the deadline at the end of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister now accept that if he intended to proceed in this way such a committee should have been put together by him and asked to operate and report some three years ago? <Col N="386" /> Will the Minister agree that there is no prospect of any comprehensive legislation being published and passed through this House before June 1991? Will the Minister indicate if it is his intention that local elections will take place in June 1991, even if it proves not possible to enact such legislation prior to that date, and will the Minister agree that the many organisations that made submissions to this committee will be very interested in seeing the contents of the report that the committee make?  Would the Minister not agree that it is in the public interest that that report be published so that there can be an informed public debate on Government policy, or the need for local government reform and the the type of structures that are required to take Ireland through the nineties into the year 2000?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The advisory expert committee, as the name suggests, was appointed to give advice to the Cabinet sub-committee which I chair.  It is not proposed to publish that advice or the recommendations of the expert committee and it would not be normal practice to do that.  We are committed to local government reform.

Would the Minister agree that it is in the public interest that a report produced by an expert group such as this should be made available not only to all Members of this House, but publicly so that there can be informed public debate and assessment of the validity of the proposals that <Col N="387" /> the Government bring forward to reform local government?</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Environment</askee>
      <Quest>whether he has ascertained the view of the EC with regard to the levying of road tolls on roads which have been constructed exclusively from EC and public moneys; and if it is contrary to EC rules and regulations that following the construction of such roads, a private company be commissioned to administer a toll system.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The EC Regulations governing the Structural Funds permit the payment of EC assistance in respect of revenue-generating investments, including toll roads.  The general conditions for such assistance are set out in Article 17 (3) of Council Regulation EEC No. 2453/88 of 19 December 1988, known as the Co-ordinating Regulation.</P>
      <P>The Community Support Framework for Ireland provides that roads and other transport projects with a revenue-generating capacity will have to be examined on a case-by-case basis and that an average rate of aid of 50 per cent is estimated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be clear, therefore, that EC rules <Col N="388" /> permit the funding of a road from a combination of State, EC and private sources, with the exact details being decided in each case on its merits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that where the building of the road has derived solely from EC Regional Funds and State moneys, and where there has been no private funding of the road, it is at variance with EC policy that a toll be levied by a private company on a road so built?  Will the Minister indicate to the House whether he has informed the relevant authorities in the European Commission that it is his party's intention in Dublin County Council, and the Minister's intention, to attempt to impose a toll on the western parkway route which is to form part of the Dublin ring route, despite the fact that the route was funded solely from public and EC moneys with no private moneys involved?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the function of Dublin County Council to devise a toll scheme and that is the way it will be.  They are dealing with that matter and with any proposal put to them.  The matter has been discussed with the EC Commission. As I stated in the reply, it is possible to get EC structural aid towards this, but at a reduced level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the funding for this road has been provided by the EC, not at a reduced level on the basis of tolling being envisaged but at what was the appropriate level in the context of public moneys solely going into the building of the western parkway route, and that in those circumstances the tolling of the road is contrary to EC regulations?  Could the Minister indicate to the House whether he is now dropping his proposal that this road be tolled and leaving the matter solely to the discretion of Dublin County <Col N="389" /> Council, and that he will not interfere with that discretion in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>At a special meeting of Dublin County Council on 5 October that matter was dealt with when they passed a resolution, the terms of which I am sure the Deputy is familiar with.  A response to that resolution will be forthcoming in the near future.  In so far as the tolling of any road is concerned, even ones that have EC funding attached, we have been in touch with the Regional Policy Commissioner in this regard and he replied that he does not object in principle to tolling, but of course the tolled roads&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Quest>if he will use the powers available to him under the Derelict Sites Act, 1990, to instruct CIE to dispose of lands off Seville Place, Dublin 1 which are lying derelict and are surplus to the company's needs and are required by Dublin Corporation for housing purposes, in order to relocate the tenants of Sheriff Street, Dublin 1.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 102 together.  I would refer the Deputy to the reply to Question Nos. 5 and 16 of 10 July 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plan submitted by Dublin Corporation does not require my approval at this stage but I have written to my colleague, the Minister for Tourism and Transport, seeking his assistance in getting CIE agreement to make land in their ownership, identified by the corporation in their plan as suitable for housing, available to the corporation at an early date. I am awaiting the outcome of this approach.  Apart from that, approval has <Col N="391" /> issued to the specific housing schemes identified by the corporation for financing from the £1 million allocation in 1990 for the rehousing of tenants from the Sheriff Street Flats.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the corporation's architects' plan was submitted on 20 June 1990 no response has been received from the Department indicating that the Minister supports in principle, the contents of the submission.  May I now ask the Minister if he would indicate his own support, in principle, for Dublin Corporation's plan to rehouse tenants from Sheriff Street?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>We received the plan to which the Deputy has referred which identifies certain sites and existing houses which might be acquired but the plan does not require my formal approval in this regard.  On the contrary, we have been very supportive in so far as we are trying to get my colleague to negotiate with CIE to make available certain parcels of land, if possible, to accommodate what we regard as the reform programme for housing in the Sheriff Street area.  I hope they will be successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it from the Minister's final comment that he agrees in principle with the plan?  He has refused to say whether he does or does not, which I am sure leaves the tenants in Sheriff Street very uneasy about the future.  As the Minister has indicated, much of the land in question is in the ownership of CIE.  If CIE do not respond to the Minister's colleague's requests, having regard to the fact that the land is derelict and surplus to the needs of CIE, would the Minister be prepared to consider using his own powers under the Derelict Sites Act to encourage CIE to dispose of the land so that the corporation can acquire it for rehousing purposes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I took particular interest in derelict sites which might be included on the derelict sites register but I should point out that there are no such sites in <Col N="392" /> the Sheriff Street area on the register at this time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the land in question has been derelict for many years &mdash; I am sure the officials of the Department would confirm this &mdash; is not in use and is surplus to the needs of CIE&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;will the Minister at least make some inquiries to see if he can use his powers to force CIE to dispose of the land so that the corporation can acquire it for rehousing purposes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should make it quite clear that under section 13 of the Derelict Sites Act, 1990, the Minister has power to direct a statutory body to dispose of their interest in a derelict site entered on the relevant local authority derelict sites register.  Before the Minister can give such a direction he has to be satisfied that the land in question is not being used by the statutory authority in the performance of their functions and is unlikely to be required for that purpose. The Minister must also, of course, consult with the Minister responsible for the statutory body and consider any objections which may have been made so far as the proposal is concerned.  As I said, the register of derelict sites currently being compiled by Dublin Corporation does not have any land in the Sheriff Street area entered on it as yet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the people of Sheriff Street have been treated in a disgraceful way by both the Minister and his Department? Having regard to the relationship between the tenants and the Financial Services Centre and the speed at which developments are taking place there, would the Minister not agree that what he is doing is following a policy of dispersement and that he has no intention of facilitating the rehousing of the Sheriff Street residents within their parish as they have requested?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.</P>

      <P>It is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, £1 million has been allocated specifically in the corporation's 1990 capital allocation for the Sheriff Street project.  The intention was that this money would be spent in the North Wall parish to acquire any available property or houses identified in the plan.  Certain schemes have been attended to in that way, including the Oriel Street scheme and the 35 house scheme &mdash; phase 2 &mdash; at Portland Row as well as some private dwellings.  As funds become available I will be quite happy to facilitate the rehousing of the Sheriff Street tenants as early as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>A very brief question, Deputy, as I am going to another question shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that we are speaking here about a minimum of 340 families in the Sheriff Street complex and that the £1 million he speaks about will go nowhere near providing alternative accommodation for 340 families having regard to the amount of semi-derelict private housing in the area?  In general, £1 million is insignificant given the numbers wishing to be rehoused within the parish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="394" />
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that it was never intended that £1 million would satisfy the requirements, but what I am saying is that it was a start and it will have to be added to.  The question of the purchase of sites is the one Deputy Gregory is trying to pursue and I think the answer he has been given will enable him to pursue it in a more positive way.  I hope we will get a positive response, through my colleague, so far as the disposal of some of the CIE property there is concerned. That would provide the added impetus to provide extra funds, as required, to deal with the matter on a continuing basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister, again, if he would at least support in principle the submission made to him by Dublin Corporation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the special subcommittee regularly deal with this matter.  I hope they will be able to identify the sites, locations and houses which can be acquired to enable us do what we all wish to see happen in this case, that is, to rehouse all the people in the Sheriff Street flat complex.  That is my aim.</P>

      <Quest>when grant aid will be given for the replacement of defective chimneys at Crannmore Housing Estate, Sligo, for which he has already given a commitment.</Quest>

      <P>A capital allocation of £100,000 was made to Sligo Corporation under the remedial works scheme for expenditure this year.  The apportionment of the allocation between the corporation's approved projects, including this estate for which tender proposals have recently been approved, is a matter for the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, approval was given to allow work begin on the chimneys of those houses still in <Col N="395" /> the possession of Sligo Corporation.  He is also aware that no approval was given in respect of the houses, about 45 in all, being purchased at present.  Will the Minister make money available and sanction the submission of tenders for this purpose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy quite rightly said, approval of the corporation's proposals for the acceptance of the tender in respect of the 65 rented dwellings was issued on 15 November.  For the information of the Deputy, that included the chimneys and some ancillary works.  The estimated cost of this work is about £220,000.  The Deputy referred to about 40 houses in that estate which are being purchased under the tenant purchase schemes.  He will be aware that the maximum capital which the Department make available to the local authority in respect of such dwellings under the terms of the scheme is 50 per cent of the cost of the eligible work.  The balance has to be met by the purchaser.  This matter has not been pursued to finality as yet but, as the Deputy might well imagine, there is the option of extending it to cover reconstruction of the chimneys in the remaining 40 houses being purchased under the tenant purchase schemes.  I would support any such application in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the history of the outrageous planning involved, of which the Minister is well aware, and of the promises he made in Sligo, will he give an undertaking to the House that he will recommend funding the total cost of the replacement of those chimneys?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Purchased dwellings can be included for grant assistance under the remedial scheme.  I will be supportive of an application in that regard under the terms of the scheme as it now exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>At present the scheme allows only 50 per cent support so far as <Col N="396" /> eligible work is concerned.  It is a matter for the local authority to deal with the tenants in that regard.  I will be supportive of an application should one be submitted to me in that way.</P>

Is the Minister also aware that subsequently he gave consideration to postponing the elections due in June 1990 due to pressure put on him by Fianna Fáil councillors and when he considered the matter he postponed them?  Does the Minister anticipate sitting Fianna Fáil councillors putting him under pressure during the course of the next few months to postpone the June 1991 local elections? Does he consider, if he is put under such pressure, he is likely to cave in again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to think that we will come to a decision smartly.  The incinerator is necessary for a number of reasons, particularly because of the principle of self-sufficiency and also the principle of proximity in relation to hazardous <Col N="402" /> waste disposal.  I believe a hazardous waste facility is an integral part of any modern industrial infrastructure.  The location will be a matter for whichever operator is finally favoured.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>One has to negotiate about the grants and the contractual arrangements in a major undertaking like this. There is no undue delay; it will be proceeded with as soon as possible.  As far as Cork is concerned, the operator will finally decide where it is hoped to locate such a facility.  Then it will have to go through an EIA process and the planning process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had quite a few representations in this regard.  We have also had considerable representations from industry asking us to get on with the job.  It is reckoned that we must have this facility to deal with toxic hazardous waste accumulating in this country and now being exported.  Within a few years we will not be in the happy position of being able to export our hazardous waste, so we will have to deal with it ourselves.  It would be irresponsible not to grasp this nettle.

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wholeheartedly agree with the Deputy that we should seek to improve production processes and reduce waste at source.  I have put forward that view on a number of occasions, as has the Minister of State, Deputy Harney.  I also believe we should have a greater recycling programme which would reduce the amount of hazardous toxic waste.  No matter how well these things are done, we will still generate an increasing tonnage of hazardous waste which must be disposed of in a safe way which can be monitored.</P>

      <Quest>if he will outline for each local authority, the allocations he has made in 1990 to enable them to carry out essential resurfacing of rural roads; the volume and percentage increase which he will be allocating to the same local authorities in 1991; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1990 road grant allocations to each local authority for non-national, regional and county roads are set out in my reply to Question No. 128 of 27 March 1990.</P>
      <P>Pending the determination of the overall road grant provisions for 1991, I am not in a position to indicate the amount of the road grant allocations to individual local authorities for next year</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it is ludicrous that local authorities have not been notified of their roads grant for this year at a time when quite a few local authorities have brought in their books of estimates and others are in the process of doing so?  Would the Minister further agree that the funding <Col N="405" /> available for county roads is grossly inadequate, that the basic structure of roads is being undermined and that colossal amounts of money will be required in years to come to repair the damage which is being allowed to occur?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that.  The money provided this year is being spent during 1990.  The normal practice in local authorities is that, on receipt of their allocations, they have roads meetings early in the year and decide how they will spend the money throughout the year. There is nothing unusual in that.  I must point out to the Deputy that in 1990 an exceptional amount of money was provided under the county road regional fund, amounting to £82.5 million in total, a huge advance on the previous year and earlier years.  It is the highest single amount provided in this area for many years.  The job is being done well and I am receiving reports from around the country that the county roads are improving dramatically.  We hope to continue with that good work next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that by this time last year and the year before the road grants allocation had been notified to local authorities?  Can he indicate by what date the grants will be notified?  Can he confirm that due to the financial cutbacks to be implemented in his Department the road grants for 1991 are to be reduced and that the reason the figures have not been announced is that he is trying to avoid that matter being discussed at estimates meetings of local authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is grossly unfair of the Deputy to make that suggestion when he knows very well that the Book of Estimates has not yet been published. That kind of comment would be all right if it were to be borne out, but that it not so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The sum of £82.5 million <Col N="406" /> to which I referred is the amount for non-national roads in 1990.  As soon as the Book of Estimates is published people will know how active the Minister has been on behalf of local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister believes that the condition of county roads has improved in any significant way, he must not be travelling the roads of Ireland. With regard to the estimates meetings of local authorities, is he aware that local authorities are now proceeding on the basis that the allocation they will receive in 1991 will be maintained at the same level as in 1990.  I take it, from what the Minister has said, they will not be disappointed.  The other side of the coin is that, when estimates are being prepared, there are implications for other areas in local authority budgets for road grants which have rendered planning quite difficult this year.  Is the Minister confirming that local authorities who proceeded on the basis that they will receive next year at least the same amount as this year will not be disappointed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is seeking a commitment from me which I cannot give the House in advance of the publication of the Book of Estimates.  That would be irresponsible of me and I cannot do so, except to say that, over the past few years, we have increased very substantially the amount of money available under this subhead.  The Deputy will remember that, a few years ago, I introduced a three-year programme involving expenditure of £150 million for county roads because of the disgraceful allocations made by the previous Coalition Government in that area for many years before that.  In addition to that, as was announced in the budget earlier this year, there was an extra £15 million on top of which was granted the flood damage money which was fresh money as well. <Col N="407" /> Therefore, the Deputy will see that a lot of money and resources have been put into this area.  I think that was necessary; the roads infrastructure was not in a good state but it has been improving quite dramatically.  I think I can see the Deputy smile in support of that contention.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that, as Minister with overall responsibility for housing, there is something seriously wrong with the way in which policy is being administered at local level with State funds, if 380 houses capable of being allocated remain vacant because they cannot be refurbished while the housing lists daily get longer?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The word &ldquo;housing&rdquo; has been used repeatedly here.  For the record, would the Minister break down that figure of 369 between housing stock and flats?  For example, would he not agree that there are in Ballymun 200 vacant flats which have been vandalised to the extent that they are not habitable; that there are 500 people waiting &mdash; because of the housing crisis existing in Dublin city &mdash; to go into those flats, on <Col N="410" /> the waiting list for Ballymun alone?  Furthermore, would the Minister agree that, due to cutbacks in the rates support grant on the part of his Government, Dublin Corporation are incapable of refurbishing even in Ballymun, 200 flats which have been vandalised, because of shortage of funding available to that local authority? Would the Minister agree that it is his responsibility and not that of the local authority?</P>

      <P>I would have thought the Deputy would have been fair enough to admit that I have been the first Minister for quite some time to have taken a very active interest in the whole question of the refurbishment of the Ballymun complex. I have provided extra funding for that purpose.  There is an ongoing programme there.  There are 369 vacant dwellings out of a total of 36,000.  There will always be some vacant dwellings, but the local authority have a programme to deal with that.  In so far as remedial works are concerned, the Deputy will be aware that I have very substantially increased the amount of money being provided for that purpose throughout the country.  I believe that is money well spent on the reinstatement of existing vacant dwellings, and improving inadequate sanitary services; indeed, keeping in good order pre-1940 and cheaply built houses so that we reap the best benefit from our housing stock.  Very substantial amounts of money have been expended on that scheme over the past few years from a base of virtually nothing in 1986.</P>

      <P>Local authorities are responsible for the management, maintenance and improvement of the rented dwellings and funding for these works must normally be provided from the authorities' own-resources.  Limited funding may be available under the remedial works scheme to enable authorities to carry out major refurbishment projects in designated estates, including some flat complexes.  This year, £15 million has been made available to local authorities under the scheme.</P>

      <P>While agreeing that some money has been made available for the refurbishment of certain blocks of flats in Dublin's inner city, the Minister will be aware that there are lots of flats urgently in need of refurbishment, including Marrowbone Lane &mdash; which was shortlisted by the local authority some years ago and which has not been allocated a penny? Would the Minister agree that blocks of flats such as those in Bridgefoot Street and St. Teresa's Gardens are in dire need of central Government funding for refurbishment purposes and that, unless such money is forthcoming, the quality of life in those flats will continue to be deplorable, giving rise to the type of dereliction one observes, particularly in ground floor flats which have been vandalised and abandoned by tenants?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do accept that we should do what we can to improve on funding in this area.  That has been my policy for the last three years.  It is interesting to remember that, for instance, in 1985 0.8 per cent of £1 million was the total sum provided for the remedial works scheme. <Col N="412" /> Progressively I have increased that to £15 million this year.  I would like to think I would be able to maintain it at that level of activity so that we could get rid of what the Deputy correctly described as a large number of dwellings in dire need of refurbishment. I would like to see the seven refurbishment projects at present in progress in this area of the city progress as speedily as possible so that we could finish them and then undertake the other necessary projects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that, having regard to the substantial reduction, on the capital side, in the provision of moneys for new housing from a general financial point of view that he has considerable room to manoeuvre. Has he any proposals to deal with the problem if he recognises there is a problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that it would be wise to have improved management with tenants involvement and participation.  It is interesting to note that this year the £51 million provided for social housing was quite a substantial increase on the money provided by the Government the previous year.  It was £38 million the year before.  One must take into consideration the increases I have been able to arrange for remedial works, from that very low base up to the £15 million this year, and I think we can continue with that scheme at that level of activity.  It is not going to be easy to do that but we will in a short few years bring about a happy situation for the vast majority of these estates many of which, as the Deputy knows, are in need of refurbishment.  The Minister is aware of that as well.</P>

Will the Minister agree that this crucial link is missing, particularly given the relevance of refurbishment schemes costing millions of pounds such as those taking place in Oliver Bond House and Fatima Mansions?

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I wish to report to the Dáil on the Summit Meeting in Paris of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), which I attended, together with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, from 19 to 21 November.</P>
      <P>At the outset, I should like to pay a richly deserved tribute to President Mitterrand and the French authorities for the warmth of their hospitality and to express my admiration for the flawless efficiency with which they organised this large, complex operation.  Our thanks are due to them for the success of an occasion when the excellent arrangements fully matched its historic importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="461" /> I have already arranged for the concluding document of the Summit, entitled &ldquo;The Charter of Paris for a New Europe&rdquo;, which all CSCE participants signed at the meeting, together with the text of the agreement reached in the Vienna negotiations on Confidence &mdash; and Security-Building Measures, to be placed in the Library of the House.  I am also making arrangements for the publication of the concluding document so that it can be made known as widely as possible in this country.</P>
    <P>The Summit was attended by the 34 CSCE participating states, which included the US and Canada and all the countries of Europe, except Albania, with a combined population of about one billion people.  President Mitterrand, in his introductory comments placed this conference in an historic context.</P>
    <P>The Congress of Vienna in 1815 followed destructive wars which saw the overthrow of empires and a fundamental redrawing of boundaries in Europe.  The Helsinki Conference in 1975, more than 100 years later, took place in an atmosphere of Super-Power rivalry against a background of strongly conflicting ideologies. This Paris Summit, on the other hand, represented a consensus unique in modern times, among many different countries, including the US, the USSR and the EC, on such basic issues as democracy, human rights, economic development, security and the environment. As such, it represents a major advance in international co-operation with the potential of great benefit for mankind throughout the world.</P>
    <P>The Summit took place following an initiative taken by President Gorbachev a year ago.  Deputies will recall that the CSCE is a process which has been seeking to achieve more stable and secure relations in a hitherto divided Europe. The previous CSCE Summit in 1975 adopted the Helsinki Final Act which set out ten principles to guide relations between the 35 participating States &mdash; now 34 following the recent unification of Germany &mdash; irrespective of their political, economic and social systems: it also contained a balanced and comprehensive <Col N="462" /> programme of measures for co-operation in the areas of military security, economics, science, technology and the environment as well as in the humanitarian, cultural and information fields.  The Helsinki provisions have been extended and amplified at a number of CSCE follow-up meetings, of which the most recent was concluded in Vienna in January 1989 as well as at additional &ldquo;inter-sessional&rdquo; meetings of the participating states.</P>
    <P>Up to now, the CSCE remained just a &ldquo;process&rdquo; organised on a conference basis rather than functioning through established institutional structures. Meanwhile, as the CSCE process was under way, momentous changes have taken place in Central and Eastern Europe &mdash; influenced in part, at least, by that process.  Regimes which formerly held power there have been swept away and replaced by democratic governments which are working to move their countries towards free market economies and respect for human rights.  Negotiations between the two alliances and between the Super Powers have led to dramatic reductions in military forces in Europe. The atmosphere of threat and counter-threat, the pervasive tension which characterised these earlier years, has been replaced by a new climate of openness and increased confidence.  Doctrines of security and defence based on the East/West confrontation must now be radically reassessed.  The dramatically reduced military threat has posed fundamental questions for the military alliances about their role in the new situation.</P>
    <P>On the morning of 19 November, immediately prior to the opening of the conference, I attended the ceremony for the signing of the Treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe.  This, the first such treaty since World War II, which was the outcome of extended negotiations between the 22 nations of the two military alliances, contains agreement on significant reductions in the level of armaments in Europe.  At the same time, the two alliances signed a joint declaration which has formally brought an end to the Cold War, with both alliances declaring <Col N="463" /> they will never threaten each other or become adversaries again.  Whatever about NATO, it is clear that the Warsaw Pact is coming to an end.  In fact, the President of Czechoslovakia stated specifically that the Warsaw Pact countries are to meet shortly to definitively decide an ending its military structures while the Prime Minister of Hungary expressed his hope that the pact will be dissolved before the end of 1991.</P>
    <P>Ireland, in common with the other neutral and non-aligned participating states was not, of course, a participant in these negotiations, and therefore not a signatory to this treaty.  At the Summit meeting proper, I laid particular emphasis on our welcome for the progress which this treaty represents as an important step towards the mutual reduction of armaments and armed forces, one which will bring about a qualitative increase in the security of all.  I expressed the hope that this treaty would also help to move us nearer to the attainment of what we regard as a key objective: the halting of the nuclear arms race and the elimination of all nuclear weapons.</P>
    <P>The parameters of the security situation in Europe have therefore changed fundamentally and we must now, together with our partners in the European Community and the other CSCE participants, adapt our thinking in a number of areas to a completely changed situation.  New thinking is called for to enable us to draw the maximum benefit from the progress already achieved, and from the advent of a peaceful, secure European order.</P>
    <P>The major changes brought about in the CSCE also require us to examine the implications of this new situation for the current efforts of the Community to develop further its own identity in the international arena.  As part of that process, 11 members states, including Ireland, agreed at the Rome European Council on the objective of a common foreign and security policy with the aim of giving greater coherence and effectiveness to the Community's international <Col N="464" /> action.  The Intergovernmental Conference on Political Union which begins in Rome on 15 December will examine this issue.  This examination must now have special regard to the new Pan-European framework within which the security and stability of all the countries in Europe in future will be assured.</P>
    <P>In the discussions to date some member states have argued it is important to distinguish between security, which is a broader concept, and military defence.  I believe it is right to make this distinction.  The Twelve are already committed under the Single European Act to seek to co-ordinate their positions on the political and economic aspects of security.  The new commitment to a common foreign and security policy could now mean that this co-ordination would extend to other areas, such as disarmament and concerted action against international terrorism.  However, there is as yet no meeting of minds among the member states of the Community.  Some insist that European military defence should continue to be a matter for the NATO Alliance, which involves the USA and Canada, and not for the Community as such.  Others see the Western European Union as the right forum for these questions.  It seems clear therefore that a common EC foreign and security policy, when articulated, is unlikely to include specific military aspects at this stage.</P>
    <P>The momentous developments in Europe over the last 18 months &mdash; the collapse of the communist or socialist regimes, their replacement by democratic and free market systems, the progressive disintegration of the Warsaw Treaty Organisation &mdash; underlines the need to develop new Pan-European institutions to accommodate the new security situation in a Europe which, since the end of World War II had been based on mutually antagonistic alliances and ideological confrontation.  There was also the need to buttress the emerging democracies and to strengthen ties between the countries of Europe through increased co-operation.  Furthermore, it was clearly necessary to establish institutions which would enable the participating <Col N="465" /> states, in particular the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, to provide for their security after the demise of the Warsaw Pact.</P>
    <P>There was a consensus at last week's Paris CSCE Summit that the necessary framework would be formed by development and enhancement of the CSCE process, which provides the only existing forum that spans all Europe and includes the US and Canada as equal partners, and also through the enlargement and revitalisation of other bodies such as the Council of Europe, the Economic Commission for Europe and the OECD.  A number of decisions to achieve these ends were taken and these are contained in the Paris Charter.</P>
    <P>Decisions in the CSCE are taken by consensus.  The Helsinki Final Act, and other CSCE documents, are not legally binding on the participating states. However, they represent a solemn political commitment by them.</P>
    <P>The first part of the Paris Charter sets out for the first time a common commitment by all CSCE participants to democracy and respect for specific human rights, including the right to own private property.  The participating states have undertaken to build, consolidate and strengthen democracy as the only system of Government, and to recognise that the free will of the individual forms the necessary basis for successful economic and social development.</P>
    <P>With the dawning of a new era in Europe, the section on friendly relations among participating states reaffirms the commitment to the Ten Principles of the Helsinki Final Act as the basis for relations among participating states.  It renews the pledge to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.  The Charter does not single out any of the principles, and retains the possibility, set out in the Helsinki Final Act, of changing frontiers, in accordance with international law, by peaceful means and by agreement.</P>
    <P>In the second part of the Charter, the CSCE participants agree to build on the <Col N="466" /> provisions relating to the human dimension which were agreed earlier this year in Copenhagen.  This is an area which has always been of particular interest to this country.  We see the individual as central to the whole CSCE process.  Unless individuals are guaranteed the effective enjoyment of their fundamental rights and democratic freedoms, there can be no lasting basis for stability and peace, nor can genuine security exist between the participating states.  I am especially glad, therefore, that a decision was taken to convene a seminar of experts in Oslo in November 1991, and also that the mechanism to ensure the full implementation of commitments in this area is to be expanded.  We look forward to the holding of a seminar on national minorities in Geneva next August, and to the Moscow Conference on the Human Dimension later in the year.</P>
    <P>We see it as a matter of great importance that the Paris Charter recognises that security in Europe, in all its aspects, is the direct concern of all the participating states, irrespective of whether or not they belong to a military alliance.  In this area, a number of important decisions were taken by the CSCE members.  The meeting endorsed a series of innovative, confidence and security-building, measures &mdash; essentially these measures are intended to ensure that routine military activities do not themselves become a source of tension &mdash; and confirmed that the Vienna CSBM negotiations would continue until the Helsinki follow-up summit meeting which is to be held in 1992.</P>
    <P>The Paris Summit also welcomed the decision of the countries participating in the negotiations on Conventional Forces in Europe to continue these negotiations with a view to their conclusion no later than the Helsinki meeting in 1992.  We particularly welcome the summmit's decision that there should now be more structured co-operation among all participating states on security matters, and that discussions and consultations will take place among the 34 participants aimed at establishing by 1992 new negotiations on disarmament and confidence <Col N="467" /> and security building open to all participating states.  This represents an important departure from the previous practice, adopted at NATO insistence, of limiting disarmament negotiations, to the members of the two alliances.  In my statement to the conference, I expressed the hope that this process would rapidly lead to further substantial reductions in all types of weapons.  The Summit also agreed on co-operation to eradicate terrorism and to combat illicit drug-trafficking.</P>
    <P>The Summit also decided that new forms of co-operation for resolving disputes should be sought.  This co-operation would cover, in particular, a range of methods for the peaceful settlement of disputes.  This question will be considered further at a meeting of legal experts to be held in Valletta early next year.</P>
    <P>While co-operation in all of the fields of security which I have mentioned &mdash; disarmament, confidence building, and the peaceful settlement of disputes &mdash; is still at a relatively early stage of development, I am confident that, as it broadens and deepens, it will come to represent a satisfactory framework of security for all the countries of Europe.</P>
    <P>With regard to economic-co-operation, the Charter underlines the need to build further on the results of the Bonn Conference held earlier this year, with its emphasis on democratic institutions and economic liberty as the basis for social and economic progress.  It stresses that economic co-operation, based on market systems, constitutes an essential element for the construction of a prosperous and united Europe.  It calls for further co-operation in the economic field, in science and technology, and also in the fields of energy, transport and tourism. It records our commitments to free enterprise, increased trade, social justice, effective policies to tackle unemployment and support for the countries concerned in their transition to the market economy.</P>
    <P>The conference recognised the important role of the European Community in <Col N="468" /> both the political and economic development of Europe.  I stated that Ireland fully shares with our partners the intention that the Community should participate in the construction of a wider Europe and welcomed the fact that the Community, represented by Italy, which currently holds the Presidency, and by the Commission in the areas for which it has competence, would be signing the Paris Charter.</P>
    <P>The Paris Charter pays particular attention to questions of the environment, and outlined the scope for further co-operation in this area within the CSCE framework, as well as in co-operation with other international bodies. Other areas also singled for special attention include culture, migrant workers, and the Mediterranean.  The last part of the Paris Chapter sets out the following decisions of the Heads of State or Government on the establishment of new institutional structures intended to facilitate the achievement of the objectives set out in the first two parts of the document.</P>
    <P>First, it was decided that there should be regular meetings of CSCE Heads of State or Government.  The first of these will take place at the Helsinki follow-up meeting in 1992 and others will follow on the occasion of subsequent meetings, normally every two years.  In addition, Foreign Ministers will meet as a council regularly and at least once a year.  These meetings will provide the central forum for political consultations within the CSCE process.  Meetings of other Ministers may also be convened.</P>
    <P>To prepare the meetings of the Council and carry out its decisions, a committee of senior officials will be established.  It will also review current issues and consider future work of the CSCE.  Additional meetings of representatives of the CSCE participating states may be convened to discuss questions of urgent concern. A CSCE secretariat will be set up to provide administrative services for the various meetings.  It will be small, and will consist of officials seconded by their Governments for a fixed period.  It will be located in Prague.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="469" /> A Conflict Prevention Centre will be established.  Initially, this will deal largely with the exchange of information agreed under the provisions on confidence &mdash; and security-building measures.  A particularly important aspect of its work will be to provide a forum for consultation and co-operation between the participating states in the event that unusual military activity in a neighbouring state might give rise to concern.  It is intended that this will defuse a potentially serious situation: in the words of President Mitterrand, &ldquo;preventing a spark from igniting a powder keg&rdquo;.  Provision exists for its functions to be extended in the future by the Council of Ministers, and we would favour such extension.  It will be located temporarily in Vienna.</P>
    <P>An Office for Free Elections to facilitate contacts and to exchange information on elections within participating states will be established.</P>
    <P>The Paris Summit has called for greater parliamentary involvement in the CSCE process, in particular through the creation of a CSCE parliamentary assembly, involving Members of Parliaments from all participating states. This is a development which we fully support.</P>
    <P>The decisions which were taken at the Paris Summit meeting were historic in the truest sense and of world-wide relevance. Many speakers at the Summit echoed the President's view that a shot fired in Europe is heard in the Canadian woods and a wave which breaks in the Pacific is felt on the shores of Europe.</P>
    <P>The Paris Summit has taken far-reaching decisions in establishing a new framework for relations among the nations of Europe, the US and Canada and, through the institutions it has established, will enable the CSCE to fulfil a new and strengthened role as a framework for peace, security, stability, co-operation and prosperity in a new Europe based on democratic principles, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the market-oriented economic system.</P>
    <P>This does not mean, however, that the <Col N="470" /> door has been closed on any future evolution of the shape of Europe, or that legitimate aspirations will be suppressed. By no means; the Paris Charter envisages the possibility of changes through peaceful and democratic means.  Similarly, the CSCE process fully acknowledges the value of the great diversity which has contributed so much to the European heritage and provides for its preservation.</P>
    <P>During my time in Paris, I had brief discussions with Presidents Bush and Gorbachev and with Chancellor Kohl as well as with President Havel of Czechoslovakia.</P>
    <P>I had more substantive meetings with the Prime Ministers of Canada, Czechoslovakia and Sweden.  Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada gladly accepted my invitation to visit Ireland next summer.  The Prime Minister intends to bring a group of businessmen with him to look at trade and investment opportunities in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In my talk with Prime Minister Calfa of Czechoslovakia we followed up on certain matters of interest between our two countries discussed initially in the meeting we had earlier this year in Dublin Castle.</P>
    <P>Prime Minister Carlsson of Sweden and I discussed the recent EC-EFTA negotiations which are being conducted with a view to the establishment of a European Economic Space.  We also considered certain aspects of Sweden's relations with the EC.</P>
    <P>President Mitterrand in summing up made the important point that we had successfully combined to lay out the strategy, the concepts and the formulae but that it was now necessary to put our words into practice and to ensure the implementation of what we had enunciated.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the momentous steps which have been taken and enshrined in the Paris Charter have laid the foundations for a peaceful and secure Europe, in which rights and liberties will be fully protected by the rule of law, and with a market system oriented towards the wellbeing and prosperity of all.  I have <Col N="471" /> made it clear that the Government are fully committed to the attainment of these objectives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1975 Helsinki Final Act of the CSCE states: &ldquo;The participatiing states regard as inviolable all one another's frontiers&rdquo; and &ldquo;they consider that their frontiers can be changed in accordance with international law by peaceful means and by agreement&rdquo;.  That declaration was signed in 1975 by Ireland and has implications for the Constitution of this country, in particular for Articles 2 and 3 thereof.  Our Constitution should state, explicitly and clearly, that we envisage a change in the status of Northern Ireland only to bring it within the jurisdiction of this House by peaceful means and with the agreement of a majority in Northern Ireland.  To say that in our Constitution would bring it fully and exactly into conformity with the Helsinki Final Act which we signed in 1975 and with the terms of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  For us to insert that in our Constitution would bring it fully in line with principles set out by the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe.  It is something that we in this House could do immediately in practical terms to show that we are serious in our commitment to building a new Europe, based on the peaceful resolution of disputes and the creation of a structure for peace in Europe.</P>
      <P>The best way to lead in matters of this kind is by example and this would set a very concrete and practical example as far as our commitment to peaceful means for solving disputes &mdash; and consent &mdash; is concerned.  My party, Fine Gael, are currently working out detailed proposals on this matter which we will be placing before the other parties in Dáil Éireann soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Charter of Paris, to which the Taoiseach referred, adopted by the CSCE Heads of Government last week states: &ldquo;We affirm that ethnic, cultural, linguistic and religious identity of national minorities will be protected and <Col N="472" /> that persons belonging to national minorities have the right to freely express, preserve and develop that identity without any discrimination and in full equality before the law&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This declaration is of great importance and of particular importance to Ireland. It provides clear European backing for the efforts that successive Irish Governments have made to ensure that there is a strong guaranteed position for the minority living in Northern Ireland. However, European thinking on the protection of minorities has not developed sufficiently.  We want a guarantee, not only for the rights of individual members of minority communities throughout Europe, but also for the collective rights of those minorities in terms of practical participation and effective say in the political process.</P>
    <P>In that context, the power sharing model pioneered under the Sunningdale Agreement is an example &mdash; perhaps the best example available anywhere in Europe &mdash; of a guaranteed form of practical political participation linking minority and majority communities in the process of joint decision making in their area of responsibility.  The Sunningdale Agreement, and the power sharing model devised under it &mdash; and indeed the Anglo-Irish Agreement with its wider context involving bilateral relations &mdash; provide a model for the resolution of disputes and difficulties of this kind elsewhere in Europe.  For example, it provides for a relationship that could be brought into being between Hungary and Romania in respect of the Hungarian minority community within Romania.  It provides perhaps a model also for the arrangements that will have to be devised in the Baltic States to provide adequate rights for the Russian-speaking communities living within the Baltic States in the event that those states acquire a greater degree of independence in their operations.</P>
    <P>The Sunningdale Agreement in terms of internal arrangements, and the Anglo-Irish Agreement in terms of, for example, relations between Great Russia and the individual Baltic States, provide <Col N="473" /> a model for a guarantee of the protection of the rights of minorities in particular areas where they happen to live together. This is a very positive contribution that we can make to building a new Europe in terms of our concrete experience &mdash; our hard and difficult concrete experience &mdash; when we faced exactly those types of problems in our own history.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed in some respects with the outcome of the Copenhagen meeting.  For example, when it came to seeking to establish in the declaration of the Copenhagen meeting &mdash; this was a more detailed meeting dealing with specific human rights aspects of the CSCE process &mdash;&ldquo;education, cultural and religious institutions for minorities which could seek voluntary contributions&rdquo;, which is important as people should have the right to run their own schools, it was necessary to add, in order to get countries to agree to that at Copenhagen the further words, &ldquo;that this should be in conformity with national legislation&rdquo;. That took the whole meaning out of it because national legislation can provide almost anything.  So there was no guarantee of the right of people to establish their own schools in conformity with their own religious or ethnic minorities. That is a deficiency in the protection of minorities given under the CSCE.</P>
    <P>To some, the rights of minorities may seem to be a very esoteric subject but in fact the rights of minorities are at the very heart of the preservation of peace in the new Europe that has been created as a result of <i>glasnost</i> and <i>perestroika,</i> because the biggest threat to peace does not now come from the Warsaw Pact, no more than it comes from NATO; it comes in the potential release of destructive energies in Europe arising from the break up of states and republics in Eastern Europe on ethnic lines because of long standing minority disputes.  In modern Europe different ethnic groups are inexplicably mixed.  To preserve peace, it is essential that political and legal structures should exist to ensure that ethnic groups can live together and that there is a system of external monitoring and <Col N="474" /> control of those political and legal structures to ensure that they work.</P>
    <P>Because of our experience and because of our success in dealing with some of these problems, we should be in the forefront in developing European models of thinking in regard to this matter.  That is perhaps the most important thing that can be done to preserve peace in Europe &mdash; putting in place structures that will guarantee, as far as any humanly devised stricture can, harmonious relations between minorities and majority ethnic communities who happen to be living together.</P>
    <P>I know that the Council of Europe has already commenced some work on political rights for minorities and it is important that this work be actively encouraged.  There is a danger that the Charter of Paris will raise unsustainable expectations in this or in other areas.  For instance, the charter contains a reference to the establishment of a conflict prevention centre in Vienna but little information is given as to what this conflict prevention centre will do.  As far as one can see from what the Taoiseach said and from what the charter tells us, all it will do is exchange information about conflicts. Is there any point in setting up a separate parallel conflict prevention centre in Vienna without real powers when the UN already exists, and all the member states are members of the UN, and the UN, through its Security Council, have powers to do something concrete about resolving conflicts?  I am not drawing any conclusion but that is a question we should try to answer in this debate. Sometimes setting up new institutions can be a bad thing in the sense that they create confusion and lack focus even though they may be motivated by goodwill.</P>
    <P>Likewise, the conference decided to establish an office for free elections in Warsaw.  What practical powers will this body have?  Surely the procedures for validating elections already established under the aegis of the Council of Europe, are sufficient to deal with this problem. To become and remain a member of the Council of Europe one must operate free <Col N="475" /> and fair elections and, if one does not continue to do so, one can be expelled from the Council of Europe.  Do we want a situation where, for example, the Council of Europe decide that an election is not fair but the office for fair elections in Warsaw comes to a different conclusion? That potential for confusion should not exist.  It would make more sense if the Warsaw body were brought under the aegis of the Council of Europe rather than had a separate existence under the CSCE.  That is another question that needs to be addressed in this debate.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the declaration in the Charter of Paris that we unreservedly condemn as criminal all acts, methods and practices of terrorism, and express our determination to work for its eradication. The best way to work for the eradication of terrorism is through the extension and strengthening of the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism.  This convention restricts the use of the political defence against extradition for offences of terrorism but is far too restrictive.  The European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism should be extended to ensure that all acts of violence are excluded from the political defence against extradition in contrast with the present provision in the convention which only allows that defence to be set aside in respect of a limited number of acts of violence.  I have tabled a motion in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe to change the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism, to make it a much stronger instrument by excluding political defence in respect of all acts of violence.  I hope that the declaration in the Paris Charter in regard to this matter will give further momentum to moves in the direction of having a stronger European Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism along the lines of the motion I have tabled.</P>
    <P>I hope that the fact that the CSCE are now involved in the subject will not be used as an excuse to delay action on the matter at the Council of Europe, because <Col N="476" /> action is urgently required.  Transboundary terrorism will become an even larger problem in the Europe of the future.  If European peace is to be preserved, we must have strong and effective means of ensuring that those who engage in such activities cannot use borders within Europe as a means of avoiding justice.</P>
    <P>One of the big question marks over the whole process of the CSCE is to establish what exactly is to be the relationship between the CSCE and the Council of Europe.  The Council of Europe already &mdash; or will soon &mdash; represents virtually all the countries that are in the CSCE with the exception of Canada and the USA.  The Council of Europe should speed up their work on European integration.  One way in which they can do this would be by departing from the principle of absolute unanimity in their committees of Ministers, which is the current practice.  In that way the Council of Europe could deal more expeditiously and in a concrete way with many of the matters now the responsibility of the CSCE.  The Council of Europe have an existing administrative structure for making decisions and implementing them.  That cannot be said of the CSCE which do not have an administrative structure at all and are simply talking about seconding civil servants from various national administrations.  I hope that when the Taoiseach replies to this debate he will advert to that subject.</P>
    <P>In the past the Taoiseach indicated that the CSCE was his preferred means of dealing with the military aspects of security in Europe.  It is inevitable, in this hard and harsh world, that we acknowledge the fact that there are such things as military aspects of security.  We can pretend that if we bury our heads in the sand and bury our weapons six feet under the ground, nobody will ever attack us. That would be a rather innocent view to take.  The reality is that part of security must be defence.  You cannot defend yourself unless you have the means to do so.  If you sit there defenceless you may be attacked.  That is the reality.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has expressed the view that the best means of defending the new Europe we are building is through the <Col N="477" /> CSCE.  He seems to suggest that this is a preferable alternative to seeing the much tighter European Political Union to be created by the Twelve members of the European Community acquiring a defensive dimension.  The Charter of Paris makes it quite clear that the Taoiseach's preferred option is simply closed because it states clearly: &ldquo;it fully recognises the freedom of States to choose their own security arrangements&rdquo;.  In other words, it is washing its hands of this matter.  If there is to be a system of European defence it will not emerge in the CSCE.  I do not believe the Taoiseach can use the CSCE as a shield against facing the issue that must be faced, that is, if we create a European Political Union &mdash; I underline the word &ldquo;if&rdquo;&mdash; with one currency, one economic policy, one social security system and one political entity, then there must be some means available in this hard old world of actually defending that new creation.  I do not think that issue can be dodged. Neither the Taoiseach nor any of the other parites who genuinely believes in European unity can dodge that issue anymore. When such a union is created it will have to be defended.  That does not mean it will happen tomorrow or that we must sketch out in detail how it is to be done, but we must be prepared to envisage the possibility that if we create something we must be prepared to defend it.</P>
    <P>There are a few matters on which I would like to know the Taoiseach's view. I understand Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, whose annexation to the Soviet Union this State has never accepted or recognised, sought representation at the CSCE in Paris.  I would be interested to know what view the Taoiseach took on that matter.  I understand that the Spanish Prime Minister, Felipe Gonzales, stated he believed that the CSCE process should be used as a means of dissolving the dispute that Spain has with Britain regarding Gibraltar.  What view did the Taoiseach take on that matter?  What is the Taoiseach's view on the proposed creation of a parliamentary assembly in Europe?  This would be important and <Col N="478" /> would provide a democratic dimension which is frequently lacking in international relations.  I hope the Taoiseach will indicate strong support for early action on the creation of an assembly for Europe.</P>
    <P>This may seem to be a rather practical and mundane point but it is important just the same: if you look at the geographical area covered by the CSCE stretching, as the Taoiseach stated much more poetically than I, from the shores of the Pacific in Vancouver on the one side right across to the shores of the North Pacific of Vladivostok and try to find the centre, that place is Ireland.  There are proposals to establish offices, in Prague, Vienna and Warsaw.  I am surprised there has not been a suggestion that this body might establish some offices in this country.  It may be too late to raise this matter, but there will be other meetings and I hope some thought will be given to inviting one of the CSCE institutions to establish its headquarters in Ireland, a country which has much to teach other European countries with regard to the establishment of legal structures for the resolution of conflicts that may exist.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Charter of Paris does not contain any specific reference urging member states to accede to the UN and Council of Europe conventions on matters such as human rights, the rights of the child, the transfer of sentenced persons and conventions against torture.  The great advantage of accession to these conventions is that the legal means exist for citizens who feel oppressed by their own State to take their State to the European Court and have their rights vindicated.  There is no similar process within the CSCE.  It contains a number of very good declarations about what should be the case, but contains no mechanism whereby an individual who is not obtaining the rights contained in the Preamble stated here, can go to court and get his Government to grant him those rights.  Such an enforcement mechanism should exist under the CSCE or through a declaration that CSCE membership would be conditional on the accession of States to conventions under <Col N="479" /> the aegis of bodies such as the UN or the Council of Europe.  Otherwise how will we be able to guarantee no one will be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention, that there will be freedom of thought, conscience, religion and belief, and that there will be a right to own property either individually or in association, and exercise individual enterprise?</P>
    <P>These rights and others that were declared in Paris are simply words on paper and no more unless a means exists for the individual to vindicate those rights before some international body and have their Government put in the dock if they fail to vindicate them.  I am disappointed that, to date, the CSCE has not taken any position in regard to requiring, as a condition of membership, the accession of states to well established conventions which protect those rights in practice.  I hope that in the Taoiseach's future work on this subject he and the Government will take up this very practical point about how one can translate words on paper which read very well into reality on the ground enjoyed by the citizens of Europe.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to respond to the Taoiseach's statement on the summit meeting in Paris of the Conference on Security and Co-operation. I welcome the general tenor of the speech made by the Taoiseach at the summit meeting, particularly its emphasis on peace and on the strategy of peace as opposed to the military strategies in relation to the present conflicts we face.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to the two speeches, I was considering the context in which the Paris meeting took place.  The immediate context in which it took place was one of a threat in the Gulf region.  It was very interesting that the interviews conducted in the general ambience of the Paris meetings were ones that continually asked some of the major participants where they stood in relation to the two options &mdash; the one of peace and the other of military resolution in relation to the present conflict in the Gulf which led to President Gorbachev stating that a peace <Col N="480" /> conference was hardly the place to give an answer to questions about troop deployment or his attitude to a military strategy which would be facilitated by a UN Security Council resolution.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that it was clearly in the public mind, internationally, that Ireland stood unequivocally in favour of peace.  At that meeting two views were canvassed.  Both Mr. Baker and President Bush expressed impatience in their interviews with the strategy of sanctions, diplomacy and negotiations.  At the same time it was very clear that the process being conducted by President Mitterrand, through Claude Cheysson, and President Gorbachev, through Mr. Primakov, was one of desperately seeking for an extension of the space of peace.  In that choice, our clear moral duty as a non-military and neutral member of the European Community was enhanced by making a statement in favour of the option of peace.</P>
    <P>In a few moments I will turn to the rather tedious discussion on whether or not we should be embarrassed by the fact that we are neutral or have not yet found an enemy.  I find it rather curious that the response to the major meeting, which celebrated the most momentous events between Eastern and Western Europe and effectively declared the Cold War over, was that people should wonder why a country which is neutral was lesser equipped, because it is not militarily engaged or has not yet found an enemy. It was argued that it would be part of the proper equipment of an integrated Europe in any political sense that it would have to have an enemy.  I find that kind of thinking curiously negative, arid, hopeless in philosophical terms, and very old fashioned as much as I do the old views on deterrent theory in international relations and international foreign policy. It argued that it was only through the possession of the capacity to kill, maim and wound that one was safe from killing, maiming and wounding.  The departed Prime Minister of Britain was known to go in for such flourishes of speech.  It is distressing to find the new leader of the <Col N="481" /> largest party in Opposition following that bankrupt vein of thinking.</P>
    <P>The truth is that there are other opportunities for those who are both generous and positive.  Peace, to which the Paris Charter refers, can be positively expressed.  That peace will in turn engage other elements of international relations. If there is an immediate element in that context it is the Gulf crisis but, perhaps, the most important one is the fact that the bi-polar structure of geopolitics is over.  The events in Eastern Europe have shown that the Soviet Union, for example, has entirely changed the character of its participation in international affairs.  All thinking people in foreign policy must ask themselves how that vacuum in what has been accepted as the traditional version of geopolitics will be filled.</P>
    <P>A number of options are open.  One which looked very promising in the last decade was the emergence of a series of regional initiatives to bring peace to different parts of the world.  Certainly, the General-Secretaryship of Perez de Cueller seemed to promise the delivery of this option in Namibia, Southern Africa, Central America, parts of North Africa and the Middle East.  This led to conferences taking place in these regions at which the possibility emerged of the vacuum about which I spoke, and the changed character of bi-polar politics which had disappeared, being filled by a new, elaborate and growing set of regional strategies aimed at the resolution of regional difficulties.</P>
    <P>The regional initiatives are not as promising as they were a couple of years ago but another dimension of that vacuum is that the remaining super power will change its role.  Certainly, that would give grounds for concern.  One would hope that, given the general international atmosphere of a reduction in nuclear weapons, and a considerable extension beyond non-proliferation agreements and on towards a complete extinction of the testing of nuclear weapons as proposed by the Soviet union, this would bring a similar response.</P>
    <P>It therefore behoves all of us to try to <Col N="482" /> think in positive terms as to how we might build in a practical way the possibility for this space of peace.  Practical problems arise and there is no point in dodging them.  We are speaking in an atmosphere where, if the regional initiatives have declined in terms of their possibilities, there has been little less than an abandonment in international policy of the quest for a new international economic order.  As one reflects on the Paris Summit, where the very fine rhetoric of President Mitterrand which I admire, and his impulse which I respect, was once delivered at the same time as the feeling of Willy Brandt and the Brandt report, it is perfectly clear that the basis for a new geopolitical order to succeed the bi-polar version of conflict in international relations, will require the negotiation of a new international economic order.</P>
    <P>This will raise questions which impinge on the definition of security because no one who is serious about the meaning of security in international relations can think of security without addressing the issue of its definition.  For many in the so-called developing world the issue of security is seen very differently from the way it would be defined in the First World.  We are talking about countries which, unfortunately, have been used as a dumping ground and constructed as a market place for armaments produced in countries, the heads of which are signatories to the Charter of Paris.  The security about which many of the leaders of these countries would speak is a security which would ensure their own sovereignty and, most important, the existence of their people, the prevention of famine and hunger and a security which would enable them develop their own structures.</P>
    <P>In the language used at the Paris Conference, and occasionally in the Taoiseach's speech, there was a rather dangerous suggestion that human rights and a market oriented system go together.  I am at pains not to misconstrue the speech and the suggestion is not there directly but, unfortunately, at several different parts of his speech words like <Col N="483" />&ldquo;respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the market oriented economic system&rdquo; appear much too regularly together.  The market oriented system has in many parts of the world, with which I am too familiar, neither assisted human rights nor fundamental freedoms.  Under this system weapons and instruments of death have been sold to the Third World; to those who have been responsible for the most appalling breaches of human rights.  It has also been used as a mechanism to sustain the greatest travesties of the fundamental freedoms of different peoples. It is an appalling distortion of language, politics and philosophy to suggest that the market oriented economic system, as a philosophy, has been anything other than the motive of greed, aggression, destruction, war and anti-life.  That is very different from saying that the market system can be an instrument for the achievement of different ethical purposes. To elevate the mechanism from the level of the instrumental to a philosophy and to link it with human rights and fundamental freedoms is an insult to the intelligence.</P>
    <P>There are other realities with which I think we should deal following this speech.  When we have stripped away the huff and puff we might deal with reality as we have been invited by the previous speaker.  I could not make my mind up whether the speech that preceded mine was in favour of there being CSCE institutions.  Taking this issue, it was asked why we need conflict resolutions when we have the United Nations Security Council.  Let us be very clear about this.  The United Nations Security Council has, as two of its five permanent members, Britain and France.  When scholars studied the behaviour of the members of the European Community and the UN General Assembly they noticed something very interesting: Britain and France, for example, resent issues being discussed which are Security Council items.  They see themselves, and describe themselves, as players on a world stage of politics.  Let me locate this in the atmosphere of the Paris Conference <Col N="484" /> we have just had.</P>
    <P>As somebody who was involved in an initiative in the Middle East, I was being continually reminded of our UN obligations and European political co-operation. Britain was bound by the same obligations, so was France.  France being perfectly consistent with its view that European political co-operation is an important but one dimension of its foreign policy, was busy constructing an option for peace through Claude Cheysson and Mr. Primakov under Gorbachev. The voice from Britain at the time was the surrogate voice of Mr. Bush who was busy throwing around the guff of war.</P>
    <P>In relation to a responsible foreign policy in Ireland there is nothing to place the slightest inhibition on Ireland accepting its UN obligations, its European political co-operation obligations and, at the same time, being free to speak as a non-NATO neutral in a positive way in building and assisting the space of peace. I repeat, lest it be lost: there is not one whit of an obstacle stopping us from doing this.  The only thing stopping us is not only a conservative ethos by those responsible for these speeches but a conservative approach towards reading the issues of the day, an absence of originality and of commitment towards being positive about our foreign policy.</P>
    <P>I welcome the range of institutions suggested in the Taoiseach's speech arising from the Paris Summit &mdash; there will be meetings of the Heads of State and Foreign Ministers every year and additional meetings of representatives of the CSCE, CSCE Secretariat, an Office of Free Elections and a Conflict Prevention Centre. Good luck to them all, but the one thing we have not got in this House is a foreign Affairs Committee.  The only people who are not qualified to discuss these issues are the elected representatives of the people.  It is marvellous to know &mdash; and I have every confidence in the people we will send to the secretariat&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;they will be as good as the people we send to other secretarists. They have that qualification, unique in Ireland, that they are not elected which makes them superior, more informed, makes them expert and makes them trustworthy.  We, unfortunately, are elected and, therefore, we are disqualified.  We are people not even for motions; we are people for whom statements will do.  We have had the Taoiseach's statement and the spokespersons' statements; we are told to make the best of our half hour, Question Time is coming, make the best of it because that is all you are getting.  I view with hilarity the statement in the Taoiseach's contribution:</P>
      <P>The Paris Summit has called for greater parliamentary involvement in the CSCE process, in particular through the creation of a CSCE parliamentary assembly, involving members of parliaments from all participating States.  This is a development which we fully support.</P>
      <P>If we can discuss it abroad, as is welcomed here, would it not be nice to discuss it at home?  I find this intriguing. I do not want to go over old ground because my position on this is very clear, but in November 1986 I made the proposal for the first time and it was defeated.</P>
      <P>I want to come back to the main text of the Taoiseach's speech which I broadly welcome, although I find this part of it less than convincing.  In his statement we have this curious, extraordinary development in international affairs and foreign policy something with which the journals in these areas have not yet come to terms. The Taoiseach said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to economic co-operation, the Charter underlines the need to build further on the results of the Bonn Conference held earlier this year, with its emphasis on democratic institutions and economic liberty as the basis for social and economic progress. It stresses that economic co-operation, based on market systems, constitutes <Col N="486" /> an essential element for the construction of a prosperous and united Europe.</P>
    <P>I would like to know where these ideas are coming from?  Are they from the policy institute in London, the old resting house of the Tory hacks that throws out all this right-wing rubbish regularly, some of which permeates here &mdash; those who got an education in economics occasionally can be found reading it in the Library?  Can the notion of democratic institutions being dependent on market systems be justified anywhere historically? Democracy in most enlightened systems has gone on to speak about democracy in the workplace, rights of workers, basic conditions, the rights of women and accountability, all matters rejected by the spokespersons of the so-called market oriented Europe.</P>
    <P>I am chairman of the social affairs subcommittee of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.  I have listened to people who say that social Europe must wait until the benefits of the integrated market are available.  They do not want to hear about minimum wages nor do they want to hear about a typical work or translated from Eurospeak part-time workers until the benefits have begun to flow.  They said the same in Europe.  This is the Europe gathering apace without its social dimension or, more accurately, with word broken on its European social dimension for which Deputy Bruton wants an army.  We are likely, in his thinking, to get a European army before we get a basic minimum wage or protection for workers.  Why is he not speaking about that?  It is just playing soldiers again.</P>
    <P>There are fundamentals we have to deal with in relation to our thinking on this, but Deputy Bruton raised a very important point and I am afraid the Taoiseach's speech failed to address it, that is, that it is necessary to express the basis of one's preference for the mechanism of the CSCE over the Council of Europe.</P>
    <P>The Council of Europe is a very interesting body.  The states which joined in its <Col N="487" /> formation believed, as they stated in their statement at its foundation, that &ldquo;the pursuit of peace based upon justice and international co-operation is vital for the preservation of human society and civilisation.&rdquo; They also stated their devotion to the spiritual and moral values which are the common heritage of their peoples and the true source of individual freedom, political liberty and the rule of law principles which form the basis of all genuine democracies.  In Article 1 (d) of the Statute of the Council of Europe they provided that &ldquo;matters relating to national defence do not fall within the scope of the Council of Europe.&rdquo;  Therefore, one must pose the question: is the unattractiveness of the Council of Europe based on its specific rejection of matters of defence and military matters and is the choice of the CSCE its amenability towards military and defence matters?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's statement that some people who were at the Paris Summit were in favour of NATO being the major defence of Europe is, to put it mildly, rather coy.  This would be bad news for Deputy Bruton who has said that CSCE is not on as a mechanism.  This leaves him with NATO.  I sit here waiting for these announcements to be made every week &mdash; neutrality is old-fashioned, it is gone and his party do not believe in it any longer.  The next step is, I suppose, to join NATO.  Let us hear about those issues because, I have said, we all welcome debate.  We are now living in a time of great openness, and people who have had thoughts for the past 20 years can now feel free to express them.  I welcome this development but I do not thank the marketplace for it.</P>
    <P>I believe we could, unless we are very careful in terms of being positive about our foreign policy, find ourselves in the short term rather than the long term facing a horrific possibility.  Let me give an example.  It is possible that before we meet next week there will be a war in the Middle East region.  I want to state this afternoon in response to what has been <Col N="488" /> said here that any one who talks in a military way now about a conflict which would be confined, let us say, to a resolution of the Iran-Iraq war knows very little about the realities of that region. Such a conflict would quickly engulf the entire region and it would be neither quick, sharp nor short but would lead to a long conflict.  Even if those who want the military conflict were to achieve all their aims it would lead to a confrontation between forces in that region, a more militant fundamentalism and a conflict between the West and Islam.</P>
    <P>If people, through ignorance and the misreading of foreign policy, want to replace the cold war which the Paris Summit officially ended with a new enemy and a new confrontation, I must seriously warn them against going down the road of using dangerous language which will set up a conflict between the West and Islam.  Such a conflict would not end for decades and it would not be fought out in the air or in any conventional way; I believe it would very quickly embrace all aspects of international terrorism.  I believe the people who are showing impatience with the path of peace should think again about what they would be unleashing on the world.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Bruton that it is necessary to get beyond rhetoric and to take positive steps.  I cannot but view with a little disdain the fact that many of those who signed the Paris Charter are the very people who were exporting the means of death into the conflict region about which they are now expressing concern.  The chemical weapons which were built and the mustard gas supplied by West Germany were used against thousands of Kurds.  Who complained?  And the gas has continued to flow.  This sudden recognition by the countries from the West, who supplied tanks and armaments, of the danger that different forms of leadership created in the Gulf region is not convincing.</P>
    <P>I want to come back to the point with which I began my speech in many ways. There is a great moral bankruptcy in a view that sees foreign policy as some kind <Col N="489" /> of outcrop or facilitation of economic realities.  If there is a war which is motivated by energy costs and the politics of oil, are we to construct foreign policy around that?  What was wrong with a foreign policy which spoke about the intangible of peace?  It is sad that every line and paragraph of this speech is written on the assumption that the old social solidarities were all wrong.  There are bits of trendy language used in the speech which rather remind me of that new non-speak corporate waffle, an alternative to language, which exists these days and in which people speak about &ldquo;throwing out ideas,&rdquo;&ldquo;running with them&rdquo;, &ldquo;putting them in the works&rdquo; and &ldquo;coming on line&rdquo;. There is an equivalent foreign office kind of speech in which there is reference to &ldquo;market-based&rdquo;, and &ldquo;the market economy&rdquo; in an imprecise way.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle.  Here is the evidence of what I was saying.  The Minister stated: &ldquo;We see the individual as central to the whole CSCE process&rdquo;.  Does the usage mean personal rights within an atmosphere of social rights, with social solidarities respected, or does the word &ldquo;individual&rdquo; mean a theory of individualism which regards social responsibility as some kind of casual result of a series of individual actions?  Where do the theories of individualism bring us in analysing international relations?  Have they not been the core philosophical principle at the base of every conflict and every war, every act of aggression, every build-up of armaments and every attack on the concept of development?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time that we in this country watched our language when we make general speeches on peace.  We in the Labour Party are in favour of peace and neutrality, of its positive usage, and in favour of the deflection of resources <Col N="490" /> from tasks of armament to tasks of development.  We have positively used this both inside this country and outside it by making the case for peace and being in favour of peace studies being on the curriculum of our schools.  We do not find anything old-fashioned about that and we do not regard ourselves as dinosaurs.  We see ourselves as humane people speaking about peace at a time when the world desperately needs voices in favour of peace rather than loose language about war with its catastrophic consequences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">

      <P>There is no doubt that the summit of the 34 nation Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe held in Paris last week was an occasion of unique importance and could mark an historic turning point in the history of Europe.</P>
      <P>While the conference received relatively generous media coverage, I believe that the importance of the conference has not yet been fully appreciated by most members of the public, and I would hope that the Taoiseach's Department would now consider appropriate means to promote greater knowledge and understanding of the CSCE process in this country.  I welcome his commitment today to publish the Paris Charter signed last week.  Publication is not sufficent. We need some commitment by the Taoiseach's Department to ensure that it is distributed and disseminated and that the ideas in it are examined and discussed. The Department of Education should also consider in what way school children can be made aware of this historic development taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the fine principles contained in the Charter of Paris, there were also a number of specific decisions made, such as the commitment to establish a Conflict Prevention Centre in Vienna, which can contribute to peace and stability throughout Europe.  The treaty signed during the conference by NATO and Warsaw Pact leaders, which could lead to up to 100,000 pieces of military hardware, including tanks, armoured cars, helicopters, jet fighters and artillery being destroyed, will be welcomed by <Col N="491" /> all those who want to see peace on this continent.</P>
    <P>The statement by the 22 members of these military pacts that &ldquo;they are no longer adversaries&rdquo; could accurately be described as the final nail in the coffin of the cold war in Europe.  The aim must now be to build on the progress made in Paris and secure the total scrapping of obsolete and outdated military organisations such as NATO and the Warsaw Pact.  This should be a central objective of Irish foreign policy over the next decade.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party have argued for many years that the interests of peace, security and stability in Europe can best be served by the strengthening and development of the CSCE.  A start was made in Paris.  I welcome the establishment of a permanent secretariat to assist the implementation of the Helsinki Charter and to organise follow up conferences. A foundation has been laid which can be built upon.  It would be foolish, however, to ignore the many problems which remain to be tackled in regard to the role, structure and organisation of CSCE and about the role of Ireland and our neutrality in that body.</P>
    <P>In this context the Taoiseach's speech to the conference was as disappointing, as it was vague and lacking in specifics.  The only concrete suggestion the Taoiseach had to make was that the disarmament talks should be broadened to take in not just the 22 countries of NATO and the Warsaw Pact but the full 34 member states of the CSCE.  It is heartening that agreement has been reached to try to achieve that position by 1992.</P>
    <P>Although the Taoiseach has, in the past, spoken about the CSCE providing &ldquo;a framework for peace, security and co-operation throughout Europe&rdquo;, he has also talked about the EC and its member states playing a leading role in all proceedings and discussions to establish new structures or agreements based on the principles of the Helsinki Final Act &rdquo;while maintaining existing security arrangements which members have&rdquo;. This seems to imply acceptance of the <Col N="492" /> inevitability of the continued existence of NATO and the Warsaw Pact.</P>
    <P>In his speech today, however, the Taoiseach indicated that he has shifted his ground somewhat on that point.  He said that whatever about NATO, it is clear that the Warsaw Pact is coming to an end.  Why not indicate that he would also like to see NATO come to an end?  Why the reticence on this issue?  Why the reticence by the Taoiseach on the European Community's development of a security position and the fact that the negotiations which will take place in December at the inter-governmental conference will tackle this issue?  The Taoiseach is still maintaining a very vague position on that issue.  He stated:</P>
    <P>New thinking is called for to enable us to draw the maximum benefit from the progress already achieved, and from the advent of a peaceful, secure European order.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>This examination must now have special regard to the new Pan-European framework within which the security and stability of all countries in Europe will in future be ensured.</P>
    <P>He did not say anything about the Irish position on this new security framework. He does not indicate what Ireland's attitude is to the fact that there is no doubt members of the Community will raise the question of defence.  It is not good enough to say, as he does in his speech, that the question of defence is a long way down the road because members of NATO will be anxious to retain that body as the primary defence mechanism in Europe.  Simply to say that this matter is not one which needs to be addressed now because we do not have to make a choice about it now is not good enough.  We should be establishing the parameters of our attitude to security in Europe.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a conflict in the Taoiseach's position.  On the one hand he welcomes the development of the CSCE as a security framework but then goes on to talk about the European Community developing its own security system.  To <Col N="493" /> say the least of it, he is coy about the defence commitments which may be involved in that development.</P>
    <P>Although we can draw some comfort from the fact that those leaders who most vigorously promoted the cold war, such as Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, have now moved off centre stage, there are many vested interests who wish to see the continuation of military spending at their current obscene levels.  Thousands of billions of pounds are invested in industries manufacturing military equipment and nuclear weapons.  The profits of war are far greater than the profits of peace.  Those who have made such a financial killing out of making weapons to kill have no interest in diverting their investments to tackle the social problems of Europe or the even greater problems of hunger and deprivation facing the developing countries.  Presumably to interfere with the arms industry or to insist on their diverting their investment to more peaceful pursuits would be seen as interfering with the free market system which seems to be beloved by our Taoiseach, Deputy Charles J. Haughey, and many others.</P>
    <P>It is significant that in her last international speech, made to the CSCE conference in Paris only days before she was forced out of office, Mrs. Thatcher launched a vigorous defence of NATO and insisted that the alliance remain the core of western defence.  She stated that &ldquo;Security comes from knowing that you have a strong defence, including nuclear weapons, which have played such an important part in keeping the peace in Europe.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In a strange way what Deputy Bruton had to say today about security and defence echoes the words of Mrs. Thatcher. He made the point that one cannot have security without addressing the question of defence, that one cannot establish a European Community and not take on the question of defending it. What Deputy Bruton did not tell us is what enemy he imagines we will have to defend the European Community against.  Against whom are we to use the military hardware which presumably he <Col N="494" /> feels we should acquire to defend the European Community?  Unless we address the question of enemies, the question of defence must be seen in a completely different context.</P>
    <P>Against the background of such militaristic sentiments Irish neutrality remains relevant.  Certainly there is a need to define what our neutrality is about, to take account of the changing conditions in Europe, but we should unequivocally reject the urgings of those, such as the new Fine Gael leader, Deputy John Bruton, who now claim that Irish neutrality is irrelevant.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party see the potential of our neutrality not as a negative or restrictive factor but as a positive and constructive national policy, which enabled us &mdash; free from the prejudices of military blocs &mdash; to adopt independent foreign policy positions, particularly to be a force for peace and against war. Irish neutrality should be used to promote disarmament and oppose military pacts and alliances.  It should be supportive of dialogue between all countries and against confrontation.  It should recognise the right of all states to defend themselves, while opposing aggression by any country against another.  It should seek out areas of common interest and promote joint ventures with other neutral and non-aligned countries.  Indeed in this context it is most disappointing that Ireland plays no part in the neutral and non-aligned group within the CSCE.  On that issue might I draw the attention of the House to the fact that, in the Charter of Paris signed last week by the Taoiseach, representing the people of this country, the section therein relating to this question of security and peace reads:</P>
    <P>Being aware that an essential complement to the duty of States to refrain from the threat or use of force is the peaceful settlement of disputes, both being essential factors for the maintenance and consolidation of international peace and security, we will not only seek effective ways of preventing, through political means, conflicts which may yet emerge, but also define, <Col N="495" /> in conformity with international law, appropriate mechanisms for the peaceful resolution of any disputes which may arise.</P>
    <P>That is a far more positive declaration with regard to how this country should address the question of security, whether it be within the narrow confines of the EC, the broader Pan-European security system or broader still, within the security system that may emerge under the auspices of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>For too long Governments here have viewed neutrality as an excuse for opting out, for not taking positions.  The world is changing.  Circumstances in Europe are changing.  Irish neutrality must change. If we do not adapt Irish neutrality, it will wither and die of irrelevance.  The vast majority of Irish people support neutrality and want it to continue; all of the opinion polls have confirmed this.  The best way to achieve this it to make it more positive and assertive.</P>
    <P>Although it was not formally on the agenda, the other major issue to dominate the Paris Conference was the current crisis in the Gulf, arising from the illegal and unacceptable Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.  Clearly, there are many behind-the-scenes discussions among national leaders.  Unfortunately, there now seems to be a dangerous momentum for war in the Gulf.  There appears to be a willingness once again on the part of some world leaders, such as President Bush, to fight to the last drop of other people's blood in order to achieve US objectives.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party condemned the Iraqi invasion on the day it took place but have said all along that military action could be considered only when all other options had been exhausted.  I do not believe that all the options have been exhausted.  I believe that war in the Gulf at this point is unnecessary and will lead to the deaths of tens, if not hundreds of thousands of people &mdash; both combatants and non-combatants.  It should be noted that among the victims of any war will be those held hostage in Iraq and Kuwait, including several hundred Irish people. <Col N="496" /> There is no guarantee that any war would be a short one.  Conflict could drag on for many years.</P>
    <P>The invasion took place less than four months ago.  Sanctions have not yet been given the opportunity to bite fully.  The net can be tightened.  Sanctions can be intensified.  According to today's <i>The Irish Times,</i> a former CIA director, Mr. James Schlesinger, described as a &ldquo;hawk of the sixties and seventies&rdquo;, told the US Senate Armed Services Committee yesterday that economic sanctions should be given at least 18 months to work.  I believe that the preference of the vast majority of the people throughout the world would be to see Kuwait freed in 18 months by peaceful means, rather than in 18 weeks by a bloody war with the deaths of many thousands of people.</P>
    <P>Again I might draw the attention of the House to the quotation I read from the Charter of Paris which obviously emphasised the need to seek peaceful means to bring about a solution to the conflict.  That is not what is being sought by the United States at this time at the United Nations.</P>
    <P>I welcome the suggestion made by the Taoiseach in Paris last week that sanctions should be given time to be effective. I would now urge him, on behalf of the Government and the Oireachtas, to make a clear, unequivocal and detailed statement to this effect.  The UN Security Council will apparently be asked today or tomorrow to pass a resolution authorising states with forces in the Gulf to use &ldquo;all necessary means&rdquo; to eject Iraq from Kuwait.  Ireland should oppose this resolution as being premature.  We should make it clear that if, at some point in the future, military action has to be taken against Iraq, it should be done only on the basis of a mandate from the General Assembly of the United Nations under the direct control of the United Nations, not by the US-dominated international force now in the Gulf and that it cannot be allowed to happen that war would be launched in the Gulf on the basis of a resolution agreed within the Security Council which may receive the support <Col N="497" /> of nine members only of the total membership of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>Our Government must give a commitment that, if a motion sanctioning force is approved by the United Nations Security Council, a decision of the Dáil will be necessary before this country can act in support of it.</P>
    <P>Article 28.3.1º of our Constitution states and I quote:</P>
    <P>War shall not be declared and the State shall not participate in any war save with the assent of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>We are now faced with the prospect of a United Nations Security Council resolution which could commit this country to at least supporting a war in the Gulf. Our Government must reserve their position on this until the Dáil has been consulted and must be bound by the decision of the Dáil in this matter.</P>
    <P>In the meantime we must continue to press for a peaceful solution to the Gulf crisis.  At a time when there is so much hope, when progress has been made towards peace in so many other areas, the prospect of a war would be a tragedy not only for the people of the Gulf but for the people of the entire world.</P>
    <P>In relation to a number of points Deputy John Bruton made in the course of his contribution, I have to say that I welcome his commitment that he will support the amendment of Articles 2 and 3 of the Irish Constitution.  The Workers' Party hope shortly to afford the House on opportunity to debate this question.  I look forward to Deputy Bruton's support for our initiative in that regard.  I agree with him that a threat to peace in Europe is now much more likely to come from regional disputes, from inter-ethnic disputes, rather than on the old basis feared, that is between East and West.  Indeed, the CSCE is a very appropriate forum at which such conflicts could be addressed. There is a need to strengthen the role and structures of the CSCE to enable that conference assist in the resolution of such conflicts.</P>
    <P>I would question the point Deputy John Bruton made about the issue of <Col N="498" /> education, when he argued that ethnic groups should be enabled not only to provide their own education but to seek subscriptions to assist them in so doing. I am sure there is a case to be made in certain circumstances for such a provision, but we cannot fail to have regard to the experience of Northern Ireland in this respect.  We have there two systems of education, one a State system which in theory is available to all citizens of Northern Ireland, and the other a system of Catholic education which is provided by the institutions of the Roman Catholic Church on the basis of subscriptions from the people who subscribe to that Church.</P>
    <P>The State also supports that system to some extent, nevertheless we have such a situation because the Roman Catholic people of Northern Ireland opted out of the State system.  We have a system of sectarian education in Northern Ireland which in no small way has contributed to the conflict that exists there today.  I can recall an interview being given by a leading member of the Provisional IRA in which he stated quite clearly that if it was not for the existence of Catholic schools in Northern Ireland the IRA would not exist as far as he was concerned.  He said that the impetus for the maintenance of a separate identity, a separate understanding about what Northern Ireland was as a society, what rights they were entitled to and to whom they should offer allegiance, was maintained and developed by a separate education system.</P>
    <P>I am not arguing for a situation where the ethos of the Roman Catholic Church would not have a place in an education system.  Clearly people who are Roman Catholics have a right to expect that the religious beliefs they hold should in some way be conveyed to their children, nevertheless too simplistic an attitude is taken and conflict can arise from having separate education systems for people who see themselves differently from the rest of the population.  I, and my party, have argued for many years that part of the solution for Northern Ireland is integrated education.  We have made it quite clear on a number of occasions that we <Col N="499" /> believe it to be a scandal that the only area of third-level education which is divided on religious grounds is teacher training, where there is Catholic teacher training and Protestant teacher training. All other areas of third-level education are integrated.</P>
    <P>It is a disgrace that children in a community are separated at the age of three or four when they head off to school, not on the basis of their learning ability or where they live but on the basis of the religion of their parents.  Until we address that matter and exert pressure on the institutions of State and Church to do so realistically there will be a fundamental reason for the continuation of the conflict that exists in Northern Ireland.  On that point I differ from Deputy Bruton who has indicated a willingness to address the issue of Northern Ireland in relation to Articles 2 and 3 but he has not yet fully taken on board the reality of sectarian education in Northern Ireland and its role in the maintenance of the division there.</P>
    <P>There is one point I want to address &mdash; Deputy Michael D. Higgins addressed it to some degree &mdash; and that is the constant reference in the Taoiseach's speech to this question of the free market and the free enterprise society.  I have not seen a copy of the Charter signed in Paris but read extracts which were printed in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 22 November 1990. Nowhere in those excerpts does the Charter relate to the free market or the free enterprise society.  It talks about transition to market economy, not to &ldquo;the&rdquo; market economy referred to by the Taoiseach. It refers to the establishment of market economy and the creation of the basis for self-sustained economic and social growth.  Again, it does not refer to free market economy or free enterprise economy.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach knows, as I know, that the addition of the word &ldquo;free&rdquo; has a quite specific meaning, and it is not correct for the Taoiseach to stand up in this House and effectively mislead the House with regard to what the Charter of Paris relates.  No one in this House and, I suspect, no one or very few outside the <Col N="500" /> House would deny the importance of a market mechanism for the distribution of goods and so forth, but to attempt to indicate, as Deputy Michael D. Higgins has pointed out, that in some way there is a direct connection between a so-called free market economy or a free enterprise society and democracy and human and civil rights is a direct misleading and misreading of the Charter of Paris.  There are more instances of states on the face of this earth which pursue a free market economy under dictatorships with no rights whatsoever for the citizens of those states than there are of states which do not pursue a free market economy.  I suggest to the Taoiseach that, if he wants a debate on the difference between a free market economy and the idea of a socialist or socialised economy, then we will be happy to have that debate in this House, but it is not good enough for him to attempt to confuse the issue and confuse what is being agreed by the 34 members of the CSCE.</P>
    <P>I thank the Chair for his patience in allowing me a few extra minutes to conclude my remarks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to begin on a non-contentious note on this side of the House by saying I agree entirely with Deputy Michael D. Higgins when he deplored the fact that, on an issue of this importance, we have a series of statements in the House.  We do not have a debate, no reactions from the Government, no assessment of the issues that have been raised by the Taoiseach and by three other speakers but we simply have a series of statements.  It is all the more annoying because the Taoiseach in this House only a few weeks ago seemed to be taking credit for the fact that this House debates foreign affairs issues, he thinks, very frequently.  There is not much point in having a series of statements in this House if they lead to no conclusion, no meeting of minds here and no concrete action on behalf of the House by the Government.  I deplore the fact that we are having simply statements and on that issue I agree with Deputy Michael D. Higgins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="501" /> There is another issue on which I agree with him in that connection, that is when he deplores the fact that we do not have a foreign affairs committee.  I will not go on at any length about this because that ground has been travelled before but it is an issue that will be taken up again and again.  I hope before too long we will put ourselves in the same boat as parliaments in the rest of the EC and have a foreign affairs committee where these issues can be debated.  I wanted to make the point for the record that we could have had a foreign affairs committee here some time between 1982 and 1987 if Deputy Michael D. Higgins, and his colleagues in the Labour Party, did not make the absurd attempt they made to enshrine a principle in foreign policy, that is their notions of neutrality, in the terms of reference of a committee of the House.  That was not acceptable then.  It would not be acceptable now.  I am glad to see that the Labour Party have at last come to that view.  I hope now we will be able to get on with the real business of setting up a foreign affairs committee in this House with proper terms of reference so that these debates can have more point than today's debate will have.</P>
    <P>The Paris Summit of CSCE was undoubtedly a success and represented a very substantial further step towards peace.  A number of important decisions were made that were designed to maintain the momentum generated up to now. My colleague, Deputy John Bruton, has rightly insisted this afternoon on the need to ensure that these decisions are given effect in structures and in fora that have executive powers to take real action. These decisions, the annual meetings of Foreign Ministers, the institution of a secretariat in Prague, follow-up meetings every two years, the conflict prevention centre in Vienna, the office for free elections in Warsaw and, indeed, the idea of a parliamentary assembly, if they are to mean anything, must be followed up vigorously in institutions and in bodies that can actually take decisons and make things happen.</P>
    <P>With 34 participating states and with the firm political will that has been shown <Col N="502" /> so far, the CSCE clearly provides an irreplaceable framework for progress towards peace, freedom, human liberties and democracy.  There is a great deal more to be done.  There has been some reference in this House this afternoon to one specific area that was addressed by the Paris Summit, the problem of ethnic minorities.  I think that is putting it in a wrong context to talk about the problem of ethnic minorities as if these were somehow small groups of people in remote corners of Europe who have problems. It is much more a problem than that. There is a real problem of ethnic mixtures and indeed of ethnic collisions in Europe. That will have to be dealt with and the sooner the better.</P>
    <P>I have had a number of meetings and discussions with Christian Democratic collegues, Slovanians, Croats and Hungarians, all of them living in areas where these ethnic tensions are very difficult to deal with.  We have the problems of Hungarian minorities in countries bordering on Hungary and in each case &mdash; and it is the one common thread that runs through them all &mdash; what we see is a people who feel themselves to be a distinct people and who want, first, to have their separateness recognised so that they can then feel free, so they can then feel self-confident, to move forward and to work out a way of living politically, socially and culturally with their neighbours. If our experience counts for anything, if we could get even as far as the situation of the talks now going on in Northern Ireland, if we could help those ethnic groups to get that far without the kind of bloodshed we have seen in Northern Ireland, and without the kind of bloodshed that now seems to be threatening in some of those areas of Europe, then indeed we would have made a very substantial contribution to establishing peace in Europe and to bringing about a step towards the notion of the common European home that has become so much a part of the currency of international debate in the last year.</P>
    <P>The CSCE, however, cannot be the only forum in which we participate in that work.  It is not the only tool available to <Col N="503" /> us &mdash; I will come back to that in a moment.  That work demands very careful consideration, among other things, of security requirements and, let us not avoid the issue, it requires a totally new evaluation of defence needs and of doctrines on defence policy.  We face a totally new situation.  We have gone from the situation rightly characterised by Deputy Michael D. Higgins as bi-polarity to a situation where we can see in front of us the prospect of Soviet troops being gone from East Germany, from Poland and from Hungary, and I know that everyone in this House hopes to see the day when Soviet troops will have gone from Latvia and Estonia, from the Baltic States. Indeed, we are seeing some of the immediate consequences of that just now.</P>
    <P>I was reading just the other day that the integration of East German forces into the armed forces of a united Germany is causing major problems because people have not yet worked out who actually owns the tanks, who actually owns the missiles.  We must hope, of course, that the great majority of them will be destroyed following on the treaty signed recently, that we can see the day when everything we thought of, all the old habits of thought, all the old customs of international relations that were fixed and directed by this bi-polarity, will have gone, will have changed utterly.  It is clear that we will need to look again at what that means in terms of the European Community's own security and defence interests.</P>
    <P>I was very sad to hear Deputy Michael D. Higgins and Deputy De Rossa coming out with the newest bogeyman which Deputy Michael D. Higgins invented just the other day on the radio. He asked &ldquo;where is the enemy?&rdquo;.  He accuses Deputy Bruton and others, myself included I suppose, of looking for a new enemy.  That, Sir, is absolute nonsense and it is made all the more nonsensical when we listen to Deputies Michael D. Higgins, Michael Bell, De Rossa and McCartan expressing their concern about our Permanent Defence <Col N="504" /> Forces.  They seem to be utterly convinced that we need a permanent defence force.  I agree with them.  They seem to be utterly convinced that we need to ensure that our Permanent Defence Forces are manned by people who are properly treated.  I totally agree with them.  Might I ask them where they think the enemy is against whom this defence force is needed to protect us?  If they are convinced of the need for a defence force, against whom is it going to defend us?  Their answer will be neat and glib and they will accept the single, central, fundamental doctrine of sovereignty, that the maintenance of an independent way of running our own society which says that in order to make that credible one has to show other people that one is prepared to defend it, even if there is nobody immediately around who seems to be threatening it.</P>
    <P>I regret the fact that Deputy Michael D. Higgins tried to suggest that anybody in this House is suggesting that the new enemy is Islam.  That is an outrageous and indeed a very stupid comment to make.  The enemy is not Islam. There is no new enemy.  What the enemy will always be, whether it is an Islamic State, a Christian State or a state with no religion at all, is a state that decides to descend to aggression or indeed a state that decides to descend to depriving people of liberty, detaining them against their will or to any of the other acts that the whole international community, represented in the UN, rightly deplores.</P>
    <P>So let us not have a new bogeyman invented by the Labour Party and The Workers' Party because they do not want to face the consequences of what is happening in Europe, because they do not want to accept the logic that all the changes we have seen and the explosion, the destruction of bi-polarity mean that we have to rethink all the way through, all of the old habits of thought that we had ourselves or that we objected to so strongly when we saw them in other people.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach indeed seems to have some inkling that this is what is required because this afternoon he said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="505" /> Doctrines of security and defence based on the East-West confrontation must now be radically reassessed.  The dramatically reduced military threat has posed fundamental questions for the military alliances about their role in the new situation.</P>
    <P>I agree with that but, of course, the Taoiseach does not come to any conclusion about that.  He has sought rather to evade the issue by suggesting that the CSCE must be the privileged forum for discussion on these issues.</P>
    <P>I will quote an extract from an interview with <i>The Irish Times</i> in which the Taoiseach said: &ldquo;We would be looking very much to the CSCE as providing a framework covering all of Europe which would create a whole new structure of relationships between the countries of Europe, East and West.&rdquo;  I agree entirely with that, but it is interesting to see the very conditional way in which it was put, &ldquo;we would be looking very much to the CSCE&rdquo;.  In what conditions, and under what circumstances, would we be looking that way?  Is the Taoiseach afraid to say that he is looking in that direction?  Is he afraid to go even that far?  He expressed the view this afternoon that &ldquo;a common EC foreign and security policy, when articulated, is unlikely to include specific military aspects at this stage&rdquo;.  Yet he seems to see the need to address this part of the problem because he said also this afternoon:</P>
    <P>The major changes brought about in the CSCE also require us to examine the implications of this new situation for the current efforts of the Community to develop further its own identity in the international arena.  As part of that process 11 member states, including Ireland, agreed at the Rome European Council on the objective of a common foreign and security policy with the aim of giving greater coherence and effectiveness to the Community's international action.</P>
    <P>He then went on to talk about the Inter-governmental Conference on Political Union which he says must have special <Col N="506" /> regard to the new Pan-European framework within which the security and stability of all the countries in Europe will in future be ensured.  That again is very wise and I agree with it but the Taoiseach fails to come to any conclusion about it.</P>
    <P>What I ask now and what we have been asking in this House for a good six months or more is what will the Taoiseach be saying in the context of that new reassessment. What will our Government be saying?  Will they have any point of view to put forward?  What will the Government be saying on our behalf in debating the shape and the content of future political union in the European Community?  What will the Government be saying about how that European Community is going to relate in future in the security field, the defence field and the foreign policy field to the newly emerging democracies in Eastern Europe?  The answer we get from the Taoiseach is nothing at all.  He has no view to give us. He, and the Government, seem to have made no decision about the approach we should adopt.</P>
    <P>Yet again we see uncertainty.  Further in the Taoiseach's speech &mdash; I do not intend to read it all &mdash; there is a long passage about the Paris Summit welcoming the decision on the reduction in conventional forces.  He said he particularly welcomes the Summit's decision that there should now be more structured co-operation among all participating states on security matters, and that discussions and consultations will take place among the 34 participants aimed at establishing by 1992 new negotiations on disarmament and confidence and security building open to all participating states.  I assume by that that the Taoiseach means that by 1992, if this process goes well, all the 34 participating states, including Ireland, will be involved in negotiations on disarmament and confidence and security building.  This afternoon the Taoiseach made the old-fashioned, typically Fianna Fáil virtue of the fact that &mdash; as he said in his usual smug fashion &mdash; we stand aside from all these discussions on military matters.  Yet suddenly the <Col N="507" /> CSCE presents a new framework and the Taoiseach is apparently now hoping that by 1992, all going well, we will be involved with all the participating States in talking about this.</P>
    <P>What has changed?  What suddenly has made the Taoiseach seem to indicate that he has a view on this now that he did not have before?  That is all very confusing, vague and indefinite.  Frankly, I regard it all as just so much window dressing.  The Taoiseach has shown consistently an unwillingness to express any view, to commit himself to any opinion, and that has been typical of his approach to foreign policy issues and particularly to questions of European integration throughout the course of this year, in the fact of everything that has been happening both outside and inside the Community.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach pointed out this afternoon that the European Community, represented by the Presidency and the Commission, would be signing the Paris Charter.  It is clear, therefore, that as a signatory to the Charter the Community will have to work out its own approach to all the issues dealt with in that Charter, including questions of defence.  I hope that approach will be forward-looking, constructive and will make a real contribution to the development of peace and the expansion of freedom and liberty, but it will require all member states of the Community, including Ireland, to participate in defining the Community's position on all these issues, including security and defence.  That is the central thought in what Deputy John Bruton said this afternoon.  It is time we got off the fence, stopped prevaricating and decided that we are involved in this. We have a view about other countries' military activities and we have a right to have such a view because we are just as much threatened by the consequences of what they do as they are themselves.  It is time we had the confidence to express that view on behalf of the people who <Col N="508" /> elect us to this House.  It will be only if we do that that we can make our full contribution to pushing forward the cause of peace.</P>
    <P>I know why the Taoiseach will not give an opinion on any of these matters.  I know why he is presenting the CSCE as being the privileged forum.  It is a bolt-hole for him.  It prevents him having to make up his mind.  It does away with the need for the Government to take a position on this issue.  Yet the full nonsense of the Taoiseach's, and the Government's position can be seen when you look back and reflect on the words the Taoiseach used this afternoon &mdash; it was he who pointed it out &mdash; that decisions made by the CSCE are not binding on any of the member states.  Each state has to decide for itself how much it is going to implement, how far it is going to go and how it is going to do it.  This is the bolt-hole that is being chosen for us by our Government, and I find that totally unsatisfactory.  It is a total abdication of the responsibility of Government here and I consider it to be a betrayal not only of our people but also of all the people in Central and Eastern Europe who are looking now to the West, to the European Community in particular, and to each of its member states to be the engine that drives the process of pushing out the borders of parliamentary democracy.</P>
    <P>A great deal more could be said about all of this but, unfortunately, time prevents me from going into the issues that have been raised in relation to our participation in this process and in UN decisions about the Gulf.  On that subject I will say only this, we must support United Nations action.  We cannot have it both ways, as the Labour Party and The Workers' Party seem to want, of supporting the UN when it suits us and not going along with the UN when it requires us to do something new, to do something that goes against the old traditionalism which, for all their radical thoughts, the Labour Party and The Workers' Party represent on these issues we are now discussing.</P>

      <P>It would have been very enjoyable if we had had the right to interrupt speakers, because when you cannot comment or ask a question about something with which you disagree it kills debate and statements.  Unfortunately, if a Member interrupts he or she is asked to leave the House as a result of disorderly behaviour.</P>
      <P>In this debate there was plenty of gobbledegook in talking about free markets, market economies and so on. However, I hope that there will be enough food for everyone in Eastern Europe and indeed it is now obvious that the system in those countries did not work.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's speech on the CSCE.  Clearly we are now getting to the stage where sanity seems to prevail, where peace is more important than war.  A few days ago I spoke on the Third World where one of the figures I read from a document was that 30,000 children were dying daily from hunger or curable diseases.  That is a massive figure but, as the document was produced by one of the people involved in that field, I take it at its face value.  Now that we have shifted from the idea of war to peace, will we be able to spend money in helping those in need?  A speaker mentioned the money spent on armaments, and said if that money was used properly the world would be happier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that Deputy De Rossa would like to interrupt me now and again.  He used a lovely phrase when he was talking about neutrality but he did not develop it.  I was fascinated to hear him say that we should make neutrality more positive and relevant.  I know we can describe things as &ldquo;positive&rdquo;, &ldquo;negative&rdquo; and <Col N="510" />&ldquo;neutral&rdquo; but I should like the Deputy to expand on how neutrality could be made more positive and relevant.</P>
    <P>CSCE participants have given a commitment to democracy and respect for human life.  However, Deputy Dukes pointed out that these documents are not legally binding on the participating states although they represent a solemn political commitment to them.  What have we achieved if there is nothing binding in these statements?  Are they pious platitudes? Will anything happen?  If they live up to the recommendations in the CSCE document I will be very happy.  I welcome anything that prevents war or waste of money which provides the means of war. I hope that this will lead to a better and safer world.</P>

    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to immediately introduce a National AIDS Plan to respond to the AIDS epidemic in Ireland; to establish a national task force on AIDS with a specific budget; and to ensure that the medical, community care, accommodation, financial and other needs of HIV-AIDS patients are properly provided for now and in the future.</P>

    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dail Éireann endorses the Governments AIDS strategy which encompasses a programme for the prevention of HIV infection and the care on an integrated basis, of AIDS-HIV patients within existing services and <Col N="511" /> which is responsive to the needs of persons with HIV-AIDS and is up-to-date with international developments in this field.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I listened with great interest to the debate last night.  Contributions have been constructive and sympathetic on this issue.</P>
      <P>I take issue with both Deputies Howlin and Yates on a number of issues. It is extremely alarmist of Deputy Yates to say that by the year 2000 there will be approximately 20,000 HIV positive patients in this country and that Dublin will be the AIDS capital of Europe.  That statement is without basis in fact.  As the Minister said yesterday we should follow the advice in the World Health Organisation statement, that projecting data like that is totally unwise, as the nature and spread of this disease in terms of individual groups and geographical prevalence is unpredictable.  In his speech the Minister tackled the problem from the perspective of those who are HIV positive and from the perspective of protecting the general public.  It is not necessary to go into this in any detail because the Minister's speech last night covered everything.</P>
      <P>Needs in this area are catered for in an integrated network of community services throughout the country.  I disagree with Deputy Howlin in that I see no reason to import specialists to deal with AIDS.  AIDS is a viral disease that attacks the immune system.  The unfortunate victims of this disease usually succumb to secondary illnesses such as pneumonia and so on.  These diseases are adequately dealt with by indigenous specialists who are dealing with these illnesses on a daily basis.  In the past Deputy Howlin spoke about wanton waste in the medical field.  His proposal would cost money.  If extra money is to be made available it could be diverted to better use in this sphere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have an AIDS problem in Mountjoy Prison.  The Minister dealt <Col N="512" /> comprehensively with this yesterday. How could anybody have foreseen the problem of AIDS in the prison system when we were devising our prisons?  I am glad that the Minister for Health has announced that a special unit in Mountjoy is nearing completion.  I hope this will alleviate the problem and eliminate further criticism in this regard.</P>
    <P>Education is obviously a vital component of any campaign to prevent a disease like this.  An increasing number of young people are sexually active as is evidenced by the growing number of teenage pregnancies and pregnancies outside of marriage.  This age group must be specifically targeted in any education programme.  The ideal solution would be a return to our moral values.  However, we must be realistic and accept that ideals are hard to maintain.  We have had a barrage of advice about condoms, sterile needles and so on.  Some of this advice runs counter to the accepted ethical values held by churches, the medical profession and other people.  I hope a common approach can be reached to have the desired effect in combating AIDS.</P>
    <P>Because of our education programme the problem of AIDS is decreasing among the gay community.  It will be hard to get the message across to our wider heterosexual society but we must tackle the problem.</P>
    <P>The greatest single cause of the spread of AIDS in Ireland relates to specific individuals who in the early eighties imported large amounts of hard drugs into this country and made junkies of many young people.  The kids who started on drugs then did not know what effect they would have.  The culprits for the introduction of this tragic disease are the drug barons for whom I have no sympathy. They prospered on the misery of countless young people.  I hope the drug barons who are careful not to use the drugs themselves will be wiped off the map.  No punishment is too severe for these people.</P>
    <P>We have consensus in relation to this issue.  We have a lot of common ground. <Col N="513" /> I propose now to give the remainder of my time to Deputy Hillery.</P>

I will briefly focus on the role of education in relation to the tragic disease of AIDS, to underline specifically the pro-active role that the Department of Education together with the Department of Health have played.  When we think of education in the context of AIDS we realise straightaway that AIDS can only be prevented because a cure has not yet been found.  If people are unfortunate enough to be infected with AIDS, it is over to the medical people to tackle it.  Unfortunately and typically the disease leads to premature death.  Therefore, the preventive role through education is of vital importance.  In that context, during the past two years or so a number of initiatives have been taken in respect of education and information on AIDS for young people in our schools.  This has been a joint effort between the Department of Education and the Department of Health.  When the Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, contacted the schools and school authorities, as well as medical personnel, in this regard she immediately and correctly underlined the importance of the parental role.  I think in modern society &mdash; I speak as a parent myself &mdash; we tend to underestimate the role of parents and the influence we have on our children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall debating not so long ago a joint policy report on youth.  An extensive survey was done among teenagers and one of the more interesting findings was that overwhelmingly &mdash; over 90 per cent &mdash; children turned to their parents when they had problems of any kind.  Therefore, parents are particularly influential and it is especially important that they should be involved in the development of initiatives on the educational side, and <Col N="514" /> this of course the Government were keen to do.</P>
    <P>The disease itself, of course, is tragic at the personal level.  It is important that we underline the gravity of it because, unfortunately, there are those who would minimise the dangers associated with it. It is obviously tragic for the individual, for the family concerned and, as we know from the continent of Africa, it is tragic for whole countries which are affected by the disease.  On the other hand, we know the virus is transmitted, but only in specific ways.  Transmission is entirely preventable; it can be prevented by avoiding the behaviour which causes a risk of transmission.  It follows, therefore, that we all have an educative information type role and responsibility in that regard.  When I use the word &ldquo;all&rdquo; I mean politicians, parents, teachers, doctors, officials and so forth.  There is no single member of the community who does not have a constructive role to play in preventing the spread of AIDS.</P>
    <P>This is the reason the Government have been keen to develop and advance a programme as part of the total educational process in the schools.  Having contacted the schools, the Department quickly got the message from teachers that it was very important that we have home produced educational materials on AIDS.  It is to the credit of the Government that considerable research was done to see what was being done in this regard elsewhere, for example, in Northern Ireland.  Detailed research was carried out and some drafts of possible resource materials were prepared and discussed within the Department with individual teachers and others who had a responsibility and interest in the educational area.  The Department receive regular feedback from individual schools on their meetings with parents and on what parents consider should or should not be done.</P>
    <P>One important message which came through was that parents were very concerned about their children's future welfare and were very positive and relieved to know that schools were taking initiatives in relation to AIDS education.  Here <Col N="515" /> we have co-operation between parents and the schools working jointly under the aegis of the Departments of Health and Education.  It was decided that the serious situation with regard to AIDS required detailed educational resource materials, not just general guidelines which would leave it up to schools and teachers to develop their own materials or use imported items.  Because of this it was decided that it was necessary to carry out a pilot study in a small number of schools.  The results of this study proved very valuable because extremely valuable feedback was received in trying to put the correct programme together.</P>
    <P>There are those who believe that the only initiative taken by Government Departments and their respective Ministers was the development of resource materials, but in practice not one but two summer schools have been held to tease out the issue further.  We now have a programme on AIDS in place in many schools as part of the general education programme.  This is found to be acceptable and is being implemented in a non-confrontational way.  This is not the end of the matter as it is quite obvious that the effectiveness of the material currently in use will have to be monitored and when further feedback are received, more refinements of the programme will be applied as and when necessary.</P>
    <P>Given my undertaking to share my time with the Minister of State, Deputy Harney, I will now pass over to her.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Deputies Hillery and McDaid for sharing their time with me. I will not avail of all the time at my disposal.  I would like to begin by congratulating Deputy Yates for bringing forward this motion for debate here this week and the various Deputies who have entered into the discussion.  Their contributions have reflected a wide consensus on this crisis and on the urgency and scale of the task presented to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In discussing this issue tonight I can only favourably contrast it with the tone <Col N="516" /> of the last occasion on which this House considered an AIDS-related matter &mdash; the special funding to compensate the small number of haemophiliacs who had become infected with the HIV virus in the course of a blood trnasfusion.  To its shame, this House was then unable to agree to make special provisions for these tragic individuals and it is a source of particular satisfaction to me that one of the least contentious results of the subsequent general election was the allocation of £1 million to this group.  I hope tonight's debate proves to be a benchmark in our developing attitude to this disease and to its implications, both national and global.  The AIDS crisis, quite simply, is the most serious health and social issue which has ever faced the world.</P>
    <P>On their own the statistics relevant to the disease in this country are alarming: 174 people have contracted full blown AIDS &mdash; 69 of whom are already dead, over 1,000 people have the HIV virus, the particular problems resulting for our drug problems, the increasing and inevitable spread of the disease throughout society, and so on.  Tragically, however, these figures are only the tip of the iceberg. With global increases being measured in hundreds of thousands and forecasts of future trends running into tens of millions, the scale of the crisis facing us is clear.</P>
    <P>Our strategy in response to this disease must be guided by three principles.  First, to the best of our ability we must prevent the further spread of the disease, second, we must ensure the best possible care for existing and future sufferers and, third, we must take every possible measure to tackle discrimination against those suffering from the disease.  Given that the prospects for an effective treatment of this disease are still very far off, preventing the future spread of the disease must be our paramount concern.  The proven decline in the rate of transmission of the disease among homosexual men proves beyond doubt that it is imperative to ensure that the full and frank facts of the disease are disseminated not just to those most at risk but throughout society <Col N="517" /> because the threat of the disease can no longer be said to be confined to any particular group.</P>
    <P>This campaign must use every resource at our disposal &mdash; the full provision of information on every aspect of the disease throughout society &mdash; ensuring the availability of exchange needles and condoms to intravenous drug abusers in particular and the widest possible use of an effective media campaign to highlight the problem.  The media blitz which accompanied the initial news of the AIDS disease has clearly died.  Memories are tragically short and I have no doubt that in the absence of an ongoing and prominent campaign about the seriousness of the disease, young people in particular will be more convinced by the phrase &ldquo;it will not happen to me&rdquo; than by a proper concern for their real vulnerability.</P>
    <P>The present Minister, to his credit, in the 1987 campaign did show that that campaign was hugely successful in highlighting the disease and in educating the public to its implications and seriousness. For lasting effectiveness, however, I believe such a campaign must be virtually continuous and should be concentrated not just at air and ferry ports but throughout the country.  We cannot simply suggest that AIDS is only caught abroad.</P>
    <P>While prevention must always be of paramount concern we must also ensure that every effort possible is invested in treating current AIDS and HIV sufferers. I have no doubt, even with the most ambitious estimates for disease prevention, that the coming years will see a huge growth in the number of sufferers. This will have enormous implications not only for our health professionals but for future health planning and budgeting.  It is only by taking the proper planned steps now that we can ensure the best treatment for sufferers of this disease.</P>
    <P>I am equally concerned, however, at the discrimination problems which affect AIDS sufferers and the people who are HIV positive.  The reluctance of individuals to contemplate casual AIDS testing reflects an understandable worry that they and their families will, through <Col N="518" /> ignorance, be virtually ostracised from their communities.  This too must be the guiding principle behind any public awareness campaign on the disease.  As in any situation, ignorance and fear are the primary factors in discrimination. They must be tackled and the understandable fears of people must be addressed so that there is no excuse for any discriminatory treatment of AIDS sufferers.</P>
    <P>In this country we have been slow to come to grips with the seriousness of the AIDS problem and, indeed, with our wide responsibilities as legislators to deal with the situation.  However, in the last number of years great progress has been made in our approcah to the problem and a greater understanding and sympathy has been evident.  The Minister must be congratulated for this as, indeed, must Dr. James Walsh, National AIDS co-ordinator, who has worked tirelessly on this campaign.  A number of points raised in this debate deserve the most careful consideration.</P>
    <P>In an almost unique manner the future direction of any AIDS policy cannot be anticipated.  I believe the situation and our response to it must be kept under constant and careful supervision.  We should be prepared at any stage to alter our approach to the disease and be flexible enough to incorporate any advances which are made in health and public awareness fields in connection with it. We are still very much at the stage of the unknown.  As I said earlier, it is the greatest health and social issue currently facing the world and one which all of us as legislators &mdash; regardless of what political party we happen to represent &mdash; must come together and work on if we are to find a sympathetic and caring solution to the problems it brings to those who suffer from it and their families.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeSherlock" hpid="Mr. Sherlock Mr. Sherlock">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherlock</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion before the House from Fine Gael is a good motion and The Workers' Party will be giving it our support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>AIDS is a killer disease and the numbers infected with AIDS-HIV are growing <Col N="519" /> in this country.  Ireland has the unenviable distinction of having the highest proportion of babies born in this country with the HIV virus or with full blown AIDS in Europe.  The numbers of people who have contracted this deadly disease through heterosexual activity is also growing.  I am, therefore, dismayed that the Government have put down a self-congratulatory amendment seeking to make this issue a party political one and not a human one.  The task facing us all in this country is to muster all forces to halt the spread of the AIDS epidemic. I believe the motion in the name of Deputy Yates is an earnest attempt to put forward a way to tackle the AIDS-HIV problem in Ireland.</P>
    <P>AIDS has become the major health issue of the late eighties and will now unfortunately be the health issue of the nineties.  People with AIDS, HIV or AIDS-related problems are normal people who have contracted this deadly disease in a variety of ways.  The Government must show, by example on the ground, that their attitude to this matter is not complacent but an active preventive and caring policy.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a national AIDS task force would be an excellent and serious policy decision.  There is no point in the Government coming before this House, blandly telling us that in comparison with other European countries our problem with AIDS is not too bad.  All people infected with AIDS-HIV are human beings with feelings and families and not mere statistics.</P>
    <P>The people who are working on the ground are encountering so much ignorance, prejudice, hostility and human tragedy, that I must congratulate them on their tireless work.  These local action groups in different parts of the country are telling anyone who cares to listen the same sorry story, a lack of funding and co-ordination between the statutory and voluntary bodies.</P>
    <P>Are we serious about tackling the AIDS epidemic in this country?  If we are to be honest with ourselves, the answer at the moment appears to be no.  I say <Col N="520" /> this because there is no good reason for not establishing a national AIDS task force which would represent all the groups working on the issue in the country.  Such a force could give national direction in the fight against AIDS and give the campaign added seriousness and enthusiasm.</P>
    <P>With the hostility to the task force everyone who has fought campaigns in the past will tell you that a nationally co-ordinated group with representatives of local groups, is much better than disparate localised activity.  Surely this is the lesson that Fianna Fáil should have learned from the Presidential campaign. Fighting the spread of AIDS deserves our best and most intelligent organisational skills to be deployed.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Southern Health Board, I know, from submissions made by the Cork AIDS Alliance to that board, that they are seeking to build a front against AIDS-HIV.  The Cork AIDS Alliance have asked for integrated co-operation between the voluntary and statutory sector as the most effective response to the problem.  I supported this call in the Southern Health Board and fully support the need for a national task force to be established which would comprise representatives of the voluntary and statutory sector.</P>
    <P>I am sure that every Deputy in the House knows of the selfless and thankless work they do on behalf of the country in their voluntary organisations.  Their call for integrated co-ordination at national levels to be sincerely taken on board and accepted by the Government as the most appropriate way to tackle the problem.</P>
    <P>I am perturbed, and it leaves me somewhat sad, that the vast majority of the funding to combat the spread of AIDS-HIV comes from the national lottery. This is a clear example of lottery money being used to prop up and supplement the Department of Health budget.  Lottery money has many uses for the benefit of the country.  It should not, in my view, be used for ongoing funding for such a major matter as tackling AIDS-HIV.  I believe that lottery funds are for stop gap <Col N="521" /> use to tackle a major problem that has just arisen.  AIDS will be with us for many years to come and lottery funding is not appropriate.  Funding must come from the Exchequer to deal with this problem. The Department of Health should have sufficient moneys in their budget.  That is a demand we will continue to make.</P>
    <P>There is a definite feeling in the country that the Government's information and preventive programme is complacent and dominated by the attitudes of one religious group.  Information is preventive; ignorance of AIDS-HIV does kill.  I fully believe that the publicity campaign in 1987 using billboards, TV, newspapers and local health centres was a good effort at disseminating information.</P>
    <P>It amazes me, however, that the Department of Agriculture and Food can regularly run advertisements drawing the public's attention to the danger to farm animals of dogs on the loose.  The Department of the Environment regularly advertise and warn the public of the dangers of drinking and driving.  The Department of Health confines its warning about AIDS-HIV to small posters hanging on crowded notice boards in health centres.</P>
    <P>There is a crying need for information on this subject and it is the Government's responsibility to give the most effective and sensible information to the public.  If nothing else is achieved out of this debate the Government will have realised that there is great annoyance at their self-satisfied attitude.  Information is urgently needed and wanted now.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health can do something very significant and at no cost to his Department to save the lives of many people.  It is difficult to understand why the family planning laws on the sale of condoms are still in existence.  Condoms are medically proven to be a major preventive method in halting the spread of AIDS-HIV.  It is a ludicrous situation that a retailer can be prosecuted for selling a packet of condoms in a shop which is not a pharmacy.  In all the other countries of the European Community members of the public can easily purchase condoms, but not in Ireland after the closure of chemists at say 6 p.m. or on Sundays.  I <Col N="522" /> call upon the Minister to amend the family planning laws to make the sale of condoms more accessible.</P>
    <P>We like to pride ourselves on being a Christian country, full of charity and a major donor of money to the poor countries of the world but I am disappointed at the way we treat our people at home. Those unfortunate people who have contracted the HIV virus or AIDS tell stories of how they are made feel totally unwanted, like lepers in their own communities. It is wrong to say that Ireland has the best health care and counselling available in the health service.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health coming into the House last night and telling us that there are sufficient staff for the AIDS programmes was nothing short of a farce. AIDS patients need in-depth counselling to help them cope with the disease.  There are not enough counsellors available and the result is that those on the staff have to cope with a workload which would not be borne by other counsellors in the health service.  That is a terrible indictment of the Department of Health.  The provision of counsellors is absolutely necessary to trace other people who may have been in sexual contact with people who have AIDS or HIV.  By comparison one full-time counsellor in Britain has to deal with 30 patients only.  That is not the case in Ireland and St. James's Hospital in Dublin has been arguing about the need for a third counsellor for some time. When we consider that St. James's Hospital handles all the AIDS-HIV cases in the greater Dublin area it is clear that the number of counsellors in Ireland is far fewer than the rest of Europe.  Indeed, at a conference on AIDS held in Copenhagen in March last there was a discussion on the over-burdening of staff and how it can cause staff burn-out.</P>
    <P>I am appalled at the intolerance and hostility shown to these unfortunate people or which they believe they receive. People who have learned that they have AIDS-HIV face a traumatic time and often are totally shocked and in distress.  There is clear evidence that many of these victims feel they have to emigrate particularly to Britain, to obtain <Col N="523" /> care and counselling.  This is not an attack on the dedicated workers in the medical service; it is an attack on prevailing attitudes. It is also a reflection on the poor efforts of the Department of Health to explain the ways AIDS can be contracted in their publicity campaigns.</P>
    <P>World AIDS day will be held this weekend, 1 December, when this House would do itself proud by passing this motion in the name of Deputy Yates. The Government parties should consider the human issues involved in this and not regard it as a party political issue.  This is a unique opportunity for us to radically approach the problem of AIDS-HIV in Ireland by setting up a national task force which would have its own budget to halt this killer disease.  Such measures are taken by the Government in other areas, for example, the setting up of ERAD. Why do they not do the same in regard to this crucially important health issue?</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Byrne, has asked me to give him five minutes of my time.  Is that in order?</P>

      <P>Deputy Hillery referred to schools and the schools programme. Clearly AIDS will be a major health issue into the nineties and the failure of the Department of Education to publish their programme on it is deplorable.  Unless young people are alerted at an early age about the dangers of AIDS and to appropriate preventive measures the AIDS epidemic will continue to grow with horrific consequences.  I hope the programme which has been mentioned will be published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion before us.  As a city TD who represents the constituency of Dublin South-Central I am aware at first-hand of the problems facing communities where AIDS exists.  I want to congratulate all the workers in the voluntary sector who are tackling the AIDS problem at the coalface.  I know my time is extremely limited because of <Col N="524" /> the time allocation but I should like to make a few points on this issue.</P>
      <P>As part of my research on this issue, I called to the Merchant's Quay project which is being run in Dublin south inner-city and spoke to some of the voluntary workers.  I was incredibly impressed by the work these people are doing in tackling the problem of AIDS.</P>
      <P>We are all aware that there is a direct relationship between HIV infection and drug abuse in parts of this city.  There have been 75 deaths since 1986 from this disease and there is a rapidly spiralling increase in the number of people who are tested as being HIV positive.  For example, in November 1989 there were 865 reported cases of this disease which had risen to 1,005 by this month.  In March 1990, 914 people had tested positive to the HIV test of whom 534 or 58 per cent, were intravenous drug users.  At the same time 130 people were diagnosed as having AIDS which figure had increased to 174 cases by this month.  Of the 130 people diagnosed as having AIDS 51 people, or 35 per cent, were intravenous drug users.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that these figures relate only to those people who have been tested for HIV.  It is known that at present many of the prison population are trying to avoid being tested because they are afraid of being segregated within the prisons.  We also know from the work being carried out by detached workers &mdash; people who go out into the community and get to know the people who are using drugs &mdash; that new drug users are sharing needles, thus giving rise to an increasing risk of infection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The plight of the drug using sub-culture in Dublin calls for a series of new initiatives. Hopefully, these will be implemented if this motion is passed. Many of the initiatives needed were listed in a report recently submitted to the Department of Health by the CSSC who are actively involved in the Merchant's Quay project.  These proposals have been put forward after research into the needs of drug users in Dublin and include the need for a broader range of treatment <Col N="525" /> options for drug users, better co-ordination of services and access by health workers to the drug using sub-culture.</P>
    <P>The drug treatment centre in Pearse Street saw over 200 people in one day in April this year.  This gives a clear picture of what is happening in this city.  When one balances that picture with the fact that there is only one residential treatment centre for drug users in Dublin one can understand the reason this motion is before us tonight.  There are no reliable statistics on the number of drug users in Dublin.  The drug treatment centre has dealt with more than 8,000 poly drug users since it opened in the early seventies and they have had an average of 600 new contacts every year since 1984.  Research carried out in Dublin secondary schools shows that a further 7,000 young people use drugs other than alcohol on a regular basis.  Some of these used opiates and synthetic opiates.</P>
    <P>There is sufficent evidence to indicate that this problem is persistent and growing. Drug abuse leads to the spread of HIV and it is for this reason that we support the call for a national AIDS plan. The number of deaths in Dublin from AIDS has heightened people's anxiety about continued drug abuse.  The need for supports, education and ongoing care is evident and will become more urgent in the future.  Drug abuse has an inbuilt dynamic which gradually pushes the user out to the margins of society.  This alienation is like a downward spiral which is rotated by family disruption and imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Social prejudice and an inability to find or keep a job serve to fuel this downward trend.  Added to this is the constant compulsion to find a fix and to be stoned on drugs.  Begging for substances leads to personal neglect that causes both physical and psychological trauma.  The process of alienation creates tenuous clusters of drug users who form a sub-culture around the supply of and demand for drugs.  At best this group can only offer to themselves an insecure sense of belonging.  At worst it reinforces their marginal identity and it is here that growing numbers of <Col N="526" /> drug users experience economic destitution &mdash; they are politically impotent &mdash; and an existence that is spiritually empty.</P>
    <P>The problem is worsened when AIDS or HIV infection is added to this state of alienation.  It simply spins the spiral more rapidly.  HIV, for example, changes family disruption into a traumatic upheaval and also closes the addiction trap as it feeds a constant anxiety that stopping drugs will only lead to illness and the collapse of the immune system. To a person with HIV, prison is a double segregation.  It first cuts the prisoner off from his family and society and then futher segregates him from the mainstream of prison life.  The links between such acute social isolation and suicide are well known to the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>I want to give credit to those who are involved in the Merchants Quay project. It was the multiple needs of those fathers, mothers and children which gave rise to this centre.  I compliment their dedicated workers, some of whom know at first hand the experience of addiction and HIV and who strive to lesson the experience of isolation felt by drug users simply by spending time with them.  Their advice and referral centre provides a friendly link to the helping agencies and their service seeks to halt or even reverse the process of alienation.  For example, the respite care which is provided by them ensures a safe place where drug users with HIV can step off the spiral of destitution. Here they can find a place that seeks to restore and affirm their capacity to regain some power over their lives. The volunteers are motivated by a deep sense of admiration of those who are struggling to defy those life-threatening forces.  It is the commitment of those volunteers that makes projects such as this possible.  I want to congratulate them on their enthusiasm which derives its force from the courage and energy of their many clients.  In the final analysis it is these alienated people who impart an infectious hope to each of us.  It is this <Col N="527" /> hope that is our common bond as it surfaces in each of us with the cry &ldquo;I want to have a life and to have it to the full.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputy Yates is some years late in bringing forward this motion.  In 1986 as a member of the Eastern Health Board I expressed by way of motion my concern about the development of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome and the spread of the disease.  Somewhat to my surprise, the motion did not have the full support of all the political parties at the meeting.  The main party supporting was the Fianna Fáil Party.  It is nice that some years later Deputy Yates sees the need to address the issue.  The need is, however, already being addressed.</P>
      <P>The rate per million of AIDS cases in Ireland is the lowest in EC countries other than Greece.  The AIDS strategy being implemented by the Government is in line with the strategy in all EC countries.  It is continually monitored in the light of the latest international developments to ensure that the most up-to-date services are available to those in need.</P>
      <P>In examining the Government's AIDS strategy it is necessary to look at the objectives it sought to achieve.  These objectives are twofold, the first being the prevention of the spread of the disease, the second being the care and management of persons with HIV/AIDS in a proper manner.  I am satisfied that these objectives are being met in a caring and compassionate way, with the focus at all times on the need of the patient and the protection of the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Yates is somewhat late in <Col N="528" /> bringing a motion of this nature before the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>It is somewhat late.  The health boards around the country are already implementing policy.  I strongly refute the allegations made yesterday by Deputy Yates, in particular the implied criticism of the regional health boards in their response to the serious problem of HIV infection and AIDS.  I can speak with some degree of authority on the services being provided in the Eastern Health Board area where the disease is most prevalent.  The board lost no time in developing services at street level, community level and hospital level to meet the needs of persons suffering from HIV infection and their families.</P>
      <P>At street level the Eastern Health Board have in place a number of programmes. We have a methodone maintenance programme which includes a needle exchange, and an Outreach programme which has counsellors working at pavement level.  A number of these counsellors work throughout the Eastern Health Board area and there is a telephone communication available on a regular basis, following a pilot scheme introduced in 1987.  There are a number of other schemes, including an AIDS helpline.  There are drop-in centres which cater primarily for drug abusers and provide them with a needle exchange and advice.  The workers on the Outreach programme are either nurses or social workers who try to make contact at pavement level with drug abusers with a view to persuading them to go along to drug treatment centres.  These people are followed up to ensure they have attended and are availing of treatment.  We have also run, and now have, a full education programme.  In the Eastern Health Board area in recent years there have been different pilot projects, including an educational one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are also funding a number of the voluntary organisations who deal with HIV-infected people and drug abusers.  I <Col N="529" /> am aware also that a number of organisations are funded directly by the Department of Health.  Therefore, there is a range of services provided at community level, in line with Government strategy, and the hospital services are being developed to meet the need.  For example, again in the Eastern Health Board area, Cherry Orchard Hospital make available approximately 22 beds &mdash; some of which are made available on a respite basis &mdash; that have catered for a number of HIV-positive patients on a regular basis as the need arises.  There is also co-ordination of the services provided by the Eastern Health Board and all the other authorities, including St. James's Hospital where the main consultant, Dr. Mulcahy, is responsible in regard to access to beds required.</P>
    <P>I cannot support Deputy Yates's motion.  When I began Deputy Yates mentioned that this was the first time this subject had been discussed on the floor of this House.  That may be so but I am sure there are many other issues not discussed in this House while meeting the needs of those in our community.  I would imagine that those people requiring services would prefer to have them made available at community level rather than have the matter discussed in this House. I know that, in conjunction with the Department of Health, the Eastern Health Board are providing the necesary services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. N. Treacy) Noel Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am, indeed, pleased to have an opportunity, on behalf <Col N="531" /> of the Government, to respond to this motion and the debate thus far.</P>
      <P>It is known, from our surveillance data, that the HIV virus is present in our popuation and that we are, therefore, part of the AIDS epidemic worldwide.  AIDS and HIV infection by its very nature tends to create strong emotive responses &mdash; sometimes bordering on hysteria.  This, of course, is understandable given (i) that this disease affects people in the prime of life &mdash; most of the cases occurring in people aged between 25 and 40 years and (ii) that, as of the present time, it is a terminal disease.</P>
      <P>Strategies dealing with this disease are not, however, well served by emotive reactions based on inaccurate and subjective data.  Highly charged emotional statements do not serve the best interests of people infected with the HIV virus or their families.  The Government welcome calm and constructive public debate on this major public health problem.  They must, however, continue to base their strategies on the established known facts about the disease and continue the balanced and practical response outlined in detail by my colleague, Deputy O'Hanlon, Minister for Health, in this House last night.</P>
      <P>We recognise from our ongoing surveillance of the disease in this country and from our constant contacts with international bodies &mdash; in particular the EC AIDS Centre in Paris &mdash; that the epidemiology and social background of the disease is ever changing.  We have long recognised that flexibility of approach is essential in dealing with this complex disease.  This approach will underpin our strategy development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important, however, at this point to emphasise again &mdash; as the Minister said last night &mdash; that we have a comprehensive programme for the prevention, monitoriing, diagnosis, treatment and management of AIDS in line with international strategies &mdash; a programme which is being implemented in a caring and compassionate manner consisting of the monitoring of AIDS and the trend in HIV infection; prevention <Col N="532" /> through health education strategies aimed specifically at the young and at at-risk groups; the protection of the blood supply; the provision of services to reduce risk such as Outreach and methodone maintenance and provision of condoms and needle exchange aimed specificaly at certain at-risk groups and linked to counselling at individual level; research into aspects of the disease; the care and management of people suffering from AIDS and HIV within an integrated framework of services including community services, primary care services, respite services, hospice services and acute hospital services; and the co-ordination of policy and its implementation at national and local levels.</P>
    <P>The question has been raised whether any evaluation of our health education programmes referred to by the Minister last night have been carried out.  I would like to confirm that such evaluations have taken place.  We found that first there was increased awareness of drug addicts as a high risk group and an increase in the percentage of people aware that sharing needles was dangerous; second, there was an increased awareness that those who had sexual intercourse with a person infected with the HIV virus, or casual sex, were particularly at risk of becoming infected; third, there was an awareness that the use of condoms was one of the effective things that sexually active people can do to reduce their risk of getting AIDS; fourth, more people recognised that one cannot become infected with the HIV virus by using the same swimming pool as an infected person; fifth, there was an increase in the percentage of people who would be willing to send their children to a school where they knew there was a child infected with the HIV virus; sixth the vast majority of those who read the Department of Health's booklet on AIDS considered that it was easy to understand and that it gave sufficient information for the general public on AIDS and, seventh there has been overwhelming acceptance of the school AIDS programme developed jointly by the Ministers for Health <Col N="533" /> and Education.  It is very encouraging to know that this programme has been sent to all 800 second-level schools in the country and that, from these schools, 1,600 teachers will be informed on how to use the materials with their students. The materials are properly viewed as a resource from which teachers can select and adapt in terms of the particular school context in which an AIDS education programme is taking place.  As the Ministers for Health and Education have stated, such programmes will be carried out in accordance with the school ethos, the wishes of parents and where pupils have a prior understanding of sexuality and human relationships.</P>
    <P>The findings from these surveys confirm that the Government's health educational strategy is the correct one.  Education-prevention strategies need to be carefully thought out.  We must be sure that the right message is reaching the right people in a way in which they can make use of it.  There is no use spending money telling people they cannot get HIV infection in swimming pools if they already know this.  Consultation needs to take place and it needs to be followed by action.</P>
    <P>Resources are scarce.  We must use them wisely.  Identifying needs is of the utmost importance; this is being done with appropriate research and appropriate strategies for meeting these needs are selected.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Government's approach in this area is soundly based and relevant.</P>
    <P>At this point I would like to respond to a number of specific points raised by Deputy Yates in his contribution to last night's debate.  Deputy Yates told the House that there would be 20,000 cases of HIV infection in Dublin by the end of the century; that Dublin was becoming the AIDS capital of Europe and that this would lead to what he described as a social disaster.  I am astonished at these statements.  I would like to know on what data are these Doomsday predictions based.  Does <Col N="534" /> Deputy Yates not accept the internationally expressed view that it is not possible at this stage to simply extrapolate figures over such a long period?  Does he not accept that all the evidence available shows that the prevalence of HIV infection and AIDS cases in this country is among the lowest in Europe?</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>In his speech last evening the Minister for Health pointed out that data from the EC AIDS centre in Paris shows that Ireland has a rate of 43.4 cases of AIDS per million of the population.  This compares with 173.2 cases per million for France, 158.4 cases per million for Spain and in fact shows that there is only one country in the EC with a lower rate than ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>He would not want to go on today's figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Brendan Howlin, in his contribution to the debate, spoke about the AIDS epidemic in the United States.  By way of comparison it is worth noting that the rate in the US of AIDS cases per million of the population is 561.8.  This is from the Central Disease Control HIV AIDS Surveillance Report of July last.  I make these comments, not to deny that we have an AIDS problem but rather to maintain a sense of balance and proportion in the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Yates last night gave the impression that there is such a thing as an &ldquo;AIDS consultant&rdquo; and that our approach should be to develop specialised services around such specialised units.  I would suggest that this is a limited perception of the problem.  It is known that AIDS manifests itself in a wide range of clinical symptoms involving almost every discipline of medicine.  The commonest manisfestation of AIDS is a type of pneumonia with approximately 70 per cent of patients becoming ill in this way. Presumably Deputy Yates would accept that pulmonary physicians would be the <Col N="535" /> appropriate people to treat those cases. The second most common way in which people become ill from AIDS is by developing various cancers and again the Deputy must accept that an oncologist would be the most appropriate consultant in such cases.  While recognising the important role of STD consultants in the management of HIV and AIDS patients, the Government's strategy for the care and treatment of AIDS and HIV cases is based on the provision of services in the patient's appropriate acute hospital by the appropriate consultant, depending on the nature of the clinical presentation. This ongoing policy has recently been reiterated in a circular issued to health boards and voluntary hospitals.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Department of Health recognise that HIV-AIDS patients will spend the greater part of their lives in the community and that primary care and domiciliary care services are central to the national AIDS strategy.  The general practitioner has played a significant role in our AIDS strategy to date &mdash; a point which seems to have been ignored by all of the Opposition speakers in the debate so far &mdash; and we are in regular contact with the Irish College of General Practitioners in relation to this involvement. This emphasis on primary health care and community support has always been an integral part of the Department's AIDS programme.</P>
    <P>Deputies Yates and Howlin both criticised the Government for what they perceived as a lack of planning of future services.  At international level, discussion and debate on the impact of AIDS on the health services is ongoing. We as a country were quick to recognise that it was impossible to assess accurately the impact of AIDS on our future health services without better, hard information on the spread of the virus in the general population.  Indeed, during my Government colleague, Deputy O'Hanlon's Presidency of the Council of Health Ministers, he raised this very subject which resulted in the adoption by the Council of a conclusion calling for, and I quote: <Col N="536" />&ldquo;more precise epidemiological information to facilitate the development and organisation of services....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Arising out of this initiative by our Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, all European Community countries including ourselves are now examining ways and means of obtaining better data on which to plan future services.  New methodologies are being considered in Ireland at the moment.  However, it is important to ensure that any new system, such as unlinked voluntary HIV testing, is ethically, legally and medically sound.  I am satisfied that we are approaching this complex problem responsibly and correctly in order to develop the right services for our people based on accurate sustainable data.</P>
    <P>On the subject of the planning of future health services for people suffering from AIDS and HIV-infected people, the outcome of early intervention strategies will have obvious implications.  As has already been stated, research studies in the last two years have shown that early diagnosis and treatment can extend the life of people with HIV infection.  This development is relatively new and its implications for the planning of future health services is obvious.  It is worth noting again that my colleague, Deputy O'Hanlon, in the context of his Presidency of the Council of Health Ministers, recognised this fact and brought it to the notice of his European colleagues resulting in the adoption by them of the following conclusion, and again I quote: &ldquo;Recent progress made notably in early intervention for HIV sero-positive persons and people with AIDS, which will allow for improvements in the health status of those people and result in an increase in their life expectancy, requires that particular attention be given to the future needs of medical and psycho-social care services for such persons&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I think it is clear, a Chathaoirligh, that, far from ignoring the planning of health services for AIDS patients as suggested by Deputies Yates and Howlin, it will be seen that Ireland has taken a leading role in the international debate on the two major and related issues of early <Col N="537" /> intervention and better surveillance both of which are vital to the future planning of services in this area.  In this context the major international meeting being held on Friday next in the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, announced by the Minister for Health yesterday, on the subject of early intervention and bringing together leading clinicians from America, Africa, where the disease is particularly widespread, and Europe is further evidence of the leading role this country is taking in the international debate on AIDS.</P>
    <P>On the question of AIDS and drug abuse I would like, a Cheann Comhairle, to agree with the point raised by Deputy Howlin yesterday when he said that there was a common agenda for these two problems.  We know that in this country almost 60 per cent of our HIV positive people are intravenous drug abusers.  As a direct consequence of this we have particular problems in the areas of paediatric AIDS, heterosexual spread and AIDS among prisoners.  As Deputy Howlin pointed out, there are common strategies to be adopted to deal with both the problems of drug abuse and AIDS and indeed it is fair to say that, if we were to control our drug abuse problem in this country, we would have gone a long way towards the prevention of the spread of the HIV virus.  In my capacity as Chairman of the National Co-ordinating Committee on Drug Abuse I am particularly conscious of this link.  I am therefore ensuring that the special emphasis placed in the Government's AIDS strategy on the co-ordination between the drug abuse services and the services for the prevention of HIV infection is being implemented on the ground.  This has widespread implications for all State services including the prison service.  It is a daunting task, but it must be achieved.  Not alone are we attempting to confront the complex issue of drug abuse in our community but also, in so doing, endeavouring to deal with the commonest mode of transmission of HIV virus in this country.  I have seen at first hand the commitment of the Government and the Minister, Dr. <Col N="538" /> O'Hanlon, the quality and commitment of the staff and the national AIDS co-ordinator, Dr. Walsh, who is one of the foremost voices on AIDS prevention and treatment in the world.</P>

      <P>In conclusion, I want to reiterate what my colleague, Deputy O'Hanlon, said last night in refuting the allegations made by Deputy Yates in relation to the lack of co-ordinated planned services for AIDS patients and persons suffering from HIV infection.  The Government's strategy is soundly based, equitable and compassionate.  Continuous monitoring and liaison with international bodies ensures that the most up-to-date services are available and that Ireland's AIDS sufferers will benefit without delay from any breakthrough in medical research dealing with prevention and treatment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you very much for your co-operation.  This disease cannot be treated on a party political basis.  It is much too serious for that.  In the few minutes I have I want to pose some questions. We cannot see into the future in the way we would like with regard to this disease and that is really one of the most threatening factors about it.</P>
      <P>I know what the Eastern Health Board are doing.  I worry about the regional bases and the other health boards.  The response in one of the health board areas would seem to indicate that the other regions have no problem with regard to AIDS or that they have not got the facilities to address it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would all agree that the care and management of people suffering from AIDS and HIV must be dealt with within an integrated framework of services.  I worry because everybody in this House <Col N="539" /> can say, hand on heart, that we do not have any real infrastructure of community care for long-term health care. Doctors, the people on the pavement or at the coal face who were mentioned tonight freely and sorrowfully tell us that. We deal in our clinics, day after day, with heart-breaking cases for whom long-term community care is not available, the care we know is essential for these patients.</P>
    <P>On that point, let me add that one of the reasons I will continue pursuing this cause is that the carers who are left to pick up the pieces, to deal with an under-resourced community care service, particularly an under-resourced home care service, are women.  Women will carry the burden of this as they have been asked to do in other areas, and they are among the voiceless.  That is happening at the moment and what the Minister said does not reassure me in the least.</P>
    <P>I deplore the fact that the Minister can come into this House and say that there is an awareness that the use of condoms is one of the effective ways that sexually active people can reduce the risk of getting AIDS while as legislators we stand in this forum with an Irish family planning Act that is so farcical that not alone is it laughed at by the rest of the world but has serious implications for the prevention of the spread of AIDS.  One has only to recollect that at the end of 1989, as we approached a bright new decade in Europe, the Family Planning Association were prosecuted for making condoms available through one of the most available youth sources one could get, a record store. Approximately 3,249 people availed of this service in the Virgin record store in 1989 before the prosecution was brought. The increase in the number of people using the service during holiday periods suggests that at those times people from rural areas tend to use the service while visiting Dublin.  Why is this?  It is because those resources, despite Deputy Callely's optimistic view, are not available at pavement level in a lot of areas in the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is serious about countering the spread of AIDS with every available resource we have, the first thing he must do, with the support of the rest of the House, is amend that family planning Act.  It is useless for us to say we are taking it seriously until we do that.</P>
      <P>Finally, I want to draw attention to a programme I viewed last night on Channel 4 directed to all of us about women and AIDS.  In January, 1989 when the clinic for women was first opened it mostly addressed itself to drug users and former drug users.  It is now having five to six new referrals every week and 80 to 85 per cent of them have sexually transferred virus, and are proving very vulnerable to infection.  I am inclined to believe that Ireland is not unique in the world, so when I hear of patterns emerging in other countries I do believe that we will be part of the same pattern.  We are human.</P>
      <P>I will conclude in order to allow time to my colleagues.  What I have to say, I say in the most serious way, because this is a learning process for all of us.  Women particularly are being diagnosed very often quite late, when they are very sick and when, in fact, they are beyond remedy, and that has been the pattern for women for many reasons.  I am sorry I cannot go into it any further but that is a dimension that is emerging and it has not been part of the problem up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that there is not more time to debate this issue because there are many Members offering.  I support this motion.  The AIDS problem is the most serious public health issue for generations.  It will not go away.  It will not be managed and controlled by some outside force, some third party.  It must <Col N="541" /> be managed and controlled by the Government, the Department of Health and the health boards.</P>
      <P>The reason there is a need for a co-ordinating body is to monitor all aspects of the disease, treatment, counselling, education, information, public attitudes or prevention.  Trying to do this in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner, as is being done at present, is a guarantee of failure.  We need a central AIDS plan administered by dynamic and experienced personnel.  We need enough of them to attack the problem, set targets and deal efficiently and professionally with the people afflicted and with their families.</P>
      <P>Thanks and appreciation should go to the many individuals and organisations who, over the years, have worked with those who have AIDS and HIV.  Many of them do not feel they receive adequate support and they certainly do not have confidence that the Government know what they are doing.</P>
      <P>We are talking about the rapidly growing disease of AIDS that grew from 11 in 1985 to 146 in 1990 and of HIV that grew from 275 to 948.  Of course, we should not cause undue panic or alarm to anybody, but how can we remain calm when in five years HIV sufferers have grown in numbers from 275 to 948? That is only those we know of, but I believe there are at least half as many again undetected.</P>
      <P>There is a need for a clear and specific continuous campaign of promotion and advertising of AIDS, as in the case in other countries.  This should be based on advertising campaigns that have been successful elsewhere.  For instance, in the UK the Government produced a series of educational advertisements, some of which at first tried to shock people into changing their sexual habits.  Critics said these images frightened people without encouraging them to practise safer sex. More recent campaigns have concentrated on informing people of the risks by using simple concepts and even humour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="542" /> We must stress &mdash; I pick up the point made by Deputy Monica Barnes &mdash; the concept of safe sex all the time, as is done in other European countries.  In the UK no opportunity of public information is missed to push this slogan.  What do we mean by safe sex?  Of course we mean monogamy, fidelity and so on but, in the context of the young at risk group, this can be little more than aspirational.  Most young people throughout the country, as young as 16 years of age, are now sexually active and these are the ones who need guidance.  Safe sex for them has to be sex with condoms.  The use of condoms is recommended widely, not least in the health promotion unit booklet.  But is it not profoundly hypocritical that they are put virtually out of the reach of young people?  Why are condoms restricted to chemists, hospitals and clinics?  They are not medication or medical aids.  They should be in slot machines for people who want them, where men and women can get them easily and confidentially.</P>
    <P>Let us end this prissy, narrow-minded attitude which legally elevates doctors and chemists to God status.  It is no wonder, as the Minister said in his speech last night, the foreign media programmes ridicule and attack us.  Our double standards must appear farcical to them.  We have a growing AIDS problem, particularly the problem of babies born with AIDS, and yet we will not reform our out-dated law on contraception.  The case has been made for reforming this legislation as soon as possible and enabling us to give this very important protection to young people.</P>

The Minister for Health has shown from his speech last night his typical smug, complacent neglect of the AIDS epidemic.  He obviously has not discussed directly with AIDS patients their view of his services.</P>
      <P>Today a press release was issued by the AIDS Action Alliance calling on all Deputies to support this motion.  They made specific note of the fact that next Saturday is World AIDS Day.  I will quote one paragraph of their statement: &ldquo;As we head into World AIDS Day, the 1st of December, 1990, we have a unique opportunity of marking this day by radically rethinking our response to HIV/AIDS by supporting Deputy Yates's Private Members Motion.&rdquo; Those are the people who matter.  It is their views that matter.  When they say they are denied access to services, they are speaking the truth.  The Minister has been misinformed, and he should be listening to those people.</P>

    <P>Just because Ireland is in the early stages of this disease does not mean that we, in years to come, will not have an epidemic.  The Minister said that I have exaggerated and have been alarmist in my prediction that there will be 20,000 people HIV positive by the turn of the <Col N="544" /> century.  The Minister gave no prediction of the level of the virus at the turn of the century.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Minister that I have consulted people in the World Health Organisation as well as experts in his Department, about this and they have told me that a figure of 20,000 is &ldquo;conservative&rdquo;. They know the real level of this tragedy.  If we take away the bluster of the Minister we will see the facts.  The facts are that there is no Government advertising or information programme on AIDS today.  There is no interdepartmental structure of Government dealing with AIDS.  There is no separate AIDS budget within the health service to provide for the special needs of these people.  The Minister is not implementing his own working party's report into the review of the health services for persons suffering from AIDS.</P>
      <P>Having listened to the Minister and the Minister of State, I am particularly fortunate to have a full photocopy of the Minister's working party's report into what needs to be done about AIDS.  This working party was set up under the chairmanship of Deputy Leyden, Minister of State, in February 1989.  The group consisted of many eminent people such as Mr. Hickey, the Chief Executive Officer of the Eastern Health Board, Professor Hillery, Mr. Seán Hurley, who went on to greater things in the Southern Health Board, the Irish Haemophilia Society, a principal officer of the Department of Health, Dr John O'Connor, and also Dr. Jimmy Walsh.  What do they say about the need for AIDS services?  I will refer to some relevant sections of their report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They said there seems to be a reluctance on the part of general practitioners to accommodate HIV positive persons with regular health checks.  The need for <Col N="545" /> additional counselling services was identified. They spoke about the prisons. Mountjoy Prison is not designed to treat HIV-AIDS prisoners.  There is only general practitioner service available there. There are difficulties in getting dental treatment for AIDS and HIV-positive prisoners. There is no liaison between the prison and the health and social welfare services. There is evidence of discrimination in the workplace in relation to accommodation for AIDS and HIV sufferers. The group recommend an integrated network of contact points to be established between the Departments of Health, Justice, Social Welfare and Labour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister looks at the front page of the report he will see that the group was established in February 1989 and reported later in the year.  The report is a little over a year old and its principal recommendations were not even mentioned in the speeches of the Minister or the Minister of State.  They have been ignored.  The group proposed an integrated network between Departments but that has not been set up.  It proposed an integrated model of care but that has not been set up.  It outlines the cost to future AIDS patients, at £35,000 a year.  On economics alone the reality is being ignored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group recommend that the Mater Hospital is the most appropriate location for the provision of the necessary services <Col N="546" /> and should actively participate in providing these services, but what has happened? In three years the Mater Hospital has not taken one step to set up an AIDS unit.  The Minister has tolerated the situation in which there is no AIDS facility except in St. James's Hospital.  The clear recommendation of the group is that the two hospitals mentioned are appropriate to provide the acute hospital services for AIDS on the most cost-effective basis. The report said that dentists and doctors who ignore AIDS patients, as is happening all over the country, should be dealt with by the medical and dental councils.  But the Minister did absolutely nothing in regard to that recommendation.</P>
    <P>In relation to prisoners, the group said that the position of prisoners with AIDS was a source of particular concern to them.  The problems were compounded by a further number of factors such as the segregation of AIDS prisoners, on which no action has been taken.  Neither has anything been done in regard to the fact that only general practitioner service is available in prisons.  The group recommended that specialist services for subacute treatment should be available as part of this arrangement, but nothing has been done in that regard.  It was also recommended that the Minister for Labour should set up an anti-discrimination code but that has not been done.  Therefore, the Minister should not come into this House and say that he is dealing with this disease or that, because, in the whole of Europe, Ireland is not worse than Greece, we do not have a problem.  We have a major problem as we do not know the level of HIV-positive sufferers in the community.  On voluntary testing alone the figure amounts to over 1,000 and it could be 3,000.  The figures are doubling every 14 months and the response is that there will be no change in the law regarding condoms.  The Minister lectured us on swimming pools, and the Progressive Democrats &mdash; who have opted out of this debate &mdash; are full of <Col N="547" /> bland generalities in favour of paying lipservice to the problem.</P>
    <P>We have put forward a response to deal with the problem in the same way TB was dealt with in the forties and fifties&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy John Bruton gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the position of Irish residents in Iraq and Kuwait in view of the impending UN Security Council resolution sanctioning force to end the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait.  Deputy Bruton has five minutes to present his case and the Minister for Foreign Affairs has five minutes to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears certain that the United Nations Security Council will tomorrow sanction a resolution which will allow all necessary means to be used to eject Iraqi occupation forces from the Emirate of Kuwait.  This essentially means that, as from 15 January next, United Nations forces or forces sanctioned by or with the consent of the United Nations will be able to claim the sanction of the United Nations to engage in military activities designed to eject the Iraqi forces from Kuwait.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That creates a serious situation from the point of view of the world at large but particularly from the point of view of the Irish people who still remain in Iraq and in Kuwait.  The Government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have shown an insufficient sense of urgency in seeking to have these people repatriated.  After all the German and French Governments who are among the nations that are actually ranged against Iraq, the ones for whom one would expect least concessions, as against Ireland who has not taken such a forward position, have been able to have their nationals brought home.  Meanwhile the Irish nationals remain.  There is a particular irony in the fact that Irish employees of a German company, Mannesmann, must remain while their employers, the people who would normally be responsible for getting <Col N="551" /> visas for them to come home, have gone home to Germany and are unable to do anything for their Irish employees still in Iraq.  That is most unfortunate for those people.  The position of PARC's Irish employees and, indeed, that of all the other Irish people who have been left in what may well soon become a war zone without any hope of coming home, is equally unfortunate.  As I said, I do not feel that the Government have shown they have the capacity to take effective action in this matter and it is for that reason I sought to raise it now.  I hope as a result of this debate the Minister may inject some greater degree of urgency to get these people home in view of the impending United Nations Resolution which is due to come into effect on 15 January, 1991.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Deputy Bruton for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  The Government fully share his concern for the safety and welfare of those Irish trapped in Iraq and Kuwait as a result of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.  The House can be assured that we are sparing no effort to secure the release of all our citizens and their early return home.  We can fully appreciate the sense of helplessness felt by those who have family members in these two countries. It is a matter of great concern that all those prevented from returning home should be enabled to do so at the earliest possible date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have on a number of occasions in this House detailed the comprehensive steps the Government have taken to ensure the safety and early release of those Irish citizens currently trapped in Iraq and Kuwait.  Everything in our power to secure the maximum possible number of exit visas for our people there is being done.  It must be remembered that it is not within our power to bring our citizens home without the agreement of the Iraqi <Col N="552" /> authorities.  The Ambassador in Baghdad, on my instructions, continues to bring all possible pressure to bear to achieve the release of our citizens.  I have raised this matter on two occasions with the Iraqi Ambassador to Ireland.  I informed the Ambassador that the refusal to allow Irish people to leave Iraq and Kuwait was unacceptable and a breach of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Iraq is a party.  We have consistently demanded that their rights under international law to travel freely and to leave Iraq and Kuwait for a destination of their choice must be restored.</P>
    <P>Since the invasion of Kuwait on 2 August all our efforts have been concentrated on getting over 400 citizens home as quickly as possible.  These efforts have resulted in 77 per cent or 90 citizens who were in Kuwait returning home safely.  Of the remaining 26 citizens, two men have secured exit visas and will leave shortly.  In addition, two women and three children could have availed of evacuation arrangements but have chosen, for the moment, to remain.  The other 19 men in Kuwait, of whom 16 are dual nationals, are free to leave for Iraq. We have advised them that while there are no guarantees of exit visas if they come to Baghdad, recent indications suggest that their chances of getting exit visas would be enhanced by their presence in that city.</P>
    <P>On 2 August we had almost 300 citizens living in Iraq, the largest group of whom were working for the PARC Hospital in Baghdad.  Exit visas have already been secured for 144 individuals.  There are now 154 citizens left in Iraq, of whom 14 have exit visas and should leave shortly.  The recently concluded agreement between PARC and the Iraqi Ministry of Health to allow the hospital services to be run down to a caretaker status by the middle of next month should result in the majority of those remaining in the hospital leaving that country within the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="553" /> Overall, 56 per cent or 233 citizens who were trapped in Kuwait and Iraq after the 2 August invasion are now home. We are hopeful that many more will be allowed to leave shortly and will be able to enjoy Christmas with their families.</P>
    <P>We continue to base our approach on the principle which has guided us throughout the crisis, namely, our insistence that Iraq complies fully with all Security Council Resolutions.  We hope that the international solidarity as manifested particularly in the Security Council and the effective implementation of the economic sanctions decided by the Security Council will force a reassessment in Baghdad of its current stance and will permit the crisis to be resolved without bloodshed.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, our fervent hope that the crisis can be resolved in a peaceful way without recourse to military force. Such an outcome would clearly be in the best interest of all concerned.</P>
    <P>Under Article 25 of the United Nations Charter, all United Nations members agree &ldquo;to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council&rdquo; in accordance with the Charter.  Ireland as a member of the United Nations accepts this obligation.  The charter goes on to specify further the kinds of measures that may be taken under it and the conditions under which they can be taken.</P>
    <P>The terms of the Security Council Resolution will not, of course, be known until the debate in that body is conducted and the resolution has been voted upon. While, therefore, we must await the conclusion of this process, it is my hope that Iraq will take very serious account of the fact that, in an unprecedented manner, as evidenced by the adoption of ten Security Council Resolutions, the international community in general has expressed its rejection of Iraq's invasion and annexation of Kuwait: the Security Council has also demanded that Iraq permit and facilitate the immediate departure from Kuwait and Iraq of all third state nationals who wish to leave and has <Col N="554" /> affirmed repeatedly that Iraq remains fully responsible for the safety and well being of foreign nationals in accordance with humanitarian law.</P>
    <P>Finally, the sense of tension, frustration and distress felt by the relatives of those Irish citizens still in Iraq and Kuwait is fully understood.  The House can rest assured that the Government will not cease their efforts to secure the early release of all our citizens in these countries and to press for a peaceful solution to this Gulf crisis.</P>

      <P>Deputy Jim Kemmy gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the collapse of the building firm of Fitzgerald and Dowling Limited, management contractors, at the Savoy Complex, Limerick, with the loss of 50 jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a sad and painful story that I have to relate here tonight concerning a building firm of management contractors, Fitzgerald and Dowling Limited.  They are different from the normal building firm.  This was a new concept for Limerick and, indeed, a new concept for Ireland because it was the first time the normal building contractor was not used.  They were set up as management contractors and subcontracted almost all the work &mdash; to more than 30 sub-contractors.  Indeed, they had the overall responsibility for carrying through the single biggest building project in the city centre of Limerick, namely, the Savoy Complex.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I mentioned, the company subcontracted all the work to more than 30 bona fide sub-contractors who supplied the labour and building materials.  The complex is almost complete and was officially opened some time ago with great ceremony, pomp and circumstance. <Col N="555" /> However, last week the company went into liquidation with debts of about £1.5 million, £1 million of which is due to 30 subcontractors, who are owed sums ranging from £20,000 to £175,000, and the rest to the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social Welfare and the workers concerned.  Many of these subcontractors, decent people, who pulled themselves up by their boot straps, worked very hard to establish themselves. They are now in a desperate plight, in an emotional state of insecurity and financial ruin.  Many will, undoubtedly, go out of business as a result. Employees have also suffered a loss of wages and holiday pay.  Pension, social welfare and income tax payments have not been returned to the appropriate bodies.  I have a P45 in my pocket which shows that, in the case of one of the employees who worked there for 28 weeks, &ldquo;nil&rdquo; was returned to the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare for his income tax payments and social welfare contributions.</P>
    <P>Other employees have great difficulty in obtaining their P45 because the office in Limerick has closed down.  There was no bonding involved, no guarantees or protection for the subcontractors or the workers concerned.  Despite the fact that it was a multi-million pound project in the centre of Limerick the company had no real assets.  The share capital in the company was £2 and there was nothing unusual about that but it was suspicious in the circumstances.  The plant and equipment for this multi-million pound complex was valued at only £500 on the list of liabilities.  The office furniture was valued at £10,000.  I see this as a betrayal of those 30 subcontractors and the 50 employees concerned who worked extremely hard.  It was reckless, irresponsible behaviour by the firm concerned for the livelihoods of those concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister has expressed his concern to me in private about this and I discussed the matter with him twice.  I <Col N="556" /> understand his concern very well because he also met the employees and the sub-contractors. Concern is not good enough. We must have action to seal off these loopholes and prevent this abuse.  I thought we were in the process of stopping this abuse but, apparently, new abuses crop up every day.  This is obviously a new one which requires new legislation.  I spoke to the Minister about this problem and perhaps he will reply to me tonight.  It should not be possible in this day and age for a contractor to do this to ordinary people.  It was an act of betrayal, the first time I have seen this type of behaviour here and I hope it will be the last.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have to point out to the Deputy in the first instance that, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, I have no specific function in relation to the particular operations of an individual building firm.  Only companies who are engaged in manufacturing activity or who provide a specified type of international service are grant-aided for industrial employment purposes.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding that, of course I am aware of some of the circumstances of this case and of the deep upset which has been caused to the individuals and companies who may have lost substantial sums of money arising therefrom.</P>
      <P>I would stress at this stage that it would be inappropriate to make definitive statements in the light of our current state of knowledge, and it is in any event a matter for the liquidator of the company to decide what future action should be taken.  Of course, should it be established that there were any transactions of a criminal nature, these would have to be pursued by the Fraud Squad.</P>
      <P>In relation to the general principles involved, of late much attention has focused on the role of the Examiner in relation to rescues in recent legislation. However, it may be relevant to elaborate somewhat on the concepts of fraudulent trading and reckless trading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 33 of the 1990 Act introduced <Col N="557" /> the concept of reckless trading in the context of the new rescue mechanisms which I have just adverted to.  Section 136 of the main Companies Bill also provides for its introduction in the context of the winding up of a company.</P>
    <P>Section 297 of the Companies Act, 1963 already contains a civil sanction for fraudulent trading, by giving the court power to impose unlimited liability on any person whom it considers to have been involved in the carrying on of business in such a way.</P>
    <P>Section 297 however, has been criticised because of the standard of proof which it is considered would be required in such a case.  The argument is that, even apart from the considerable difficulty of proving intent to defraud in its own right, that difficulty is worsened by the likelihood of criminal standards of proof being required, even in civil cases.</P>
    <P>Thus, it is fairly widely held by those who specialise in the winding-up of companies that section 297, as it currently stands, is deficient and has little deterrent effect.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the received wisdom is that those liquidators and creditors entitled to do so are reluctant to embark on civil proceedings, with the result that few persons are ever made personally liable for the debts created by means of fraudulent trading.</P>
    <P>In an effort to tackle the deficiencies in the existing law, to facilitate court proceedings and, where appropriate, to encourage liquidators and creditors to take civil proceedings, the approach adopted in sections 135 and 136 of the Bill is to separate clearly the civil and criminal elements of section 297 of the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>In regard to the criminal sanction, I should just like to mention that, on Report Stage in the Dáil last week, I moved an amendment which will allow criminal proceedings for fraudulent trading to be taken under section 135 even where a company is not being wound up.  This reflects the wider approach accepted by <Col N="558" /> the Oireachtas in examinership cases under section 34 of the 1990 Act.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, civil liability for fraudulent trading is now contained separately in section 136 of the present Bill but the section goes further, however, and will extend the scope of potential civil liability to cover reckless trading as well.  When the Bill was originally published, there was no attempt in that section to define what was meant by trading in a reckless manner, and the provision was, perhaps rightly, criticised on that account.  However, the provisions were considerably amended in the Seanad, and these amendments, among other things, effectively crystallised a definition of the term.</P>
    <P>None of the foregoing should be construed as implying that there were any such improprieties in the case which is the subject of the motion tonight, but to the extent that what may have happened to the company or indeed to those who may have traded with them reflects any weakness in existing company legislation I want to assure the House that I am determined to rectify the situation, and soon.</P>
    <P>It was my intention to have the Bill finally passed today but, unfortunately, it was not possible for one of the Opposition parties to agree to that.  I understand that the arrangement now is that it will be passed through this House on this day week.  That is not before its time.  It will be generally welcomed because the matter raised tonight by Deputy Kemmy is one of many examples we have which could be more fully dealt with if this long awaited legislation was passed.</P>

      <P>Deputy Eric Byrne gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter as to the practice of the Department of Social Welfare to substantially reduce the unemployment assistance of <Col N="559" /> single persons living at home on the basis that they are receiving board and lodgings from their families, the pressure this is exerting on young people to leave the family home and, in some cases, emigrate.  I think Deputy Byrne knows the procedure.  He has some five minutes to make his case and the Minister, or the Minister of State, has five minutes to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for choosing me from your list.  The policy of the Department of Social Welfare in regard to the payment of unemployment assistance to single people who are living at home is leading to the break-up of families and encouraging young people to emigrate.  Under the Department of Social Welfare rules single unemployed persons living with their families are considered to be receiving free board and lodgings and their unemployment assistance is assessed accordingly.  In some cases unemployment assistance, which would normally be approximately £40 per week for an adult, is being reduced in many cases because of changing circumstances in the family to as little as 80p per week or nothing at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would appear there are no standard guidelines as to what constitutes the value placed on board and lodging.  It can vary greatly depending on the attitude of the relevant social welfare officer.  In my constituency, for example, there appears to be a particular blitz &mdash; presumably at the behest of the Department &mdash; which is aimed primarily at single people living at home.  I have received many complaints in the past few weeks from those who found their unemployment assistance drastically reduced.  This policy results in many young people &mdash; and many who are not so young &mdash; being left penniless and puts great stress on family relationships. As a result young people who wish to remain in the family home are forced <Col N="560" /> to leave in order to ensure some independent income by being reassessed outside the family home minus the board and lodging clause.  Indeed, in some cases young people are opting to emigrate.  It is ironic that this is being done by Fianna Fáil, the party who have always put themselves forward as defender of the family.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>In the social welfare area they are pursuing a policy which is anti-family. I urge the Minister for Social Welfare to review this policy and implement the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.  They recommended that single applicants for unemployment assistance between the ages of 18 and 25 years should be entitled to a standard allowance irrespective of household circumstances or parental means.</P>
      <P>How can the Department of Social Welfare put a value on board and lodgings when a family living in, say, Dublin south inner city, north inner city, Sheriff Street, Oliver Bond Street or St. Theresa's Gardens have a low standard of living while those living in Howth, Dalkey or Foxrock have a high standard of living?  I would argue that we should not put a value on board and lodgings but that we should be giving a basic minimum entitlement to all people over 18 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is absolutely absurd to think that people are forced out of the family unit because of these ridiculous policies. These people can go from relative luxury or relative poverty, as the case may be, to private rented accommodation.  Perhaps in some cases they will qualify for local authority accommodation with all the costs involved in that.  They will be eligible to receive a rent subsidy if they are in private rented accommodation and also by right qualify for an allowance from the State through unemployment assistance.  All this can be done with the stroke of a pen just because an individual <Col N="561" /> has decided to vacate the family home. This is illogical.  I plead with the Minister to convey to the Cabinet the need for a basic minimum income for all people.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to reply to Deputy Byrne.  The purpose of the unemployment assistance scheme is to help unemployed persons without means or with limited means to provide for themselves and their dependent families until such time as they find work or otherwise acquire an adequate source of income.  I need not remind Deputy Byrne that this scheme is financed by the taxpayer out of the Exchequer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The requirement to take account of board and lodgings is provided for in the Social Welfare Acts and has been a feature of the unemployment assistance scheme since its inception.  The justification for this is that any non-cash benefit or privilege which one applicant would have over another by reason of the fact that he or she is living <Col N="562" /> at home should be taken into account in assessing entitlement.</P>
      <P>While it would be much simpler and administratively advantageous not to do this it can be argued that it would be unfair and an inefficient use of resources to treat applicants for unemployment assistance from well-to-do households in the same fashion as those whose parents are in poorer circumstances.  People on unemployment assistance are expected to actively seek work which is suited to their level of skill, age and other factors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>An applicant who resides at home has a good permanent base from which to do this and thus he or she has certain advantages over one who resides in a rented abode and who may be forced for financial reasons to change from one place to another.  I find it hard to understand how the Deputy maintains that it is those applicants living with their families who are most likely to emigrate.  I would have thought the opposite.</P>
      <P>The amount assessed against an applicant arising out of his or her residence free of charge at the family home or with other relatives is determined by a deciding officer in the first instance and is based on a practice which has been confirmed over the years by appeals officers.  The Deputy may know that deciding officers and appeals officers are statutory officers who have always acted independently of the Minister of the day and of pressures which can arise from time to time.  While there was never any doubt about this independence the Minister for Social Welfare has taken measures to ensure that it will be more obvious to all by having the appeals system established as an independent office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In making their assessment in respect of board and lodgings enjoyed by applicants free of charge, whether in the family home or elsewhere, deciding <Col N="563" /> officers and appeals officers in the interests of fairness, have to take account of the overall level of income enjoyed by the family in question.  Generally speaking the value of the benefit to such an applicant would vary with the overall level of that income.  I am satisfied that in all such cases deciding officers and appeals officers strive to be fair in their assessments.  Any changes in relation to the assessment of the value of free board and lodgings would have to be considered within a budgetary context having regard to competing pressures for additional social welfare spending on other improvements.  In this connection I should like to point out that it was estimated some years ago that the cost of the abolition of the board and lodging provision would then have been over £21 million per annum.</P>

      <P>Deputy Byrne who is not too long in the House made a statement that Fianna Fáil have been putting themselves forward as the defender of the family.  I want to say to the Deputy that not alone have we defended the family but we have supported the family and brought forward a tranche of progressive social legislation, second to none in Europe and throughout the world, which has protected the rights of the family.</P>

I propose to call on Deputy Michael Finucane to make a one minute statement appropriate to the Minister for Agriculture and Food, in the first instance, to be followed, by a statement appropriate to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.

      <P>My question to the Minister for Agriculture and Food relates to the famous disadvantaged areas extension. A statement was recently issued that the proposed appeals system would only extend to 1.5 per cent of the entire country.  If this is true it will be a derisory extension.  I ask the Minister to clarify whether this is actually true.  Rumours are now prevailing that it is possible it may be more than 1.5 per cent.  I would appreciate it if the Minister would clarify that point.  When does the Minister anticipate the disadvantaged areas extension will be finally approved by the EC?</P>

      <P>As the Minister for Industry and Commerce is probably aware, I live in Newcastlewest and I am very much aware of the lack of industrial development in that area.  Since 1979 Newcastlewest, the county capital, has <Col N="565" /> not received any overseas industrial project. The people of Newcastlewest welcomed the announcements over a period by SFADCo &mdash; these announcements appeared in the local media &mdash; that the Bartizan Corporation, an American engineering company, would set up a project in one of the advance factories in Newcastlewest and that Gogi, an English company, would set up a knitwear project in the other advance factory.</P>
      <P>Those factories have been enhanced and refurbished in recent times to the tune of £350,000 to make them aesthetically more pleasing to industrialists. I want to ask the Minister when those promises will come right?  Can he clarify when those projects will start in Newcastlewest, if they will start and when recruitment of workers will commence?</P>

      <P>The results of the 1989 survey constitute both the largest extension and reclassification of our disadvantaged areas ever proposed to the EC.  Almost 2 million acres are being proposed for extension compared to the previous largest extension of only 415,000 acres.  The proposed reclassification of 1½ million acres approximately is almost twice the previous largest proposal for reclassification of 869,000 acres.</P>
      <P>We are asking the EC Commission to allow us to introduce an appeals procedure to deal with genuine anomalies and are seeking EC approval to be allowed to add up to 1½ per cent of the country &mdash; 255,000 acres &mdash; to our disadvantaged areas by Commission procedure without having to go to the EC Council of Ministers. The 1½ per cent is the limit allowed under EC legislation for this purpose. This approach is in line with the commitment given in the Programme for Government in September 1989.  Until our submission is approved, however, it would not be possible to set up an effective appeals system or decide its terms of reference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="566" /> In this regard, Deputies can rest assured that we will continue to press our case with the EC to set up an appeals procedure as soon as approval is obtained.  I might add that, while the EC services have limited staff resources and are also under pressure arising from submissions from other member states, they have made substantial progress and expect to complete their examination of the technical aspects of our case in the very near future to clear the way for a proposal to be put to the Council of Ministers to secure their approval for the proposed 12 per cent extension of our areas.</P>

      <P>In December 1988, Shannon Development approved an offer of grant assistance to Bartizan Corporation to establish a credit card imprinter manufacturing operation at Newcastlewest, County Limerick. However, early in 1989, there was a worldwide fall in demand for Bartizan's products for several months when the company decided that the proposed manufacture of the credit cards would not be financially viable and could not be justified.</P>
      <P>However, Bartizan decided to proceed with a smaller project than originally envisaged.  Shannon Development approved new industry, rent reduction and training grants in July 1990.  Discussions with Shannon Development and the IDA are continuing with a view to Bartizan finalising a decision in the near future to establish in Newcastlewest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the Gogi factory, Shannon Development have informed me that they approved a grant aid package in December 1989 for a project to be undertaken by UK firm Gogi Brothers Knitwear for Newcastlewest, County Limerick.  It was intended that the project would start up in 1990.  However, due to problems encountered by the firm in sourcing production equipment, allied with a need to firm up on market outlets <Col N="567" /> in some European countries, the promoters notified Shannon Development that they were delaying start-up of the project.  Efforts by Shannon Development to get the promoters to sign legal agreements have not been successful and they have recently contacted the promoters and informed them that if a formal response was not received from them, it would have to be assumed that the project is not going ahead and <Col N="568" /> that the reservation on the building would have to be released.</P>

      <P>Since 1987 a significant proportion of motorists are renewing their motor tax through the post.  The vehicle registration unit of my Department send a reminder notice to each vehicle owner about two weeks in advance of the expiry of existing tax disc.  This notice can be used as a tax renewal form and it contains preprinted details of the vehicle, including the appropriate quarterly, half-yearly and annual rate of tax.  The form is accompanied by a post-paid reply envelope, addressed to the local motor tax office.</P>
      <P>In view of the extent to which these new arrangements are being availed of, I do not propose to sanction the provision of motor tax branch offices.</P>

As housing does not come within the competence of the EC, it is a matter for each member <Col N="421" /> state to implement its housing policies appropriate to its circumstances.

    <P>A further meeting of Housing Ministers has been arranged by the Italian Presidency for 5-7 December in Milan and it is my intention to attend.  No formal agenda for the meeting has yet been received but the Presidency has indicated that the discussions will relate to a number of areas, including methods of quantifying housing requirements of the disadvantaged, possible new initiatives, the provision of suitable accommodation and arrangements for better exchange of information in relation to housing.</P>

      <P>The urban renewal scheme has been particularly successful in encouraging private sector investment in designated areas.  In these areas, projects with an estimated value of £64 million have been completed while projects with an estimated value of £152 million are in progress.  Further projects with an estimated value of some £190 million are at planning stage.</P>
      <P>In order to build on the success of the scheme, I announced on 1 May last details of extensions of the existing designated areas of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway as well as new designations in the towns of Ballina, Bray, Carlow, Clonmel, Drogheda, Ennis, Longford and Portlaoise.  Earlier this year, the time limit for the urban renewal tax incentives was extended by two years to 31 May 1993.</P>
      <P>Last year a new scheme of urban renewal grants was introduced to finance local authority works directed at upgrading the general environment of the designated areas.  These works are designed to complement private sector development already undertaken and to enhance the possibilities of further developments. A sum of £2.5 million has been provided for these grants in 1990.</P>

      <P>At present compulsory annual roadworthiness testing applies to about 46,000 heavy goods vehicles and trailers, buses, ambulances and taxis over one year old.  A step by step approach to the extension of compulsory testing to other categories of vehicles is favoured.  Under EC Directive 88/449/EEC of 26 July 1988, I will shortly make regulations requiring the compulsory testing of light goods vehicles over four years old every two years.  This extension will be phased in over two years, starting on 1 January 1994.  About 38,000 light goods vehicles will be affected.</P>
      <P>A draft EC Directive on compulsory testing of private cars would require that cars over five years old should be tested every two years.  I am keeping the question of compulsory car testing under review in the light of relevant developments, including those at EC level.</P>

    <P>The extension of the Wyckham by-pass from Sandyford Road to Taney Road, has not been approved for road grant purposes because it was considered that the benefits in terms of reducing traffic flow through Dundrum Main Street would not warrant the level of expenditure that would be involved.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 56 and 113 together.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware of the difficulties with water supplies in the Dublin area.  My Department has been in close contact about the situation with the local authorities concerned, who are of course responsible for the provision and management of water supplies.</P>
      <P>Work is in progress on a major scheme to increase the water production capacity of the Ballymore Eustace treatment plant.  In addition, I have recently approved a preliminary report to improve the efficiency of the Vartry water supply treatment plant.  As well as long term proposals, this report includes short term measures that will allow the Vartry treatment plant to improve the quality and quantity of water production.  My Department has asked Dublin Corporation to expedite the planning of these proposals so that work can commence as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Construction work is expected to commence in 1991 on the north city arterial main scheme from Binns Bridge to Dollymount <Col N="430" /> together with watermain replacement and reservoir construction in the Howth area.  These projects when completed will significantly improve water supply on the Northside of Dublin.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the private sector in the construction industry is no longer building low cost housing for sale; that real demand has now dramatically increased for this type of housing; the action, if any, he proposes to take to promote such house construction, having regard to the cessation of the local authority house building programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Private housing completions this year are showing an increase of some 7 per cent compared to 1989.  The price mix of these new houses should generally reflect the nature of demand in the market.  It should be noted, however, that large numbers of starter type houses have been provided over the past 20 years and now form a big element of the housing stock.  The availability of these starter type houses on the second-hand market is at present meeting much of the demand referred to in the question.  This is borne out by the fact that, in 1989, 28 per cent of second hand houses for which loans were advanced were priced below £25,000 and a further 18 per cent were priced between £25,000 and £30,000.</P>
      <P>I would also point out that there has been a substantial increase in the level of the local authority house building programme in 1990 as a result of the increased capital provision.  Additionally the voluntary housing programme has been further increased this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The method used by the CSO in compiling the Live Register has not been changed over the past six years.</P>
      <P>The Live Register consists of the following classes of persons under 65 years of age who are registered at local offices of the Department of Social Welfare: (1)  All claimants for unemployment benefit (UB) excluding systematic short-time workers; (2)  Applicants for unemployment assistance (UA) other than smallholders and, (3)  Other registrants, including applicants for credited social welfare contributions but excluding those directly involved in an industrial dispute.</P>
      <P>This was the coverage recommended in the report of the Interdepartmental Study Group on Unemployment Statistics (Prl. 7925, April 1979) and which has since been maintained unaltered.</P>
      <P>The following administrative changes, made since January 1985, have impacted on the Live Register: Equality of treatment between men and women in social security was provided for by the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1985 which was introduced in two phases:</P>
      <P>(a)  Phase 1 came into operation on 15 May 1986 and provided, <i>inter alia,</i> for the duration of unemployment benefit for married women to be extended from 312 days to 390 days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  Phase 2 came into operation from 19 November 1986 and provided, <i>inter alia,</i> that married women could <Col N="441" /> claim unemployment assistance in their own right.  Previously, married women could claim UA in exceptional circumstances only.</P>
    <P>The impact of these changes would be to increase the number of women on the Live Register; but the precise effect cannot be quantified.</P>
    <P>A number of initiatives enabling unemployed claimants to participate in education courses were introduced. Participants in the following three education schemes are not included in the Live Register:</P>
    <P>(a)  The educational opportunities scheme was introduced in 1986 on a pilot basis to allow certain recipients of unemployment assistance to further their education at second level.  It was launched on an extended basis as the vocational training opportunities scheme in October 1989.  The current level of participation in the scheme is 660.</P>
    <P>(b)  The vocational preparation and training programme was introduced in October 1990 in co-operation with the City of Dublin Vocational Education Colleges.  The current level of participation in the scheme is 200.</P>
    <P>(c)  the third level allowance for the unemployed was introduced, on a pilot basis, in October 1990 for those who wish to participate in third level education.  The current level of participation in the scheme is 66.</P>
    <P>The part-time job incentive scheme was introduced initially on a pilot basis in August 1986.  It was extended in December 1986 and was further extended in May 1988.  This scheme allows certain unemployed people to take up part-time employment and continue to get a special allowance.  Participants are not included in the Live Register.  The current level of participation in the scheme is 280.</P>
    <P>The pre-retirement allowance scheme (PRETA) was established by section 28 of the Social Welfare Act, 1988 but not introduced until 29 March 1990 when a commencement order was made.  Under <Col N="442" /> the scheme, which is optional, persons in receipt of long term unemployment assistance who are aged 60 years or over and who declare they have retired from the labour market are taken off UA and are paid a pre-retirement allowance.  Payment is made by payable order book at the local post office.  At the end of October there were 4,537 PRETA recipients.</P>
    <P>From 2 August 1990 persons aged 60 years and over who were signing for credits only were given the option of declaring that they were retired and no longer available for employment.  Participants no longer have to attend at the local office or signing centre to prove employment. Instead, they make a yearly declaration of retirement on the basis of which credited contributions are awarded to them.  At the end of October 1990 there were 2,536 pre-retirement credits scheme recipients.</P>
    <P>The widower's pension and deserted husband's allowance scheme was introduced from 1 October 1989 under section 6 of the Social Welfare Act 1989.  The level of participation in this scheme is negligible.</P>
    <P>Variations in the number of places available on certain employment and training schemes administered by FÁS and the Department of Labour also have an effect on the Live Register figures.</P>

      <P>The national fuel scheme applies to persons in receipt of long term social welfare or health board payments.  The person concerned is in receipt of disability benefit since 14 April 1989.  This is not a qualifying payment for the purposes of the national fuel scheme and he is not, therefore, entitled to a fuel allowance under that scheme.</P>
      <P>However, under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, local health boards provide assistance towards heating needs in exceptional circumstances. It is understood that the local health board did provide such assistance to the person concerned last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Flynn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to see a fire alarm such as a smoke detector in every home, including mobile homes and caravans. These devices provide an early warning of fire, and particularly where occupants are asleep, they can play a major role in saving lives and property.</P>
      <P>However, I am firmly convinced that people should be encouraged to install fire alarms, rather than that an attempt should be made to make their provision compulsory.  Responsibility for ensuring that a home is safe from fire rests with the householder.  A householder who installs a smoke detector by choice is likely to be far more conscious of the value of fire safety than someone who installs one only because he is forced to do so.  In my view, it is better to convince householders of the value of domestic fire alarms by advice and publicity.</P>
      <P>On numerous occasions, I have publicly advocated the provision of smoke detectors as a valuable protection against death and injury by fire.  A number of publicity campaigns to highlight the advantages of smoke detectors in homes have been run by the National Safety Council.  The council has just produced a special leaflet entitled &ldquo;Fire Safety for the Travelling Community&rdquo; which contains detailed advice on particular aspects of fire safety in caravans, including the desirability of having a smoke alarm.  The leaflet is being distributed with the assistance of local authority fire officers, social workers and other persons who work with the travelling community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In November 1989, my Department wrote to all housing authorities reminding them of the need for adequate fire safety precautions in local authority houses.  A schedule of fire safety measures designed to assist them in the planning of new housing schemes and, where applicable, in the planning of refurbishment work under the remedial works scheme, was also sent to them.  The importance of smoke detector alarms was emphasised and local authorities were requested to take steps to encourage tenants to install and keep such devices in <Col N="452" /> good working order.  In addition, authorities were requested to advise their tenants on fire precaution measures applicable to the type of dwellings they occupy.  Special guidelines have been issued to authorities in respect of demountable dwellings, including a recommendation that, for which dwellings, suitable smoke detectors should be provided.  The question of requiring the provision of smoke alarms in new houses is being considered in the context of the making of building regulations.</P>
    <P>I have no function in regard to the Industrial Research and Standards (Fire Safety) (Domestic Furniture) Order, 1988.  However, I am informed that under the provisions of the order it is illegal to manufacture, assemble or sell furniture for domestic use unless it complies with specific flammability and labelling requirements.  These requirements also apply to furniture that is ordinarily intended to be affixed to and to form part of a caravan.</P>

      <P>The detailed administrative arrangements for the issue of driving licences are primarily a matter for the licensing authority concerned.</P>
      <P>The Euro model driving licence introduced on 13 November 1989 incorporates security features which increased the processing time for each licence.  Dublin Corporation envisage that the backlog of applications for licences will be eliminated by the end of next month as a result of the filling of vacant posts, the redeployment of staff and overtime work.</P>
      <P>The position will be further improved early in 1991 as the administrative benefits of the new ten year licence begin to take effect and the volume of annual licence applications is significantly reduced.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are also being made to speed up the processing of individual driving licence applications by computerisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
