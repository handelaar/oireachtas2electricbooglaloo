      <P>I tabled a question to the Taoiseach for answer today, to ask him whether he had personally intervened in the matter of the sale of Cablelink and I received a letter from you, Sir, dated 3 May informing me that the question was disallowed on the grounds that it contains argument.  I submit to you that my question contains no argument, no allegation, no inference, no imputation of any kind. It simply seeks information.</P>

      <P>This was a special one-day meeting of the Council, convened in addition to the formal meeting to be held on 25-26 June next.  The practice, followed at the regular formal meetings of the Council, of the Head of State of the Presidency country hosting a lunch for participants on the first day of a two-day meeting did not, therefore, arise.  The usual practice for the President's lunch will, of course, be followed at the formal June Summit.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister of State agree that there is a substantial number of spouses whose husbands are compelled to work in England and the US and the fact that we do not know how many is a serious defect and indicates that our database is totally inadequate from the point of view of formulating social policy?</P>

      <P>It is extremely difficult to extract the type of information the Deputy was referring to.  Indeed, in the absence of such procedures the only reliable estimates are those from net emigration, the difference between inward and outward flows between successive censes of population.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State not agree that it should be relatively easy to introduce some type of simple procedure whereby somebody intending to emigrate would notify some recognised official agency and on return again notify this agency so that we would be in a position to compile accurate statistics in relation to (a) the number of people who have emigrated and (b) the number of people who are here as dependants. The absence of that procedure is an acknowledgment on the part of the Government that they do not wish to know the facts in relation to emigration.</P>

      <P>Questions Nos. 2 and 3 related to the Summit that was held the week before last and, in the course of his reply the Taoiseach referred to the Summit to be held in June.  I tabled two questions for answer by the Taoiseach today, one related to the letter from Chancellor Kohl and President Mitterrand about Lithuania, and I asked him if he had been consulted about it.  The second question asked the Taoiseach whether it was the Government's intention to submit a paper to the Summit in June about political union.  Both questions were transferred by the Taoiseach to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  It seems to me that they are essentially matters for the Taoiseach to answer because they relate to Government business and yet he had been transferred.  I understand it is not the function of the Chair to transfer questions.</P>

      <P>I <Col N="840" /> propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 8, 9, 14, 24, 32, and 40 together.</P>
      <P>As I informed the House during the debates on the Defence (Amendment) Bill, 1990, the first election of representatives of personnel of the Permanent Defence Force will be conducted under the general supervision of the principal officer in charge of the franchise section of the Department of the Environment. He will determine, on the basis of submissions from interested parties, the procedures for the election of representatives.</P>
      <P>Immediately the Bill was enacted &mdash; on 11 April 1990 &mdash; the head of the franchise section invited submissions from individuals and groups of individuals within the Permanent Defence Force on the structures &mdash; associations &mdash; into which representatives will be elected; the electoral system to be used; the constituencies to which the election will relate; the number of representatives to be elected; arrangements for the conduct of the elections; and any other relevant matter.  Submissions are to be forwarded to him by tomorrow, 9 May 1990.</P>
      <P>To facilitate the making of submissions and in order that elections can be held at the earliest possible date, the franchise officer had a number of discussions with representatives of the three teams comprising officers, non-commissioned officers and privates which were set up in connection with the Gleeson Commission as well as with representatives of PDFORRA.</P>
      <P>The formation of associations has the full support of the military authorities. They have welcomed the new development and have encouraged the members of the Defence Forces to promote support for the electoral process.  In keeping with the best traditions of the military authorities, once the Oireachtas has made known its intentions they will be implemented.</P>
      <P>I can assure the House that the arrangements are proceeding as planned and, subject to what emerges from the submissions which are due tomorrow, I am hopeful that the elections will be held during the month of June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="841" /> When the duly elected representatives emerge from the first election I will meet them and the detailed arrangements will be worked out in discussions between them and representatives of my Department before the associations are formally established and before the Defence Force Regulations are made.  These regulations will be published.</P>
    <P>Deputies may rest assured that the undertakings given by me in this House during the debates on the Bill will be honoured in full.</P>

If they are, will the Minister outline their brief?</P>

I welcome the Minister's undertaking in the House in regard to this but I should like him to ensure that his views, and those of Opposition Members, percolate to the highest levels of the Army and down through the system.  He should ensure that there is full consultation because that is important.

Because of the considerable investment involved in the training of apprentices it is necessary to require those who qualify as technicians to serve in the Permanent Defence Force for a reasonable period on completion of training.

If they were given the choice of opting out at 25 years of age as opposed to &mdash; on average &mdash; 27 years of age will the Minister agree that it could <Col N="847" /> be a very useful way of reducing the flow of apprentices from the Defence Forces?

All these trends started in the current year's expenditure where we have concentrated on the purchase of equipment and mechanised vehicles to a very large extent and the closing of Collins Barracks in Dublin which was superfluous to requirements. We are moving in the direction of having more responsive and mobile Armed Forces.  This cannot be done overnight but, broadly speaking, that is the concept.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Commencing on 15 March 1990 the Minister of State at my Department made an official visit extending over a period of twelve days to Irish troops serving with the United Nations in the Middle East, including Lebanon and Cyprus.  He spent four days with the Irish contingent of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, and saw at first hand the conditions under which Irish troops are required to operate.  He was satisfied that, despite the generally unsatisfactory situation in South Lebanon, the presence of UNIFIL affords protection and humanitarian assistance to the local population and provides a relative stability and sense of security.</P>
      <P>The safety and welfare of Irish personnel are a source of constant concern to the Government.  We will continue to monitor developments in Lebanon very closely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="859" /> While in Beirut, the Minister of State met the Lebanese Minister of Defence, Dr. Albert Mansour, and a number of senior officials.  During discussions, he raised the case of Brian Keenan, who has been held hostage in Lebanon since 1986. He asked the Lebanese authorities for their assistance in establishing Mr. Keenan's whereabouts or any other information which might be of assistance in securing his release.</P>
    <P>In interviews with local news media, the Minister stressed the concern of the Keenan family and appealed for information which might assist in securing Mr. Keenan's freedom.  As the House will be aware Government efforts to secure the release of Mr. Keenan are a matter of top priority.</P>
    <P>In the course of his visit to UNIFIL, the Minister met the Force Commander, Lieutenant-General Wahlgren and discussed the security of the Irish battalion with particular reference to the relocation of battalion headquarters and the redeployment of personnel.  He also meet the Muktar of Tibnin and representatives of Amal.</P>
    <P>The Minister then travelled to Cyprus where he spent two days visiting UNFICYP. He paid courtesy calls on the Cypriot Minister for Defence, the Force Commander and Chief of Staff of UNFICYP and the Special Representative in Cyprus of the UN Secretary-General.</P>
    <P>The Minister also went to Syria for a three-day visit.  He visited UN observation posts on the Golan Heights and met the Commander of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force &mdash; UNDOF and the Syrian Minister for Defence.  Before the Minister left Cyprus for Syria he had asked the Syrian Ambassador in Cyprus to contact his Defence Minister in order that some positive information on Brian Keenan would be available when they met in Damascus. In the event, the Minister of State was informed that Mr. Keenan was alive.</P>
    <P>I would like to avail of this opportunity to pay tribute to the dedication and courage of all Irish personnel serving with <Col N="860" /> the United Nations.  They are a credit to Ireland and to the Defence Forces.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Minister in commending our Defence Force personnel serving overseas.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs has been raising that matter with the Secretary General of the United Nations; that is where the difficulty lies in that respect.  Repayments have increased recently as the Soviet Union and the United States endeavour to catch up on their defaults in payments over the years to the United Nations.  Therefore these moneys are coming on stream at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

      <P>I join the Minister in his tribute to our forces serving overseas with UNIFIL.  Has the Minister any plans for a visit to them on the part of the spokespersons of the other parties?  Does he not think such a visit would be of immense value to the spokespersons of the other parties and indeed to the morale of the Army personnel?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, that idea was mooted earlier this year. Then the security position there blew up, <Col N="861" /> which sometimes, unfortunately, happens in that part of the world.  The matter is still under consideration and is one for discussion between the Whips.  Indeed I spoke to the Government Chief Whip about that only today.</P>

      <P>As part of the reply which indicates the age profile of the main categories of vehicles comprising the Defence Forces transport fleet is in the form of a tabular statement, I propose to circulate it in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>A programme for the modernisation of the Defence Force transport fleet commenced in 1988.  The programme is based on the disposal of obsolete and unserviceable vehicles and their replacement on a phased basis by new vehicles.</P>
      <P>It is intended that about 130 new vehicles will be acquired during 1990 and that further vehicles will be purchased in subsequent years as financial resources permit.</P>

There are eight in total of which six remain, leaving aside the two involved in the accidents.  They were all purchased in 1973.  Therefore, a case can be made for looking into the matter thoroughly and this is why the courts of inquiry were set up.  I have ordered them to go into this matter very thoroughly because <i>prima facie</i> it is disturbing that two accidents should occur so quickly involving two separate aircraft.</P>

I know we are only four or five months into the year but there has been only one application for the current year.  There was certainly a rush last year.  I hope morale has improved.  My information is that it has. With the institution of the representative bodies I feel that there will be greater understanding and consensus within the Defence Forces generally.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That would depend on the category.  We are very chary about granting release to pilots.  After very complex and detailed training there is an obligation to the State and to the taxpayer and it is only right and proper that following such expensive training a pilot should be retained for a reasonable period.

      <P>First, I am taking the question addressed to the Taoiseach in the name of Deputy Peter Barry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach, in view of the proposed meetings between the Unionist parties in the North and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, if it is the Government's intention to agree to a suspension of the Anglo-Irish Conference or the removal of the Secretariat from Maryfield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he has been consulted regarding the proposed talks between the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and Unionist leaders; and the concessions his Government are prepared to make to ensure progress in those discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to take both questions together.  We have, of course, been consulted about these talks and in the interest of securing progress have been as helpful as we can in regard to them.  I can assure <Col N="879" /> Deputies that the suspension of the Conference and the removal of the Secretariat are not in question.  However, it is important for all concerned, with a view to being constructive, to be careful about what is said on the subject at this time, when active efforts are being made to get a process of dialogue going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply and accept his view on the necessity to be careful about the words we use.  Would he agree that it is not helpful that additional blocks are put in place any time slight progress is made along the road by way of additional conditions under which certain people may take part in talks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we should all concentrate on endeavouring to remove barriers and blocks, and indeed that is the spirit that prevails throughout Europe at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>As it has never been claimed that the Anglo-Irish Agreement was an end in itself or a final agreement, and all sides appear to be saying that something better can be put in its place, can I ask the Taoiseach if at this point he accepts that there are obstacles preventing the Unionists coming to talks and if he and the Government are prepared to take some steps to remove those obstacles?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, the Deputy will know that I have said in this House on a number of occasions that the Government are committed to continuing to work the agreement fully until it is transcended by a new and more comprehensive arrangement.  The answer to the Deputy is inherent in my reply in which I said that we have, of course, been consulted about the talks and, in the interests of securing progress, we have been as helpful as we can.  I think the Deputy will know what I mean by that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Taoiseach's statement that he wants to be as <Col N="880" /> helpful as he possibly can, would he not accept that at this time the Irish Government should agree to a suspension of the Anglo-Irish Secretariat for a predetermined time to allow talks to get under way and, in the event of those talks failing, that the agreement would be recommenced at a fixed time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Bearing in mind, as the Taoiseach has said, the need for sensitivity in the current situation, would he acknowledge that the requirement by the Unionist parties for the suspension of the conferences and the removal of the Maryfield Secretariat is not a new requirement; it is not a requirement which they have announced recently but has been one of their conditions for some considerable time?  Would the Taoiseach indicate that it is a question on which the door is not closed but is one that can be considered at some future time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have advised the Deputy before that I do not think he should take upon himself the role of interpreting for me the wishes of the Unionists. I have time and again asked that they would convey these concerns to myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that the statement made by him and by others in this House and a similar statement made by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to the effect that the two Governments are prepared to contemplate the possibility of another agreement which, in the Taoiseach's own words, would transcend the present agreement is not in itself a very substantial political move which would be recognised by the other parties to these talks as being a very clear earnest of the constructive intention of all the parties concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a very clear indication of our respective positions and, as I read the newspapers, it has <Col N="881" /> been welcomed as such by the Unionist representatives.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the position outlined by the Taoiseach, which amounts to a negative response to the request made by Unionist leaders at the weekend, is he now confident that the talks will take place between the Unionist leaders and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in those circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope they will.  I would certainly rebut any suggestion of a negative attitude on our part.  As I have said in my reply, and I would like to reiterate it, in the interests of securing progress we have been as helpful as we can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach accept that the political movement we are currently witnessing in Northern Ireland is of such a fragile and sensitive nature that it has to be very carefully nurtured and that all of us in this House should be extremely careful in what we have to say in relation to it because, while there are some people in Northern Ireland who are prepared to put their political necks on the line in order to find political accommodation, there are others clearly who would like nothing better than something said in this House or outside it, in the Republic, which could be used as an excuse for breaking off discussions?  Would the Taoiseach agree that in those circumstances it is incumbent on all of us who desperately wish to see political progress in Northern Ireland to be acutely sensitive and conscious of these considerations?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the absence of the Minister for Labour who is in Brussels on official Government business.  The dispute which has been simmering for some time came to a head on Saturday, 5 May 1990. Ratings on the freight ship, <i>M. V. Bison</i>, refused to carry out certain duties.  The company decided that in these circumstances it was not possible to run the service efficiently and, therefore, removed the crew involved from the payroll and cancelled the sailing.  The crew involved are members of the Seamen's Union of Ireland.</P>
      <P>On Monday, 7 May the dispute escalated when crew members on other B &amp; I freight and passenger ships took action in support of their suspended colleagues on the <i>M.V. Bison</i>.  As a result of this action, B &amp; I have suspended all sailings for the time being.  Initially the action was unofficial but the Seamen's Union of Ireland have now made the dispute official.  There have been two Labour Court conciliation conferences on the dispute and a further conciliation conference has been arranged for this afternoon.  As I speak, talks are already under way which, I hope, will lead to a resolution of the dispute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take the three Private Notice Questions together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last Sunday at about 3 p.m. ten prisoners made their way on to the roof of the separation unit at Mountjoy Prison.  The circumstances in which the prisoners were able to gain access to the roof are being investigated particularly with a view to identifying any measures which might be taken which would assist in the prevention of a recurrence of this type of incident.  Any information I give to the House now is of necessity general in <Col N="884" /> nature pending completion of the detailed investigation now taking place.</P>
    <P>The separation unit has five landings and on the day in question there were 36 prisoners accommodated there.  The E1 landing is generally used to accommodate six offenders whom it is considered could not be accommodated securely in the main block of the prison.  The remaining landings accommodated 27 prisoners who have been identified as HIV positive and three trustee prisoners.  The six prisoners on the E1 landing are kept segregated from the other prisoners.  The indoor recreation area for the E1 prisoners is on the E2 landing where five of them were last Sunday afternoon.  These prisoners succeeded in making their way on to the E4 landing.</P>
    <P>The door at the end of the E4 landing was open as it normally is during recreation periods to enable prisoners to go into the recreation yard.  There is a gym just opposite the door and a struggle took place there between two officers and a number of offenders.  Regrettably one of the officers sustained a broken rib and damage to two other ribs.</P>
    <P>The prisoners obtained iron bars from weightlifting equipment in the gym and went through the door of the landing to the fire escape.  They used the iron bars to prise apart corrugated cladding on the fire escape which was there to prevent access to the roof and ten prisoners got on to the roof.</P>
    <P>During the course of this incident an alarm was sounded and extra staff rushed to the separation unit where they concentrated immediately on restoring order among the remaining prisoners and preventing any other prisoners from getting on to the roof.  Steps were also taken to ensure that the rest of the prison remained under control.</P>
    <P>As the prisoners on the roof of the separation unit were not causing any significant damage and as the situation in the rest of the prison was calm, it was decided that, in the short-term, the balance of advantage lay with attempting to persuade the prisoners to come down. This strategy was effective.  Shortly before 11 p.m. on Sunday one of the <Col N="885" /> prisoners came down, another at 8.40 a.m. yesterday morning and a third at 9.20 a.m.  At 2 p.m. three more prisoners came down and another about 20 minutes later.  During the course of yesterday afternoon two more prisoners came down and the last of the ten came down shortly after 7 p.m. last evening.</P>
    <P>I am sure the House will join with me in paying tribute to the professional manner in which the governor and his staff brought the incident to an end.  I would also like to commend especially the chaplains at the prison who played a valuable role in the successful outcome which was achieved.</P>
    <P>While I certainly have no wish, as Minister for Justice, to add fuel to the fire by becoming involved in unnecessary controversy about incidents of the kind which have now thankfully ended without serious injury, I feel that this House would understand &mdash; and indeed expect &mdash; that I should at least refer to certain comments which have been made about the matter and indeed have become part of the stock-in-trade whenever situations of this kind arise.</P>
    <P>First, it is said that no effort is being made to implement the recommendations of the Whitaker report &mdash; the same thing has been said to all my predecessors.  At the recent annual conference of the Prison Officers' Association I dealt at some length with this subject and I explained not for the first time &mdash; nor was I the first Minister to do so &mdash; that it is simply false to say that the Whitaker report has been ignored.  It had a substantial influence on developments which were already taking place at the time of its publication and some major recommendations, such as the need to introduce a new duty roster system, have subsequently been implemented.  The implementation of these recommendations is by no means a simple operation &mdash; the lengthy and, ultimately, successful negotiations which preceded the introduction of the new rosters provide ample testimony to this.</P>
    <P>I certainly have no intention of acquiescing to suggestions to the effect that I have ignored the Whitaker report during my ten month term of office.  One of the <Col N="886" /> very important recommendations of the Whitaker report was that a Sentence Review Body should be set up; I have also implemented this and I am glad to say that it is working satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>Time and time again there have been demands for the appointment of a medical director.  Again, I took this project in hands, obtained Government approval for a substantially improved &ldquo;package&rdquo; and I am glad to inform the House today that it produced a very worthwhile response on this occasion.  Interviews took place only last week and I hope to be in a position to make an announcement shortly.</P>
    <P>I have also taken a number of other initiatives.  The release, last Christmas, of categories of offenders whose release was not contemplated prior to this was a major success.  The very tragic problem of deaths in custody was another matter on which I took an initiative.  This has long been recognised as a worldwide phenomenon, the causes of which are quite complex and varied.  Various protections are in place, but I was not prepared to leave it at that.  That is why I established an expert group to advise me on the subject and I hope to have their recommendations soon.</P>
    <P>The record, a Cheann Comhairle, is not one of complacency or indifference to prisons or prison affairs.  The handling of prisons is quite a complex matter involving constant tension between various interests.  There is simply no way of meeting the demands of a particular interest without causing dissatisfaction &mdash; sometimes serious dissatisfaction &mdash; elsewhere within the system.  The Minister's job &mdash; and I know that this is a view that will be shared by those who have had the experience of serving as Minister for Justice &mdash; is to strike a balance which, on the basis of the best advice available, he believes to be the right one in an effort to secure the right combination of stability and progress.</P>
    <P>Some of the comments made concerning the recent incident in Mountjoy fully illustrate the point.  There is, for example, the allegation that those suffering from infectious diseases are not <Col N="887" /> receiving the proper treatment either for their disease or for drug abuse.  As regards medical treatment for those known to be HIV positive I can say &mdash; and nobody who knows anything about the situation would deny this &mdash; that whatever is required and is advised medically will be provided.  Nobody I am sure would dispute the fact that I must rely on the expert advice I receive on these matters, not on non-expert opinion.</P>
    <P>With regard to drug abuse, the problem is that, on the one side, there is the demand for effective preventive measures but, on the other, the demand for humane treatment.  What the prison authorities consider to be reasonable preventive measures &mdash; such as random searches &mdash; will inevitably be perceived by prisoners and represented by them as &ldquo;hassle&rdquo;, &ldquo;inhuman treatment&rdquo;, etc. There is no point in making broad generalisations about the quality of treatment and having some vague notion that it all has to do simply with tangibles such as accommodation.  There are accommodation problems, and I shall return to the point later, but there is no escaping the fact that when it comes to adopting measures designed to protect and control persons in custody, the perceptions of those whose job it is to protect in a reasonable manner usually differ quite radically from the perceptions of those for whom the protection is designed.  One man's care and concern is another man's &ldquo;hassle&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The policy of segregating HIV offenders &mdash; also highlighted recently &mdash; is another matter on which there are differences of view.  It is difficult to go into detail about this very sensitive area and I certainly want to say nothing which might add to the tensions and the very genuine worries of offenders on the subject. The policy was put in place when the first cases were identified in 1986. It created enormous anxiety within our prisons at the time.  HIV, of course, is a source of concern and anxiety outside prisons as well as inside, but inside the impact seemed to be potentially very serious indeed.  The best advice at the <Col N="888" /> time was that, from an operational point of view, those known to be HIV positive should be segregated.  The primary motivation was the protection of those suffering from the illness and the protection of good order and security within the system.</P>
    <P>Deputies will know that this is another area to which I have devoted some considerable attention since I became Minister for Justice.  There are no simple answers to the problems of coping with infectious diseases such as HIV within the prison system and it is a delusion to pretend that there are.</P>
    <P>One of the decisions which I have already announced was the provision of a new unit within Mountjoy Prison for those known to be suffering from infectious diseases.  I decided on this on the basis of the best advice available to me &mdash; including medical advice &mdash; following detailed discussions on the subject within my Department.  Over £1 million is now available and the plans are at an advanced stage.</P>
    <P>As to the best policies to be followed for the future, I concluded, having heard the views of the various interests &mdash; some of whom, again, would be competing interests with quite different perceptions as to what is appropriate &mdash; that the best course, in the light of scientific and other developments which were taking place, was to bring the appropriate experts, both from within and outside the prison service, together to discuss the matter I am in the process of doing this at the present time.  This I believe is the responsible course &mdash; there is no point in coming up with half-baked solutions on the basis of unprofessional ideas as to what is or is not appropriate in this area. The risks involved were quite simply too serious.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the subject, one of the solutions which has been canvassed was the use of Wheatfield.  I can inform Deputies that this was a subject of very intensive discussion within my Department and with appropriate outside experts and the conclusion was that Wheatfield should be used for the offenders for whom it was intended and <Col N="889" /> not for those suffering from HIV.  I am not saying that there was total unanimity on this &mdash; the doctors and many others consulted were in agreement &mdash; but there were dissenting views and again it was my job to weigh up the issue and to reach a conclusion.</P>
    <P>Another area in which there would be a substantial difference of views relates to the amount of public expenditure which is appropriate in the prisons area.  A considerable amount of money is spent each year &mdash; in the current year it is £8 million &mdash; in maintaining and refurbishing our existing prison stock.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that further expenditure is not warranted &mdash; it is, and I will do my best to ensure that what can reasonably be provided will be provided, but it is important that certain facts be acknowledged.  In the first place it is a distortion of the truth to say that all our prisons, apart from Wheatfield and the training unit, are in poor condition.  There are prisons in need of remedial works much of which is in progress, but much has been achieved also.  The unit in which the recent disturbances took place was completely modernised only a few years ago and is not overcrowded.  Conditions simply do not constitute a total explanation for disturbances and it is a gross error to believe otherwise.</P>
    <P>It is important to realise also that those who claim that we should demolish our other institutions are actually saying that we should now commit the Exchequer to hundreds of millions of pounds of additional expenditure.  Again there is no point in being vague about this &mdash; we are talking about hundreds of millions of pounds.  While accepting that a certain level of expenditure is necessary to maintain and improve our prison stock, I think that a great many taxpayers as well as those unemployed and depending on State resources, would look askance at the idea that we should now commit hundreds of millions of pounds to prisons, against the background where, in recent years, there has been widespread acceptance of the need for curtailment of State expenditure even where that curtailment, in some instances, pinched.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="890" /> There is no point in hiding from realities either by saying, for example, that what we need are not more prisons but more alternatives to imprisonment. There is no point in pretending that the prisons' population could be dramatically reduced by means of greater use of alternatives. Alternatives are used quite extensively in this country &mdash; there are over 3,000 persons on alternatives of one kind or another as against 2,000 in custody. I am specifically examining the scope for further expansion of alternatives at the present time and I would have to say that looking at the present prison population I would be misleading the House if I were to say that alternatives will provide the full answer.</P>
    <P>The Whitaker Committee which rightly advocated the use of alternatives were looking at the prisons' population in the early to mid-eighties &mdash; I have to look at the composition of the prisons population in the nineties.  Again, I have to balance the advantages of a policy which would see a large number of offenders dealt with in the community against the background of very understandable anxieties of a great many people who fear the activities of criminals. I say, and I want to stress this, that I will expand alternatives in whatever way I can because they are cost effective but let nobody believe that this represents a total answer.</P>
    <P>There is one further comment which I want to make concerning recent events &mdash; and this again is something which I know would be understood by anybody who has been Minister for Justice &mdash; and that is that some of the comments which are given prominence when serious situations like this arise become the source of very great concern to those whose job it is to resolve the problems with minimal risk to staff and offenders alike.  I believe the average citizen would wonder at a system which has the effect of providing a platform for criminals &mdash; in one instance emotively described as rebels &mdash; at a time when they are behaving in a life-threatening manner.  The management and staff who have to deal with these offenders, eyeball to eyeball day-in and <Col N="891" /> day-out, are only too well aware of the effects of providing platforms.</P>
    <P>I believe the average citizen would take the view also that in all the bandwagoning which takes place not enough emphasis is placed on the fact that very often we are dealing with very serious offenders. The impression given in the recent incident was that we were really dealing with people who were simply &ldquo;sick&rdquo;.  They are not in prison because they are sick &mdash; some are amongst the most difficult offenders in the system and are in Mountjoy specifically for that reason and no other.</P>
    <P>With regard to suggestions for a judicial inquiry into Mountjoy let me say that I have no intention of establishing any such expensive machinery &mdash; the issues are known and I will continue to play my part to the best of my ability in resolving them.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I wish to refer briefly before I conclude and that is the recent controversy surrounding the 1988 report of the Mountjoy Visiting Committee.  That report will be published this week and I am somewhat constrained in what I can say about it in advance of its presentation to the Government.  I had to investigate certain matters prior to publication and I have already made a public statement on that &mdash; that statement will incidentally be included in the report.  There are some critical comments in the report &mdash; it is the job of the visiting committee to express criticism where it is justified &mdash; but there are also some very favourable comments which I think many people will find interesting in the light of what has been said in recent days about the treatment of offenders suffering from infectious diseases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was the one who raised the prospect of the appointment of a judicial figure to investigate the goings on and, having listened to the Minister's answer, I am convinced someone needs to go in there and tell him exactly what is happening.  Has the Minister any views on the appropriateness of using a <Col N="892" /> recently modernised high security unit as a place of detention for those who are suffering from illness, namely, the HIV virus?  Does he consider it appropriate that the punishment area of the prison, the B basement, is the most appropriate area to house people who suffer from serious problems arising from the HIV virus?  Has he any view on the problems of the lack of work, training or school available to these prisoners and will he take any steps in the interim before the new unit opens for them, so that their conditions will be ameliorated and something done to improve their lot?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the block involved from which the prisoners went on the roof, there are six prisoners in there whom it is considered could not be secured in the main block of the prison. As to the suitability of the block for HIV prisoners, I have already secured Government funding for it and announced so last November at the time of the publication of the Estimates.  I do not agree that that building is suitable for HIV sufferers and for that reason the Government decided to allocate the money to me to allow for the construction of a new, properly designed, medically equipped unit and over £1 million is available for that.  The planning is already under way, the site for it has been cleared within the prison, and work should commence shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that the number of prisoners confined in Mountjoy is over 600 and far exceeds the number for which it was designed, in that of these, 220 prisoners are detained in double occupancy, or more, cells designed for single prisoners, and this has led to the distress of prisoners and low morale among the management, resulting in disturbances which we witnesed over the weekend?  Will he not use the vacant cells in Wheatfield to somewhat alleviate the immediate problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the overcrowding in Mountjoy is concerned, yes, it is not <Col N="893" /> ideal.  Regarding overcrowding in the unit where the protest took place on Sunday, there is no overcrowding in that unit.  The transfer of prisoners to Wheatfield has been speeded up and the only thing that is holding it up at this stage is the extra training of prison staff, and the remaining approximately 50 places that are available for prisoners there should be filled within a matter of months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to compliment the governor and the prison staff on the low key but firm manner in which they dealt with this protest.  I wish to put three short queries to the Minister.  First, in the light of the very comprehensive reply the Minister has given to the House, does he not accept there is substance in the demand I have been making for quite some time that there should be a full debate in this House on the Whitaker report that cannot adequately be dealt with by a few questions such as we are having now?  Second, in relation to the 1988 prisons report and the failure to publish it at the proper time, the Minister now says this will be published this week. Does he not accept that on 13 March last, in response to a Dáil question he gave me a commitment that it would be published within a few weeks?  Third, perhaps most important, does he not accept that the lack of a visiting committee to Mountjoy Prison, a vehicle through which prisoners can channel their grievances and complaints, was a major cause of the protest and a major contributory factor to the problem?  Does he not accept that he is in clear breach of his statutory duty because under the 1925 Prisons (Visiting Committees) Act he is obliged to constitute a visiting committee in every prison and these committees have not been in existence since their term of office expired at the end of 1989?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as publication of the report is concerned, the report and the comments of the visiting committee refer to an incident in 1986 when my party were not even in Government and the Deputy's party were.  What was attempted was to get clarification of an incident reported in a 1988 report that some say took place in 1986 and some say never took place.  The visiting committee will be appointed on Friday, on the same day as the report is published.</P>
      <P>I want to make one point in relation to the incident on 31 December 1986.  This has been fully investigated by my Department in the light of the accusation made about an incident that took place in 1986. As I say, it is in a 1988 report.  There had been no other indication of it.  The Department were satisfied in relation to the reports from the prison governor and prison staff.  However, since the weekend a comment has been made by a number of women prisoners who up to then had made no statement.  In view of the accusations made publicly by these women prisoners, I have asked the Garda to investigate the matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcCartan" hpid="Mr. McCartan Mr. McCartan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartan</NameTxt>
      <P>On an aspect of a question I addressed earlier given that it will take a considerable time to build and commission a new unit, were there any steps in the interim period, particularly to relieve those prisoners held in the punishment area, the B basement?  I think the Minister will agree it is a wholly inappropriate area for people to be detained permanently.  Am I right in thinking there is a unit in the grounds of Dundrum Central Mental Hospital that is currently vacant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Dundrum is not my responsibility.  Let me mention a point in relation to the HIV prisoners which is interesting when one considers what happened at the weekend.  The prisoners have access to welfare services, a psychiatrist, a psychologist and a chaplain. In addition representatives of outside <Col N="895" /> agencies involved in dealing with drug abuse visit the prison to counsel offenders.</P>
      <P>It is of interest to the House that I should say, rather than accepting the picture that has been painted by the Deputy, that on a number of occasions offenders who had the HIV virus and were given periods of relief returned to prison early asking to be taken back because they were ill or were having difficulty coping with the outside community.  Those prisoners were facilitated and I suggest that their behaviour is evidence of the high level of service provided for such offenders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather from the Minister's long reply that he has accepted that many of our prisons are outdated, over-crowded and in need of replacement. Will the Minister say what additional money will be made available to update prison accommodation?  At the end of the day the important question is what money the Minister will make available to improve the accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have stated, Wheatfield has come on stream and there will be more than 300 places available there. A number of prisoners have been transferred from St. Patrick's to Wheatfield. That prison will be in full use within a matter of months.  In regard to funding I should like to tell the Deputy that more than £8 million will be spent this year on renovation and restoration alone.  We are dealing with old buildings.  We will need to have a continuous programme.  I will strive, within the financial constraints imposed on us, to secure the best funding possible for prison rebuilding.</P>

Will he agree that he indicated that the six months unavoidable delay at that stage was due to staff commitments? Will the Minister accept that in relation to any report of the visiting committee under the 1925 Act, to which I referred, every such report must be open to inspection without charge and that whatever about the veracity of its contents, it should not be used as an excuse for delay in publishing the report?  Now that the Minister seems to be espousing the Whitaker report I should like to know if he acknowledges the existence of an important recommendation in that report concerning the appointment of an inspector of prisons.  Will the Minister indicate whether he favours that recommendation?</P>

The Deputy raised a question about the publication and availability of the report and I should like to tell him that the report is available.  As a matter of fact media representatives are this afternoon in the Department examing the report.  It is available to them under the law, as referred to by Deputy O'Keeffe.  I should like to tell the Deputy that I was very keen to ensure that any report of an incident purported to have taken place, even if it did not take place during my period in office or during a Fianna Fáil administration, or this administration &mdash; this took place during the period of the Deputy's administration &mdash; was accurate and that no false accusations were made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take both questions together.</P>
      <P>Following the announcement of the appointment of a receiver to the Institute of Clinical Pharmacology (Ireland) Ltd., officials of the Department of Health requested and were granted an immediate meeting with the receiver.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this meeting the officials stressed that the primary concern of the Minister for Health was to ensure that proper medical care and supervision should continue to be provided for all participants in clinical trials being conducted by the institute.  It was indicated to the receiver that the trials being conducted by the institute were the subject of licences granted by the Minister under the Control of Clinical Trials Act, 1987 on the basis of agreed protocols which included appropriate provisions for the care of participants which was one of the fundamental purposes of the Act.  The Minster was anxious to ensure that the terms of the licences were fully complied with. It was also indicated that there should be no unilateral withdrawal of participants from such trials except under proper medical supervision and guidance.  The receiver accepted the responsibility to provide such care and indicated that he was seeking the assistance of leading specialists in the fields of medicine and pharmacology to advise him in this respect.  He also undertook to keep the <Col N="898" /> Department of Health advised of all developments in this matter.  I am satisfied that the medical needs of the participants are being provided for.</P>
    <P>The Government are, of course, anxious that clinical research and testing should continue to be a feature of health care in Ireland.  I understand that the receiver is actively pursuing the possibility of putting together a rescue package for the institute.  In so far as my Department can be of assistance to him in this, we will readily do so.  I should say, however, that apart from ICP as a centre for clinical testing of drugs, much testing and research also takes place in hospitals and other centres and such testing is totally unaffected by the receivership of the Institute of Clinical Pharmacology (Ireland) Ltd.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he will give an assurance to the House that all the obligations to the 20 drug-testing volunteers will be met, financial and medical?  Has the Minister obtained such an assurance from the receiver?  Will the Minister, and the Government, accept that their failure to amend the Control of Clinical Trials Act has meant that hospital-based and clinical research here is grinding to a halt because of insurance difficulties?  Will the Minister give a commitment to the House that the new legislation will be brought forward?</P>

      <P>I thought I had made the position clear.  I should like to assure the House that all obligations, financial and medical, will be met by the receiver and we have a commitment to that effect. The receiver has appointed two eminent professors of clinical pharmacology to advise him in regard to this.  He has given a commitment that 24 hour medical supervision, full nursing care and monitoring facilities are being provided for all volunteers involved.  I do not accept what the Deputy has said in regard to the failure of the Government to bring forward the new clinical controls Bill.  The introduction of the Control of Clinical Trials <Col N="899" /> Act, 1987 in Ireland has not adversely affected the conduct of clinical research here.</P>

For that reason they were not under any difficulty in regard to ethics.  I should like to assure the House that the Attorney General has examined the proposed new Bill and cleared it to the parliamentary draftsman.  As soon as it has been cleared by that official the Minister for Health will bring it before the House.</P>

I should like to ask the Minister if he has invoked section 11 (1) (b) of the Control of Clinical Trials Act, 1987 which, I should like to remind him, enables him to require detailed progress reports from the institute concerning the progress of volunteers involved in clinical trials.  Will the Minister say if the Department of Health are taking any measures to supervise or monitor the progress of those clinical trials to their termination?</P>

I should like to assure the Deputy, and the House, that the Department of Health have been in touch with the receiver and that we have been assured by his commitments. He has engaged eminent advisers.  It is a matter for the receiver to deal with this issue and not the ICP.  The interests of the volunteers, medical and financial, are being looked after by the receiver and the Department of Health will monitor this and be in constant touch with the receiver.</P>

    <Title>Shannon Navigation Bill, 1990: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Daly) Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Daly)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is with great pleasure that I commend this Bill to the House.  The Bill deals with three significant waterways &mdash; the Shannon navigation, the Ballinamore/Ballyconnell Canal and the Erne and Lough Oughter navigation.</P>
      <P>Contrary to the impression given by casual observation the River Shannon is not a navigable waterway in its natural state.  Intermittent stretches of the river allowed passage of boats from earliest times but continuous navigation for any significant distance was not possible because of many natural barriers.</P>
      <P>By the early 18th century the value of a continuous navigation was realised and the establishment of the Commissioners of Inland Navigation in 1751 saw a determined effort to improve the river.  By 1787 when these commissioners were dissolved navigation was possible from Killaloe to Carrick-on-Shannon.  When control subsequently passed to the Directors General of Inland Navigation the Limerick-Killaloe section was made navigable by 1814 and the system was extended to Lough Allen the same year. These works involved the construction of significant sections of canal to by-pass serious obstacles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inland passage to Dublin was made possible by the completion of the Grand Canal in 1804 &mdash; which joins the Shannon at Shannon Harbour, County Offaly &mdash; and a further link was completed in 1817 when the Royal Canal was completed taking a more northerly route connecting <Col N="963" /> with the river at Clondra, County Longford. These links resulted in regular passenger and cargo services between Limerick and Dublin by the early 19th century and the smaller centres were also served.  The Grand and Royal Canals were transferred to the Commissioners of Public Works by virtue of the Canals Act, 1986.</P>
    <P>When the Office of Public Works was established in 1831 it took control of most of the Shannon navigation.  The Shannon Act, 1839 formalised the control of the Commissioners of Public Works and the following years saw a comprehensive programme for improvement works.  These works transformed the waterway and involved deepening the channel for significant stretches, constructing huge weirs and locks and replacing many bridges.  The quality of these works has stood the test of time and they protected the navigable status of the river through subsequent lean times.</P>
    <P>However, despite the creation of a high quality navigable route and the link to Dublin and the east of the country the volume of traffic was disappointing.  The relatively sparse population distribution, lack of industrial activity and absence of bulky material such as ore &mdash; which were the mainstay of waterways in other countries &mdash; all contributed to low traffic levels.  The coming of the railways from the mid 19th century and further depopulation of the western part of the country led to a serious decline on both goods and passenger traffic.  Surprisingly, despite the ominous trends, a successful summertime passenger steamer service operated between Killaloe and Carrick-on-Shannon for several years at the turn of this century.</P>
    <P>The decline in traffic continued and the condition of the navigation began to deteriorate.  However, CIE operated summer passenger cruises from the mid 1950s and although the navigation was originally intended for commercial traffic, slowly with the improving economic climate pleasure boat traffic began to emerge and by the early 1960s boats were available for hire.  The Office of <Col N="964" /> Public Works restored the operating condition of the waterway and traffic grew steadily.</P>
    <P>The last 25 years has seen a transformation of the river.  A natural waterway even if navigable can never achieve its full potential without facilities for berthing and aids to passage.  The Office of Public Works has expended significant sums of money on the provision of quays and harbours at many locations and several others are planned for the next few years.  For instance, major new facilities have been provided at Lough Key, Drumsna, Dromond, Lecarrow, Hodson's Bay, Clonmacnoise, Portumna and Dromineer and further works are in progress or planned for Roosky, Portrunny and along the river Suck.  The budget for 1990 for the Shannon is almost £1 million.</P>
    <P>In addition to the provision of these berthing facilities other works include dredging, hydrographic surveying, the provision of water and other services and the marking of hazards and navigation routes.  Ongoing maintenance of the waterway which must be undertaken generally from water-based plant is vital to maintain the navigation in a safe and pleasant condition.</P>
    <P>The power of the Commissioners of Public Works in relation to Shannon navigation derived initially from the 1839 Act for the improvement of the navigation of the River Shannon and the 1846 Commissioners of Public Works Act.  There have been various enactments since that time which have a bearing on the navigation. However, in effect, the only statutory power the Commissioners of Public Works now clearly hold is that related to the maintenance of the navigation and to raise very minimal tolls and charges.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of section 39 of the 1839 Act the boundaries of Shannon navigation were defined.  Since that time, additional property has been acquired as worth-while additions to the navigation facilities but these fall to be administered as State property under the State Property Act, 1954.  It is highly desirable that these properties, together with any <Col N="965" /> subsequent acquisitions and any extensions to the navigable waterway, should be within the ambit of the Shannon navigation legislation.  The only satisfactory method of resolving the matter is by the introduction of new legislation.</P>
    <P>The Ballinamore and Ballyconnell Canal is the name given to the junction navigation that once linked the Shannon and Erne navigations.  It was 39 miles long, consisted of a still-water canal from the River Shannon near Leitrim village to Lough Scur, a distance of 5.3 miles, and the canalised Woodford River from Lough Scur to Upper Lough Erne at a point about 4.5 miles north of Belturbet in County Cavan, a total distance of 33.6 miles.  The canal rose about 80 feet through eight locks from the Shannon to Lough Scur.  From Lough Scur it fell about 70 feet, also through eight locks, and passed through the towns of Ballinamore in County Leitrim and Ballyconnell in County Cavan on its way to the Erne.</P>
    <P>More than half the course of the former navigation lies totally within County Leitrim while about one-fifth lies within County Cavan and a short length lies on the boundary between these two counties. The remainder lies on the boundary between Counties Cavan and Fermanagh except for three short stretches of artificial channel totalling about a mile that were constructed within County Fermanagh.</P>
    <P>The history of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal starts in the last quarter of the 18th century when there was a proposal to make the Woodford River navigable for about 8.5 miles from Upper Lough Erne to Ballyconnell as part of a general scheme for the Erne that would have linked Belturbet in County Cavan via Upper Lough Erne to Enniskillen and via Lower Loch Erne to Beleek.  The link from Beleek to the sea at Ballyshannon would have been completed by a canal by-passing the steep falls in the River Erne.</P>
    <P>A further link westward via the Woodford River to Ballinamore and Lough Scur and via a still-water canal to the Shannon at Leitrim was envisaged as a <Col N="966" /> future development.  Some work was done on the navigation at that time including partial construction of a lock at Corraquill, or Carool, on the stretch between Lough Erne and Ballyconnell but it came to a halt in 1792 and was not to be resumed for over half a century.</P>
    <P>Two events in 1842 gave an impetus to a resumption of the project.  The first was the completion of the Ulster Canal which linked the Erne with the various navigation systems in eastern Ulster and the anxiety at the time to extend the connection westward to the Shannon.  The second was the passing of the Arterial Drainage Act of that year which made provision for the carrying out of river works &ldquo;to promote the drainage of lands and improvement of navigation and water power in connection with such drainage&rdquo;.  This resulted in the submission under the Act of Memorials by the local landowners for a drainage scheme and by the Ulster Canal Company for a navigation scheme to link the Erne with the Shannon along the line of the Woodford River.  The company was confident that a link between the two major navigation systems would generate sufficient through traffic between them and that industry and agriculture in the area would generate local traffic and would derive benefit from the facility.</P>
    <P>A scheme providing for drainage and navigation was drawn up by the Commissioners of Public Works and drainage works were commenced in mid-1846. Work on the navigation started 18 months later.  The navigation design called for a depth of 6 feet of water over lock cills and in channels and for locks 82 feet long by 16 feet 6 inches wide.  As an economy measure during construction, depths were reduced to 4 feet 6 inches over considerable stretches of channel and, in some places, they were found subsequently not to exceed 3 feet 6 inches.</P>
    <P>A further Act of 1856 provided for the making of awards by the Commissioners, wherein the works completed are formally documented, differentiating between the drainage and navigation works, following which the operation and <Col N="967" /> maintenance of these works would be handed over to separate boards of trustees.</P>
    <P>The first recorded use of the navigation as a through route was at the end of 1856. There was an official trial in June 1858. The navigation award was made in January 1860 and the works were handed over by the Board of Works to the trustees on 4 July in the same year.</P>
    <P>The work of the navigation trustees was to be financed by tolls, rents and a levy on the ratepayers of districts adjoinging the canal.  They appointed an engineer, to direct and supervise the maintenance work.  In October 1860 he carried out a survey of the works as completed and listed many faults including inadequate depth over considerable lengths, rock and silt in lakes, bank slips and badly constructed locks and fittings.  He reported that traffic could not be carried on except by small steamers.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to say if these criticisms were valid or exaggerated. However, neither through nor local traffic materialised.  Lack of traffic meant lack of revenue and a loss of confidence and enthusiasm among the trustees.  This led to poor maintenance which meant that conditions got worse and passage through the canal got more difficult which, in turn, discouraged any growth in traffic.  A report in 1875 indicated that the navigation was even then sinking into a derelict state.</P>
    <P>The trustees, however, continued in existence with two interruptions until their last meeting in 1948.  Maintenance work continued up to 1937 albeit with a suspension of more than 20 years at the end of the 19th century.  Much of this work was concerned with the weir and sluices in Ballyconnell which had to be maintained to preserve water power at the mill there.  The last maintenance contract was for the cleaning of the canal basin in Ballinamore.</P>
    <P>To my knowledge, the trustees have not met since 1948 and no elections have been held but there has been no formal move to wind them up or to transfer their duties and responsibilities to any other <Col N="968" /> body.  No maintenance work has been carried out on the navigation since 1937 although minor repairs may have been carried out by other bodies.  For instance, the basin in Ballinamore was cleaned up recently under a Youth Employment Agency scheme.</P>
    <P>Commercially, it is obvious that the Ballinamore and Ballyconnell Canal was a failure.  It was in some sort of usable condition for only 15 years during which some 15 boats made the through passage, just over half of them paying for the privilege. There is evidence that none of these boats was of the full size for which the navigation was intended and, certainly towards the end of the period, that the passage took an excessively long time.  If this is so, it is an indication that earlier criticisms had some foundation and that the works were not completed to the intended standard.  This, in turn, would have made it very difficult for the trustees to attract traffic to the canal but there is little evidence that such traffic was available in any event at that time.</P>
    <P>What is clear is that the construction of the Ballinamore and Ballyconnell Canal demonstrated that the Shannon and Erne navigations could be sucessfully linked without the necessity of resorting to expensive engineering works.  The route, which was chosen after a number of alternatives was examined, made use of the Woodford River and its lakes for more than 85 per cent of its length.  The design included some excellent features including the diversion of a number of streams which achieved the optimum use of water resources and also ensured that the deposition of alluvial material which they carry would not take place in the navigation channel.</P>
    <P>The navigation has been unusable as such for over 100 years.  During most of that period it has been permitted to &ldquo;decay quietly&rdquo; with only sporadic attempts at maintenance, mostly in the interests of drainage or power generation rather than navigation.  Apart from unauthorised interference with a number of the weirs there has been very little deliberate demolition and substantial <Col N="969" /> parts of the works have survived remarkably well.  The visible evidence of these works, notably some of the locks on the western leg that appears to be in very good condition, has continued to fuel a desire to see the navigation restored.  The revival in recent decades of the Shannon and Erne navigation systems for pleasure cruising and other recreational uses has given rise to the query, could the navigation be restored?  In short, the answer is yes as investigations over the last number of years have shown.</P>
    <P>In view of the constraints on other economic options, the area having relatively little manufacturing industry and comparatively poor agricultural land, tourism represents the major element in any future plans for the development of the area.  The development of the navigation in the area is a significant move in this direction.  The Government, being fully aware of the potential benefit of reopening the canal, have decided to proceed.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that the statutory powers necessary for the execution of the works should be incorporated in the Shannon Navigation Bill which I am now presenting.  The purpose of this Bill, therefore, is to up-date the powers of the Commissioners of Public Works in relation to the Shannon navigation, which at present derive from Acts of the last century, and to transfer to the commissioners the Ballinamore and Ballyconnell navigation with powers for its restoration by them or by such other person or persons to whom those powers may be delegated by order by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The Bill will also allow the commissioners to maintain and operate navigation facilities on the River Erne in the State, including Lough Oughter, which is connected to the Ballinamore and Ballyconnell navigation and for which there is no navigation authority at present.</P>
    <P>The Bill will also have the effect of applying the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, to the Ballinamore and Ballyconnell drainage district as is the case with all other drainage districts within the State.  Hitherto statutory responsibility <Col N="970" /> for maintenance of these drainage works has been vested in drainage trustees who recouped the cost from the local authorities. Henceforth responsibility for maintenance of these works will lie directly with the local authorities.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum which accompanies the Bill sets out in more detail what it aims to achieve but, I will endeavour to summarise here the powers sought in more general terms.  In short, the Bill will empower the Commissioners of Public Works to undertake the care, management, control, improvement and development of the Shannon navigation, including the Ballinamore and Ballyconnell navigation and the section of the River Erne navigation within the State which will, in fact, be deemed to be part of the Shannon navigation.  Potential for joint ventures with public and private interests will be fully explored.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt this legislation will provide the legislative framework which will enable us to undertake major development of a resource now dormant and stagnant.  It will empower the commissioners to make charges for the use of the navigation facilities by them, to make by-laws for the control of the users of those facilities, to acquire and dispose of property, to enter on adjoining lands for the purpose of inspecting, surveying and carrying out works to the navigation and to extend the limits of the navigation.  The Bill, of course, also contains adequate safeguards for the rights of existing landowners.</P>
    <P>The Bill empowers the commissioners to control pollution from boats using the navigation.  However, the general question of pollution of rivers is the responsibility of local authorities under the Water Pollution Act.  It would not be appropriate for the commissioners to duplicate the efforts of the local authorities in this regard.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that the Commissioners of Public Works should be given the necessary statutory powers for the control and management of the Shannon navigation, as well as the maintenance thereof, as a single entity to ensure its vital role as the major public <Col N="971" /> amenity of the State.  It is, likewise, appropriate that the management and development of the navigation should be directed towards maximising its contribution to tourism revenues and charges fixed accordingly and that comprehensive legislation should be prepared to close all the gaps in the present law relating to the navigation.</P>
    <P>The tourism potential of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell link is uppermost in my mind.  The significance of this North-South link in bringing tourists from the South into the northern waterways and those from Northern Ireland into our own waterways will have many benefits.  The advantages to the small towns and villages along the route of the canal with tourism revenues from North and South is an important feature of the project.  The authorities in Northern Ireland are fully supportive of the venture and I see it as an important initiative adding to our North-South links.</P>
    <P>In the development of our waterways currently under the direction of the Commissioners of Public Works and its further extension proposed in this Bill, the extensive waterways will match those available in other countries such as the United Kingdom and France.  These waterways are increasingly seen as essential ingredients in the tourism attraction available to visitors.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Navigation Bill provides the necessary means whereby the future of these waterways will be assured.  I, therefore, look forward to the support of this House in securing early enactment of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>My party welcome the provisions of this Bill so far as they go. We welcome in particular the provision to transfer the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell navigation to the Office of Public Works, to provide for the restoration of the canal and the taking into charge by the Commissioners of Public Works of the Lough Oughter navigation, and the portion of the River Erne in the State from Oughter to Upper Lough Erne.  The Bill also brings up to date and defines tightly the <Col N="972" /> powers of the Commissioners of Public Works in relation to navigation and maintenance of the River Shannon itself.</P>
      <P>The great pity is that Government have not used the opportunity to bring in a meaningful Bill to manage the navigation and other activities on the main stem of the River Shannon.  This was often promised by Government spokespersons when they were on this side of the House and, on other occasions, when they were in Government.  In the Dáil on June 4 1986 a number of Fianna Fáil speakers, one of them now a Cabinet Minister, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, and another a Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce, Deputy Terry Leyden, had no problem in calling for a new Shannon authority.  It seems it is just another of these cynical and sad examples of the wide and yawning gulf there is between what these people promise and what they are prepared to do when given the opportunity to carry out the work.</P>
      <P>At present and for the future Shannon navigation falls to two authorities, the Office of Public Works and the ESB. There is often a conflict of interest &mdash; lock gates are opened and closed to suit the individual needs of each body and this often results in lateral flooding of adjoining lands leading to complaints from farmers.  The farmers are never consulted no matter what losses they may suffer.</P>
      <P>This Bill should set up a Shannon authority with real powers to manage this great natural waterway in the interests of all.  The authority should comprise people representing agriculture, tourism, fisheries, navigation, industry and power generation &mdash; there are others.  They should be given optimum powers of management of lake storage capacity and control of water levels to minimise the flooding of farmland and all the lock gates should be made to operate efficiently. They should be financed to take urgent action on silt clearance which is mostly the result of Bord na Móna activities and this would improve the flow and alleviate the flooding problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such an agency should have appropriate powers to control pollution on the <Col N="973" /> river.  There is no proper power to control pollution on the river and we often forget that much of the pollution is generated by traffic on the river itself.  It is, however, left to the various local authorities whose areas the river passes through.  The agency should also have the power to protect the unique wildlife and fisheries of the river system.  Much of the Shannon waterway and the land in its immediate environs, in the central plain, have now been identified as areas of international scientific interest from a wildlife and general environmental point of view. Why the Government have dragged their feet for so long in designating these areas as environmentally sensitive under EC Regulation 1760 of 1987 is beyond any rational explanation.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the Bill about a summer flooding relief scheme which is a feasible proposition.  We all now agree that a full drainage scheme for the Shannon is no longer a workable proposition. A summer relief programme, however, would relieve problems on thousands of acres of land during the summer months with a major impact on the incomes of hundreds, maybe several thousands, of small farmers on both banks of the Shannon. It is also ridiculous that only 50 per cent of the lands that suffer flooding from the main stem of the Shannon itself, from its tributaries and its canals, are classified as severely handicapped.  the other 50 per cent, as adversely affected, is classified as less severly handicapped and cannot benefit from the EC Regulation 268 of 1975 which is the cattle headage regulation.</P>
    <P>The activities of one of our largest commercial semi-State bodies, Bord na Móna, have a critical influence on the behaviour of the Shannon.  The cutting away of great tracts of peatland removes a vast natural sponge that used to hold unquantifiably large amounts of water from rainfall that afterwards was released by a natural slow process into the river system.  With so much of this bog area adjacent to the Shannon gone, vast amounts of water now enter the system <Col N="974" /> much more quickly than happened a generation ago.  That exacerbates the flooding on the Shannon.  Then there is the silt run-off from peat at harvesting which rests in the main channel bed, causes fouling in weirs, raises the water level and has a damaging effect on fish life.</P>
    <P>For this reason, is it not high time that Bord na Móna were involved in the management of the Shannon?  It is not in their interest that the river should be fouled or damaged by their very necessary activities.  They would gladly help &mdash; and they have often said this &mdash; if they were given a statutory role.  Is it not high time, too, that the farming interests that have been so damaged and whose livelihoods depend to a great extent on the behaviour of the River Shannon were brought in and given a say in the management of this waterway, given that so many of the problems arise as a result of the activities of two major bodies whose interests do not converge and who never sit down together to talk about the problems of flooding which arise directly from the present management of the navigation of the Shannon.</P>
    <P>That is just to make a somewhat detailed case for the farmers and an industry like Bord na Móna.  One could spend the rest of the evening making a case for bringing in people like Bord Fáilte, the Wildlife Commission and people who are interested in pollution abatement, etc.  However, I will move on and talk for a moment on what I see as the only beneficial side of the Bill, that is the taking in charge of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell navigation.  The Minister dealt at great length with this and its restoration and other works on the Erne.</P>
    <P>I would like also to compliment and support the work of the Northern Ireland Department of Agriculture for the work they will be doing on the Erne in County Fermanagh to complete the navigation. There are great practical benefits from this scheme but there are also highly significant symbolic benefits.  It is a cross-Border undertaking and its completion will show what enormous benefits can flow from this rare piece of cross-Border co-operation.  We are delighted it is to be <Col N="975" /> a flagship project in our application for EC structural funding.  We appreciate, too, the interest of the International Fund for Ireland in this project and their stated willingness to part fund this project because of its cross-Border co-operation implications.  The Economic and Social Affairs Committee of the EC in a report on Irish Border areas and on the Erne catchment area, published in 1983 stated:</P>
    <P>The opening up of ... the Ballinamore-Balyconnell canal to full use by pleasure craft would give a massive boost to a still very under-developed tourist industry...the consequences of such a direct link being forged between the Erne and the Shannon cruiseways are of the first magnitude, since by combining them a navigable waterway of European importance would be created.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am delighted that some of the aspirations they expressed are being fulfilled by what we are enacting here today.</P>
    <P>South Leitrim and the western part of County Cavan &mdash; the region to benefit from this project &mdash; are probably the most disadvantaged areas in the country. In the 60 years from 1926-86, County Leitrim lost 50 per cent of its total population. In the same period, County Cavan as a whole lost almost 35 per cent of its population, but, the region of west Cavan, which is so like Leitrim &mdash; and there is a major difference between the levels of prosperity and the opportunities available in east Cavan and west Cavan &mdash; I submit would have lost at least 50 per cent of its population.  Interestingly, Lisnaskea-Derrylin, the area of County Fermanagh which will benefit, is contiguous to both Leitrim and Cavan.  While this part of County Fermanagh has similar geographical difficulties from the point of view of remoteness and the quality of the land to the counties Leitrim and west Cavan, the decline in population in that area has been less.  That area which incidentally is the poorest area of County Fermanagh enjoys higher levels of employment.  Indeed, farm <Col N="976" /> incomes in this area are far higher than our side of the Border.</P>
    <P>Employment in County Leitrim fell by 14 per cent in the 20 years between 1961-81 and employment fell by 12 per cent in County Cavan in the same period. However, if we were to confine the decline in employment to the western part of County Cavan &mdash; we do not have figures for this &mdash; we would find that it would be very close to the figure for County Leitrim.  We can get some idea of the opportunities for employment in Ballinamore and Ballyconnell, the towns which give their names to the canal.  In the period 1961-81 the population declined in Ballinamore by 17.5 per cent while in Ballyconnell the corresponding figure was 14 per cent.  Emigration is only a symptom of the lack of employment but it gives us an indication of what has happened to employment in the area.</P>
    <P>In my opinion you would need 100 acres of land at least to engage in viable farming in the region.  I am not talking about adjusted acres but, actual acres.  If you adjusted the average 100 acres of land in that region, you would be very lucky to have 40 adjusted acres, which by any standard nowadays is hardly a viable holding.  Only 3 per cent of the farms in County Leitrim are farms of 100 acres or more.  These are holdings of the actual number of acres, and not adjusted acres; 100 actual acres in County Leitrim amounts to 40 adjusted acres, which is the only meaningful acreage to a farmer, and in County Cavan as a whole, only 5 per cent of farms are of 100 acres or more.  I submit to the House that most of the large farms are in the region where there is better land and that the average farm size in west Cavan will be very much like the holdings in County Leitrim.  In these circumstances the implications for the income of the population are great. These are not extraneous matters, a Cheann Comhairle, because I wish to draw the attention of the House to the economic state of the region we are talking about.  If you were to identify the sources of income in that area, it is pure and simple farming, marginalised subsistence farming and the service activities <Col N="977" /> that go on in the small towns in such areas.  It is important that we put the area in context.  It also puts into context the level of investment one would need to make a significant impact on the trends and the general economic state of the region.</P>
    <P>It may be more germane to talk about tourism statistics in the area.  It appears that 1 per cent of tourists from inside and outside the State visit County Leitrim and about 2 per cent of the total number of visitors, national and international, visit County Cavan.  However, the two counties taken together, earn about 1 per cent of the total tourist revenue for any given year.  Again I hope this will focus the attention of Members on the value of tourism to the area.  The figures show that while tourism is very valuable to those who gain their livelihood from it it also indicates that the number of people who benefit from tourism must be very small. Obviously, the area is off the beaten track for visitors.  Certainly it is not one of the destinations of most people who go on holidays in this country.  I suppose this is because of its remoteness but particularly because it has been grossly neglected and under-sold over the years.  This is an area of great natural beauty &mdash; a wonderland of lakes and unspoiled countryside, but it has never been sold.  Indeed, if it had been promoted properly it would have attracted factors of ten or even 100 times more tourists than visit the area now.</P>
    <P>The opening of this canal to navigation will no doubt improve the potential for growth and for the betterment of economic life in this area.  It is certainly one of the best things that has happened to the region since the country gained its independence.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte expect that there will be an increase of 4,400 cruising tourists when the canal is operational and they expect it will generate about £45 million in tourist revenue over a 20 year period. There are all sorts of views on the working life of the restored canal.  The Office of Public Works or the ESB &mdash; the Minister may correct me &mdash; are talking of a lifespan of 20 years but others say that it should have a lifespan of at least 50 years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="978" /> It is quite remarkable that in the 100 years in which the canal has lain unused and derelict, so much of it has remained intact.  I would be inclined to go for the longer period rather than the period of 20 years of which Bord Fáilte are in favour. They are talking about 4,500 additional tourists per annum and an additional amount of revenue &mdash; this is all guesswork &mdash; of about £45 million in a 20 year period.  On both counts, these are very conservative figures.</P>
    <P>I believe when this new navigation facility is brought on-stream it should be aggressively sold internationally by Northern Ireland tourism as well as by Bord Fáilte &mdash; I would say that to both of them &mdash; I hope the people north of the Border will hear this as well as those in Baggot Street.  One of my criticisms of our tourist effort relates to how little we do in terms of promoting ourselves aggressively.  If you take up one of the Sunday newspapers &mdash; one of the better class &mdash; you find that places like India or Ceylon are sold aggressively to people here but if you look at the English newspapers you will find very little promotional material about Ireland, their next door neighbour.  I have looked at American papers and have seen little or nothing by way of advertising the facilities and pleasures we can offer the tourist. Obviously the American tourists come to Ireland more by accident than by design, or they are emigrants returning to their roots.  I believe the tourist figures could be quadrupled over a period of 20 years and, if we are lucky, that the revenue generated over 20 years could be ten times more than the estimated £45 million.</P>
    <P>We have to remember that each season there are large fleets of cruisers, canoes and other boats on the Shannon and the Erne.  Together they make up the longest unbroken navigable waterway in western Europe.  Well sold, the number of people using this waterway could be doubled or quadrupled.  There is hardly another place on the planet where you could find a navigable river, lake and canal, with such a wealth of fishing, wildlife, unspoilt <Col N="979" /> countryside, very little noise or deleterious effects of industrialisation.  The clean unpolluted surface water from very high rainfall &mdash; something we often do not speak very highly of &mdash; makes the whole system unique.</P>
    <P>Arising from their surveys, Bord Fáilte point out that an inland water holiday is one of the most popular among our continental tourists.  There is an interesting table in the environmental impact study published by the ESB.  They quote a survey carried out on the motivation of tourists who holiday on United Kingdom waterways.  Ninety five per cent of those surveyed said they preferred cruising or boating holidays because they were very relaxing; 94 per cent said that kind of holiday enabled them to enjoy the countryside; 75 per cent said boating and cruising was a very important outdoor activity; and 67 per cent said they took their vacations on the waterways to observe wildlife and flora and fauna.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the existing Shannon waterway is a paradise for fishermen and reopening of the canal will greatly extend this facility.  The Woodford River is a rich source of all kinds of coarse fishing; there are excellent fish stocks in the lakes through which the navigation will pass; and of these lakes, Lake Garadice, is one of the most beautiful inland lakes in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The construction work on the project will provide much needed employment in this region.  The creation of perhaps 150 new jobs locally is bound to have a very beneficial effect in an area where nowadays job creation is never heard of but job losses are an everyday experience. When it comes to the construction work on this project, it is important that we do things right and that there is no delay in providing the necessary finance to put in train all the facilities that will be needed.  It is most important &mdash; I say this from my experience of the Shannon in County Roscommon and the difficulties we have had trying to get some basic facilities at mooring points along the main stem of the Shannon which flows for <Col N="980" /> almost 80 miles on one side of the constituency that I represent &mdash; that moorings be provided in little villages like Leitrim where the canal starts and small towns like Keshcarrigan, Ballinamore, Ballyconnell.  It is also important that there be mooring points and tie-up points along the lakes &mdash; Lake Garadice, St. John's Lake and others &mdash; and that basic facilities be provided.  For instance, a tap with clean running water should be provided at each mooring point and, above all, there should be enough mooring points to facilitate all the boats so that they do not have to go to a much larger area.  Telephone kiosks should be provided in these places to facilitate foreign tourists.  Because our telephone system is now digitalised, it is one of the best in the world.  We should not have to argue with Telecom Éireann when the job is finished as to whether a telephone kiosk would be viable.  Provision for a kiosk should be provided at the construction stage.  There should also be provision for another very basic amenity a public toilet, at all these places.</P>
    <P>These may seem to be small points to Members of the House.  As I have said, the main stem of the Shannon passes through one side of my constituency.  In areas such as Roosky, Tarmonbarry and Kilglass there is an ongoing battle to provide even the most basic facilities and tie-up points.  Tourists will tell you that when they come to a small area and they want to go to the pub, there is no tie-up point. Neither are there other amenities, such as those I have mentioned &mdash; the telephone, public toilet or the tap with clean running water.  These amenities would cost very little.  It is estimated that the project will cost £20 million and relative to the overall cost to provide these facilities would cost pennies.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to Lough Scur.  As mentioned by the Minister, the level of Lough Scur must be raised.  He gave us some of the technical data on its new elevation.  The report states that something in the region of 40 hectares of land &mdash; which is roughly 100 acres &mdash; will be submerged completely by the raising of the level of Lough Scur.  St. John's Lake <Col N="981" /> will also be raised.  That too will have a lateral spread on adjoining lands.  Lands which are now used for farming or marginalised farming will be lost; they will become part of the water system.  It is very important that the farmers in that area be realistically compensated for any loss of land.  I would also want an undertaking that the figures we have been given in relation to 100 hectares being submerged around Lough Scur will be confined to that.  If it is more we should know about it.  It will be for the local representatives &mdash; there is at least one of them in the House at present &mdash; to deal with the problem where some farmers were told that they could never be submerged by the new navigation, to find out afterwards that in reality their lands were submerged and their incomes lost, and they are being told that because the statute does not enable us anymore to compensate you for the loss of land etc, there is very little we can give you.  It is very important that these matters are got right at this stage, otherwise they will lead to endless trouble.  It is most important that that would be checked and rechecked to ensure that the figures given are correct.</P>
    <P>Incidentally we are not given any figures for lateral spread of water to St. John's Lake.  The Woodford River is canalised; the locks system will make it into a pond from one lock to the other, and it will be relatively slow moving.  Naturally the water level will have to rise.  I am aware that the proposal is to deepen the channel in the Woodford River.  We must also be very careful because there will be very sensitive drainage systems feeding into that river.  It is part of nature itself because this is a river that has been there since the beginning of time.  It is very important that there is no backup of water into adjoining field drainage systems, because that would be extremely damaging to farmers.  I am saying that as somebody who has farmed that type of land.  It is very important that the interests of people on very low incomes and who have survived the greatest adversity be taken into account.  One can admire people who have survived in <Col N="982" /> the Sahara but it is often just as difficult from an economic point of view to survive off farming in that part of County Leitrim.  Anything that is done to adversely affect them could result in a disastrous reduction in the meagre income they already have.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that these matters are taken into consideration and that any consequences for any person is fully taken into consideration and that the appropriate compensation regime will be sufficiently flexible in cases which cannot now be identified &mdash; and which the survey shows is not happening but which may happen in practice afterwards &mdash; to reach out to those people if that need arises.</P>
    <P>Because this project is EC-aided it will benefit from Structural Funds.  The submission for Structural Funds for the region &mdash; Leitrim is in one region with County Sligo and County Donegal &mdash; which the Department of Finance made to the Commission in Brussels showed that the income in Counties Donegal, Leitrim and Sligo is 72 per cent of the national average.  Since Counties Donegal and Sligo are far more prosperous than County Leitrim, and while I do not have the figure I will make an educated guess here, that if you were to isolate County Leitrim from that region you would find that the income in County Leitrim is about 50 per cent of the national average.  indeed, they well deserve this infusion of capital.</P>
    <P>If you look at the other part of County Cavan, which is in a region with Counties Louth and Monaghan.  According to the submission made by the Department of Finance the income in that region is 86 per cent of the national average.  It fares a good deal better than the other North west region.  County Cavan is the poorest county of those three I think everyone would agree that Counties Louth and Monaghan have a more diverse economy than County Cavan. Eastern Cavan is similar to County Louth and County Monaghan but western Cavan is a world apart, and I submit that instead of that region enjoying an income of 82 per cent of the national average income it is much closer to 50 per cent or <Col N="983" /> below.  Nobody out there need say thanks to anybody in this House for giving them this particular project because that is the context in which this investment is being pumped in.  I hope I have not bored anybody.</P>

      <P>Indeed, and is it not a great pity?  For the reasons given I welcome the aspect of the Bill which deals with Ballyconnell-Ballinamore Canal. We are very disappointed that an authority has not been set up to be responsible for water management on the main stem of the Shannon, to be managers of its ecology, water quality, its navigation and of all aspects of the River Shannon.  We find that particularly disappointing given the promises made in this House and elsewhere, at election campaigns and so on.  Nevertheless we will be coming back to them.  I hope that through amendments to this Bill on Committee Stage the Minister will take on board some of our ideas in relation to extending management of the navigation on the main stem of the Shannon.  That will be for another day.  I do not think we will be asking the Minister to amend to any great extent that part of the Bill which deals with the opening of the new navigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Connor, I welcome the initiation of this legislation. I welcome it particularly because of the unifying influence of proposals in relation to bringing all our navigable waterways under the one authority.  As a first gesture, because I will have something to say in relation to the structure of that authority, while I have great confidence in the tradition and expertise of the Office of Public Works in regard to rivers, harbours, dredging, berthing etc. I believe that, having brought in the Erne and the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell areas under the one authority as a first goal, and having regard to the tremendous potential that the navigable waterways in Ireland have, there should be a <Col N="984" /> further expansion of the authority at a later stage.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on giving an historical record of the waterways and the interest they had for the Irish people in the early 18th century, but the enthusiasm and aspirations then were rather quickly reflected in the lack of commercial capacity to make a viable waterway of it.  In the nineties the situation has changed dramatically with the River Shannon linked to the River Erne and linked to the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell area, which will open up tremendous new challenges in tourism.  In today's world boating, canoeing and cruising are becoming major features and in today's marketing by Bord Fáilte of Ireland abroad there is no doubt that the River Shannon as it is and the River Erne in so far as the Northern Ireland tourism body go, are features which are very well sold especially in the German market and which have attracted great interest and substantial tourism incomes over the past eight to ten years.  However, to maintain and improve that, very substantial improvements will have to be made in berthing facilities, dredging and marking of routes and hazards on the waterways. This job will have to be undertaken enthusiastically once the major primary capital work has been undertaken.</P>
      <P>It must be pointed out that the whole of these navigable waterways are in our disadvantaged areas and so for any of the works included in major capital expenditure in any part of them Structural Funds should be made available.  The State's resources and those of the Office of Public Works sometimes are very limited. I say to the Minister that the mere setting up of a unified authority over all our waterways in the absence of the necessary finance to carry out the essential works would be doomed to as great a failure as possibly the original intention of having the waterways maintained as commercial navigable centres, to which we do not look forward today; but we look forward to developing their great tourism potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard Deputy Connor say &mdash; and I am in no position to challenge &mdash; that <Col N="985" /> the two bodies now responsible for the Shannon are the ESB and the Office of Public Works and they do not always see eye to eye about the nature of the development and the works that are needed.  In this field I urge that, having initially set up the body and got them functioning, there will be a necessity to widen that body substantially in order to deliver the expertise and knowledge.  The first people to come to mind who should be represented on a future Shannon navigation authority, as the Minister calls them, would be the local authority representatives of the lands, areas and counties adjoining these developments. There is in the spheres of county managers, of county engineers and of county representatives a tremendous reservoir of knowledge, expertise and goodwill and a growing and continuing anxiety to see their areas, their rivers and adjoining lands and their community benefiting to the highest degree from the natural beauty of these areas.  There are also the statutory tourist body who have a growing interest in and acknowledge fully the contribution our navigable waterways can make to a future expanding tourist industry, and there is a huge and growing volume of private investment that has been and continues to be put into the cruisers and boats on the Erne and the Shannon, and, I hope there will be the same interest in the new canal development. Within these categories there is wide enthusiasm for the proposed works outlined in the new Bill but there is also on-the-spot knowledge that is not always available to those who are administering from areas perhaps far removed from the area of the works under development. Therefore, while I welcome this legislation as a first step towards realising the tremendous potential our waterways have, I believe there should be a new, unified force involving the ESB, the Office of Public Works, local authorities, Bord Fáilte and those who are actively engaged in putting their resources on the waters to develop tourism.  All those bodies have a major contribution to make to a successful and continuing growth in the areas.</P>
    <P>With these few words I welcome the <Col N="986" /> legislation as it is now set out aimed at bringing into being a unifying force for a very valuable asset.  One reads the history here and we see that for 42 years virtually nobody has been responsible for part of the area now being taken over and from the records placed before the House this evening we see there has not been a meeting of the trustees who had responsibility since 1948.  That has been not an area of growth but, it would appear, one of neglect.  The new legislation in the first instance provides for the inclusion of the Office of Public Works but I hope in the interests of the whole of the west and of the Republic and Northern Ireland tourism we will have a wider, broader and substantially more effective national navigation board, involving in their representation and management all who are so concerned to ensure that our waterways are finally brought to achieve the maximum in the growth of wealth and employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I stand to give recognition to the Bill before us and to throw in the weight of The Workers' Party in support of the Bill as outlined to us.  The Shannon is being recognised more and more as the jewel in the crown of potential Irish tourism.  The opening up of what has not been navigable for nearly 100 years, a river course or a canal that will link us into Lough Erne in Northern Ireland and, it is hoped, into the tourist potential there, is a very important step in the right direction.  I hope that one day the Minister will also look at the Grand Canal and the Royal Canal which will have an important role to play in taking tourists from the east coast right across the country.  A fantastic dream I have had was to take the Grand Canal or the Royal Canal to the Shannon.  However, I would not get very far with the Royal Canal which at the Dublin end is an absolute disgrace.  The capital city deserves a better response from the Government through perhaps the Office of Public Works at least replacing the lock gates that are completely missing in the Dublin sections of the Royal Canal.  I am aware that some improvement works have been carried out recently on the Grand Canal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="987" /> That canal lay in the hands of CIE for a long time and they found no great use for it, but I am aware that Dublin Corporation are very keen as a local authority to assume responsibility for managing the banks of the canal and the river course as it stretches through their area of jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The Shannon is a jewel but one must ask where all the tourists will come from to spend their holidays on it.  I accept that Americans and others are interested in holidaying on the Shannon.  It is important that Bord Fálte market the links that exist between the capital city and the Shannon.  There is no doubt that with proper marketing tourists could be attracted to the Shannon region via the Royal and Grand Canals.  It is to our shame that we have not made more use of those canals though I accept that sections of those waterways are not navigable.</P>
    <P>I should like to make some observations about Bord Fáilte's new framework for the development of Irish tourism, their plan for tourism development. The board suggest that there be a doubling of tourism between 1988 and 1992 and they prepared a detailed plan for the Shannon-Erne development area. They raised a number of points about the environment and it is important that these should be highlighted.  The river system exists as a central corridor in the country joined at its northern end with the Erne through the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal.  The rivers, lakes and centres along the river are key tourist attractions because of their environment which is relatively unspoiled.  Bord Fáilte point out that there should be liaison between the State, local authorities and the farming community.  They have called for a formal co-ordinating mechanism to be created.  Bord Fáilte are concerned about the use of agricultural pesticides and the disposal of pig slurry.  It is their view that a deadline should be set for the elimination of all untreated sewage discharged into the water courses in the area.  Bord Fáilte also argue for a review <Col N="988" /> of Bord na Mona's techniques for minimising peat suspension discharges and subsequent silting of navigable and angling waters.  They say that is required to protect the system from visual intrusion of bad urban and industrial development.</P>
    <P>The Bord Fáilte report states that the development of the Shannon-Erne catchment area hinges on many State, county and local authorities.  To best ensure proper development and long term protection a formal co-ordinating mechanism should be established, according to the board, to reflect both the views of users and those with official and legal responsibilities.  The Minister should answer the claim that although he is establishing an authority, there are too many other interests involved but not in a co-ordinated way.  We must bear in mind that angling is very important to the area and that we should not concentrate on leisurely boating.  Will there be a negative effect from the silting caused by the suspended particles and by Bord na Móna?  When one considers those problems one will see the need for a mechanism to bring together the fisheries authorities, the Office of Public Works, the tourist interests and Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>Who will co-ordinate the approach between the agricultural sector, particularly those responsible for the development of piggeries, and those concerned about the environment?  We must be concerned about pollution by raw sewage or from piggeries both of which are deadly. There are so many interest groups involved that we should have a co-ordinated approach to the development of the area.  It is recognised by all that the attraction of the area now is its unspoiled beauty.  However, as it is developed there is a potential to undo some of its attractions. On a recent visit to Turkey I travelled from Istanbul to the Dardanelles and I noticed that outside Istanbul, which is being developed for tourists, the environment has been spoiled.  Will the Minister ensure that the Shannon area is not spoiled by the developments he is suggesting should take place?  I accept that the visual attraction of the area will not <Col N="989" /> be spoiled by craft mooring along the waterway but we must be on our guard about developments such as the erection of hotels, restaurants, shops and other facilities close to the river course.  We are all aware of the environmental damage that can be done by the erection of fuel stations along the river.  What monitoring will there be of those using the river?  Will every effort be made to ensure that they do not cause pollution by throwing their rubbish overboard?  The Minister should explain what anti-pollution controls he intends introducing to ensure that the users of the waterways and potential developers do not spoil the area.</P>
    <P>My big fear is that tasteless developments will turn tourists away from the area.  Does the Minister envisage setting up a special planning authority or board changed with protecting the environment against unsatisfactory developments on the river course?  The Government have placed great importance on the need to expand the tourist industry and it would be unfortunate if an authority was not established to guarantee for generations to come that private entrepreneurs in for a quick kill do not destory our environment? Bord Fáilte have suggested a series of improvements for angling and cruising. They have suggested the provision of shore facilities, water sports, and the need for information on wildlife and historical sites.  They have stressed the need for information services and amenities.  I should like to know how this project will be financed.  The last speaker told us that this was a £20 million project but, according to the Official Report of the Dáil proceedings, £16 million is the figure involved.  I understand that the Shannon, the Grand Canal and the borough systems, including the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canals will receive £17 million from the EC and £5.66 million from public bodies.  Will the Minister explain what amount of money we are talking about?  We have been told that the development of the Shannon project will help cross-Border tourism in that it will enable people to travel by boat from Fermanagh to the Shannon basin.  We have been told that revenue from Northern <Col N="990" /> Ireland tourists yielded only £46 million in 1988 but there seems to be a great reluctance to embark on a joint marketing approach between Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourism Board.  We have a golden opportunity to embark on such an approach.  There has been a lot of talk about developing friendly relations with our separated brethern in Northern Ireland and this is a golden opportunity to develop the water course in Northern Ireland and on this side of the Border through a joint venture.  We should jointly market the facilities that will be available.</P>
    <P>The main attraction will be the wild, uncluttered waterway and the sense of natural wilderness.  It will cater mainly for people escaping the stressful urban lifestyle to which so many of us have got used.  If it is not tastefully managed those who are most keen to use the facilities might find that the attractions have been spoiled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  Perhaps it is a selfish welcome because of the fact that most of the area with which it deals is near my home situated very close to the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal.</P>
      <P>I should like to pay a special tribute to the Minister of State for his efforts since coming to office with regard to the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal, to his predecessor, Deputy Treacy, to the Minister for the Marine in his former role of Minister for Tourism and to the present Minister for Tourism and Transport.  This has also been a major project initiated by the Taoiseach who, in his various roles over the past 20 years, has been very supportive of the proposed re-opening of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal.</P>
      <P>Deputy Connor mentioned a Shannon authority, which everybody would like to see.  The efforts made in regard to co-ordinating the work of the ESB, the Office of Public Works and others with a direct involvement in the Shannon are welcome and I hope that progress can be made as quickly as possible to try to relieve the regular flooding in the Shannon basin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the culmination of the efforts of <Col N="991" /> the Office of Public Works which go back to the seventies.  When it was first mooted that the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal should be opened it was felt that State resources at the time were not sufficient to allow the work to be carried out.  That position pertained for a number of years and it was not until the late seventies and early eighties that the tourism potential of the canal was realised.  We had seen the development of cruising on the River Shannon which had become a major source of revenue and recreation for many people.  It was a type of recreation which only waterways like the Shannon were in a position to offer.  As Deputy Byrne said earlier, it offered unspoiled coutryside.  Indeed, most people who cruised on the Shannon &mdash; unless they had a month &mdash; never made the full journey from Carrick-on-Shannon to Portumna or vice versa.  They did about four or five miles a day because they found that the people in the villages alongside it welcomed them with the open arms and were prepared to show that hospitality is still alive and well.</P>
    <P>The progress made in that regard in the past 20 years means that it is now a project which can go ahead because everybody knows that it is guaranteed success.  The fact that Shannon cruisers are practically 100 percent booked now for this year shows that it is the kind of holiday people want to take.  The cruisers are mainly booked by foreigners but the facility is also available to our own people although it is a recreational facility the value of potential of which we do not realise.  It is probably the most uncluttered waterway in Europe and one of the few where you can still see the bottom of the river in many places.  In places where you cannot see the bottom it is not due to pollution but to silting.</P>
    <P>The Rhine has become badly polluted over the past 20 years and it makes you realise why people are prepared to make a major sacrifice to spend their holidays on a waterway such as the Shannon.  The Shannon is now becoming crowded and it is time to provide extra facilities, which this Bill will do.  It will open the waterway <Col N="992" /> from the Shannon to the Erne.  It passes through an area of this country which has had least development and which will not be industrially developed, for obvious reasons.  One is because of its remoteness &mdash; although it is not as remote as many people think because Ballinamore is only a two hour drive from Dublin.  Indeed many places closer to Dublin take longer to reach by car.</P>
    <P>A sum of approximately £20 million has been put into an area to develop a facility which has not been operated and has remained unused practically from the time it was opened.  There were problems regarding boats on it in the early days but modern technology means that the problems which arose at that time will not recur in the nineties.  The people of the area have a great commitment to the project and never lost faith in it.  They are to be admired and are prepared to make the same effort to develop the area near the Shannon.  Towns such as Ballinamore, Ballyconnell, Belturbet, Leitrim Village and Keshcarrigan will benefit to an enormous extent from this development.  They need this type of development because they can only create wealth by tourism which is something for which they can cater.  I have no doubt that the people who make the journey up the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal from the Shannon or the Erne will find it a pleasant trip.</P>
    <P>In many ways it opens up a new waterway because you can now travel from Ballyshannon to Limerick by boat via Lough Erne and the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal.  The efforts of the Office of Public Works on the other canals are to be admired and I hope when this project is completed that the Office of Public Works who are at present carrying out a survey of the very short Lough Allen canal from Acres Lake to Lough Allen will find that the study will be successful and that the go-ahead can be given for the extension of the waterway system in the area.  Lough Allen, coupled with Garadice and Lough Erne, will probably provide the best inland waterway in the world for cruising.  It will give people an opportunity to see unspoilt development <Col N="993" /> and to mix with those in rural areas who do not want their environment destroyed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne was concerned that some developments might spoil the natural beauty of the area.  Any such development would be dealt with adequately by the local planning authorities in the two counties concerned because one who might try to carry out developments that would destroy the natural beauty of the area should be resisted tooth and nail by the local authority and by local planning officers.  It is to their credit that no development of a sinister nature has been allowed to go ahead.  In fact, proposals for many developments have been turned down on the basis that they would destroy the natural beauty of the area.</P>
    <P>The creation of a new cruising route is bound to attract the attention of people throughout Europe.  This will be the first new waterway of any significance to be developed for many years.  The last part of the canal to be developed was from Battlebridge to Acres Lake which was opened in 1977 or 1978.  This development enabled boats to go as far as the town of Drumshanbo, something they could not do before because the canal had been closed and become semi derelict. The Office of Public Works successfully carried out the work on the canal.  I believe that when Government saw how successful that development was they were encouraged to examine the possibility of opening up the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker referred to the angling potential of the area.  It is proposed in the plans which have been drawn up by the Board of Works and their consultants that the angling potential of the canal and the Woodford River should be fully exploited.  It is proposed that match fishing grounds be part of the development. I believe that such a development would be welcomed by the people of the area.  This is the area that the greatest number of coarse angling fishermen visit and nobody would like the facilities available for them to be affected by this development.  I do not think that it will happen but rather that the development <Col N="994" /> will add to the facilities which exist at present.</P>
    <P>The angling potential of the lakes in the area should also be exploited.  Garadice Lake and the Woodford River have been renowned through the years for the quality of the fish to be found in them.  In fact, they have been described by English anglers as the greatest inland and coarse fisheries in the world.</P>
    <P>We should not ignore the efforts that have been made by the Commissioners of Public Works who are responsible for the maintenance of the canal.  As has been said here, there has not been a Board of Trustees meeting since 1948.  I want to pay a special word of tribute to the members of the drainage board.  This project was initially meant to be for navigation with drainage potential included. The drainage board will no longer exist after the coming into operation of this Bill.  It would be unfair of us not to pay tribute to the people who gave voluntarily of their services on these boards.  As recently as two years ago the trustees of the board tried to collect drainage rates in the area but due to the indecision about the standing of the original Act they were unsuccessful in collecting the necessary moneys to enable them to carry out the drainage works.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision by the Board of Works that navigation will not be at the expense of the farming community. It has been decided to deepen the channel rather than raise the levels.  This is a welcome move.  Some reservation has been expressed about the raising of the levels of St. John's Lake and Lough Scur. I ask the Office of Public Works to ensure that adequate compensation is paid on a once off basis so that people can meet the project half way.  I hope the farming organisations will see a role for themselves as a liaison group in the settlement of any disputes which may arise.  I do not believe any major disputes will arise but there is always the danger where CPOs are involved that local agitation can lead to disgruntlement among certain individuals. The local farming organisations have said they are prepared to co-operate with the Office of Public Works in <Col N="995" /> reaching successful and speedy conclusions to compensation claims negotiations.</P>
    <P>The commitment of funds from the International Fund for Ireland to this project which has been signalled by both the British and Irish Governments as a major cross-Border project, means that it will hold a very significant platform in North-South co-operation.  The carrying out of work on this project will be an achievement which many people said ten years ago could not happen.  It was said at that stage that if one side agreed to the project the other side would not.  That attitude has disappeared and realism has started to come back into North-South co-operation. People realise that the commercial world must and will continue irrespective of any troubles which may be side issues.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government's commitment to this project has never been questioned. Despite numerous attempts by civil servants in the early days to classify this project as a white elephant, it has never been in that category.  It was said that the project could never succeed, that there was not sufficient cruiser traffic to take up the extra waterway.  Those doubts have now been dispelled.</P>
    <P>Because environmental matters have become so important throughout the EC I believe people will want to spend their leisure time in unpolluted areas.  This is an unpolluted area.  A previous speaker referred to the risk of pollution from farming and other sources.  I do not think that danger exists along the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal.  The people in this area respect their environment and they want to protect it.  The development of this resource which has lain unused for 100 odd years will bring money and other resources into the area.  I am glad it will be a flag ship project for Structural Funds.  I know that the Minister of State, the Minister for Finance and the Government will not be found wanting in promoting the case for Structural Funds for this development.</P>
    <P>The development of this canal will be as important to the people of this area as Knock Airport was to the people in the <Col N="996" /> west of Ireland.  People have sought this development for years.  It is a project which will have great tourism potential for many years to come.  It will give people an opportunity to meet the challenges which arise and will give individuals who live along the waterway the necessary incentive to develop their premises, whether these be guesthouses, restaurants, or other facilities in the Shannon and the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell areas.</P>
    <P>The facilities along this canal will need to be increased as time goes on.  It is a location where people can go to see something new as it were.  It will be a cruising location, the envy of all of our competitors.</P>
    <P>I hope Bord Fáilte will engage in the necessary campaign to ensure this facility is thoroughly marketed worldwide. There is no point in our spending money developing such a facility if we do not ensure its maximum usage.  If used to its maximum potential I predict this facility will be of greater benefit to the south Leitrim west Cavan area than a major industry and without incurring the same risks.  We must remember that a major industry can be closed overnight when people who have given commitments are left stranded.  This commitment will be continuous as far as its development is concerned, one that will not disappear overnight.  Indeed, it will be of more benefit to that area than, say, 200 to 300 jobs which would be regarded as a major coup in west Cavan south Leitrim.</P>
    <P>We are told the number of permanent jobs to be created will amount to ten to 12 only on maintenance but the number of spin-off jobs &mdash; in an area deprived of its youthful population over the past 20 years &mdash; will be the first attempt to restore life to that area.  It is an opportunity which must be seized in both hands by the Government with regard to its development, seeking funds from the EC Structural Fund and also from the IFI. This development must also be seized with both hands by the people in the area who must undertake the necessary effort to ensure its success.</P>
    <P>I predict it will be successful for two <Col N="997" /> reasons, the first tourists being afforded hospitality when they will return.  We must remember that only through repeated visits has cruising become the major industry it is today.  I will express one fear with regard to cruisers, that our cruising companies will be forced to operate in competition with those from Northern Ireland who have distinct advantages over their Southern counterparts.  This anomaly must be examined and rectified whether by way of tax incentive or the provisions of the business expansion scheme so that competition with regard to the hire of cruisers will be kept on an equal plane.</P>
    <P>This is a Bill I never thought I would see introduced in this House, having been talked about for so long.  However, like all things, if one maintains the pressure and keeps the matter before people's eyes eventually they come to realise that what is being sought is not some mythical development but rather one for the nineties, leading up to the year 2000, which can restore new life to a part of the country which has suffered enormously over the past 100 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I join other Members in welcoming this Bill.  I welcome it in general because of its much needed updating of the powers of the Commissioners of Public Works in relation to the navigation of the Shannon.  In particular I welcome the transfer of power to the Commissioners of Public Works for the restoration of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal.  This provision is the first practical step in rendering the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal once more navigable, the first practical step in linking the great waterways of the Shannon and the Erne, indeed also the first step in the realisation of what so many inland waterway enthusiasts still regard as the impossible dream.  Also as this &ldquo;junction canal&rdquo;&mdash; if I may describe it as such &mdash; becomes a reality once more, as the Erne waterways are linked with those of the Shannon, the centre of the Shannon navigation will move decisively upriver to Carrick-on-Shannon with a resultant major boost to tourism and morale for the whole of <Col N="998" /> County Leitrim.  As a Deputy representing the constituency I heartily welcome what will be undoubtedly a new flourishing of the area, a further realisation of its potential particularly in tourism.</P>
      <P>The Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal, when constructed in the mid-1800s, was the product of a grand design and also of a great disaster.  The grand design was of an Irish waterway network linking the Shannon, the Erne and Lough Neagh with access to the sea at Limerick, Ballyshannon, Coleraine, Belfast, Newry, Dublin and Waterford; the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell was to be the &ldquo;junction canal&rdquo; linking the Northern and Southern waters.  The great disaster to which I referred was the potato famine of the 1840s.  But for the resultant famine relief work it is extremely unlikely that the combined drainage and navigation works that became known as the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal would ever have been undertaken.</P>
      <P>The end product &mdash; at least as far as navigation was concerned &mdash; was a disaster of classical magnitude.  The canal was built at a total cost of £270,000 &mdash; say, £18 million in present-day money; in arriving at that calculation I had the assistance of the Central Bank so the figure must be relatively accurate.  Yet, the total number of boats that ever passed through it amounted to less than 18. Therefore, the cost worked out at well in excess of £1 million per boat.  I know the Chair &mdash; being a boatman himself &mdash; will readily appreciate that that was rather expensive boating.  As financial and commercial disasters come, one could not improve much on that.</P>
      <P>Now the important aspect is that the Ballinamore-Ballyconnel Canal exists and, before very long, we hope will finally fulfil its role, its destiny as the &ldquo;junction canal&rdquo;, linking the waterways North and South, becoming as fine an inland waterways system as could be found anywhere worldwide and, by way of bonus, a highly visual manifestation of practical co-operation across the Border between North and South.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="999" /> Although some work had been undertaken in the 1780s in rendering the Woodford River navigable, the real possibilities of a &ldquo;junction canal&rdquo; emerged for the first time with the establishment of the Commissioners of Public Works in the 1830s, through a series of Acts following in quick succession, giving them power and encouragement to become involved in public works, drainage and navigation. of course, that had as much to do with the employment provided as with the construction undertaken.</P>
    <P>The commissioners devised what would be classified now in their headquarters in St. Stephen's Green a design scheme, undertaking a cost/benefit analysis of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal.  In producing that cost/benefit analysis of that elaborate project &mdash; which in modern terms would cost in the region of £18 million &mdash; they attained their objective much faster than their design scheme and cost/benefit analysis for the Oranmore and Arrow catchment area in my constituency.  Because the commissioners had been established only a short time previously &mdash; and certainly not for the last time &mdash; their estimates were very wide of the mark.  The original estimated cost was £100,000.  The final cost was £270,000 &mdash; or approximately £18 million in present-day money terms &mdash; and I am not aware of any inflationary pressures at that time.  Even at an estimated cost of £100,000 nothing happened; the project was shelved and would have remained so except for the first failure of the potato crop in 1846 and the resultant clamour for relief works.</P>
    <P>The drainage part of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal was begun in 1846 and the navigation in 1847.  We must remember that at that time there were no JCBs or Hi-Macs around.  At first the only machinery or aid available was in the form of wheelbarrows and the first order placed by the new drainage people was for 200 wheelbarrows at a cost of £112.  It will be clearly seen that wheelbarrows did not come cheap even then. <Col N="1000" /> There were orders placed also for a quantity of picks and shovels, later supplemented in large measure by supplies from the famine relief stores in Belturbet, Cavan, Sligo, Enniskillen and Swanlinbar. However, by the year 1849 they had graduated to a dredger of sorts and later even constructed their own steam dredger in the special canal works in Belturbet.  By 1850 there was a horse tramway in place to help move the stones and soil from the summit cutting at Letterfine to Lough Scor.</P>
    <P>The Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal may not have done much up to this time for navigation but it did provide employment. In the initial stages 7,000 people were employed there but by the end of 1850 this number was down considerably to 2,650 with great complaints that they could not find enough labourers to work on it.  Apparently, they had a fine summer and some of the farmers preferred to work on their own holdings rather than work on the canal.</P>
    <P>The undertaking was a difficult job of construction by any standards especially as it encompassed, and this is still relevant, drainage and navigation with at times conflicting demands.  The total length of the canal was 38 miles &mdash; five miles of stillwater navigation, eight miles of channel through six lakes and the rest through the canalised course mainly of the Woodford River.  The original depth was to be six feet but later as money became scarce it was readjusted to four feet six inches.  Unfortunately, they did not always scrape the bottom sufficiently and in many places it is only three feet six inches deep, as subsequent inquiries revealed.  Even though steam towage had been established on the Shannon and even though the canal passed through six lakes, for some extraordinary reason the Commissioners of Public Works insisted on very costly towpaths where possible. Given that there were 16 locks, bridges, weirs, river diversions, fish passes and lock-keeper houses, we can see that this was a mammoth project considering the lack of machinery.</P>
    <P>Work on this project was more or less completed in 1858 and an official trial <Col N="1001" /> took place.  A trade boat was hired from the Ulster Canal Company and it managed to make the trip from Lough Allen to Lough Erne bringing with it tiles, gravel, corn and other commodities.  I hope the Minister of the day was not involved in the official trip, as is now the custom, as it took four weeks to complete but of course it traded along the way.</P>
    <P>On 4 July 1860 control of the navigation passed out of the hands of the Commissioners of Public Works &mdash; a process we are seeking to reverse in this Bill. The Commissioners of Public Works had a hard job in getting rid of it to a board of trustees from the counties of Cavan, Leitrim, Roscommon and Fermanagh. The trustees &mdash; the locals &mdash; obviously knew they were on to a loser.  However, they advertised the least of the tolls and of water power for mills along the way. They got no taker for the tolls and just one, at £5 a year, for water for a cornmill. They also sold hay from the banks.</P>
    <P>There are differing opinions about the number of boats that used the canal but it was definitely not more than 18.  Total revenue from the tolls amounted to no more than £18 in all.  The result was inevitable closure and the last boat to make it through from the Erne to the Shannon was the <i>Audax</i> in 1873.  One thing that can be said about the commissioners is that they were triers.  Patrick Flanagan in his excellent book <i>The Ballinamore &amp; Ballyconnell Canal</i> states that they advertised the Ballinamore and Ballyconnell navigation district up to 1864.  They did not sell themselves cheap. In referring to the potential for trade they stated in one of their advertisements:</P>
    <P>It connects the Shannon Navigation and the south of Ireland, with the Ulster and Newry canals on the North; and joins the Coal Mines and Iron Mines, and Gypsum Quarries of the Lough Allen District, with the several water communications in the North and South of Ireland ... The Lough Erne Steam Company's splendid steamer now plies daily on the lakes.</P>
    <P>The trustees will entertain, on most Liberal Terms, any application from <Col N="1002" /> Parties willing to develope the Traffic of this extensive and improving District.</P>
    <P>They recieved no reply despite the fact that the advertisement appeared in publications throughout the country.  Therefore, what went wrong with this project? As we know, there was no worthwhile local traffic, the revival of the Arigna coal mines did not take place until much later and the Ulster Canal Company, who to a great extent through their pleas encouraged the building of the Ballinamore and Ballyconnell Canal in turn were in trouble.  The railways began to take over from the canals and the truth is that it really never was a viable proposition.</P>
    <P>Somewhat later than the canal, the trustees also disappeared but not before we had the very odd situation in the forties where the only existing trustees were the three trustees appointed by Fermanagh County Council to control the canal, 22 miles of which was in Leitrim and eight in Cavan.</P>
    <P>It is only right that I pay tribute to Leitrim County Council.  They were always very careful about this matter and not over-enthusiastic in the past about their obligations to keep it going but in fairly recent times they showed remarkable foresight.  When the Cavan and Leitrim Railway Company constructed bridges across the canal in the 1880s they constructed them to a low design on the grounds that no boat would pass that way again but when Leitrim County Council replaced a bridge across the canal at Carrickmackeegan in 1971 they opted for a very high design with banked approaches leaving plenty of headroom for anything likely to come underneath.  They are smart boys in County Leitrim.</P>
    <P>What remains of the Ballinamore and Ballyconnell project and what have we to hand back to the Commissioners of Public Works in reversing the process of 4 July 1860?  I am certain this Bill will get an easy passage from this side of the House and perhaps the Minister might hand it back on 4 July this year, the anniversary of the date it left the hands of the Office of Public Works initially.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1003" /> The remains of the project were described by a colourful trustee, John Grey Vesey Porter in 1881 as &ldquo;one of the most shameful pieces of mismanagement in any country &mdash; not in Turkey could there be such a piece of mismanagement&rdquo;. Why he picked on Turkey I do not know but it was described later by another authority on inland waterways, Major Harry Lefroy, as &ldquo;the finest canal that was built in Britain up to that time&rdquo;. Despite all the failures, with the subsequent decline and decay and with the ravages of time and the elements, the important thing to remember is that the Ballinamore and Ballyconnell Canal remains.  Because of its nature no one was able to visit on it the same fate visited upon the disused Harcourt Street railway line.  Because it remains, and for no other reason, we can now look forward to it finally fulfilling its destiny of joining the waters of the Erne and Shannon for navigation.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Commissioners of Public Works must feel a certain sense of history as this legislation goes through.  Their job will be to complete the work and the vision of the first commissioners.  I have the utmost confidence they will do so superbly.  It was my privilege as Minister of State at the Department of Communications to put through the legislation giving them control over the other canals. Already their good work is evident in that area.  Sometimes the commissioners make mistakes.  So do we all.  They make miscalculations perhaps as to the length of time it takes to do a job, or in estimates, but this is a small price to pay for the heritage they have left us.</P>
    <P>Restoration of this canal will be a difficult job especially with the obligations of drainage and navigation which now exist exactly as they existed before but of course with more sophisticated methods of tackling them.  Sometimes there are conflicting demands but I have confidence that the commissioners can do it. Already my colleague, Deputy Connor, has pointed out these difficulties and has outlined some that may arise.  The area now comes under the same framework as <Col N="1004" /> the rest of the country as far as the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, is concerned. The Office of Public Works has vast experience in all of this region.  I hope there will be no conflicts with the local farmers, that they will get an adequate and much improved drainage scheme.  Perhaps the Minister would also explain the exact meaning of his statement that henceforth responsibility for maintenance of these works would lie directly with the local authorities.  I know they were the responsibility of the drainage trustees and I know that the drainage trustees could recoup from the local authorities. However I would like the Minister to explain if that is the same obligation that pertains to all other parts of the country or if, because of its particular history, there is a special obligation here which is not borne by other parts of the country.  I know the Minister will be pleased to explain that to us.</P>
    <P>The decision to make the reopening of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal one of the first commitments of the EC Structural Funds was particularly appropriate. This is the kind of concept for which the structural funds were intended.  The canal will open up a whole new vista of tourism for the area as the pleasure boats go through from the Shannon to the Erne and from the Erne to the Shannon.  It will help in job creation.  It will help in spin-off industry and it will do something particular for this area: it will lift the morale of the whole area and that is a good thing. In turn it will introduce the visitor coming there to a beautiful, unspoiled, pollution-free area with excellent fishing, abounding wild life and in very special botanical interest areas.  They are also coming into an area which, despite all these amenities and advantages I speak of, is yet largely undiscovered countryside.  The Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal will link two noble waterways, excellent in themselves, but joined together as they are now about to be, they will equal any inland waterway anywhere in the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this Bill and congratulate the Minister on giving <Col N="1005" /> a very detailed and interesting history of the Shannon over many years.</P>
      <P>The decision to reconstruct the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal is unique. As the previous speaker said, it will link two huge waterways, the Shannon and Erne systems.  It is a monumental task which will take much planning and a lot of work but at the end of the day we will have one of the finest stretches of waterway in Europe.  It will have drawing power and be a terrific tourist attraction in an area where there is little industrial and agricultural employment.  This is happening at a time when there is greater emphasis on the development of tourist potential than ever before.  The waterways of Germany, France, Holland, Denmark and other countries are heavily polluted.  One only has to look out of a train to see this.  We are fortunate to have very little pollution particularly in that area.  At a time when the attraction of sun holidays is reduced the added advantages of coming to a country like Ireland are that there is not the same density of road traffic and there is much emphasis on water sports etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A previous speaker said that he did not think he would see the day when the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal would be developed.  I get particular satisfaction from this development because as far back as 1975 I and a number of other public representatives across the Border, quietly at the beginning and without fuss or publicity, came together and eventually set up the Erne Catchment Drainage Committee.  At that time in the mid-seventies there was great co-operation from all public representatives North and South irrespective of religious persuasion, even though at that time there was a lot of strife in the Border areas. That committee embraced Cavan, Leitrim, Monaghan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Derry and Tyrone and was very effective.  The Erne catchment study, the most comprehensive ever carried out in all the Border region at that time, was carried out by two teams of consultants, Brady Shipman Martin and PA Consultants Limited.  They came up with a report on drainage, tourism and agriculture <Col N="1006" /> for that region.</P>
    <P>In 1980 the committee decided to seek a meeting with the Taoiseach and the Minister of State in Stormont. We met the Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, here in Leinster House and asked him to examine various issues which included the major issue of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal.  In advance we sent a submission that the Minister for Transport and Tourism, the Minister for Finance and other Ministers of State should attend the meeting along with the senior engineering officials from the Office of Public Works to discuss the Erne catchment in terms of a drainage scheme and the Ballinamore-Ballyconnel canal as a waterway and as a tourist attraction.  We had a full discussion with local authorities North and South and in mid-January we were to meet the Minister of State in Stormont.  The morning I was due to travel with the Monaghan county manager to Stormont, I received a telephone call at 9.30 to say that one of the H-Block hunger strikers had died and that it was more prudent to cancel our meeting.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the Fine Gael Criminal Justice Bill is to amend the law relating to criminal proceedings so as to provide for the review of sentences that are considered to be too lenient.  From time to time controversy erupts in relation to sentences imposed by the courts on convicted criminals.  In all cases a convicted person has the right to appeal against the actual conviction or <Col N="1007" /> against the severity of the penalty imposed.  Controversy usually focuses on situations where it is perceived that the sentence imposed was too lenient.  At present the State does not have the power to seek a review of any such sentence. The Whitaker report states that serious crimes, and it specifically mentioned murder and rape:</P>
      <P>will always, be reason of their innate seriousness, either by statutory mandate or by the exercise of judicial discretion require the imposition of the penalty of imprisonment.</P>
      <P>I specifically quote that report because it is better known for its proposals in relation to alternatives to custody, indeed for improving the situation in our prisons. Even though that was the central thrust of the report it specifically indicated that certain offences, because of their innate seriousness, required the imposition of the penalty of imprisonment.  Yet there have been instances when people convicted of such crimes have not been so sentenced.</P>
      <P>Under Article 35 of the Constitution all judges are independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and subject only to the Constitution and the law. Let me be very specific; I believe the independence of the Judiciary has been the solid base on which our democratic system has been built and should not be interfered with.  On the other hand, judges, being human, are not infallible and for that reason their decisions should be subject to review.  There is, therefore, a case for giving the State the power to seek a review of a sentence where it appears to the Director of Public Prosecutions that the sentencing of a person in a proceeding in Criminal Court has been unduly lenient.  Such a procedure, as I understand it, is a feature of the criminal justice systems in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently an extensive survey on crime was carried out in the Clontarf Garda district.  Included in the survey was the question whether the residents in the area felt that such a power should be given to <Col N="1008" /> the Director of Public Prosecutions.  It is interesting that in response to that question in the survey there was overwhelming support, 92 per cent, for the Fine Gael proposal to allow the Director of Public Prosecutions to challenge a sentence, if in his opinion it was too lenient.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Criminal Justice Bill, 1990, is to give such a power to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I should mention in passing that such a power exists in the United Kingdom; it was introduced some years ago and was given to the Attorney General.  On reflection I think that, since the Director of Public Prosecutions is the normal person involved in prosecuting cases, he would be in a better position to judge whether, in fact, an application should be made. He would be aware of the full facts of the case and have full reports from his legal teams.  For that reason I felt it was not wise to follow the British precedent of giving this power to the Attorney General, and came to the view that it should be given to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>In any criminal case which has been decided by the Central Criminal Court, the Special Criminal Court or the Circuit Criminal Court, the DPP will under this Bill, be empowered, where he considers the sentence to have unduly lenient, to refer the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal to seek a review of the sentence. Again I must mention that I have concentrated on the higher courts.  I did not include the decisions of the District Court &mdash; indeed there are an enormous number of such decisions in the District Court. Generally, serious charges are not normally brought in the District Court. There is a limit on the maximum term of imprisonment and generally the District Court is a court of summary jurisdiction. The thrust of my Bill is in relation to serious rather than minor crime or particular cases of summary jurisdiction.  I decided not to include the District Court in the Bill which I drafted.  If other Members of the House have alternative views, I am prepared to listen to them, but, having considered the matter, I <Col N="1009" /> believe that this is probably the better approach.</P>
    <P>If the Director of Public Prosecutions comes to the view that the case should be referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal, that court will then have the power to quash any sentence passed and in place of it to pass such sentence as the Court of Criminal Appeal considers appropriate for the case.  Of course, the Court of Criminal Appeal could not pass any sentence which was beyond the sentencing court's power to pass; obviously it could go beyond any statutory maximum.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of justice being done and being seen to be done, it would be entirely inappropriate for a trial judge to sit in the Court of Criminal Appeal on such an application, and the Bill provides that no judge shall sit as a member of the Court of Criminal Appeal dealing with a reference, under the Act, of a sentence passed by him.  The Bill also provides for reference to the Supreme Court but, of course, only on a point of law involving public importance.  That is the normal procedure, in that the Supreme Court has a special remit in that regard in dealing with points of law of public importance. If there is such a reference, the Supreme Court will be empowered to give their decision on the point of law and at that stage they can either remit the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal for final decision or alternatively the Supreme Court itself will be empowered to deal with the case under the terms of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The background to this proposal is the need for broad consistency in sentencing policy.  The Criminal Justice Bill which I now present to the House will help to achieve that objective, particularly if the Minister takes on board another proposal of mine which is not a legislative one but more an administrative one.  The objective of consistency in sentencing policy will be helped if we pass this Bill into law but in addition the presidents of the different courts should have regular conferences of judges to discuss their respective experiences.  It is a very unwise saving on the part of the Minister for Justice and his Department to refuse to approve travelling expenses to judges <Col N="1010" /> who wish to attend such meetings.  Essentially I am suggesting a two-pronged approach: firstly, the legislative one which would involve the review by the Court of Criminal Appeal where the Director of Public Prosecutions feels the original sentence was unduly lenient and, secondly, the adminstrative approach, that the presidents of the respective courts, the High Court, the Circuit Court and indeed the District Court, would be encouraged to have these regular conferences. My understanding from the Judiciary is that they would be very keen to hold conferences, and also that where proposals have been made in the past it has been made clear that they could not go ahead for one simple reason, the travelling expenses of the judges would not be paid to attend such conferences.  That seems to be a crazy policy.</P>
    <P>On the question of the conferences of judges, it is relevant to refer to that portion of the Whitaker report which deals with court sentencing practice.  It is worth taking note of the views of Mr. Ken Whitaker and his colleagues on this point.  It states:</P>
    <P>Maximum custodial penalties are usually fixed by statute.  In deciding a sentence in a particular case, the court takes into account factors such as the gravity of the offence, features which aggravate or mitigate the seriousness of the offence, the level of sentences common in similar cases, the need to maintain a balance with sentences for other kinds of offences and the circumstances of the accused.  An appeal against the severity of sentence lies to a higher court.  This helps to ensure consistency in sentencing practice.  We believe that consistency in sentencing would be helped further by regular judicial conferences on sentencing practice, the setting of guidelines by the judges themselves and by the judges introducing training in sentencing standards and techniques.</P>
    <P>I present that view by way of support for the second part of my proposal which is that, apart from accepting this Bill, the Minister should ensure that those regular <Col N="1011" /> conferences of judges to which I have referred take place.</P>
    <P>On the question of consistency of sentencing, consideration has to be given to the position of the victims of crime.  To a large extent the victims of crime have been, if not ignored, at least insufficiently considered in relation to judicial procedures in the past.  I noted that at their annual conference the Irish Association for Victim Support highlighted the concern that some victims of crime had expressed in relation to what they termed derisory sentences.  Obviously that would be a subjective opinion but it is fair to say that in some instances at least the view in relation to derisory sentences is shared on an objective basis by members of the general public.  It is appropriate at this stage for us to consider what are the views of victims in relation to the sentences imposed for serious crime; indeed what are the views of victims in relation to the whole criminal procedure as far as they are concerned.</P>
    <P>The Director of Public Prosecutions, in his major speech to the Incorporated Law Society in Killarney, expressed his concern for the victims of crime and indicated the possible need for changes in procedures from the point of view of notifying the victims in relation to any pre-bargining process and of advising them as to how proceedings in which they were involved were going.  I do not intend to go into the issue in any great detail at this stage other than to agree with the view to a large degree we will have to consider ways in which we can bring the victims to the centre rather than leaving them on the periphery of the judicial process.  There will have to be far greater consideration for them.  I think many victims of crime would feel greater consolation and comfort, in so far as it can be made available to them, in the knowledge that the Director of Public Prosecutions would have the power which I am proposing in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Another view expressed very forcibly by the Director of Public Prosecutions in the major speech he made in Killarney was the need to codify and update the <Col N="1012" /> law.  I am all in favour of the codification of the criminal law.  This legislation proposal I am making is not in any way counter to that view.  Obviously codifying the criminal law will take some time.  In the meantime we should make efforts in the different areas to also update the law. While I strongly urge the view that a criminal law reform commission should be established with a particular role in relation to the codification of the law, at the same time we should be dealing with loopholes and lacunae in the law as they present themselves, and, in particular, proposing solutions where possible.  I mention that in the context of making it clear that this proposal does not in any way substitute for any effort to codify the criminal code in general.</P>
    <P>When considering this proposal we have to look at what has been happening in relation to crime in general in recent years.  At present about 90,000 indictable crimes are recorded every year.  These figures can be to some extent misleading. I think there is a general perception that a substantial amount of indictable crime is not reported at all.  It is interesting to refer to the recent Clontarf survey which demonstrated that over 20 per cent of the crimes which occurred in that area in the previous 12 months were not reported to the Garda.  I accept that is just one survey but it is there by way of confirmation of the general perception that we all have about the non-reporting of crime.  I mention that from the point of view of the enormous increase in crime that has taken place.  I am not pointing the finger at the Minister because it has not just taken place in the last number of years; I am thinking of a much longer time span. If there is about 90,000 recorded crimes and about 20 per cent is not reported, there are well over 100,000 cases of indictable crime being committed each year.  The detection rate, at about one-third of recorded crime, suggests that there are about 60,000 indictable crimes undetected plus about 20,000 unreported. These are horrific figures and indicate a major change in society over the years.  In the forties the number of recorded crimes was slightly less than <Col N="1013" /> 15,000.  That figure increased to 26,000 by the end of the sixties and yet now we are talking about a figure of 90,000 recorded and perhaps over 100,000 unreported crimes.  That is an increase of at least six-fold, not seven-fold.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of committing crime it is clear that various new approaches must be adopted.  Part and parcel of that approach must be reform of the criminal code and its updating.  The proposal I am putting before the House fits into that category.</P>
    <P>I would like to say one other thing which I consider to be important in relation to this legislation.  I do not see this proposal as being in any way consistent with my support for the various recommendations in the Whitaker report from the point of view of alternatives to custody.  The measure I am proposing is to deal with sentencing policy in relation to serious crime.  I support the various proposals to provide alternatives to custody in particular, for minor offenders.  I have outlined before how this can be done.  I am talking about the payment of fines by instalment rather than by having people committed to jail because they cannot find the money to pay the fines imposed on them.  We are talking about attachment of income, confiscation of property, greater use of community service orders, restitution to the victim of the crime and general powers to the courts to require attendance at treatment centres, residence in approved hostels, participation in training programmes and restriction of offenders at specified times to their places of residence.  There is no conflict whatever with the proposal to establish those alternatives to custody and at the same time to provide the Director of Public Prosecutions with the power to appeal a sentence after a criminal has been convicted by the court where the Director of Public Prosecutions considers such a sentence to be too lenient.</P>
    <P>I want to give my colleague, Deputy Fennell, an opportunity to comment on the Bill so I will conclude my initial presentation by indicating that we all have to accept that there has been a huge escalation in serious crime in Ireland in <Col N="1014" /> the past 20 or 30 years.  As legislators we have a responsibility to put forward proposals as to how that serious problem should be tackled.  I accept that the response to the huge increase in crime is multifaceted.  There are many areas that need to be looked at from the point of view of the Garda Síochána, the prison system, the victims of crime and the codification of the criminal law.</P>
    <P>The enormity of the job should not deter us from making specific proposals, such as the one I am putting before the House.  This should be part &mdash; admittedly a relatively small part &mdash; of our response to that crime wave.  It is clear from the public outrage that has been expressed from time to time in relation to a number of cases that there is need for this change in our law.  I urge the Minister and my colleagues in the House from the other parties to support the proposal I am suggesting in the Bill, to give the Director of Public Prosecutions the right to appeal sentence, to the Court of Criminal Appeal in cases where he considers the penalty to be too lenient.  I urge too, that my other proposal, which is non-legislative, be supported, that is, that conferences of judges can take place to improve the consistency of sentencing policy.  Accordingly, I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy O'Keeffe, for allowing me some time to comment on this Bill which is long overdue.  I welcome the Bill and urge the Minister to seriously consider it and, if at all possible, to accept it because there is a lacuna in our law which the Bill, as presented would fill.  I have no doubt but that this proposal would have public approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Traditionally in our courts it has been possible for a convicted person to appeal against conviction or against the severity of a penalty imposed.  This is as it should be.  I believe in the principle of appeal.  It is something we would defend absolutely but it puts in stark contrast the position regarding the State.  There is no possibility for the State to seek a review of any sentence where it is perceived to be too <Col N="1015" /> lenient.  I am sure other speakers will deal with specific incidences but I will mention a couple of cases that have come to public attention.  Indeed, there have been cases in the jurisdiction of our nearest neighbours, mostly cases of violence, specifically in areas of rape and sexual violence against women, in which very inadequate sentences have been handed down.  It has been impossible and very frustrating to try to respond to inadequate sentencing in Ireland because decisions are absolute. There was the specific case of a member of the Defence Forces who admitted raping a young girl.  He got a ludicrous sentence.  There was justified outrage as a result and I had strong words to say at the time.  The courts are the arena in which serious issues such as this are decided.  I have the utmost confidence in our Judiciary and it gives me no pleasure at any time to be critical of the actions of our judges but there is inconsistency in regard to penalties.  Admittedly, we are far from hearing the kind of remark in our courts that was made recently in an English court in which a judge said that in his opinion when a woman said &ldquo;no&rdquo; she very often meant &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  A journalist telephoned me to ask what I thought of that remark.  At first I would not believe it could have been made by a judge.  It was incredible.</P>
    <P>On the one hand we are dealing with a group of people who, perhaps, are a little out of touch and who have carried into their profession some of their prejudices or old fashioned notions.  Even if we scream at people in that position on a regular basis and monitor how they measure up on chart of bias, as it were, there is nothing more we can do unless we accept this Bill.  The Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Bill, 1988 [Seanad] is going through this House.  I spoke on that Bill when I was in the Seanad and at that time welcomed the proposal to bring cases from the Circuit Criminal Court to the Central Criminal Court.  I believed this would make it possible for the State to appeal for a review of sentences.  That belief was based on the contribution of a very learned Member of <Col N="1016" /> the Seanad at that time.  I checked it out with a few people and nobody seemed very clear about it.  Can the State not appeal a lenient sentence imposed in the Central Criminal Court?  It seems that is so, and that is why we need this legislation. The need for it is self-evident.  The need has been expressed and classified by so many groups over the years that we are fortunate to have a Bill now on the table and all we have to do is debate it and make any proposals or amendments needed, but the Minister should allow it to go through.</P>
    <P>Public outrage develops when the public perceive a sentence coming from the court on a serious charge as being too lenient, and we see a second trial by media.  The trial has gone ahead, the decision has been taken, and then because there is public outrage, the media and the commentators have their say.  This is not right.  It is understandable that people are angry and feel helpless and frustrated and tend not to see the courts serving their needs adequately. This is bad for our ego and for our judicial system.  It brings the law into disrepute and to hold our judges up to ridicule cannot be good.  They have a very prestigious place, deservedly held under the Constitution and we should defend and protect that right.  Therefore, the principle of appeal must be extended and made possible in the instances I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I am particularly sensitive about this area.  I have spoken to a number of rape victims.  One case is stamped on my mind. A young married woman who lived in Tallaght was the subject of extreme violence, probably eight or nine years ago. She met me and talked with me.  When she was married for about a year, a man broke into the house, chained her husband in the bathroom next door to the bedroom, held her in the bedroom for about six hours and raped her continuously. That man got out on bail and subsequently received a very lenient sentence. That is a classic case.  I saw the woman's anger and fear and I realised that she will never recover from what happened to her.  I suppose her situation <Col N="1017" /> would not be made easier but she would probably be able to accept it if she saw the person who committed that crime, heinous in anybody's book, punished adequately or if the court had not imposed a satisfactory sentence, there could have been an appeal and the State, the DPP, had authority to go back to seek a review of sentence.  I say this meaning that the full facts, all the details, would be re-examined.  I am not suggesting that in every case I want very punitive sentences imposed by virtue of the fact that there was an appeal.  I would accept that in a review all the facts would be taken into account and a new decision could be taken based on those facts, but we will not feel that justice is adequately being done if that facility is not there.  If the case goes to appeal and the sentence is upheld on appeal, people will feel that justice has been done and the full process of the law has been observed.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to accept this Bill which is badly needed, is timely and will serve a very real need in society today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, I would like to commend Deputy O'Keeffe on the work he has put into preparing this Bill.  I appreciate the arguments he has made for it which I know are motivated by a concern to improve the administration of justice in our courts, but I am afraid, nevertheless, that I must oppose his Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My opposition to it is not based on any rejection in principle of what it seeks to do.  It may well be that a system of appeal against what are perceived to be over-leninent sentences along the lines of that in the Bill is a good idea.  There is a problem and I accept that.  Cases do arise from time to time where there is public dissatisfaction at a sentence imposed by the courts because it is felt to be too lenient.  Often in such cases it may be <Col N="1018" /> simply that the public are unaware of all the facts and all the circumstances which led a judge to impose a particular sentence. Information may be available to a judge which is not available to the public, such as psychological reports and reports on the background and circumstances of the accused.  These may have a significant bearing on the sentences imposed.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of the decisions made in our courts are just and fair.  It is only very infrequently that a case arises where there is a decision made which gives rise to widespread public disquiet and where, even allowing that a report of a case is no substitute for presence at the trial, it is difficult to contemplate any circumstances which could have led to that decision.  We all recognise these cases when they arise.  These occur perhaps at a rate of one or two over several years.  I cannot say what percentage they would represent of all cases disposed of, but I am sure it is very small indeed.  I think we should be clear in our minds that it is only these infrequent &ldquo;problem&rdquo; cases we must address.  I certainly would not like to see prosecution appeals, if they are allowed, being taken as a matter of routine as it were.  This would be uncalled for.</P>
    <P>I do accept, as I said, that occasionally mistakes are made and sentences are imposed which simply do not fit the crime.  These cases cause a great deal of public concern and can reflect badly on the courts themselves.  I agree, therefore, with the Deputy that we must look at the system to see if we can devise some procedure, some method, by which these mistakes can be corrected or, better still, be avoided if possible.  I know that this is what Deputy O'Keeffe is attempting to do in this Bill.  As I said, I share his concern.  What I disagree with is his approach in proposing this Bill at this stage.  In explaining why I take this view I may seem unduly critical of the Deputy's initiative.  I would like, therefore, to assure him and the House at the outset that to the extent that I am critical my only intention is to be constructive and to address the problem about which we <Col N="1019" /> both are concerned in the most appropriate way.</P>
    <P>In an area like this where there are complex issues to be addressed legislation should, in my view, only follow detailed and expert examination.  Basically, the Deputy's Bill is a copy of provisions in the English Criminal Justice Act, 1988. The fact that a procedure has been introduced in Britain does not mean that it can be uncritically transplanted to our jurisdiction.  While I agree that our legal system has much in common with that in Britain, I need hardly remind Deputies that we do not always find the latter to be without flaw.  I think we should examine the matter ourselves to ensure, as a minimum, that if we do import a procedure from another jurisdiction, it is the best available.</P>
    <P>The problem to be addressed is not an easy one.  Complex and fundamental issues going to the very heart of our legal traditions are involved.  No doubt recognising these complexities, the Attorney General to the last Government in which Deputy O'Keeffe's party were a partner requested the Law Reform Commission to examine and report on the whole question of sentencing policy.  Due to the heavy work programme in which the commission have been engaged, I understand that they have not as yet been able to undertake this examination.  However, because of the obvious concern about this matter the Attorney General has, at my request, asked the commission to afford high priority to this examination and this they have agreed to do.</P>
    <P>In an issue as complex and fundamental as this it is vital that we have the advice and recommendations of an expert body like the Law Reform Commission before we take any action.  The processes employed by the commission are ideally suited to examination of such matters.  They can research the area thoroughly and canvass views from a wide range of interested parties.  They also have the facilities to establish how this problem, as I am sure that it is not one unique to us, is tackled in other jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1020" /> They are also in a position to consider the problem in its widest context.  There is more to be looked at in terms of sentencing policy than just the problem of over-lenient sentences.  For example, uniformity is also an important issue to be addressed.  It would, therefore, be percipitate and wrong in my view to proceed without awaiting the commission's recommendations.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to Deputy O'Keeffe and to the House that there is nothing to be lost and much to be gained by being a little patient in this matter.  The commission will, I have no doubt, proceed with their examination with expedition and provide us with, as is their practice, a detailed and well considered report which can then form the basis for appropriate action.  This is by far the better way to proceed.</P>
    <P>I referred to the procedure being proposed in the Bill as representing a fundamental change in criminal procedure. Without going into too much detail and while keeping an open mind on the issue I would like to illustrate what I mean.</P>
    <P>Some might argue that the procedure proposed in the Bill would be an infringement of the rule against double jeopardy. This rule seeks to establish equity in the context of criminal proceedings between the State and the citizen.  In a criminal prosecution an accused person faces the might and resources of the State and, in the interests of fairness, it is accepted that he should not be obliged to face such an ordeal again if the State fails to prove its case against him.  It is well recognised internationally.  It is enshrined in many international treaties dealing with such matters as extradition and mutual assistance in the criminal field.  Strictly speaking, the concept of double jeopardy relates to the question of acquittal.  Nonetheless it could be argued that a procedure which would permit a person convicted and sentenced to face the possibility of having his case further reviewed as to sentence should be at least looked at from the point of view of this concept.</P>
    <P>This Bill raises the important question of whether conferring a right of appeal <Col N="1021" /> against what the prosecution might consider an over-lenient sentence would be consistent with the concept of fairness.  If we accept that a person has been tried before a court and has been sentenced by a judge who is charged with that function under the Constitution, should that person have to suffer further uncertainty by allowing the prosecution to seek to have the sentence increased?  Could we not be accused of permitting double punishment if we were to allow this to happen?</P>
    <P>Take a concrete example.  Suppose a person is convicted of an offence and receives a suspended sentence.  Such a sentence would restore his liberty and he would be free to resume a normal life and to engage in employment and other activities.  A subsequent prosecution appeal against sentence could result in all that being taken away again.  Would this be fair?  Should the prosecution be allowed to have a second bite at the cherry when the issue of the sentence had already been decided upon by a competent authority particularly when the consequences for the person involved could be so drastic?  I offer no judgement. I simply say that we must think about this.</P>
    <P>On the question of fairness there is a further point I must mention.  This relates to the time for the bringing of prosecution appeals against sentences which, I note, is not addressed in the Bill.  I believe that this cannot be neglected and I am sure that Deputies would agree that a very strict limitation period would have to be imposed for the taking of such appeals if we are to allow them.  It would not, in my view, be acceptable that a person who has been dealt with by the courts should be put in the position of having a sword of Damocles in the form of a threat or the possibility of an appeal against sentence hanging over him for an indefinite period. It would be essential to prescribe a maximum period within which the prosecution would have to give notice that it proposed to lodge its appeal.  This was done in the UK Criminal Justice Act.</P>
    <P>A change of the nature proposed in the Bill might have some implications for the <Col N="1022" /> independence afforded to the Judiciary under our Constitution.  It is accepted at present that the judge has complete discretion in dealing with the cases that come before him, including the question of sentence within the maximum penalty prescribed by law.</P>
    <P>In deciding on a sentence in any given case judges may be expected to take account of a wide variety of factors before deciding on a sentence including the nature and circumstances of the offences, aggravating or mitigating factors, the circumstances of the accused such as age, character, previous convictions etc., the public good and so on.  The proposals in the Deputy's Bill would add a new dimension to this which must, as a minimum, be looked at.</P>
    <P>I should perhaps here remind Deputies that at present we rely on the judges themselves to take steps to avoid undue disparities in sentence.  There is, in fact, statutory provision which allows the President of the District Court to convene meetings of justices to discuss issues such as disparities in sentencing.  While there is no similar statutory provision for meetings of judges of the higher courts, there is nothing, of course, to prevent them having regular meetings for the same purpose.</P>
    <P>A further difficulty which could arise from the procedure proposed in the Bill and which is not addressed therein relates to whether public comment should be permitted on a sentence where it may be appealed by the prosecution.  For example, a prosecution appeal against sentence is most likely to be taken in the type of case which attracts a great deal of public attention &mdash; a number of them were touched on tonight &mdash; and where there may be a public outcry about the perceived leniency of a sentence including, perhaps, widespread media comment and criticism.  I think the House will be able to recall examples of the type of case I have in mind.</P>
    <P>What is to happen then if a person convicted and sentenced in such a case is to face review of his sentence?  Is it fair that that review should be conducted against a background of adverse public <Col N="1023" /> comment and criticism?  Would steps need to be taken to prevent public comment before an opportunity has been given for a prosecution appeal?  These too are questions which must be addressed.</P>
    <P>Another matter in the Bill which requires close consideration is the proposal that the Director of Public Prosecutions should have the power to take the appeal.  If a procedure on the lines of that proposed in the Bill is to be put in place I can see the arguments why it should be the Director of Public Prosecutions. It could be argued that as the convicted person is entitled to appeal against what he or she considers to be a too severe sentence, the prosecution should have similar powers in the case of what it considers to be an unduly lenient sentence.  However, I am not so sure that that is what we should have in mind.  In particular, I would not foresee the power to appeal against what might appear to be an unduly lenient sentence as a power to be exercised frequently or as a matter of course.  Indeed, I would not see it as a common occurrence at all.  It seems to me that such a power if it were to be provided would generally be exercised only in those cases where there was well founded cause for disquiet in a particular case.  In other words, the power would be exercised in the public interest in those cases which may have given, or could be foreseen as giving, rise to public concern.</P>
    <P>In such a scenario I believe that the question of giving the power of referral to the Attorney General rather than to the Director of Public Prosecutions would need to be debated.  It could be that the Director of Public Prosecutions, having prosecuted the case, could be seen as having too much of a vested interest in the situation where the question of the referral of a case might arise for consideration. I note in this connection that it is the Attorney General who has been given the power of referral in the United Kingdom.  Again I mention this only as an issue for consideration.  All the points I am making are for consideration.</P>
    <P>A further point that arises from the fact that the Bill would confer the power <Col N="1024" /> to appeal against what was perceived to be an over-lenient sentence on the Director of Public Prosecutions is that such a move would represent a fundamental change in the role the prosecution has taken in matters relating to the sentence to be imposed on a convicted person.  Up to now it has always been the position that the prosecution has not sought to influence court decisions on sentencing in any way but the effect of the Deputy's proposals would be that the Director of Public Prosecutions would become involved in that area.  If that were to happen, then a question that would have to be asked is whether prosecutors should be at liberty, or even required, to make submissions on sentence to a trial judge. This is a very important point and one, I believe, that could only be properly dealt with after full and careful consideration of all the relevant issues.</P>
    <P>Another matter that has to be considered in the context of the proposals in this Bill is the question of appeals to the Supreme Court against decisions of the High Court.  Article 34.4.3º of the Constitution provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that the Supreme Court shall, with such exceptions and subject to such regulations as may be prescribed by law, have appellate jurisdiction from all decisions of the High Court.</P>
    <P>In this connection, the view that decisions of the Central Criminal Court can by virtue of this provision in the Constitution be appealed by the prosecution to the Supreme Court is of relatively recent origin.  While the Supreme Court has to date entertained appeals by the prosecution against certain acquittals in the Central Criminal Court, it has declined to order retrials in such cases. In regard to the question of an appeal by the prosecution against a sentence imposed by the Central Criminal Court the position is unclear.  The Central Criminal Court at present generally only tries murder cases.  In the case of a conviction of murder the sentence is a mandatory life imprisonment so the opportunity of appealing against sentence in murder cases would not have arisen to date.  However, the question <Col N="1025" /> could arise in the case of a conviction for manslaughter or attempted murder and, of course, the matter will become much more relevant when rape and aggravated sexual assault cases are transferred to the Central Criminal Court as a result of the passing of the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Bill, 1988.</P>
    <P>The implications of this situation require consideration and presumably it is a matter that the Law Reform Commission will advert to when considering this whole area.</P>
    <P>One other matter which arises in the context of the Bill is the basis on which legal aid should be made available to persons who might be the subject of appeals against sentence.  In the case of persons who have already received legal aid in the course of their trial, this should not give rise to difficulty as, presumably, it can be accepted that they should also have the same facilities for the appeal. Even so, this would require a change in the law as the type of case involved would not be covered by the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act, 1962. A more difficult issue, however, would be whether persons who had not been legally aided should have their costs on an appeal against sentence met by the State.  In support of that proposition the case could be made that as the appeal proceedings were being undertaken at the behest of the prosecution all the expenses involved should be met from State funds.  It is an issue that would have to be teased out fully.</P>
    <P>Another issue that would require consideration if a procedure on the lines of that proposed by the Deputy were to be adopted would be the scope of a proposed prosecution power to appeal against sentence. Under the terms of the Deputy's Bill an appeal would lie in any case where a sentence had been imposed by the Central Criminal Court, the Special Criminal Court or the Circuit Court.  This would include even cases which had been appealed to the Circuit Court from the District Court which are dealt with by way of a full rehearing.  My inclination is that any appeal against sentence that might be permitted should be restricted <Col N="1026" /> to serious offences and I understand from the relevant parliamentary debates that this was also the intention of the British Home Secretary when he introduced the provision that became clause 36 of their Criminal Justice Act, 1988, in the House of Commons.</P>
    <P>Finally, reference has been made in the context of these proposals to sentencing in rape cases.  I would not like the impression to go out that we are soft on rapists.  The opposite is in fact the case as can be seen from the statistics contained in the Annual Reports on the Prisons and Places of Detention.  For example, of those serving prison sentences for rape during 1988 &mdash; a total of 65 inmates &mdash; 85 per cent were serving sentences of five years or more.  More significantly, almost a half were serving ten years or more. Generally speaking, from a sentencing point of view, rape is being treated in our courts as the horrendous offence that it is.</P>
    <P>I would like finally to make a general comment with regard to the public dissatisfaction which arises from time to time with the outcome of criminal trials. It has always to be remembered that our criminal justice system is a human creation and, therefore, like any creation of man, cannot be wholly perfect.  Mistakes can, and are, of course, made. Therefore, while any changes we make may help to improve the system they cannot make it perfect.  For example, the disquiet that was expressed at the recent acquittal on murder charges of two youths arising from an incident in Meath would not at all be affected by the provision of a prosecution power of appeal against sentence.  In that case the decision was reached by a jury of ordinary lay people &mdash; the man in the street if you like &mdash; yet it still gave rise to dissatisfaction.</P>
    <P>I will summarise what I have been saying.  A fundamental change in our law of the nature proposed in the Deputy's Bill should be preceded by careful and detailed examination and consideration. Matters of principle and matters of detail inherent in such a change have to be addressed.  The matter is currently with the Law Reform Commission, a body <Col N="1027" /> well fitted to undertake such examination and consideration.  They have, as I said, now agreed at the request of the Attorney General to afford that examination high priority.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, in the meantime, ask the Deputy to withdraw his Bill and await the commission's report.  I can assure the House that when it is published I will act on it expeditiously.  The Deputy is right in raising the matter for debate but I hope he will accept the validity of my arguments against pressing his Bill further at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has covered the main ground from our point of view and I wish to say a few words in general support of his remarks.  There are problems in the system of criminal justice and administration and the Bill seeks to deal with one aspect of those problems.  I do not say that in a condescending way.  It is not sensational or newsworthy for a Government backbencher to admit that there are problems in the system of the administration of criminal justice at present.  However, there has not been a system of administration of criminal justice in any civilisation at any time which was not attended by problems because such systems are designed and operated by human beings who are fallible. In that respect, Ireland is not unique.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One problem which has attracted a great deal of media attention in recent times is a perceived leniency in sentencing policy.  The Minister made the point &mdash; and I agree with him &mdash; that while this problem exists it is more apparent than real.  In the vast majority of cases where a conviction is secured nobody disputes the fact that justice is done and is being seen to be done.  It is the very odd case that attracts the sort of media hype which tends to focus the minds of journalists and the public on this problem at particular times.  We must recognise that in this country, over the last five or ten years, we have had the phenomenon of intense competition among the media.  I do not have to outline to the House the <Col N="1028" /> sort of pressure that puts on journalists to find sensational things about which to write and indeed to sensationalise things which should not be sensationalised. From that point of view a great deal of the problem relating to perceived leniency of sentencing is a media creation but it is an illusion.</P>
    <P>I have attended criminal trials which were subsequently reported in the media. When I read the report of the trial I wondered if the reporter and I had been at the same trial.  There is a tendency on the part of some journalists to look at the beginning and the end of a criminal trial and to leave out what happened in the middle.  Having said that, there is no doubt that there is a problem, which the Minister acknowledged.  The people who discuss the problem create a lot of confusion. There is loose, vague talk about lack of uniformity in sentencing, etc., but it can be said with certainty that there is a lack of consistent, well defined logical principles to underline sentencing policies. Having said that, one wonders to what extent one can have such a set of principles which will be suitable across the board, given the infinite variety of criminal cases.  Of course that is not to say that we should not try and I was delighted to hear the Minister announce tonight that the Law Reform Commission have been given the brief to study sentencing policy and to bring forward coherent and &mdash; I hope &mdash; logical and carefully considered proposals.</P>
    <P>One offshoot of the problem we are dealing with relates to the fact that the defence can appeal the severity of a sentence whereas the State cannot appeal its leniency.  The Bill seeks to resolve the perceived lack of uniformity in the law relating to criminal sentencing and trials.</P>
    <P>There are a number of defects in the drafting of Deputy O'Keeffe's Bill but I fear that time will not permit me to go into detail.  In any case, I do not say that as a fundamental objection to the Bill because if it gets to Committee Stage we can deal with them in detail.</P>
    <P>The question then arises as to why there is an apparent lack of uniformity in this area of sentencing policy.  Why is <Col N="1029" /> there apparently one law for the State and another for the accused?  One theory I heard advanced is that there should be no such thing as an appeal against the severity of a criminal sentence, that the trial judge is the proper person to decide on the sentence to be handed down because he was in a position to perceive the demeanour of the defendant in court, he listened to the witnesses and also heard the victim.  Another theory advanced is that because of the importance of the liberty of the subject the fact that the accused is given the right to such an appeal is an exception to the general principle.  There is some force in that argument but I have to say I do not find it overwhelming.</P>
    <P>The area of sentencing policy is beset by a number of problems.  The Law Reform Commission are looking at this area at present and hope to come up with some solutions.  The proposal put forward by Deputy O'Keeffe in his Bill may very well become the law of this country when the Law Reform Commission have reported and their report is translated into legislative proposals in this House.  I am not saying it is inevitable that it will become the law but I concede that there is a high likelihood that it will become the law.  The area of sentencing policy needs root and branch consideration and not piecemeal tinkering. That fundamental consideration is under way and we should await its outcome.</P>
    <P>In 1988 in the United Kingdom the change now proposed by Deputy O'Keeffe became law.  I have discussed the matter with a number of criminal law practitioners in the United Kingdom and I have come to the surprising conclusion that controversy about perceived leniency of sentencing and a lack of uniformity in sentencing is still rampant in the United Kingdom even between different judges in the same Crown Court area.  Before we think of something along the lines of the United Kingdom legislation as a panacea for our problems in this area we would want to give it careful consideration.</P>
    <P>Logical and simple as the proposal in <Col N="1030" /> Deputy O'Keeffe's Bill may seem, it can give rise to a miscellany of unforeseen problems, as the Minister outlined in his contribution.  I want to refer to one or two other problems to which it can give rise.  It will increase the burden on the Director of Public Prosecutions' office.  If this Bill becomes law the prosecution will have a further task which they do not have at present &mdash; they will have to consider each sentence given in a case where there is a conviction and reflect, if they are disappointed about it, on whether they can apply to have it reviewed.  This will, of course, create an extra burden on an already overstretched criminal prosecution service.  It would inevitably involve the allocation of additional resources to the Director of Public Prosecutions' office.  I have no objection in principle to this &mdash; a good case can be made for allocating extra resources to that office &mdash; but I would be in favour of waiting to see what we can do in this whole area before agreeing to rush out and spend more money on it.</P>
    <P>The second problem is that the proposal before us tonight will undermine the independence of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  As the Minister has pointed out, the duty of the Director of Public Prosecutions is to ensure that the law is enforced fairly between everybody. His duty is to act in the public interest in that he is perceived as an independent referee between the State and the accused.  If this Bill becomes law &mdash; we need to think carefully about this &mdash; the Director of Public Prosecutions will inevitably be exposed to public pressure which will undermine his independence. I can foresee a situation where the Director of Public Prosecutions will be exposed to lobbying and perhaps correspondence orchestrated by campaigns in the media. He may be the subject of public demonstrations and he will certainly be the subject of question after question in this House as to why certain sentences are not being appealed.  In other words, he will be subject to pressure to do what he does not consider to be in the public interest.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1031" /> As well as those fundamental theoretical difficulties, there will be many minor practical difficulties as well.  In an ordinary trial the judge sees certain documents when he is deciding on a sentence, for example, probation officer reports, social worker reports, letters of reference etc.  There is nothing in the Bill which indicates one way or the other whether the Director of Public Prosecutions will have access to those documents when he is deciding whether to refer a sentence to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  If we go down the road of allowing people to refer sentences to the Court of Criminal Appeal on the basis of information which is less than the trial judge has we will be going down a very dangerous road indeed.</P>
    <P>The majority of the Law Reform Commission took the view in their report on rape that the main purpose of criminal law is to deter and control crime.  To the question: will the proposals contained in this Bill go any way along this road? &mdash; the answer is an emphatic no.  I cannot imagine any criminal in my constituency or anywhere else who is setting out to commit a crime tonight saying to himself &ldquo;I will stay at home because Deputy O'Keeffe has brought in legislation which will allow my sentence to be appealed and I might get what I really deserve&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe has done a good service and I do not question his bona fides. He has achieved the objective of getting the Minister to get on to the Attorney General to speed up the review of sentencing policy by the Law Reform Commission. Having achieved that, the Deputy should withdraw this Bill pending the outcome of that review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before us sets out to tackle a particular problem which rears its head from time to time.  This legislation seeks to deal with the problem in a particular way.  As I understand it, the main purpose of the Bill is to give the Director of Public Prosecutions the right to appeal any sentence he believes to be too lenient.  I am very much aware of the problem the Bill sets out to tackle, but I <Col N="1032" /> have serious reservations that this may not be the right way to go about this job. This Bill arises a series of questions which have not been answered.</P>
      <P>I have to say to Deputy O'Keeffe that this Bill has all the signs that it was hastily conceived and not very well drafted.  I am referring in particular to section 2 which is the meat of this Bill.  If this measure was passed in its present form it would enable the Director of Public Prosecutions to appeal any lenient sentence passed on himself.  I am sure this was not the aim of the person who drafted the Bill and it needs a great deal of work before it is suitable legislation.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Bill sets out to confer additional powers on the Director of Public Prosecutions but is silent on the position of the victims of crime.  Very often the one who suffers most from over-lenient sentencing are the victims or their families.  They are the ones who are left to wonder how a person who murdered their father is sentenced for manslaughter or how a person who abused their child is allowed to get away with a caution. This Bill provides them with no redress other than a reliance on the Director of Public Prosecutions.  We know, because the Director of Public Prosecutions has told us, that he picks very carefully the cases he will prosecute.  We have to assume that if we confer this additional power on him he will not necessarily see it as incumbent on him to use that power to assuage the feelings of people who have been hurt by crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a way it is ironic that we are debating this Bill on the same day as we have been discussing the problem of gross overcrowding in our prisons and the consequences of it.  Whatever else this Bill will do, it will not reduce overcrowding in prisons.  I would rather be debating a measure which is aimed at fitting the punishment to the crime.  The most serious reservation I have is that the Bill misses the main point of the problem: inconsistent sentencing is a much bigger issue than lenient sentencing.  This Bill will not have the effect, even if it is passed into law, of achieving the objective of a <Col N="1033" /> consistent pattern of sentencing by our courts.</P>
    <P>All of us have heard a great deal in this House from time to time about the problems and suffering inconsistent sentencing give rise to.  Two recent incidents, one of which has already been mentioned here tonight graphically demonatrate this point.  In one case a young man was sentenced to six months in prison for stealing a car radio, while in the other case a man walked out of court free after pleading guilty to sexual abuse of an 11 year old child.  Both those incidents occurred within a day of each other.  Together they illustrate that justice is not served best by a totally <i>ad hoc</i>, inconsistent approach to sentencing policy.  In fact, it can be said there is no sentencing policy at all.  The Court of Criminal Appeal should be in the best position to elaborate on the guidelines which would underpin a proper sentencing policy.  That court is a part-time one with rotating personnel. If it were a full-time, permanent court inevitably there would be a great deal more consistency in the way in which it built up sentencing policy.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Government adopted by the present coalition provided for the establishment of an appeal court at civil level.  No action has been taken so far to implement that promise.  It seems to me that a permanent Appeal Court on the criminal side would be well worth considering.  When John Rogers was Attorney General he requested the Supreme Court &mdash; in a case known as the DPP versus Tiernan &mdash; to consider appropriate sentencing guidelines in rape cases.  At that time the Supreme Court refused to involve itself in that area, arguing that sentencing was a matter for the discretion of individual judges.  Nonetheless, even having regard to that fact, it is open to this House to assign the function, by statute, to the courts, particularly to the Court of Criminal Appeal, of ensuring consistency in sentencing.  That would be a better approach than that adopted under the provisions of the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>At present the Law Reform Commission are considering this whole issue; <Col N="1034" /> at least it has been my understanding that they were considering the matter up to this evening, yet another initiative of the former Attorney General, John Rogers. I was indeed surprised to learn from the Minister's comments this evening that the Law Reform Commission had been unable to undertake that examination to date since it is now three years since they were requested to do so.  We must ascertain from the Minister whether this delay has been occasioned by lack of personnel, expertise or whatever.  Having ascertained the reason for the delay we must then request the Minister to rectify whatever is the deficiency so that the Law Reform Commission can undertake this examination as speedily as possible.  Since their examination has not even begun we can hardly expect their report too speedily.  I must stress to the Minister that this work must be undertaken immediately and be given priority.</P>

      <P>The Minister must use his influence in this respect and, if it transpires to be a lack of personnel, resources, expertise or whatever, he arranged to have such made available to the Law Reform Commission immediately.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that there is a strong argument for awaiting the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in this matter but it is unfortunate that we shall have to wait longer than we had anticipated when coming into the House this evening.  Like the Minister, I would urge the Fine Gael spokesman to withdraw his Bill until the report of the Law Reform Commission is available.  I would not be satisfied with the Bill, as drafted.  I assume it is capable of amendment should it reach Committee Stage.  In view of the arguments advanced by the Minister and those I have represented this evening, I hope the Fine Gael Party will review their position on this Bill, having had the Minister's assurance &mdash; and again just now &mdash; that he will see to it that there is expedition in getting the Law Reform Commission to report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1035" /> For those reasons I hope Deputy J. O'Keeffe can see his way to withdrawing this Bill, affording us an opportunity to debate another Bill of wider scope than the one before us this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>There is great concern countrywide about whether there is uniformity of sentencing.  It would be fair to say that, by and large, sentences handed down by our courts have been correct.  Of course, there has been the odd case over the years in which it appeared to the general public, via the media, that a particular sentence was too lenient and which provoked much public comment.</P>
      <P>The question I would pose this evening is whether the remedy proposed by this Bill is not worse than the disease.  It has been wisely said by extremely experienced conveyancers over the years that no two sales are exactly similar.  In the same way, in criminal law it can be contended that no two cases are exactly similar. Very often sentences that may appear to many to be too lenient when handed down by a judge are handed down in the light of a protracted criminal case when the judge will have had at his disposal facts which may not have been at the disposal of others who would seek to form a judgment or pass sentence on the defendant concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am extremely concerned with the contents of this Bill because I believe they would give rise to the question of whether our criminal justice system was playing cat and mouse with people's lives. Take the example of an individual convicted in a court, perhaps not sentenced to any period of imprisonment.  The provisions of this Bill do not state when the Director of Public Prosecutions in his wisdom, might or might not decide to seek to have the case referred.  For example, it might be a year later, two years, five or ten years later.  In the meantime that individual may not have come to the notice of the authorities at all but will have had that terrible cloud hanging over his life.  The question I would pose <Col N="1036" /> is whether that is fair.  I contend that quite clearly it is unfair.</P>
    <P>There is also the fact that if an individual is given what the Director of Public Prosecutions subsequently considers to be a lenient sentence, that would already have been the subject of comment in the media.  No doubt the media would seize on the case as being one in which a lenient sentence had been handed down.  In that event would it not be fair to say that, in as much as we had been ready to criticise certain British politicians for making public comment about an Irish individual facing extradition, it would be equally wrong of us to say, in relation to one of our citizens, that the media could criticise a sentence handed down to that individual. In fairness it could not be said that, in those circumstances, under those kinds of pressures, the appeal court would be in a position to hand down an impartial sentence.  I believe that individual would be placed at grave risk, that any such proposal would prove unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>The alternative would be to prevent any media speculation on the case once the sentence had been handed down.  This raises the proposition that it would be possible under an amendment to the Bill, which is what would be required to make a case, after it had been disposed of <i>sub judice</i>.  I do not believe any such proposal could find favour in any fair or democratic system.</P>
    <P>The question arises also whether the Director of Public Prosecutions, having brought an individual to court, would not be a judge in his own cause in deciding to refer the matter back to a court of appeal with the leave of the appeal court. If it were held that the Director of Public Prosecutions was indeed a judge in his own cause in attempting to have reheard what had already been decided, that contention would not withstand the test.  It is true that mistakes have been made but the question which arises is whether mistakes would also be made on appeal. Could a situation not arise where the Director of Public Prosecutions in his wisdom would be incorrect in relation to whether a sentence was too lenient and that the appeal court subsequently would <Col N="1037" /> also be incorrect in relation to its decision as to the leniency of the sentence?  This in turn would lead to an injustice on the individual and would be unfair to him.</P>
    <P>Where sentencing is concerned, place an individual in double jeopardy.  It would be an unwarranted interference by the State in sentencing policy and I envisage the Minister for Justice being questioned every second month by Opposition Deputies about what he was going to do about a given case at a given time.  Unquestionably, pressure would be brought to bear on the Director of Public Prosecutions through the media and other ways in an attempt to influence him on whether he should seek leave to put a case before the appeal court for further consideration.  It is a fundamental principle of our law that an individual would not be placed in double jeoparty but this is what would occur in this case.</P>
    <P>The argument has been made that it is possible the Attorney General could be the person who would decide whether to seek leave from the appeal court to refer a case to it but I do not think this would make any fundamental difference to the Bill.  Because of these factors I am opposed to the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Bill which has been drafted by my colleague, Deputy O'Keeffe.  There is a need for us, as legislators, to review sentencing policy to see if the best interests of society are being served.  It is most disappointing that the Minister succeeded in delivering a speech over a dozen pages long without saying anything positive other than that the matter has been referred to the Law Reform Commission, but even this news is bad given that we have been expecting to receive a report from the Law Reform Commission for some time.  It is most disheartening to learn that the Law Reform Commission have not yet even begun to compile this report which was commissioned in 1987.  This underlines more than anything else the need to look at the Law Reform Commission to see whether a special arm of the Law Reform Commission or a special reform commission should be established to deal <Col N="1038" /> solely with the updating and reform of criminal law.  It is most disappointing that the Minister was not in a position to outline when this Law Reform Commission report will be published and whether it is his intention to commission interim reports or consultative papers.  This underlines more than anything else the need for this House to act.</P>
      <P>I hope between now and next week Members or the other side will see their way to give this legislation a measure of support and to allow the Bill to go beyond Second Stage.  We can thrash out on Committee Stage the minor difficulties mentioned by the Minister and the concerns expressed by Deputies O'Dea and O'Donoghue but the longer we refrain from introducing the necessary reforms the more we are adding to the public disquiet.  The Minister stated that, in principle, he is in sympathy with what we are trying to do and if that is the case we have a basis on which to work in the coming months.</P>
      <P>Since an offender has the opportunity to have his sentence reviewed and to appeal to a higher court on the conviction or on the severity of the sentence, there is no reason the State should not be allowed appeal a sentence which it considers too lenient.  We are not seeking to give the State the opportunity to reopen a case on acquittal but merely to have a sentence reviewed.  Listening to some of the concerns expressed by speakers on the other side of the House, one would think this would leave the Director of Public Prosecutions in an impossible position where he would have to review every case which came before him and that the courts would be clogged up with appeals at the behest of the State.  This is not the case. The Deputies on the other side of the House are well aware of this and they know that what we are seeking is to give the Director of Public Prosecutions the discretion to use this weapon where he deems it necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years there has been public disquiet and disquiet in legal circles about the length of custodial sentence imposed in a number of cases, some of which have been referred to by Deputies.  No one is <Col N="1039" /> saying that the State should have a second bite at the cherry in every case or that there should be an onus on the Director of Public Prosecutions to act accordingly; we are merely seeking to give him the discretion to use this device.</P>
    <P>In relation to sentencing policy &mdash; and this was referred to by the Minister &mdash; members of the Judiciary are likely to impose differing sentences in accordance with the merits of each case.  This is very important.  It is fundamental that each and every case would be judged on its merits and that there would not be mandatory sentences or slot machine justice where a mandatory sentence would be handed down.  It is very important that the judge would have discretion as soon as the jury return their verdict, but it is also important that there be a balance. Therefore where the State or the Director of Public Prosecutions considers the sentence imposed by a justice does not fit the crime or is too lenient, he should have the opportunity to take the case to a higher court with the higher court, in turn, having the opportunity to review the sentence.</P>
    <P>I am not particularly happy with the double jeopardy argument because at all times we would be dealing with cases where a jury has returned a conviction and we would be concerned only with the sentence imposed.  Therefore it is not strictly true to say that we are seeking to give the State a second bite at the cherry so far as the conviction is concerned but rather that we are giving the State the opportunity to have the sentence reviewed.  So far as an acquittal or conviction is concerned, the double jeopardy argument does not arise.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Shannon Navigation Bill, 1990: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment I was speaking about the involvement of <Col N="1040" /> myself and other local representatives in this project in the past 15 years.  I outlined to the House that in a meeting with the then Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, in December 1980 a positive approach was made asking that a close examination be made of this question by the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>Many speakers mentioned the benefits this would have for the Cavan-Leitrim region.  I trust those areas will prepare themselves in advance so as to get maximum benefit from the project and avoid having merely through traffic on the waterway &mdash; people just stopping for fuel, fresh water etc.  They should be setting about providing amenities such as guesthouse, hotel and self catering accommodation and recreation and sport facilities.</P>
      <P>Moneys are now being made available from the International Fund for Ireland for the smaller hotels, those of 15 to 20 bedrooms.  This is another opportunity for the Cavan-Leitrim area to maximise the benefits to itself when this project is on stream.  One of the problems is that areas such as this, which do not have a tradition in tourism are often passed over for funding while the already developed areas are developed further.  What is required is an initial effort to get a project off the ground, to get people interested and to realise that there are benefits to be derived from it.</P>
      <P>When this link is made it will create a fair amount of goodwill and opportunities for the tourism organisations both North and South.  I hope they will make a joint effort to sell the region by promoting holidays in both areas when cruisers and other water sport amenities are provided.</P>
      <P>On the political scene there are positive signs of movement on both sides to resolve the present impasse.  People are beginning to realise that the lunacy of the continuing violence must cease.  We have the opportunity to take initiatives that will have a positive affect not alone on this area but on the country generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The initiative of the IFI in getting this project off the ground is to be welcomed. This was one of the flagship projects in <Col N="1041" /> their annual report of 1989.  On page 25 of the report it is stated:</P>
    <P>This ambitious plan to reconnect the two most important Irish waterway systems, the Erne in the North and the Shannon in the South, involves the restoration of the long disused Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal.  The project has potential as a significant tourism amenity and the board has affirmed its willingness to support the project up to a limit of UK£1 million subject to the receipt of satisfactory implementation studies and to the availability of finance from other sources for the project.</P>
    <P>This came at a good time when the programme for the North West sub-region was being set up.  In that report under the heading &ldquo;Cruising&rdquo; they stated:</P>
    <P>There is major potential to develop the river and lake cruising product within the North West based on the Shannon and Erne systems.  The phased re-opening of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal, to be brought forward for assistance under this sub-programme, would be of major strategic importance in the development of river and lake cruising in both the Shannon and Erne systems, and would be an important cruising locale in its own right.  The phased re-opening of the canal will contribute in a significant manner to the development of tourism in the North West and in Northern Ireland.  Other proposals to be brought forward for assistance in this sphere include the Lough Allen Canal, extension of the Erne navigation system from Belturbet to Lough Oughter and boating marinas at several locations within the region.</P>
    <P>The provision of this money by the IFI and the promise of extra funds from the Structural Fund guarantees the success of this project.  Seldom has a project had as definite a base from which to work as far as funding is concerned.  We also have additional funding under INTERREG. The funding should be in place to ensure that this amenity is proceeded with.  The <Col N="1042" /> Minister said that the Bill would also allow the commissioners to maintain and operate navigation facilities on the river Erne in the State including Lough Oughter which is connected to the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell navigation for which there is no navigation authority at present.  It was certainly advisable to bring this in and to have an authority under which to operate that.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned that the Bill empowers the Commissioners to control pollution from boats using the navigation. However, he said that the general question of pollution of rivers is the responsibility of local authorities.  Certainly since the introduction of the pollution grants in 1988 in regard to farmyard pollution, great strides have been made to reduce pollution levels.  If we have the same rate of progress in the next three to four years as we had in the last it will go a long way to clean up our lakes and streams and restore them to what they were ten or 15 years ago when we had so much pride in them because we had the purest ground water of any country in Europe.  This would be a terrific asset to us.</P>
    <P>I conclude by congratulating the Minister on introducing this Bill.  I know it will have the goodwill of all sides of the House.  I hope it will provide for that area the benefits that most of the speakers have outlined here tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate. Broadly speaking I welcome the Bill.  I welcome it because of the much needed updating of the powers of the Commissioners of Public Works in relation to the Shannon navigation and because of the provision for the restoration of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal.  This is the first practical step towards opening that canal and the linking of the great waterways of the Shannon and the Erne. It is the realisation of what many waterway enthusiasts have dreamed of.  I fully realise the importance of what is involved.  It is a major development which has great potential for an area that has been devastated over the past decade <Col N="1043" /> or more.  It also offers a great opportunity to bring people into an area which has so much to offer tourists.  This is a totally unspoiled area which is sparsely populated and now that our kind of climate has become more attractive because of the risks to health from exposure to the sun, I hope people from such places as Dublin will take their boats and link into the Shannon from Belturbet.</P>
      <P>The opening up of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal is a major development. I am interested in the development of the Shannon.  Indeed it is no harm to put on the record of the House, for those who do not know their geography, that the Shannon rises in my fair county of Cavan.  Indeed, I am ashamed that the potential of the area where this great river rises has not been developed.  The Shannon rises in the Cuilcagh Mountains. It begins as a little pond that runs into a narrow stream.  It is great fun for young people and the not so young, if they are any way nimble, to jump the Shannon.  I understand also that there are people who are interested in stating that the Shannon rises further upstream and that they are going to develop its potential.  I want to tell the Minister for Tourism and Transport, and I hope he will get this message, that we should start the development of the Shannon from its roots in the Cuilcagh Mountains and continue that development to where the river goes into the sea at Limerick.  This is an area of great potential but that is probably an issue for debate another day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am deeply interested in the opening up of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal to link the Shannon with the Erne. We hope that the opening up of this waterway will not just be a means of getting from Lough Erne to the Shannon inviting only passing traffic, which would be of no benefit to the towns and villages from Belturbet to Ballinamore.  We anticipate there being facilities for boats to berth and the link roads to berthing places being upgraded so that people will be encouraged to spend a night or perhaps a weekend in one of the inland towns.  A bus from Donegal going to <Col N="1044" /> Dublin and passing through Belturbet, Cavan, and Virginia is of absolutely no benefit to the region unless the passengers alight and spend their money in one of the towns.  I ask the Minister to take this point on board when developing the canal.</P>
    <P>We have enterprising people who can see the benefit downstream.  I take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Seán Quinn and his family on their initiative and enterprise in developing a greenfield site and providing a hotel right on the canal which will only succeed if the canal is utilised to its full potential.  Mr. Quinn saw an opportunity to develop a business. The International Fund for Ireland has made substantial funds available for both the hotel and canal developments.  That is very welcome.</P>
    <P>The North-South aspect of the development is important.  However, it must be remembered that when one gets to Belturbet one can only travel north on the Erne.  You cannot penetrate the county that has more to offer than any other county in terms of fishing, shooting and picnic areas.  I am referring to that area from Lough Oughter to Lough Gowna.  In his opening remarks the Minister said:</P>
    <P>It is with great pleasure that I commend this Bill to the House.  The Bill deals with three significant waterways &mdash; the Shannon Navigation, the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal and the Erne and Lough Oughter Navigation.</P>
    <P>I have gone through the speech in detail but I do not see any mention of the Erne and Lough Oughter Navigation or that it is being developed in any way.  Perhaps the Minister of State would note that point and reply to it during the course of his reply to the debate.  If the Minister can say that it is intended that the channel from Belturbet to Lough Oughter and from Lough Oughter to Lough Gowna will be opened I can assure the Minister of State that he will be very welcome to come down and spend a weekend fishing with us and we will forget the past&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was always welcome there.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the Minister was.  That would be of major importance. Deputy Leonard is as well aware as I am that the drainage of the Erne was a high priority a decade ago.  I well recall a former Taoiseach and former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr. Garret FitzGerald initiating a cross-Border survey, with the aid of EC funding, on the drainage of the Erne.  I also recall the Minister for Defence, Deputy Lenihan when Minister for Foreign Affairs being presented with the results of the survey. At that stage the project was very high on the list of priorities for cross-Border developments.  Now it seems to be suddenly out of fashion, to be on the back burner.  I will again quote from the Minister's speech.</P>
      <P>The authorities in Northern Ireland are fully supportive of the venture and see it is an important initiative adding to the North-South links.</P>
      <P>I welcome that statement, which I take as a statement of fact, but I believe there was a reluctance on the part of the Northern Ireland authorities to support the development of the Erne drainage scheme because they feared that the floodgates would be opened and that a lot of water would flow into Fermanagh and then down to the ESB station at Balyshannon.  This matter was never fully resolved.  I want to see the potential of the Ballyconnell-Ballinamore Canal development benefit the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very welcome that people travel to the North or that our neighbours and friends from Northern Ireland come across the Border to Belturbet but I would like if they would go deeper into my county if we are to benefit fully from this development.  For that reason I am concerned that no mention was made of the opening of a channel in the Erne from Belturbet to Lough Oughter and from Lough Oughter to Lough Gowna.  I fully appreciate that we cannot talk about drainage now or about bringing land into agricultural production.  However, I think we can further develop this waterway by opening a channel in the streams that link these lakes.  That should not be <Col N="1046" /> a costly exercise.  People who are keenly interested in boating and who have travelled these waterways have told me that mounds of silt have built up and that a simple dredging operation would be of major benefit.  Such an operation would have immense benefits.  It would also open up the whole regions for fishing and shooting and would have no impact on wildlife, in fact it would further develop it.  It would make available to tourists many lakes which are inaccessible at present due to extreme flooding over the winter months.  The lakes should be kept at the same level during winter as they are during the summer months, when water levels generally are lower.</P>
    <P>If tourism is to be of benefit to this country it will have to be developed as a 12-month business.  Operating for three or four months during the summer is not sufficient.  Coarse fishing should be developed an all the year round pastime. People can fish for pike, bream, perch or eel for 12 months of the year provided the waterways are accessible.  The only reason the fishing season has not been extended is because flood waters cut off access to many of our lakes.</P>
    <P>In regard to the development of the canal &mdash; I understand it will be a three or four year project which will offer employment prospects &mdash; the Minister should accept that there are excellent local contractors quite capable of doing this work. When the Office of Public Works advertise for contractors to carry out this work, these advertisements should be placed in the local papers.  I can name people who excel in this type of work, in agricultural reclamation and drainage work, with excellent equipment.  Recently I visited a project, similar to what is envisaged here but not on as large a scale, where nine miles of waterway are being opened up on the Killinkere River, from Virginia to Bailieborough.  A number of people, including the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Wilson, visited that area last week and we were all astounded at the magnificent work being done there by a local contractor, P &amp; S Plant Limited, managed by Pat and Seán Smith whom I have pleasure in naming.  The people <Col N="1047" /> could not believe that they had the equipment to dredge and clean this stretch of river, which in some areas reaches a depth of 12 ft. to 15 ft. and is 20 ft. wide. Such people should have an opportunity to tender for the development of the canal because they have expertise in the building of locks, sluices and so on.  There are firms such as the Elliotts in Cavan and other major builders in the area who would be capable of doing this work. I hope outside contractors will not be brought into the area but that as much local employment as possible will be created.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the Bill will have the effect of applying the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, to the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell drainage district as is the case with all other drainage districts within the State.  He said that hitherto statutory responsibility for maintenance of these drainage works has been vested in drainage trustees who recouped the cost from the local authorities.  That area is in the unique position of having the only drainage board in the country, the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Drainage Board. That board is still in existence because of its cross-Border dimension.  A local committee work on a voluntary basis and have been carrying out drainage works there down through the years.  To wind up this board would be giving recognition to the Border that none of us believes should be there.  The Minister proposes to give responsibility for maintenance of these works to the local authorities.  How will this work be funded or how can the local authority afford to carry out such work?  As the Minister is well aware &mdash; I do not want to harp on this matter &mdash; we cannot afford to maintain the roads at present.  Any money that is available is certainly not being directed towards drainage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>That board recoups the money from the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be no worse off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1048" />
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but that relates to minor drainage work.  If the Minister is thinking of including maintenance of the canals, there is no way the local authority could undertake that.  There would be local resentment at the winding up of this drainage board because there is pride in the work they are doing.  At present the method of collection of money is complicated. The drainage board collect the money from the farmer who in turn receives it from the council.  It would be much simpler if the drainage board could collect the money direct from the council. Perhaps the Minister would reconsider this whole matter before winding up the board.</P>
      <P>I welcome the development of this canal.  It offers great potential.  I hope it will be marketed in a way that will be beneficial to the region.  It should not be just a waterway connecting the Erne with the Shannon.  People should be encouraged to stop at various points, where facilities would be available where they could spend a few pounds.  That would benefit the region which has a lot to offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister on his very full statement to the House on this Bill.  I will be supporting the measure although I have some reservations about it.  It is obviously an improvement to transfer responsibility for this stretch of waterway from trustees, who are apparently now defunct, to the Office of Public Works.  I would suggest to the Minister that the Office of Public Works are a very widely spread organisation who do tremendous work but, as the Minister well knows, they have very many other responsibilities.  I would ask him to consider &mdash; I intend to put down an amendment on this matter &mdash; the possibility of setting up a Shannon water authority along the lines of those in operation in the UK such as the Thames Water Authority. This would give to a statutory body complete control over the entire river system. They would work as a specialist body and not just as a small section in the Office of Public Works.  I would like the Minister to consider that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1049" /> I received a representation from a resident in the area who is very concerned about possible damage to wildlife.  On balance this project will be beneficial to wildlife but nevertheless I feel obliged to point this out to the Minister and to make representations on behalf of this person who wrote to me.  Assuming that this Bill is passed and the work commences, I ask the Minister to ensure that every effort is made to minimise the interference with wildlife.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LouisBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill will enable the Minister to deal with the opportunities and problems relating to this major waterway.  The main part of the Bill deals with the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal, the Erne and Lough Oughter.  That has been dealt with by my colleagues, and therefore, I intend to deal basically with the Lough Ree area of the Shannon and on matters relating to that area.  I was a former member of the Midland Regional Development Organisation.  While this body lacked any real power, it was a consultative body which dealt with many relevant problems in Counties Westmeath, Longford, Roscommon, Offaly and Laois.  One of the items which held a lot of interest for this body was the Shannon River.  At that time a Shannon study was being jointly funded by the EC and the Government.  Unfortunately no funds were forthcoming from the Irish Government and, as a result, this opportunity was lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In dealing with the Shannon I do not think the full potential of this river has been appreciated or tapped by any Government.  We are talking about one of the finest waterways in Europe.  Every year more and more tourists arrive to spend their holidays on the Shannon or in the surrounding areas.  Coming as I do from County Longford I am fully aware of the great potential there is to develop this industry further.  On the shores of Lough Ree, for example, in the Counties of Longford and Westmeath, access to the lake is almost impossible.  Places like Derrynabuntle at Ballymahon, Killeenmore at Glasson and other areas <Col N="1050" /> along the lake have the potential for development for boating, fishing and water sports.  I would like to see serious consideration being given by the Government to develop these areas and in doing so the Government would be adding to the local economy.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Minister in his contribution referred to areas for future development.  I should like to point out to the Minister that not one area in County Longford has been mentioned for further works.  The only area in County Westmeath is at Hodson's Bay which has already been established.  It certainly is a disappointment to note that that is the case.  The Office of Public Works are an excellent body.  I compliment them on the work they have done over the years.</P>
    <P>I have called on occasions in the past for the Shannon valley to be treated as a special region for European funding.  If all the bodies associated with the Shannon were consulted and co-ordinated this would be the way forward.  The Board of Works, ESB, Bord Fáilte, local authorities, farming organisations, fisheries boards, local anglers are at times working at cross purposes.  A Shannon forum has been already set up for this purpose.  We saw in recent times the damage and hardship that has been caused by Shannon flooding.  Homes were under water, yards and outhouses were damaged, lands were flooded, livestock and fodder were lost. Severe damage was also caused to roadways. I have no doubt that if a proper approach was made by the relevant authorities an overall plan could be formulated to deal with this flooding problem.</P>
    <P>I attended many meetings in the Athlone area some months ago and I want to say that the people were very angry and frustrated at that time.  I think the Minister is missing an opportunity to deal with their problems.  Surely at this stage, farmers and families living along the Shannon deserve some consideration. I have no doubt that if flooding was taking place on a regular basis in urban areas in this country, the cries would be loud and the action would be swift to deal with these problems &mdash; and rightly so.  We <Col N="1051" /> must realise the heartbreak and losses suffered by these people.  In certain areas of County Westmeath and County Longford, families were completely marooned and in many cases farmers had losses of stock and fodder and their lands were completely under water.</P>
    <P>I want to take this opportunity to voice my utter disappointment in the allocation made recently by the Department of the Environment to deal with roads and bridges that were damaged in the recent flooding.  Both Longford County Council and Westmeath County Council submitted plans to the Department to deal with roads that were damaged and also to raise and improve those roads.  The Department of the Environment did not see fit to allocate any substantial funds to those two counties.  It is worth noting the amounts allocated to other counties.  I say, fair play to politicians who managed to gain considerable allocation for their own counties but the amounts given to Counties Longford and Westmeath is a disgrace.  I want to call on the Department of the Environment to allocate an increase of funding to both these counties who suffered much as a result of Shannon flooding.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer again before I conclude to the vast potential of the Shannon region for tourism.  Quite an amount has been done over the years by Mr. Harry Lynch and his staff in the tourist board in promoting the Shannon.  Various local organisations have been also active in this work.  The Government should consider tax incentives to people willing to promote and develop tourism in these areas.  This would create jobs and the incentive would be welcome.  Perhaps the Government could look at the possibility of establishing a natual waterways park and amenity area in the Shannon basin.</P>
    <P>One town in my area, Ballymahon, has been badly hit in recent times due to unemployment.  Ballymahon, as we know, stands on the River Inny.  I feel a great opportunity for Ballymahon would be the development of the Inny to allow cruising craft to gain access up the river <Col N="1052" /> as near to Ballymahon as possible.  Set in the Goldsmith country I feel that this could add great potential to Ballymahon. Areas such as Lanesboro', Tarmonbarry and Clondra are also prime sites for further development.  Recently I asked a question in the House in relation to the Royal Canal and I was informed by the Minister that it is planned to develop and restore parts of that canal from Mullingar to Clondra.  In the longer term, I welcome this as it could add to the water links throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The points I have raised here this evening are matters which I see as important to my area and, indeed, could add to the economy and the quality of life for the people of the Shannon area.  The Minister should bear these points in mind when considering further development of the Shannon River.</P>

      <P>I join other speakers in welcoming the publication of this Bill. It seeks to regulate the authority which the Office of Public Works will have in relation to both Shannon navigation and the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal. Deputies from the region have more than adequately made their viewpoints on the matter known to the Minister as he prepares to enact this legislation.  We all hope the Office of Public Works will take prompt action in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My interest is similar to that of Deputy Belton in that the Shannon River plays an important part in the lifestyle of the communities of west Offaly from Athlone to Ballinahown, Doon, Clonmacnoise, Clonfanlough, Banagher, Lusmagh and Shannonbridge.  For some time there has been flooding of the Shannon. The old myth of draining the Shannon has been well and truly buried.  The IFA commissioned a study in this area a couple of years ago and it is quite clear that such a proposal was not feasible.  We must live with the fact that every year we have considerable flooding along these banks and the callows in the west Offaly region which, unfortunately, has not yet been designated even a less severely handicapped area, but it is hoped the <Col N="1053" /> submission made by the Minister of Agriculture and Food in the last few days to the EC will rectify that.  It is an old chestnut in Offaly that there is an official mythology that the Shannon drains left to the west; that it floods more to the far side than to ours and that the people in the west get all the breaks under the western package, the severely handicapped scheme and so on.  However the Shannon provides us with a great opportunity to develop tourism in the area.  The operational programme for the midlands east region points to the fact that the emphasis for policy in the future will be to encourage development of resource based activities and identifies the need to develop tourism based on landscape or other natural resources.  Certainly the River Shannon and the Grand Canal, which flow through County Offaly &mdash; through Edenderry, Tullamore and on to Shannon Harbour &mdash; are a latent resource which have not achieved their potential, although there has been an improvement in the inland waterways traffic and in the number of stops continental tourist make at Shannonbridge, to see Clonmacnoise, and at Banagher.</P>
    <P>In passing it is no harm to acknowledge the tremendous work done by the Office of Public Works at Clonmacnoise in the last few years these developments are continuing.  Now Clonmacnoise is recognised for what it is, a medieval university which was renowned throughout the civilised world.  Thousands of tourists come to see it and the Office of Public Works are to be congratulated for the work they have been doing there to improve that tourism attraction.  The Office of Public Works are often criticised for their slowness at work, sometimes justifiably, but when they get around to doing a job, they do it well.  Be that as it may, the Office of Public Works involvement in the Clonmacnoise site has been for the benefit of the people in the area and for the enhancement of that very important part of our heritage.</P>
    <P>The operational programme for the midlands east region identifies the need to develop tourism.  Certainly it will never compete with Killarney or the more <Col N="1054" /> beautiful parts of our coastline where tourism is the major industry, but we have certain natural resources that we should use and develop to their fullest potential.  I have no doubt they will make a contribution to attracting tourists, given that tourism is the big growth industry all over the world.  We hope to attract whatever tourism we can to the area by emphasising the heritage aspect of Offaly.  Durrow, Clonmacnoise our cutaway bogs, Mongan Bog beside Clonmacnoise, and Clara Bog, which is renowned all over the world for its flora and fauna and its ecosystem, are tourism features which we must develop properly in a conservationist context.  They will not be flashy; they will not be number one on the list of attractions overseas tourists come to see, but there are people who are interested in that aspect of tourism, our heritage, etc.  We should emphasise this aspect, improve it and get the most we can out of it for the area.</P>
    <P>This Bill will give the Office of Public Works an opportunity to take control of the Shannon from a navigational point of view, and because the Grand Canal feeds into it we hope to see early implementation of some very fine recommendations of the Brady Shipman Martin report which was commissioned by the Office of Public Works to look into the canal system and the inland waterways system generally.  That report points to certain developments in Shannon Harbour which I hope will be part of the Minister's priorities when the Structural Fund comes on stream for the development of our inland waterways.</P>
    <P>There are things we could do in the meantime either through the Office of Public Works or by greater liaison between the Office of Public Works and the local authorities.  There is the provision of some fairly basic amenities in the west Offaly region which borders on the Shannon.  During the summer significant numbers of tourists travelling by cruisers stop off at Shannonbridge.  The facilities at this jetty are inadequate and need to be improved and developed to meet this traffic.  Since there are no public toilet facilities there, tourists will be faced <Col N="1055" /> with the prospect of going to public houses or asking private residents for the use of their toilets.  This is appalling at a time when we are talking about developing tourism.  As a matter of urgency, we should provide these basic facilities before we talk about doing more with what we have, otherwise we will lose the opportunity presented by the Structural Fund.</P>
    <P>There is an excellent jetty at Banagher and there is no doubt that the town benefits greatly from the spending power of tourists who stop off there and receive the usual Banagher welcome.  Now that the Office of Public Works have been developing Clonmacnoise I believe we will see them develop under the Brady Shipman Martin proposals the canal system and Shannon Harbour where the Grand Canal meets the harbour.  All this must be done in an integrated way with the involvement of local groups to ensure this archaeological conservation and to enhance our resources in Offaly.</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be congratulated for bringing forward this long overdue Bill. I believe it has the support of everyone in the House.  This is my first opportunity to congratulate the Minister in his new office where he is performing in his usual competent way.  I wish him well not just with this legislation but for his term of office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I join other Deputies who have welcomed this Bill.  I have an interest in the provisions of the Bill because they relate to a large expanse of water on the eastern side of my constituency. It is significant that the Minister of State who introduced the Bill is also concerned about the same expanse of water.  I am, of course, referring to Lough Derg which has an international reputation.  The Shannon, which rises in the northern part of the country, flows into Lough Derg.  The Bill will empower the Minister, and the Commissioners of Public Works, to undertake the care, management, control, improvement and development of the Shannon navigation, including the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell <Col N="1056" /> Canal and the section of the River Erne navigation within the State which will, in fact, be deemed to be part of the Shannon navigation.</P>
      <P>I welcome the powers being taken by the Minister under the Bill.  I should like to bring it to his notice that a lot of development has taken place on the Clare and Tipperary sides of the shores of Lough Derg.  The latest development at Mountshannon should be borne in mind. Clare County Council, as part of a new sewerage scheme, have provided a substantial tank facility for the pleasure cruisers that use Lough Derg.  The vast majority of the craft using the Shannon and Lough Derg do not have tanks.  It is important that the Minister controls the pollution of that lake and he can do so by insisting that all cruisers using the lake should be fitted with proper tanks.  We have made many efforts to eliminate pollution in the lake but from time to time we have to deal with growths of algae that on occasions affect the quality of the water delivered to Limerick city.  It has also led to many fish kills in the lake and, as a result, affected tourism.</P>
      <P>In recent years we have come to realise how dependent the people living on the shores of Lough Derg are on tourism.  It is important that there should be good fishing grounds in that area.  Under the Bill the Minister will have power to control pollution and to improve facilities. The Minister has said he does not wish to duplicate the efforts of local authorities but he should do everything in his power to combine the efforts of all concerned to rid the lake of pollution.  It is important that the Department, the Office of Public Works, Clare County Council and the other county councils along the river join together to combat pollution.  The Minister should involve the fishing clubs and the sailing clubs in his efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Harney, told us that she had brought those groups together to fight pollution.  I suggest that the Minister have consultations with the Department of the Environment with a view to improving <Col N="1057" /> the quality of the water in the lake.  The Minister of State, Deputy Harney, has told me that she was concerned about the silting that was taking place in the river and there is no doubt that that comes from upstream.  I have heard Deputies refer to flooding problems in Offaly, Galway, Roscommon and further north. The Minister should make provision for periodic inspection of the lake to monitor the movements of silt and so on.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to those who use the river.  Their problem is that they do not have proper charts or information on how to use the River Shannon.  There are no navigation charts that I am aware of for Lough Derg and those who hire cruisers cannot navigate the lake by night.  I accept that there are good piers from Whitegate to Killaloe on the Clare side and at Garrykennedy on the Tipperary side, but there are no night buoys on the lake.  There are no markers to indicate Williamstown Harbour, Mountshannon Harbour, Scariff Harbour, Tuamgraney Harbour and Killaloe Harbour.  Will the Minister provide night buoys on the lake and proper lighting on the piers I have referred to?  I would ask him to encourage local authorities to erect lights on those piers but in view of the financial constraints under which they are working they may reject the idea.  However, as the Office of Public works have more funds than local authorities I suggest that he ask them to make a grant available to the local authorities to erect those lights. If we are inviting people to use that waterway we should provide the proper facilities.</P>
    <P>I should like to commend the Minister on the Bill.  However, he will have to stress the importance of local authorities and the Department of the Environment getting involved in this work.  I accept that it is difficult to arrange a meeting with officials of the Department of the Environment.  In fact, members of Clare County Council cannot gain entrance to that Department.  The Minister of State should shower good will on us and help us preserve the historical sites that are on the islands of Lough Derg.  I have no doubt that tourists would be interested in <Col N="1058" /> exploring the old ruins on those islands. It is a great facility for international tourists. We should remember that many visitors travel from the United States to England to visit the town where Shakespeare was born.  The British are not slow to develop their historic sites.</P>
    <P>We have always boasted about Ireland being the isle of saints and scholars but we have done little to highlight the remains of monastic settlements on the islands of Lough Derg.  Some private interests are keen to retain their rights on those islands but the Minister of State, who can be persuasive when he wants to, should do what he can to open them up to tourists.  I hope this courage in bringing forward the Bill will be rewarded and that the economy of Counties Clare and Tipperary will benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Daly) Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Daly)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Daly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very encouraged by the constructive and positive contributions on this important legislation and I wish to express my deep appreciation to all who contributed to one of the most constuctive debates I have heard in my time in the House.  I will endeavour to deal with some of the points raised.</P>
      <P>Deputy Connor's contribution was very well researched and he went into great detail.  I detected the source of his information but his speech was very constructive and I congratulate him.  He made a big issue of the lack of a Shannon Authority and the need to have one to deal with the overall development on the Shannon.  It is a very complicated issue which has been exercising the minds of Deputies and public representatives for quite a while.  My predecessor, Deputy Treacy, in an attempt to put a voluntary arrangement in place set up the Shannon Forum which has been working very satisfactorily since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The various authorities which have an interest in the Shannon have powers vested in them by legislation &mdash; most of which went through this House &mdash; setting out their responsibilities in their particular functions.  For instance, the Electricity Supply Board have responsibility for the ownership and management of <Col N="1059" /> fisheries and water levels.  In my experience &mdash; and in that of the Office of Public Works &mdash; the ESB, Bord na Móna and the other agencies have been most cooperative, bearing in mind that they have a vested interest and statutory responsibilities in this area.</P>
    <P>The only way forward is by constructive co-operation between the agencies who have responsibilities in overseeing the desired objective.  Setting up a statutory body to have overall responsibility in this area would not be a recipe for easing problems but perhaps for creating more.  This is also the considered view of professionals in this field. The best possible way to deal with the situation is through the very logical and sensible course of dialogue, co-operation and communication with an overall strategy which can be put in place with the help and guidance of people like the Shannon Forum to which I referred earlier.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connor also pointed out the necessity for the preservation of wildlife and the value of flora and fauna.  Since the break-up of the old forestry and wildlife department and the establishment of Coillte Teoranta, responsibility for wildlife preservation and management development rests with the Office of Public Works.  There is, of course, communication at all levels in that regard and full account is taken of the very important areas of scientific interest in relation to development, conservation and management of areas like the Clara bog.  The responsibility not only rests with us nationally but also in the European context to ensure proper management and conservation of these areas.  We take our responsibilities very seriously and that is why we have been able &mdash; with the help of national funding this year &mdash; to make a major acquisition of areas of interest and to ensure that they are conserved, managed and developed properly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connor and other Deputies stressed the importance of fisheries from the source of the Shannon down as far as the estuary.  Of course fisheries have a very valuable contribution to make to <Col N="1060" /> this overall development.  I am aware, from previous experience, of the importance of inland fisheries development conservation and the contribution it can make to overall employment, the enhancement of tourism and an amenity for our own people.  In this regard we have embarked upon a scheme of coarse fishing restocking which we will undertake in consultation with the Central Fisheries Board and the Electricity Supply Board.  The regional fisheries boards, the statutory body with responsibility for overall conservation and development, are also responsible.  The best we can achieve in that regard is to have the same level of dialogue and communication which I mentioned earlier.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works work very closely with the Central Fisheries Board and the regional fisheries boards and will play their part in enhancing the value of our very important national assets.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connor asked about the position in relation to employment opportunities and job creation generally which will arise from the project.  In the planning and construction stage it is estimated that the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal will provide approximately 100 jobs.  I wish to assure the Deputies who raised this point that we will stress to people involved in that area of activity that there are very good contractors in the locality although we are bound by certain European regulations in that regard.  Operation, maintenance, planning and construction are separate matters but, as I said, it will certainly provide jobs.  The main job creation will be when the project is completed and the impact it will have on the economic life of an area which has been devastated.  It will revitalise an area which has been run down and neglected and will provide job opportunites in tourism and related business. It will also enhance the prospect of getting private sector investment and will generate activity as mentioned earlier by one of the Deputies.  In fact, new hotels have already been built on the strength of this project.  There will also be spin-off effects in employment and economic <Col N="1061" /> activity from the revitalisation of this resource which has not been used for over 100 years.  It will enable many local businesses and communities to get involved in our major drive to redevelop an area which has enormous potential.  I hope that the development of this part of the canal, which was neglected and under-developed, will transform the economic prospects of the area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connor referred to mooring points, water supplies, telephones, toilet facilities and other infrastructural work which, of course, are necessary if the project is to be a success.  Perhaps one of the mistakes made in the original project was that it was short-changed possibly because of a lack of resources at that time or, as Deputy Nealon said, because of the devastating effect of the Famine on that area.  The shortcuts which were taken at that time may have damaged the possibility of making the project viable. We have to ensure that we do not shortcut this project by not putting in the necessary infrastructural works which are vital to its success.  I agree fully with what Deputy Connor said in this regard.  It is envisaged that there will be 50 mooring points initially and further infrastructural work will be undertaken as demand increases.  This will be useful in generating further development and activity in the area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey, Deputy Connor and others referred to the Structural Funds. Structural Fund money is available for the provision of pumphouse facilities which local authorities can avail of.  We have already pointed out to local authorities that such facilities can qualify for Structural Fund money, and they should make applications for projects in their areas.  As Deputy Carey knows, the development at Mountshannon has been successful and can be used as a pilot scheme for other developments of this nature.  Funds are available to local authorities for projects of this kind, and they should avail of them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moynihan has very wide experience of the tourism business.  I am sure that he is fully conversant, coming as he does from Killarney, with the <Col N="1062" /> opportunities and problems involved in revitalising and developing the tourism industry.  Deputy Moynihan also referred to the Structural Funds.  The Government have submitted an application for money from the Structural Funds for this project and have given it a very high priority.  Indeed, it has been identified as one of the Government's flagship projects. It is expected that about 50 per cent of the cost of the project will be met from the Structural Fund.  The Government have already committed £1.2 million to this project this year and their contribution is expected to be about 10 per cent or £3 million over the three to four year lifespan of the project.  Other bodies such as the Electricity Supply Board, are also involved in the project.  The Electricity Supply Board have put their money where their mouth is and have made a very valuable contribution to the project.  However, the main funding for the project will come from the Structural Funds region of 50 per cent, the application for which is being processed at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moynihan referred to the necessity for private investment in the project.  This project will give the private sector an opportunity to get involved with State agencies and other bodies by providing the necessary finances to enable private sector developments to take place along the canal.  There are indications already that the business expansion scheme is being used for this purpose.  I know that the business expansion scheme is being availed of by the people of Killaloe to provide tourism facilities linked to the berthing facilities along the lake. The Government would certainly encourage any such investment.  As I said in my opening remarks, we are willing to talk to private investors about the possibility of their getting involved in joint ventures with us.  We have the facilities but we may not always have the necessary finances.  Deputy Carey knows as well as I do that a sizeable amount of capital ia available for developments under the business expansion scheme.  We can see the benefits of this scheme in Killaloe, Kilkee and Lahinch.  The Government <Col N="1063" /> believe that this development offers ideal opportunites for private sector investment. The question of private sector investment for this project may not have been pursued previously but the Government will actively seek such investment in the future.  Of course, this project will have further spin-off benefits which will generate much economic activity in the area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne expressed concern about the Royal Canal and said that Dublin Corporation are keen to work with the Office of Public Works in this area.  I welcome that assurance by Deputy Byrne and I am more than willing to discuss with the corporation how we can further enhance the Royal Canal.  It is proposed to open the Royal Canal from Blanchardstown to Mullingar this month and to clean up the Royal Canal in Dublin which will be opened up next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>So long as the revenue leaves Dublin it is all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy spends as much time in Dublin as he does in Clarecastle and I am sure he knows that Dublin is a very important city.  Some tree planting has already been undertaken along the canal in Dublin which will enhance the area.  The Grand Canal is navigable from the Liffey at Ringsend to the Shannon. Even though this system is navigable I am concerned that it does not appear to be used to any great extent at present. Perhaps the Dublin Deputies will avail of this opportunity to pay some attention to the Grand Canal from the point of view of developing business, and tell me why that part of the canal which is navigable has not been developed to any large extent.  There may be reasons for this but I do not think we will have the same problems along the Shannon, in Killaloe or in the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Office of Public Works have a very good record in developing tourism amenities and tackling problems such as pollution, etc.  As Deputy Carey said, the record of the Office of Public Works speaks for itself in places such as <Col N="1064" /> Mountshannon and Whitegate.  Certainly any of the work in which they have been involved to date has been expertly executed and carefully planned.  I do not believe there will be any lack of commitment on the part of the personnel of the Office of Public Works in playing their part to ensure that the provisions of this Bill are implemented in the strict sense Deputies have been advocating in the course of this debate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne also raised the question of costs.  I have already covered this aspect &mdash; 50 per cent will come from the Structural Fund, 10 per cent by way of State investment, with the ESB and others also contributing.  For example, if one looks at the development of the marina in Kilrush one will notice that the major part of the funding of that development will come from the private sector.  I was glad to hear from the director of that maritime project in the lower Shannon recently that he has all the funding in place for that project at present, the total being in the region of £10 million.  It is obvious that private sector funding will follow the lead of the public sector provided they see some sign of action, but the private sector will not take initiatives unless they see positive action on the part of State agencies.  The Office of Public Works can give a lead in this respect particularly under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne also mentioned the need for an overall single authority to control this development.  We must bear in mind that, under the terms of the Bill before us, there are involved 200 miles of canals and rivers.  To endeavour to have an overall, single authority to control or monitor developments in that area &mdash; bearing in mind also the various planning authorities involved in that huge area &mdash; in my view would be a recipe for mismanagement rather than one for better management.</P>
    <P>We have devised an overall strategy for all navigations setting out how we would like to see them developed.  We will discuss this strategy with the local authorities involved which will comprise a blueprint for the overall development <Col N="1065" /> of the Irish navigational system.  This will comprise an overall developmental strategy the broad principles of which we would like to see maintained by local authorities countrywide.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Ellis for his very constructive remarks.  He mentioned the need for a long term policy for development, conservation and preservation of our canals system.  That is the next step needed in this area.  While we are dealing this evening with the Shannon Navigation Bill there are a number of navigational systems in the State at large.  We have now commissioned a further report.  We will be bringing forward an overall, long term strategy and policy along the lines advocated by Deputy Ellis.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ellis also mentioned personnel who worked on a voluntary basis, especially those who devote time to drainage committees and boards of trustees.  I might add my words of appreciation of their contribution.  We do value and appreciate the efforts of many people over a long period, sometimes done at enormous inconvenience to themselves. We must remember that many problems were very difficult to resolve, some of the difficulties encountered having been way beyond the capacity of any local committee. These problems arose not only by way of shortcomings in infrastructure and finances, but some were even beyond the capacity of local groups to handle.  In all these areas we will continue to need the active support and co-operation of local communities, voluntary organisations, tourism promotion bodies, &ldquo;Tidy Towns&rdquo; committees, people with a deep interest in and awareness of the value of our natural resources, many of whom have been advocating for many years that successive Governments should take some action in this regard.  I might reiterate that that action is now being taken.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ellis was concerned also about the payment of compensation to people who might be affected in some way by the changes that may take place occasioned by the flooding of lands as a result <Col N="1066" /> of the developments planned.  This contingency is fully provided for in the provisions of the Bill.  In the event of nonagreement matters of this nature will go through the normal arbitration procedures. Again this is provided for under the terms of the Bill and should not create any major problems or hardship.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that, in certain areas, some land at present subject to flooding will continue to be flooded, places such as St. John's Lock and others where the water levels will be raised.  There is adequate provision being made for compensation in these areas which will be dealt with in the normal course of events. If farming representatives or others want to discuss this aspect with us, we will be prepared to work out some overall strategy in order to minimise delays and so on.  We will certainly meet any such people and discuss these matters.  It would be our wish that the development would proceed speedily without undue delay.</P>
    <P>I could not have described in a more impressive way the overall history of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal than did Deputy Nealon this afternoon.  He gave a graphic account of the once great design turning into a great disaster.  We must ensure that, in our present efforts, this grand design will not turn into a major disaster.  We can learn from mistakes of the past, even those made in the 1840s.  I share Deputy Nealon's confidence that this new development will constitute a major boost to the morale of the people of County Leitrim.  They certainly need that boost; I do not think anybody in the House would deny that fact at present.  I share Deputy Nealon's confidence about the provisions of the Bill.  It is my firm belief that the results will be positive, making a major contribution to the overall prosperity of these regions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Nealon expressed some anxiety about my remarks in introducing the Bill &mdash; that the provisions of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, will now apply to the Ballinamore and Ballyconnell drainage district.  Previously what happened was that the drainage boards in that area carried out some work <Col N="1067" /> whose cost was recouped from the local authority.  Under this arrangement the local authority will be directly responsible for drainage.</P>
    <P>I first heard of the Ballinamore/ Ballyconnell Canal from Deputy Leonard with whom I shared an office when first elected to this House in 1973.  He was actively involved at that time in promoting the necessity for the development of that canal.  Indeed, the arguments he advanced then are just as relevant today. However, certain changes have taken place in our overall economy over the past 15 to 17 years.</P>
    <P>There is now a clear indication that tourism will play a major role in our overall economic development for the foreseeable future.  We must utilise our present resources if we are to benefit fully from them; we are not doing so at present.  We are not reaping our share of the international tourism market.  We shall continue to lose that market share unless we undertake the type of amenity and resource development advocated under the provisions of this Bill.  Certainly I see clearly the necessity for the development of such amenities and facilities not only to attract international tourists but to maintain that business.  I know Deputy Leonard has a deep, keen knowledge of the problems encountered and opportunities available in that area.</P>
    <P>I believe we must grasp this opportunity so that we can profit from the increasing tourism business, getting into the marketplace with a product equal to anything else available worldwide. If we do so we will reap our fair share of the business but, if we do not, then we will not gain or hope to maintain that share.  Let nobody have any illusions that anything less than first-class standards will be acceptable to the international tourism business.  Tourists expect good value.  If and when we go to foreign destinations, we want good value for our money.  Certainly we hear daily complaints from people who do not get good value in this respect, voiced on &ldquo;The Gay Byrne Show&rdquo; or in other ways.  If we <Col N="1068" /> are to substantially increase our market share of the international tourism market during the next four or five years we will have to provide the necessary infrastructure.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Boylan who mentioned the necessity to provide link roads and the need for development in the Lough Erne-Lough Oughter region when the referred to the excellent contractors in Counties Cavan and Monaghan.  I should point out to him that there are also excellent contractors in County Clare.  As I indicated earlier on, we have to comply with European Community regulations and I have no doubt that contractors in County Cavan, such as the Smiths and Quinns, will not be slow in submitting competitive tenders for work of this nature.  A preliminary study has been carried out of the Lough Erne-Lough Oughter Canal about which Deputy Boylan expressed concern and I can assure him that I will convey his views to the commissioners.</P>
    <P>Let us not fool ourselves: much depends on the availability of resources and despite what Deputy Carey may believe, that we have much more than the local authorities, we do not have unlimited resources.  We will give very careful consideration to any proposals submitted by Deputies in this House and will as far as possible ensure they are built into the overall plans which will prove to be successful if we can maximise private investment and local authority investment as well as our own.  I am satisfied that we have a unique opportunity to make a meaningful contribution to the development of this resource.</P>
    <P>Deputy Garland always seems to express reservations about matters for which I have responsibility.  He referred to the need to ensure no damage is done to wildlife during construction.  I can assure him that the project will be the subject of an environmental impact assessment and this should put his mind at ease.  We will take the greatest of care because, as I said earlier, there is a responsibility on us to preserve and conserve wildlife.  One of the things that surprises me is the level of international <Col N="1069" /> interest in peatlands, wildlife, flora and fauna, and it is clear that the tourism dimension is not being fully exploited.  I can assure Deputy Garland that there will be the minimum damage to wildlife.</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton who is a former member of the midlands development authority also made a very valuable contribution and referred in particular to the need to develop the canals and rivers to their full potential.  He is also anxious that there be widespread consultations.  I can assure him that we will consult with as many people, agencies and organisations as possible, but once this process has been completed decisions will have to be taken, and we will never satisfy everyone.  We are fully conscious of the need to obtain the fullest co-operation, as if we fail to receive this the project will not be a success.  The Deputy also referred to the provision of tax incentives but these are matters which should be raised on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, which will be taken shortly. However under the business expansion scheme such tax incentives and breaks are provided for this type of development. When the Deputy referred to Ballymahon on the River Inny he brought back memories of a woman who lived in Cooraclare for up to 40 years and who kept reminding us just how attractive Ballymahon is.  If the development authorities come forward with proposals and suggestions we will discuss them with them to see how best they can be built into the overall scheme of things.</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton also criticised the omission of County Longford.  However I should point out that a major development was carried out at Clondra while other work has been undertaken at Tarmonbarry and Lanesborough.  Therefore, Longford has not been and will not be neglected.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowen made similar points and refered to the need to develop our tourism industry and the Shannonbridge, Banagher and Clonmacnoise areas.  I wish to thank him for his kind remarks about the Office of Public Works for the way in which they have carried out development works, including those at <Col N="1070" /> Clonmacnoise.  These and other works are a credit to the professionalism of the personnel employed in the Office of Public Works and I should point out that areas like Shannon Harbour, Shannonbridge and Banagher will feature very prominently in the promotion campaign. The benefits of work undertaken at Ballinamore or at any other part of the system should spread throughout the system which should allay the fears of Deputy Taylor-Quinn who did not avail of the opportunity to speak on this very important Bill.  There is no doubt that Lough Derg, Mountshannon and Whitegate and many other areas will benefit from the developments being proposed in this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that we will not forget about Bansha or indeed Moyasta.  I will leave the question of whether it is possible to construct a canal system from Moyasta to Kilkee to her own ingenuity.</P>
      <P>I can assure Deputy Carey that we have had discussions with the Department of the Environment about the provision of pump house facilities for which finance as well as Structural Fund moneys, are available to the local authorities.  I can also assure him, that, under by-laws, we will have the power to insist that boats be fitted with holding tanks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Carey also pointed out the shortcomings of the charts of the lakes.  I was not aware of this and will have the matter examined before Committee Stage.  I agree with him when he says there is a need to update the charts and the literature on those places where facilities are available.  It is most disappointing for a tourist, on reaching a destination, to find that the facilities listed on charts are not there.  I have received many complaints during the years from people who had been assured that they would have a full view of the sea from houses in my constituency but on arrival soon discovered that very often they had to drive five miles to reach the sea.  We have got <Col N="1071" /> to avoid that under this legislation.  In promoting our resources and amenities we should be honest and not bring people in under false pretences as this could damage our tourism industry.  I would prefer to see them up in Mount Shannon and Killaloe by night.  It would be enormously expensive to put in navigational aids for night time cruising on the canal system and I am not so sure it would be welcomed by the people in the private sector we are encouraging to invest in the tourism amenities and facilities that we have been talking about here all afternoon.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works have had long association dating back to the early part of the last century with the development and management of inland navigation here.  I have already spoken about their involvement with the Shannon, the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal and the outdated legislation under which these have been administered.  Over the last few years the Government have taken positive steps to bring the management of our inland waterways into line with modern requirements.  The Canals Act of 1986 was the first significant step taken to revitalise not only our interest in and awareness of the value of these systems but also to allow the application of modern practices to their management and development.  We are all well aware of the excellent work done by the Office of Public Works.  The Royal and the Grand Canals and the Barrow navigation system were transferred to the Office of Public Works under the 1986 Act.  This work is of course part of an ongoing programme which will continue for years to come.</P>
    <P>I am also arranging a major study of all other canals and waterways within the State with a view to drawing up a total strategy for the development of all our viable navigation systems.</P>
    <P>The aim of the Shannon Navigation Bill now being debated here is to broaden the remit of the Office of Public Works in this field by consolidating their position <Col N="1072" /> in relation to the control and management of the existing navigation, extending their jurisdiction to include the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal and the Erne-Lough Oughter system in the State for which there is no existing navigational authority.  Although the Office of Public Works has already expended significant sums of money on the provision of berthing and other facilities on the Shannon, the programme for which is still in hands, the first major project undertaken under this new enactment will be the restoration of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal thus reopening the long defunct link between the Shannon and Erne systems. Combined with the Canals Act this Bill will provide the means to link and develop navigations of the lower reaches of the Barrow to Dublin and the Shannon and the network of navigations in Northern Ireland.  A comprehensive study as to the feasibility of restoring the navigation on the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal was undertaken by the Office of Public Works and completed in 1986.  It was established that restoration was a distinct possibility but would require substantial civil engineering works involving the clearning and enlarging of the navigational channel, preparing locks and embankments and strengthening and rebuilding bridges for which preliminary designs and cost estimates were prepared.</P>
    <P>The reopening of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal will play an important role in revitalising the catchment area and provide the basis for development of tourist activities in the area.  Because of the multiplicity of interests the Government have set up a steering committee to oversee the project.  This committee will consist of representatives of the Departments of Finance, Foreign Affairs, Tourism and Transport, the ESB and, of course, the Office of Public Works.  In addition a joint steering committee has been established with the Northern Ireland authorities to effectively oversee the cross-Border dimensions in the project but the Government have also given the reopening of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal a high priority as one of <Col N="1073" /> the flagship projects for EC Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Navigation Bill is further evidence of our commitment to the maximisation of the potential of our greatest assets.  I am confident that in the exercise of their responsibilities in this area the Office of Public Works will apply the same high standards as they apply in their other areas of responsibility such as the management and development of our national parks, the preservation of our national monuments, and the restoration of our heritage buildings such as Dublin Castle, The Royal Hospital, Kilmainham and the Custom House, just to mention a few.  I look forward to the continued co-operation of the House in seeing this Bill through.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Marine Institute Bill, 1989:  [  Seanad ]   Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Noonan, Limerick West) Michael J. (Limerick West) Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick West):</i> The Minister of State who has just concluded on the previous Bill was, to a large extent, as Minister for the Marine, responsible for the initiation of this Bill. I would like to pay tribute to him for his foresight in that regard.  The Bill sets out to address the necessity in a maritime nation for a coherent and co-ordinated Government policy for the development of marine resources.  The promotion, therefore, of the Marine Institute Bill marks another decisive step in putting in place the structures that were envisaged in a policy document entitled &ldquo;Roinn na Mara&rdquo; which was published in 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will be aware that there are many problems currently affecting the positive and progressive development of our marine economy.  These problems can be attributed to the absence of a clearly defined policy.  This is <Col N="1074" /> accompanied by a great fragmentation of administrative structures.  The purpose of the Bill is to get the structures right so that the latent marine potential of the State can be fully realised in everyone's interests.</P>
    <P>The urgent necessity for the right policies was acknowledged very forcefully by the last administration.  That administration attempted to solve a number of the problems in the area through the establishment of Roinn na Mara, a new department who have brought together all the different aspects of marine development.  In the past three years Roinn na Mara have improved the administration of the marine sector and have sought to tackle some of the problems indicated in the seminal document &ldquo;Roinn na Mara&rdquo; to which I have referred.  These included, for example, wasteful utilisation of Government financial and human resources and demarcation overlaps in policy between Government Departments and agencies operating both within and outside the marine field.  That document referred too, to the absence of forward development planning relating to existing established marine resources and those with development potential.  It included references to the lack of cohesion in approach to international maritime developments which impinge on national interests.  It also referred to the inadequate investment in research and development.  That is by way of background. I would now like to focus on the issue indicated in the Bill before this House.</P>
    <P>We may ask ourselves why we need a marine institute.  Indeed, it is a logical question to ask.  The oceans are the last frontier, the least known part of our planet.  They cover 70 per cent of its surface area and have been used by man as far back as we can remember to reach other continents and to supply him with food and other resources.  Yet, it is only recently that their multifarious role has been fully comprehended.</P>
    <P>We cannot, however, exploit the tremendous resource potential of the oceans without knowledge of what is out <Col N="1075" /> there, without the capacity to measure these resources, having identified them, and without the capacity to develop the necessary related tools and instruments. We must at the same time ensure the protection of the environment in all its aspects.  It is in providing this information that marine research plays a vital role.</P>
    <P>The sea and seabed resources, and the technologies related to their exploitation, represent a new and important trend in economic and industrial development on a global scale.  In future decades, the resources of the sea will account for an increasing share of the world economy. Control of such resources and the ability to explore and exploit them, will play a significant part in the economic growth and development of many nations.  It also means that competition for the use of new resourcese will be intense.</P>
    <P>In the case of Ireland, the marine area constitutes a major but underdeveloped natural resource and offers significant opportunities in terms of wealth and employment creation for a broad range of industries.</P>
    <P>As an island nation every aspect of our daily lives is in some way influenced by the sea that surrounds us, whether it be the effect of the sea on our climate or the distance from mainland export markets. Yet, as a nation we do not perceive ourselves as a maritime people and, worse, the sea continues to be regarded as a barrier to development rather than a natural resource to be utilised and developed for the benefit of the nation.</P>
    <P>Ireland's marine area is very large in comparison to that of other European nations.  In fact, the Irish Continental Shelf is unusually wide by international standards.  It covers an area many times the size of the national land territory.  It is likely that this vast area of the Continental Shelf contains tremendous resources.  In order to capitalize on our marine and fisheries resources, it is essential that we measure these resources, understand how they behave and devise the most effective exploitation methods. Only then can we systematically start to exploit these resources commercially.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1076" /> The successful commercial development of all natural resources, whether they be marine or others, depends on a well co-ordinated, directed and supportive research and development effort. Thus, the growing worldwide investment in marine science and technology arises from an awareness that the oceans can be one of mankind's major future sources of new food, energy, mineral and chemical supplies.</P>
    <P>Marine science and technology has a vital role to play in the understanding, identification, location and mapping of marine resources, with developing and supporting marine-related industries, and providing the fundamental information on which to base development strategies.  The lack of some of the most elementary knowledge of our marine environment and resources base is crucial. The Marine Institute will fill this gap, providing the vehicle to promote the development of marine resources across a wide number of sectors &mdash; fisheries, aquaculture, non-living resources, marine engineering and electronics, etc.</P>

      <P>Deputy Charles Flanagan gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter as to the clarification of responsibilities for the unkeep, maintenance and repair of canalside roads between the Office of Public Works and local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, and the Minister of State for coming into the House tonight to clarify a number of points on an issue of considerable importance, and one that is causing deep concern in the midlands, particularly in my own constituency of Laois-Offaly.  I would draw the Minister's attention to the fact that in County Offaly alone there are over 50 miles of roadway flanking the Grand <Col N="1077" /> Canal.  When one considers the history of our canal network one can say that today the uses of the canal from a commercial point of view are far less than heretofore. Nevertheless, there has been considerable settlement along the canal banks in the midlands.  From time to time people sited commercial industries there and a number of houses are built.</P>
      <P>Times have changed and the canals are now being used primarily as leisure and tourist amenities.  Some years ago responsibility for the canals was transferred from CIE to the Office of Public Works but a number of very serious problems still remain.  Notwithstanding the transfer of responsibility for the canals, there remains the very important question of responsibility for the roads which serve people who built houses in the area. In County Offaly there are 200 houses along the canal banks between Edenderry and the Shannon.  The people living there permanently find it extremely difficulty to traverse the roads daily because of the very bad state of repair into which they have fallen.  The county councils have difficulty taking many of these roads in charge; the Office of Public Works do not want to know about them and, to the best of my knowledge, some roads are still under the jurisdiction of CIE.</P>
      <P>People living on farms, particularly outlying farms, have no other access than the canal lines.  I am sure the Minister would be in favour of expanding our canals from a tourist point of view.  There are cruisers and canoe halts along the canals.  The development of the tourist industry will be considerably flawed until the roadways serving these canals are taken to hand.  Many of the canal roads in County Offaly have become through roads from parish to parish.  This has been ignored by the Office of Public Works and by local authorities.  From a tourist point of view we are talking about making available more facilities for anglers.  If access to our canals is denied we are doing ourselves a disservice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister might clarify whether the Office of Public Works or the local authorities are responsible for the roadways adjoining the canals.  I understand that a <Col N="1078" /> formal handing over of some roads along the canals was made from CIE to the Office of Public Works but a number of roads still have not been handed over.  I believe that a certain technical difficulty arises as far as Grand Canal By-Law 51 made on 7 April 1942, is concerned.  I will quote from the by-law, which I believe to be of importance.  The object of the by-law was to protect canal embankments, especially those over peat or poor foundations, from the effects of modern vehicular traffic.  By-Law 51 states:</P>
    <P>no person shall lead, ride or drive any vehicle other than a bicycle or a cart ... carrying a load of not more than ten hundred weight .... along certain streches of canal bank.</P>
    <P>I believe there are areas of County Offaly where this Grand Canal by-law is still being enforced.  The by-law is outdated and has absolutely no relevance. The people who have built houses along the canal bank are not entitled to bring vehicular traffic, such as the family car, down these roads. this is a big problem. How relevant is by-law 51 today?  I know there are areas the by-law does not cover, but until such time as it is done away with, certain difficulties will remain.</P>
    <P>By way of parliamentary question some time ago I attempted to elicit information on this matter and the reply was that the roads along the canals, particularly the Grand Canal, were to be used as tow paths and for animal drawn traffic, presumably to facilitate the passage of barges through the locks.  That will not wash in this day and age when more than 100 people have been granted planning permission for the building of the houses, when people are encouraging the growth of the tourist industry in these areas and when we are seeking to attract people to engage in fishing activities.  The fact that access will be denied to these thoroughfares must be redressed.</P>
    <P>I am talking about areas stretching right across the midlands &mdash; from Edenderry through hamlets like Ballycommon, Tullamore, the capital of County Offaly, west of Tullamore through Rahan, Pullough and Belmount, <Col N="1079" /> leading to the Shannon at Shannon Harbour. People have been accustomed to using the roads along this 50 mile stretch. Offaly County Council cannot afford the maintenance of these roads.  They are obviously anxious to wash their hands of the matter, as are the Office of Public Works, and the road structure is falling into disrepair in many of these areas. There is an administrative jungle as far as responsibility is concerned.  Are CIE responsible?  Are the Office of Public Works responsible.  Are the local authorities responsible?  I take it that some of these roads have been taken in charge by the county council, and the Office of Public Works are abdicating their responsibility in this regard.  The county councils do not have sufficient funds to deal with the regional and county roads and it is a bit much to expect them to be in a position to take charge of these canal banks and provide the necessary funding to make the roads passable.</P>
    <P>I understand that in recent times the Office of Public Works refused to meet a deputation from Offaly County Council. I hope the Minister can now accede to that request in the hope that dialogue can take place which would benefit the people in the area, people who are very much inconvenienced.  I cannot understand how one arm of the State, the planning authority, can justifiably grant planning permission to build houses and set up commercial concerns in the area while another body are abdicating responsibility entirely when it comes to taking in charge the roads.</P>
    <P>In 1979 the Inland Waterways Association in a document entitled <i>Strategy for the Development of the Grand Canal System</i> urged the paving of canal tracks up to the requisite standard where the track is used by cars, not associated with canal upkeep.  Similarly they recommended that paved canal roads be taken in charge by all local authorities and that the canal organisation, local authorities and residents' associations co-operate in the maintenance of the canal verges and road signs in the area.  I find it very difficult to understand how&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The roads along the Grand and Royal Canals are a significant part of the property transferred to the Office of Public Works under the Canals Act, 1986.  They were originally constructed as canal towpaths for use by horses in the days of horse-drawn boats and for use by pedestrians and for canal maintenance purposes.  They were never intended to be public roadways for use by vehicluar traffic, nor were they designed for this prupose.</P>
      <P>Over the years, however, certain stretches of the towpaths have developed into roadways used for access between bridges and to groups of houses built alongside the canals.  In such cases, before the Office of Public Works was given reponsibility for canals, where it became obvious that this use would continue and where the canal banks were considered capable of taking the traffic, the towpaths were given into the charge of the local authority for the area, to be surfaced and maintained.  Ownership of these towpaths/roads remained with the canal undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Canals Act, 1986, gives the Office <Col N="1081" /> of Public Works responsibility for maintaining and managing the canals and canal property as public amenities for enjoyment and recreation.  The towpaths in general have significant amenity potential and to allow those now under the control of the Office of Public Works to be used indiscriminately as public roadways would not be in keeping with their amenity potential.  In addition, there is the possibility of damage to the stability of the canal banks in some areas if they were to be used constantly by vehicular traffic.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, certain further towpaths have been examined with a view to their being given into the charge of the local authority.  These are towpaths identified as having been used regularly for vehicular traffic and their structural stability has not been adversely reduced by such traffic.  In such instances the Commissioners of Public Works are amenable to their being taken into charge by the local authority.  Negotiations are in hand with one local authority in this respect. Towpaths have been identified and proposed to the local authority and the administrative procedures necessary for the transfer are proceeding.  It is envisaged that the local authority will assume responsibility for their maintenance while the commissioners will impose certain restrictions regarding the vehicle use.  I should point out that the commissioners are not disposed to a wholesale transfer of towpaths to local authorities for vehicular access as such use could both damage the structure of the canal and reduce the amenity value of this important resource.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that this is complicated. We have been discussing canals throughout the afternoon.  If the Deputy has particular grievances I am prepared to meet him.  The first I heard of any request for a deputation from Offaly County Council is tonight.  If he and the other Deputies from the area wish to arrange such a deputation I will discuss their particular problems.  These towpaths were never meant to be roadways for vehicular traffic.  We already had a major breach in Edenderry which cost us well in excess of £2 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you sincerely for allowing me to raise the subject of the proposal for the regional technical college and rural development institute at Thurles in County Tipperary.  The original proposals were made by North Tipperary Vocational Education Committee in 1979.  They were endorsed by South Tipperary Vocational Education Committee in the person of Councillor Neddy Brennan, the then chairman.  They recommended the establishment of an RTC at Thurles to provide technical education in engineering, science and business.  In 1982 approval in principle was granted by the then Government.  In 1985 the Department of Education issued a schedule of courses for the proposed RTC.  The Department also purchased a 20 acre college site at Thurles in 1987 and they appointed a design team in the same year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, following the cutbacks in Government expenditure in late 1987 the RTC proposals were then deferred.  The publication of the National Development Plan provided an opportunity to reassess this proposal.  The plan creates a clear link between education and development. The plan recognises the close linkage between development in rural areas and educational institutes and that these would play a vital role in promoting rural and regional economic development. This view has also been shared by Commissioner MacSharry in his efforts in the <Col N="1083" /> Community at Commission level.  This proposal represents a response to the issues raised by the Government in their plan.  This proposal has been substantiated by the action committee set up in Thurles comprising both counties.  It is supported not only by the statutory authorities of South Tipperary and North Tipperary County Councils and the VECs in those areas but also in County Laois which adjoins them and is subscribed to by Clonmel Corporation and the urban district councils in north and south Tipperary.</P>
    <P>The justification for this proposal is on four counts.  There is a shortage of places at third level education.  The Minister for Education said in a Dáil debate of 19 July 1989 that 10,000 extra places would be required by the year 2000.  The provision of 800 extra places in this new institute in Thurles would obviously help to alleviate this shortage.  These urgently needed places can be provided cost effectively through this proposal because this unique concept in Irish third level education has the following features: it would be an integrated rural development institute serving Tipperary, west Laois, south Offaly and west Kilkenny with sub-centres based in second level schools in the catchment areas.  The emphasis would be on community development, agriculture, forestry, alternative income generating farming enterprises and technology transferred to rural Ireland.  A business development institute serving the same area and using the same resources as SFADCo, industry, local services and college developments which already exist between businesses and services would be attractive to new industries at the appropriate scale.  A continuing education programme which is an integral part of this college and the workload of college staff would be a focus for business, rural and community development.  There would also be the advantage of a number of mainstream RTC-RDI programmes in engineering, science and business with an emphasis on courses relating to the catchment areas natural resources of agriculture, forestry, peat and coal. <Col N="1084" /> These are all reasons that this proposal should receive Government approval. We suggest also post-leaving certificate courses to cater for the growing demand in the large urban areas and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The college would have a structure of work which would involve enterprise, marketing, engineering, the environment, rural development and community development in urban areas.  We anticipate co-operation between all the existing institutions in the area, locally, regionally and nationally, such as the Garda Training College in Templemore, Rockwell Agricultural College, Gurteen Agricultural College, St. Patrick's College in Ferns, Teagasc, the FÁS agencies and SFADCo.  Regionally we hope to link with the University of Limerick and co-ACT.  Nationally we hope to tap into all the national universities and regional colleges.  We hope to use the institute for approximately 14 hours per day for 360 days a year.  We hope to share staff in this institute with industry, agriculture and local businesses, and that the building of such provision into this contract for the college staff will be an element of continuing education and work in industry and in the community itself.  Planning the college in such a way that we would have a mix of all these programmes in Thurles will cater for the changing needs and demographic trends already in the country.  We hope that by so doing we will improve the access for the lowest socio-economic group which had been identified by Clancy in his report of 1988 which has shown that Tipperary has the fourth lowest participation rate nationally by the second lowest socio-economic grouping, as contained in Table 28 of the Clancy report.</P>
    <P>The area itself that is chosen and supported by all agencies &mdash; involved in the area are two Ministers in this Government &mdash; is Thurles.  It is a strategic location.  It is in the centre of the area that is inadequately served by third level education already in the area.  We have institutes in Limerick, Cork, Waterford, Carlow and Athlone, but in the hinterland of Tipperary there is no such institute. Everybody supporting this proposal <Col N="1085" /> believes this is the ideal location and that is why there is agreement and consensus about where it should be.  I am from South Tipperary and we there are as committed to it as are the Oireachtas Members in North Tipperary and, indeed, as are the two Ministers, Deputy O'Kennedy and Deputy Smith whose Departments will be directly involved in agriculture and science and technology.</P>
    <P>In terms of transport, Thurles has an excellent connection with all the other catchment areas.  It straddles the main Dublin-Cork route.  The town is well served by rail links and national primary roads.  It has a total of 21 train services on the main Dublin Cork line which pass through it daily.  The level of bus services is good and there are some strong private operators, in particular Kavanaghs of Urlingford and Tuohys of Nenagh.  These infrastructural advantages will help, with their buses and transport systems, to ensure students get to the area and return home at weekends.  Maps and timetables are available and have been submitted to the Department.</P>
    <P>Having met the Minister on a deputation when she almost suggested a change in our proposals, we hope that with this change it will fit into the national plan that has been submitted for structural funding, and since the whole concept is along the lines of the development of rural areas as defined by the Commissioner, we hope this proposal will have total and committed Government support.  Everybody in the three counties who is involved is looking to the Government for agreement in principle so that further work can be done in whatever way the Government feel this plan needs to bring to fruition the efforts that go back to 1979.  I hope we will have a positive response from the Minister present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce (Mr. Leyden)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to reply to the contribution by Deputy Michael Ferris in relation to this matter and I wish to apologise for the absence of the Minister, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, who is abroad on official <Col N="1086" /> Government business.  The original proposal for the establishment of an RTC-type institution in Thurles has recently been amended by the local action committee representing Tipperary North Riding and South Riding County Councils and VECs.  This amended proposal was received in the Department of Education on 1 March 1990.</P>
      <P>The proposal envisages the setting up of the Tipperary rural and business development institute.  It seeks approval of the proposal in principle to build the institute catering for 800 students on the RTC site and, because the proposal involves the co-operation of several Government Departments, the establishment of an interdepartmental committee chaired by a representative of the Taoiseach's Department to co-ordinate the implementation of this project.  It goes on to suggest that the committee be given three months to report and that two representatives from the action committee work with the interdepartmental committee.  It is envisaged that the capital and running costs of the institute will be the same as those of a similar size RTC, though the submission envisages a higher return for students and the community.</P>
      <P>The proposal aims to provide full-time and part-time third level courses oriented to the needs of rural business and community. Full-time programmes would be in the area of business, engineering, science and the humanities and would include also post-leaving certificate courses.  The courses would be at certificate, diploma and degree levels and would be validated by the NCEA.  It is proposed that the courses would operate also in the second level schools in the institute's catchment area.  These would be out-centres of the institute.  The board of management, in addition to VEC representation, would include representatives from the Departments of Education and Industry and Commerce, Teagasc, secondary schools, the churches, industry, staff and students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, has indicated to the action committee, as a first step she was asking her officials to examine the proposal in detail and to <Col N="1087" /> prepare a comprehensive report for her. This is being prepared at present, and I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that a proposal such as this, which invovles very significant capital expenditure, requires careful consideration.  I presume the Deputy will be raising this matter <Col N="1088" /> again and at that time the Minister will have received the report from her officials and she will be in a position to give a more comprehensive reply than I can give this evening.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 9 May 1990.</P>

As the person in question was not so serving, he is not eligible for a severance gratuity.  However, he is, and has been since 1972, in receipt of a service pension under the Defence Forces pensions schemes.</P>

      <P>The person in question is in receipt of both a service pension under the Defence Forces pensions schemes and a disability pension under the Army Pensions Acts.</P>
      <P>The schemes provide that, where a person is granted both a service pension and a disability pension, the service pension is reduced so that, in general, the total of both pensions will not exceed the sum of the greater pension plus one-half of the lesser.  The disability pension, which is exempt from income tax, is paid in full.  The principle involved is not unique to Defence Forces' personnel.</P>

    <P>Income tax on farming profits is collected with Schedule D tax generally and the figures shown are, to some extent, estimated.  The figures shown are estimates of the tax paid by full-time farmers together with tax paid by trader-farmers on their farming profits only.  The yields in 1980 and 1983 were inflated by the effects of bringing forward the due dates for payment of the tax in those years. The yields in 1986 and 1987 were affected by reduced profit levels resulting from disadvantageous weather conditions in 1985 and 1986.  The 1988 figure includes an estimated £38 million in respect of the effects of the tax amnesty on the collection of arrears.</P>

      <P>The Special Border Areas Programme 1986-1990 provides for aid from the European Regional Development Fund for energy and tourism measures.  Of the total ERDF aid of £24.75 million available under the programme, £5 million is being held in reserve to cover the possible extension of a natural gas supply investment from Dundalk if this is found to be viable.  Any part of this £5 million not used for this purpose is to be reallocated to finance <Col N="908" /> measures under the tourism-based part of the programme.</P>
      <P>The steering committee for the programme are at present considering the results of a feasibility study on the western extension of the gas supply.  In the light of that examination, a decision is expected to be taken shortly on the question of the allocation of the £5 million reserve.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 70 and 71 together.</P>
      <P>While the Ballynacarragh and Clyard areas are situated in the Corrib-Headford River catchment area they are not included in the Corrib-Headford catchment drainage scheme carried out by the Commissioners of Public Works between 1967 and 1975 as the cost could not be justified on economic grounds.  As their responsiblities in the area are now confined by statute to the maintenance of the completed works of the Corrib-Headford catchment drainage scheme, the commissioners are unable to undertake any additional works at this stage.  Accordingly the question of my providing finance in this manner does not arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to remind the House that my primary and indeed statutory duty as the insurance supervisory authority is to ensure that insurance companies maintain their statutory reserves and solvency requirements. I must, therefore, respect the right of insurance firms to make their own underwriting decisions, including the acceptance or rejection of any risk, in the <Col N="920" /> light of their own underwriting experience. No legal obligation can be placed on an insurer to quote in respect of any risk or to quote at any particular premium. I am not responsible for the day-to-day running of insurance companies or the exercise of business acumen on their behalf.</P>
      <P>The cost of insurance in this country, as indeed in any market, is substantially dependent on the frequency and level of claims.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunately the case that the particular problems of high crime areas give rise to high claims and, therefore, higher premium costs.  The costs of claims can only be met by insurance companies if an adequate premium is forthcoming to cover the risk involved.</P>
      <P>In relation to property and related insurance, the Irish Insurance Federation is on record to the effect that: insurers do not regard any area as a &ldquo;black spot&rdquo; for the purposes of providing cover; each case is assessed on its own merits, but very few risks are genuinely uninsurable; certain areas social problems which give rise to high claims and premium costs are neither within the control of insurers nor unique to any city in Ireland and claims and premiums are directly and closely linked.  However, the federation's property standing committee is always prepared to re-examine cases of failure to obtain property insurance, on the strict understanding that it cannot guarantee to provide cover.</P>
      <P>Before any case can be referred to the federation it is necessary that at least half the market (approximately 12 companies including Lloyds), be approached without success.  Evidence of these approaches (e.g. a letter from a broker together with a brief synopsis of the risk should be forwarded to the insurance section of my Department who will refer the matter to the federation.  I must again emphasise that, while this arrangement is reasonably successful, no guarantee can be given that cover will be forthcoming in each individual case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Matters such as (a) the introduction of a safety net national insurance scheme to cover persons on low incomes and (b) the <Col N="921" /> use of block policies which would enable the risk to be spread among tenants of local authority areas, residents associations or private property owners, are more appropriate to the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for the Environment respectively.</P>

      <Quest>the purpose of the requirement of recipients of social welfare to inform the local employment exchange/office if he/she is absent from the State for any period; if there is a limit on the period of time of absence; if this requirement applies to Northern Ireland; if any change will be introduced in relation to Northern Ireland, in light of the Supreme Court ruling in the McGimpsey case; and if the requirement applies to visits to other EC countries.</Quest>

      <P>The purpose of such notifications arises from changes which I introduced in July 1988 to facilitate persons in receipt of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance who are temporarily absent from the State usually on holidays.  I provided a similar facility for those who represent Ireland in an amateur sporting capacity at an international event held abroad.  In the case of those holidaying abroad a limit of two weeks in any calendar year applies. Absence from the State is construed as including periods in Northern Ireland and <Col N="925" /> there is no differentiation between EC member states and other countries.</P>
      <P>This improvement extended to persons holidaying abroad existing arrangements which previously only applied to persons holidaying within the State.  A two week limit applies also in these cases and the local office must be notified.  There are no proposals for further changes in these holiday arrangements.</P>

      <Quest>in light of the large amount of money due to the Exchequer in unpaid court fines, if he accepts that the enforcement procedure available to the courts is unsatisfactory; if a more efficient administrative machinery with ways of ensuring equity in the levying and collection of fines, will make fines a better option; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Procedures relating to the collection of unpaid court fines make heavy demands on the staff resources of the courts and of the Garda but every effort is made, within the limits of these resources and with due regard to the other urgent work commitments of the staff involved, to make the fine collection process as efficient as possible.  The amount of fines collected in 1989 was £6.5 million approximately which represents a considerable increase over the amount collected in the preceding year.  It should also be borne in mind that there will always be sizeable amounts of fines outstanding, representing work currently in the hands of courts staff or the Garda.</P>

      <P>The scope for the exercise by me of initiatives of the type suggested is limited, having regard to the constitutional independence of the Judiciary.  District justices hold regular statutory meetings to discuss topics relevant to their work and I understand that judges of the higher courts also meet regularly for the same purpose.  The attendance of judges at meetings abroad, to discuss developments in the judicial sphere, is also facilitated. I am willing to consider any suggestions that the Judiciary may have as to how I might assist further in this process.</P>

      <P>The planning and carrying out of work under the remedial works scheme are matters for the local authority.  An allocation of £5 million has been made this year to Dublin Corporation under the scheme for approved refurbishment proposals, including this estate.  It is a matter for the local authority to apportion this amount between their approved projects.  Their proposals for phase 3 of the Darndale project are being examined and a <Col N="937" /> decision will be notified as soon as possible. The actual level of funding available under the scheme to housing authorities each year is dependent on the provision in the Public Capital Programme and the competing demands for assistance from authorities.</P>

      <P>The admission of cancer patients for treatment is a matter for the St. Luke's/St. Anne's Hospital Board.  I am aware of the article to which the Deputy is referring but I would like to assure him that a recent examination of the waiting list indicates a significant reduction in the waiting period which is now down to about two weeks.  Patients requiring emergency treatment are of course admitted without delay.</P>
      <P>This improvement has been brought about by increased utilisation of beds at the St. Anne's unit following integration of St. Luke's and St. Anne's hospitals under a new board of management in December 1988, the introduction of a common admissions policy for the two units and the provision of new radiotherapy equipment at both units.</P>
      <P>With regard to bed closures the position is that 15 hostel beds were closed last February due to their unsuitability for nursing care.</P>
