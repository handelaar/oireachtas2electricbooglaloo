    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed that statements on European Economic and Monetary Union and European Political Union shall be made now and, not-withstanding anything in Standing Orders, the following arrangements shall apply: (1) the statement by the Taoiseach shall not exceed 40 minutes; (2) the statement of the main spokesperson for each of the groups shall not exceed 30 minutes; (3) the statement of each other Member called on, shall not exceed 20 minutes; and (4) the statements shall conclude not later than 5 p.m.  It is also proposed that at the conclusion of business today, the House shall adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 13 November 1990.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I have submitted to you an amendment to that proposal &ldquo;That the House shall adjourn next week for 7 November only and that the House shall sit in the normal way on Tuesday and Thursday&rdquo;.  I propose that amendment because, there is, as the Taoiseach has already indicated on previous occasions, a very long list of legislative proposals which need to be dealt with urgently, to name but a number of them, the Radiological Protection Bill, the Criminal Rape Bill and the Child Care Bill.  They need urgent attention and I do not believe we should adjourn this House for longer than is necessary next week. For that reason I am proposing the amendment I have already indicated.</P>

Will that be a permanent arrangement or does he intend to appoint a Minister for Defence? In view of the particular importance of current developments within the Defence Forces and the implications of the Gleeson report, it is clearly a job which requires the undivided attention of a specific Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The first European <Col N="892" /> Council under the Italian Presidency met in Rome on 27 and 28 October.  I attended the meeting together with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Gerard Collins.  A copy of the Presidency's Conclusions has been placed in the Oireachtas Library.  Today I want to report on the outcome of the European Council and at the same time to address the related issues that will arise in the intergovernmental conference which will open in December on European Economic and Monetary Union and European Political Union, and at the Europeam Congress of National Parliaments which will meet in Rome at the end of November.</P>
      <P>Our membership of the European Community and the need to discuss at national level the changes and developments which have taken place since we joined have provided this House with some of its most important debates.  I hope the present one will be no exception. In the past, there has been a general recognition and acceptance of the value of EC membership for this country and a desire that we should make our own contribution to the process of integration of the European Community.  It is understood also that the Community provides the fundamental political and economic framework within which, as members of Government or as parliamentarians, we will operate in the future and which affords us the opportunity of achieving the highest level of prosperity.</P>
      <P>When we applied to join the European Community we did so in the knowledge that we would be required to develop new policies and to participate in new initiatives, some unfamiliar to us, as the Community itself grew and expanded. The benefits and the obligations of membership go hand in hand.  The Treaty of Rome makes it clear that the members of the Community are embarked on a process that leads to an even closer union of the peoples of Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The oil crises combined with the doubling of membership from six to 12 in the space of 12 years understandably slowed down the pace of integration but it could not delay it indefinitely.  No doubt some <Col N="893" /> of the member states felt frustrated that it has not always been possible to move forward at a quicker pace; they believed that the Community was at its most vulnerable when it was most divided; they saw the over-zealous defence of sovereignty and protection of national interests as the principal causes of the economic sclerosis which attacked the Community during the late seventies and early eighties.</P>
    <P>At the same time, others argued that by consolidating what they had and by feeling their way cautiously with one hand firmly holding on to the past, they would somehow be in a better position to protect their national interests.  It was only when the gravity of what was happening to the economies of the member states as a result of the collective failure of the Community to strengthen and develop common policies became clear that a new sense of urgency entered the political arena and set the Community on a new and accelerating course to fuller integration.</P>
    <P>Not very long after the entry into force of the Single European Act in 1987, the Community is once again considering how it can prepare itself to face the new realities &mdash; political, economic and social &mdash; of a changed and changing world.  The European Community, which came into existence as a consequence of a terrible war in order to provide reconciliation and hope for only half of Europe's population, has now clearly become a political anchor for all of the people of Europe. Just as the original six members of the Community acted as a spur to other countries including Ireland so, we, the Community of Twelve must inspire and encourage the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe to consolidate their newly won democratic freedom, give it full and fruitful expression and build efficient market economies in order to offer a better life to all their citizens.</P>
    <P>We can be justly proud of the progress that has been made since the ratification of the Single European Act, but we must ensure that the momentum which has been generated can be channelled into even more rapid and deeper integration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="894" /> The Internal Market is on schedule for completion by 1 January 1993.  By the same date, substantial progress will have been made towards economic and monetary union with the possibility of a single European currency &mdash; something unimaginable just a few years ago &mdash; in circulation before the end of the decade. The legislation under the action programme to apply the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers will be nearing completion.  In other policy areas such as research and technological development and the environment substantial progress will also have been made.  If we are to go further we must examine together what new objectives we need to set ourselves and, having reached agreement on them, make them part of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>At the international level, the Community is facing new challenges.  At the beginning of this year, during our Presidency, I moved to put our relationship with the United States on a sounder and more stable footing.  It is astonishing to recall that one of the Community's most important relationships had not been formalised and lacked the support of a proper structure within which it was possible to meet at the highest political level and to discuss issues of common interest.</P>
    <P>Nearer home, the rapid implementation of the Internal Market caused concern among the EFTA countries who felt that their interests would be threatened if they did not quickly enter into dialogue, as a group, with the Community.  Those negotiations are difficult and progress has been slow but they are taking place at an intensive level, stimulated no doubt by the realization on the part of EFTA that not only is the Community moving rapidly towards the full achievement of its present objectives but is about to embark on a process which will set it new ones.</P>
    <P>To the south, the countries of the Mediterranean, bound to the Community by traditional trade, cultural and historic links, are looking to us for help to sustain progress already made towards democracy and viable economic reform. Instability in this region of the world <Col N="895" /> would have a direct impact on the Community and we must invest time and energy to address the economic, social and environmental problems of these countries and build a policy of good neighbourly relations with them.</P>
    <P>It is, however, on the continent of Europe itself that the most dramatic developments have taken place.  The farreaching changes in Central and Eastern Europe have helped to encourage the Governments of the member states to accelerate the political construction of Europe.  For it was the Community, seen as a symbol of prosperity and freedom, where all member countries have an equal right to be heard and to have their say, which in part motivated millions of men and women to take to the streets and overthrow the oppressive regimes which had held them in servitude since the end of the war.</P>
    <P>The unification of Germany on 3 October through free self-determination and by peaceful and democratic means is, and should be, a source of great satisfaction to the Community.  It offers a remarkable example of the way in which the Community and its institutions can function and co-operate once there is political agreement and when clear objectives have been set.  Ireland warmly welcomed German unification and can take pride in the very positive part we were able to play during our Presidency to facilitate the integration of the former German Democratic Republic into the Community.</P>
    <P>What has emerged more forcefully since 1987 and the ratification of the Single European Act is the status of the Community as an area of stability in a turbulent world.  The members of the Community have built up a solid network of links &mdash; economic, political and monetary &mdash; which bind them together in a unique fashion.  It has made the Community strong and given it resources to help not only the poorer parts of its member states but others in the developing world.  It has also enabled the creation of the necessary wealth and trading power to give it a <Col N="896" /> strong and effective role in world affairs. We cannot stop there.  We must press on and strengthen the Community.  The pace of change is gathering momentum and the decisions which must be taken to reinforce the Community's coherence and develop its internal and external strength are important for all of us.</P>
    <P>The two main fronts on which progress must be made are economic and monetary union and political union.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that the European Council in Strasbourg in December 1989 agreed to convene an Intergovernmental Conference on Economic and Monetary Union and that the European Councils in Dublin in the first half of this year set the timetable for the conference and the ratification of its results.  Further preparatory work has been done in the past months.  The European Council last weekend considered the state of the preparations. Eleven member states were able to agree that the work done to date constitutes the basis for the Intergovernmental Conference which will open in Rome on 14 December next. These states also agreed on the principal elements which should guide the work of the conference and these are set out in the Presidency's conclusions.  One member state &mdash; the United Kingdom &mdash; was unable to go along with the majority approach; the conclusions contain their separate views.</P>
    <P>For 11 member states there is now agreement on several key issues.  First, we agreed on the main aims of economic union including an open market system, price stability, growth, employment, sound financial and budgetary conditions, and greater economic and social cohesion.  Second, for the final phase of monetary union we agreed on the creation of a new monetary institution, comprising member states central banks and a new central organ, exercising full responsibility for monetary policy.  Third, we also agreed that with the final phase of EMU exchange rates will be irrevocably fixed.  The Community will have a single currency &mdash; a strong and stable ECU &mdash;<Col N="897" /> which will be the expression of its identity and unity.  Fourth, it is agreed that the second phase of EMU will begin in January 1994 after certain conditions have been fulfilled.  One of these conditions is real convergence between the economies of the member states.  Fifth, at the start of the second phase the new monetary institution will be established with certain interim tasks, and, finally, there is a procedure for preparing the move to the third and final phase of EMU.  Before this is done there must be a report to the European Council on the functioning of the second phase, and in particular the progress achieved on real convergence.</P>
    <P>Ireland's general attitude towards economic and monetary union has been one of strong support.  In giving that support, however, we give equal weight to the economic and monetary aspects of integration.  This parallelism is of crucial importance for us.  We are quite clear that it would not be in our national interest, or in the interest of the Community, if monetary union were to move at an accelerated pace, while the economic aspects of the design were left undeveloped.  Our support is also on the basis that integral to economic and monetary union will be a commitment to the implementation of effective Community policies aimed at achieving economic and social cohesion.</P>
    <P>Integration will bestow many benefits on the European Community by creating an environment conducive to growth and enhanced prosperity.  At the same time, we have to consider the possibility that closer integration could lead to a faster development of the central and more affluent areas thus widening the gap between them and the poorer and more peripheral regions.  I am concerned that this should not happen and we have argued this case strongly in the preparatory work on EMU.  I believe that the agreements we secured last weekend as a basis for the work of the Intergovernmental Conference will protect and promote Ireland's interests &mdash; indeed the Community's overall interest &mdash; in this respect.  Not only is economic and social cohesion agreed as one of the principal aims of EMU but there must be <Col N="898" /> further progress towards convergence in each of the phases.  In the detailed negotiations to come we will be seeking to ensure that the design of EMU takes these commitments fully into account.  In this connection, we welcome the ideas put forward by the Commission on a possible widening of Structural Funds eligibility and these ideas offer a useful avenue for exploration.  There is still a tendency, however, for many in the Community to consider that structural funding on its own will meet the objective of economic and social cohesion.  We have consistently emphasised that the Community must also look to a more effective implementation of common policies &mdash; State aids and transport, for example &mdash; in bringing about this vital objective.</P>
    <P>Another interesting pointer to the way in which a mutual support system could evolve in the context of EMU is the Commission's idea of a scheme of grants or loans to help member states overcome major economic problems.  While the details of this suggestion remain to be fleshed out, it should prove to be a useful part of the new system required to ensure the capacity of less-developed regions to continue on the journey to economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>I would like in particular to emphasise the wide measure of agreement which exists on certain key matters of principle in both the economic and monetary domains.  In the monetary area, there is almost unanimous agreement that there should be a common monetary policy under the control of an independent and federally-structured banking system which would have, as its overriding objective, the maintenance of price stability. A single currency is now also seen as an integral feature of the final stage of economic and monetary union.  Our experience within the European Monetary System suggests that we are well able to cope with the rigours involved in this approach, subject to appropriate measures to improve cohesion.  Indeed, the experiences gained by all members participating in the European Monetary System will be of great worth in ensuring that the degree of co-operation which is <Col N="899" /> necessary to bring this about will be readily forthcoming.</P>
    <P>To guarantee the success of economic and monetary union, correct economic policies will have to be implemented in tandem with monetary policy geared to price stability.  The framework for ensuring that is already in place with the agreement reached by Finance Ministers during our Presidency on mutual surveillance of economic policies.  Moreover, all member states are agreed that budgetary discipline is a key to the success of this process.  They are also agreed that certain broad principles, designed to bring this discipline about, should be incorporated in the amended Treaty.</P>
    <P>Given the degree of institutional change contemplated by the moves towards integration, it will be necessary to consider the issue of democratic control in some detail.  There are important issues here relating to the respective balances which should exist between the various institutions.  The role of the European Parliament, in particular, will require special attention.  The Conference on Political Union will, among other matters, be examining these issues and it is to that conference that I now turn my remarks.</P>
    <P>The resolve of the member states to press ahead with the further integration of the Community was evidenced by the decision at the European Council in Dublin on 25 and 26 June to convene a second Intergovernmental Conference on Political Union and to draw up the appropriate Treaty changes.  Since then Foreign Ministers have been preparing the work of the conference and the Commission have given their formal opinion on the proposal.  We had a full debate on this issue at last weekend's European Council.  Eleven member states were able to agree on the broad lines of their approach to the Intergovernmental Conference which will open on 14 December next.  The agreement amongst these 11 and the UK's position of reserve, are contained in the Presidency's Conclusions. Understandably, given that work did not commence until the spring <Col N="900" /> of this year, preparations for the IGC on political union are not as far advanced as those on EMU.  Foreign Ministers have been asked to continue their preparatory work up to mid-December under four broad headings: the overall objective and scope of political union; the democratic legitimacy of the union; the efficiency and effectiveness of the Community and its institutions; and the unity and coherence of the Community's international action.</P>
    <P>Our approach to the preparatory work in these four areas is shaped by a number of guiding principles.  Firstly, it has been a basic tenet of our policy towards the European Community that the development of political integration should be based on a growing community of interests in the economic and social field. Progress in the latter area, which from the beginning the Treaty of Rome saw as the means of eliminating the barriers dividing Europe, will shape the pace of developments in the former.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the Community has proved its political role as a unifying force in Europe, based on its democratic values, success in improving the living and working standards of its peoples, its commitment to international peace and prosperity and its openness to the rest of Europe and the wider world.  Nothing in the current exercise should diminish the constructive and flexible character of this role.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the two IGCs should mark a significant and coherent advance in the internal efficacy and deepening of the Community and the ability of the Community and its member states to work more closely and constructively with other countries of Europe and internationally.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, the development of the Treaty to cover new areas of policy must proceed on the basis of the existing obligation of the Community and the member states under the Treaty, to strengthen the Community's economic and social cohesion and, in particular, to reduce regional disparities and the problems of the least favoured regions.  With this goal in mind, it would be unreal to <Col N="901" /> consider extending the scope of Treaty competences without addressing the means, financial and otherwise, required to meet the new objectives and to implement new common policies.</P>
    <P>Two other issues can usefully be examined in the context of the scope of political union.  They are subsidiarity and the concept of Community citizenship.  Subsidiarity can be defined as the notion that the Community will only act to carry out tasks which can be undertaken more effectively by the member states acting in common than separately.  The question is an important one which is related both to the transfer of competence to the Community and to the exercise of competences which already exist.  Several of our partners wish to see the principle of subsidiarity anchored in the Treaty.  The question is how do we go about this? For example, do we seek to define what should be exclusively the competence of the union, and those which should be left to national administrations, or should be, on the other hand, list those which cannot be ceded to the Community?  Again, should we suggest areas which can evolve over time from the competence of member states to the Community?</P>
    <P>I would argue that in considering this issue we should be clear, firstly, about the legal implications of any definition and, secondly, that subsidiarity would not be used to limit the development of the Community.  This will require political agreement between the member states on the nature of the control of subsidiarity. Should this be of a legal nature with the involvement of the Court of Justice or a new Constitutional court as has been suggested?  There are good arguments in favour of a general reference in the Treaty with control being exercised at political level.  At a stage where the Community is in the process of evolving towards a fuller union, it would be more sensible perhaps to allow the designation of what should be the competence of the union and of the member states to be made at political level.</P>
    <P>As the Community evolves and develops it is only proper that greater consideration be given to the rights which <Col N="902" /> the citizens of the Community should enjoy.  As part of the programme to establish the Internal Market, decisions are being taken to allow people to move more freely between the member states, to take up residence and to obtain employment.  Attempts are also being made to reduce the bureaucratic barriers which confront the citizens of one member state when they move to another for employment or recreation.  It is vitally important that the interests of the people of Europe should not be ignored by over-concentrating on economic and monetary issues or when striving to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the institutions of the Community.</P>
    <P>I welcome, therefore, the proposal to see included in an amended Treaty the question of citizens' rights.  It is possible to imagine a legal definition of Community citizenship which would be made up of a series of rights, freedoms and obligations.  Those would, of course, flow from the competences conferred on the Community.  Basic special rights might cover the right of Community citizens to full freedom of movement, the freedom to choose one's place of residence and the right to political participation at the place of residence.</P>
    <P>Additional rights would result from new policies.  The extension to citizens of other member states of the right to vote in local and national elections in their country of residence and the establishment of a common procedure for elections to the European Parliament are areas which could also be examined. Ireland has already an advanced profile in relation to the right to vote in elections by nationals from other member states.</P>
    <P>Other ideas have been put forward to help establish the concept of Community citizenship.  One is to create a Community Ombudsman who would help to safeguard the rights of Community citizens in areas where legal redress through the court might be difficult or simply not available.  A second idea, which can draw on experience from the Gulf crisis, is that Community citizens, irrespective of the member state of which they are nationals, should have the right, when outside the <Col N="903" /> Community, to avail of the protection of the diplomatic missions of any member state.  Ireland would be willing to study positively both these ideas.</P>
    <P>In general, we should support an evolution of the concept of Community citizenship but ensure that from the outset a framework is established which will allow for practical measures to be adopted.  It will be important to take into account rights already provided for in Community legislation and give a new impulse for others in the domain of a people's Europe.</P>
    <P>At a time in the history of the European continent when barriers whether physical or ideological, are disappearing we must find ways of demonstrating to our citizens that they belong to a single geographical and cultural entity.  By quickening the pace at which we remove internal frontiers and consolidating the concept of Community citizenship, we will be making significant progress.</P>
    <P>Just as, in 1985, the intergovernmental conference from which came the Single European Act agreed to broaden the scope of the Treaty by bringing in new areas of competence, so too the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference on Political Union will examine ways of broadening the scope of the Community by giving it new competences.  This can be examined under three headings: first, areas which are covered by existing Treaty articles such as those relating to certain aspects of social policy, environment, research and technology and vocational training where decisions are currently taken by unanimity; second, areas which are not specifically mentioned in the Treaty such as health, civil defence, culture, education, consumer protection, energy policy, telecommunications and development co-operation; and third, areas dealt with at intergovernmental level outside the Treaty framework such as immigration, drugs, police and judicial co-operation could be codified in the Treaty establishing political union.  An issue for consideration in this context is whether the decision making procedure applicable in <Col N="904" /> these areas would be the classic Community procedure or, drawing on the experience of the procedure for European Political Co-operation under Title III of the Single European Act, an altogether special arrangement.</P>
    <P>The implications for Ireland of any proposed changes under any of these three headings must of course be examined carefully.  We would need to measure the advantages and disadvantages in any change to the voting procedure, especially were there to be a move away from unanimity or where areas of a particularly sensitive nature, presently dealt with at intergovernmental level, were to be brought within the Treaty framework. However, we cannot lose sight of the very real implications for this whole exercise which would result from a cautious or indeed negative attitude on the part of member states to a broadening of the scope of the Treaty.  On the other hand, if all the areas I outlined earlier were to be included, we might run the risk of overburdening the institutions of the Community, slowing down the decision making process and allowing the Community to develop in an unbalanced manner.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the NESC report on Ireland in the European Community are relevant in this regard and Deputies will recall the argument put forward in that report that an advanced economic and monetary union with the Community involved in a wide range of policy functions would benefit the Community as a whole as well as the less developed regions.  Furthermore, such involvement is necessary to achieve genuine integration of the Community.</P>
    <P>It is not yet possible to say how much the scope of the Treaty will be broadened in the course of the current exercise. However, if we are to attain a level of European integration envisaged in the NESC report which can include appropriate mechanisms for genuine regional coherence and convergence, we should favour a wide rather than a narrower transfer of competence.  Amendments to the Treaty should be framed in such a <Col N="905" /> way as to further this objective and not to hinder it.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed by the European Parliament and by a number of member states that unless the democratic legitimacy of the Community is strengthened as part of the present Treaty reform process the basic principles of democratic accountability could be undermined.  At the same time national parliaments have expressed disquiet at the gradual erosion of their own powers following the adoption of the Single European Act.</P>
    <P>The European Parliament believes that a significant increase in its powers is necessary as a result of the moves towards greater political union.  Among questions posed here are the right of Parliament to co-decision with the Council of Ministers within the legislative and constitutional area, and Parliament's involvement in the nomination of the President and members of the Commission.</P>
    <P>In the Single European Act, Parliament was given significant new powers under the co-operation procedure and it has used these powers constructively.  We are prepared to examine in a positive spirit all practical suggestions aimed at developing the role of the European Parliament in the legislative process of the Community.</P>
    <P>It would certainly be difficult to consider changes of a far-reaching character to the Treaties without ensuring that the participation of Parliament is also considered. Not to do this could diminish the credibility of the Parliament in the eyes of the electorate.  It must, however, be stressed that a serious concern for us will be to ensure that the efficiency of the decision making process is not impaired &mdash; indeed it must be improved &mdash; and that any additional powers accorded to Parliament should not result in delays in the processing of Community legislation. Furthermore changes arising from the intergovernmental conference in the role and functioning of the institutions should not alter the existing institutional balance.</P>
    <P>As a directly elected body, the European Parliament has a special role to play in ensuring that the Community is <Col N="906" /> grounded in the principles of democratic accountability, but other institutions also have a part to play in this respect.  We should not lose sight of the fact that the European Council and the Council of Ministers are fully representative of the peoples of the Community.  The representatives of the member states in these Councils are answerable to their own parliaments and through these to their peoples &mdash; as, for example, I am answering to you today for last weekend's European Council.</P>
    <P>As the process of Community integration develops and with the prospect of further competences being transferred to the Union, concern has been expressed about the role of national parliaments. These concerns and the whole question of the role of the national parliaments in the future work of the Community will be debated at the proposed European Congress of National Parliaments and the European Parliament to be held in Rome from 27-30 November.  The preparatory work for this congress began at a meeting in May of representatives of national parliaments and the European Parliament which took place in Cork and was followed by two further meetings in Brussels and Rome.  The Oireachtas was represented by Members of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.  I have no doubt that the congress will be an important opportunity for national parliaments to put forward their own views on how they would wish to be more closely involved in future Community activities. I look forward to the outcome of the congress which I am confident will inform the work of the intergovernmental conference.</P>
    <P>The Intergovernmental Conference on Political Union will provide an opportunity to examine and improve the response of the Community and its institutions to the major policy developments since the ratification of the Single European Act.  Any necessary changes in the light of the additional competences and policies which the Community will acquire under the present Treaty amendments can also be made.  Here, too, <Col N="907" /> changes in the role of the institutions should in no sense be allowed to disturb the balance between them.</P>
    <P>The European Council has played a central role in the development of the Community over the past five years. During our Presidency I felt it necessary to call an exceptional meeting of the European Council to allow for joint consideration at the highest political level of the dramatic pace of events in Eastern Europe and especially the rapid progress towards German unity.</P>
    <P>When I wrote to my fellow Heads of Government in February inviting them to Dublin, I stressed the importance I attached for the Twelve to bring their collective voice to bear on the issues arising, to consider the steps to be taken to develop the Community's own integration process and to examine the demands that were likely to be made on the community in the new European.  It is this broad political role to which the European Council is particularly suited. It can give a general political direction or impulse, act as arbitrator and, on occasions, decision maker on areas affecting the future of the Community. During our Presidency I became increasingly convinced of these crucial functions which the European Council must exercise in the construction of Europe.  In my view the Council should retain the flexibility which has helped it fulfil this role.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind the need that has been felt in recent years to hold more than the scheduled two meetings per year, we might support any proposal to increase the frequency of meetings of the European Council.  As the need for greater unity and coherence of the Community's international action develops, the President of the European Council could become the interlocutor for the union at the highest level.  We would be prepared to examine any proposals which might be made about the manner in which it carries out its tasks but our experience would suggest that the value of the European Council might be diminished were its <Col N="908" /> nature and structure to be changed significantly.</P>
    <P>There is also a general acceptance that in future the role of the General Affairs Council and EPC Ministerial Meeting should be unified.  During our Presidency earlier this year we initiated the procedure whereby Ministers discussed the political as well as the economic aspects of issues without having to change the format of the meeting, as had been so often the case in the past.  We found that in working in this manner we were able to improve significantly the co-ordination between the positions adopted in the economic sphere and those adopted in political co-operation.  It seems to me sensible that this practice should be continued and formalised.  The overall objective should be to ensure the most efficient and rational management of the work of the Community.</P>
    <P>The role of the Commission, which is the guardian of the treaties, is central to the proper functioning of the Community. As the initiator of legislation, it must be endowed with the necessary authority and powers to ensure that the interests of all the member states are fully taken into account in the framing of legislation.  It must also be given the necessary powers to implement decisions taken by the Council.  Under the Single European Act new powers were conferred on the Commission and experience has shown that on balance these have worked well.  We can, of course, look at any improvements which might improve the operation of these new procedures.</P>
    <P>The number of Commissioners is an issue which from time to time has been considered by the member states, particularly during the negotiations on the Single European Act and on the accession of Spain and Portugal.  It has been argued that a Commission with fewer members would ensure better co-ordination, would enable matters to be more thoroughly discussed and facilitate clear conclusions, constitute a genuine team and allow its members to have a better personal knowledge of each other, thus creating a better collegiate spirit, <Col N="909" /> and establish portfolios of genuine content and equal weight.</P>
    <P>I see no reason we could not indicate support &mdash; we did so in the past &mdash; for a reduction in the number of the Commissioners, provided there is no attempt by the larger member states to monopolize the more important portfolios and provided that there is one Commissioner from each member state.</P>
    <P>The June European Council decided that the Intergovernmental Conference on Political Union should &ldquo;define the necessary framework for transforming relations as a whole among the member states into a European Union vested with the necessary means of action&rdquo;.  One of the areas to be considered in this context is the unity and coherence of the Community's international action &mdash; that is, how the policies of the Community <i>vis-à-vis</i> the outside world can be expressed more coherently and implemented more effectively.  At its meeting on 28 April last, the European Council agreed that the Community would act as a political entity on the international scene.  It is in this framework that the intergovernmental conference will examine proposals that the Community should adopt a common foreign and security policy.</P>
    <P>It is clear that fundamental changes have taken place recently in Europe with the end of the Cold War.  The situation in Central and Eastern Europe has changed with the diminution of the role of the Warsaw Pact and the restoration of democracy in most of these countries. The security picture of Europe as a whole has changed dramatically.  These changes are continuing.  At the same time negotiations between the alliances and between the super powers are bringing about reductions in military forces.  The level of tension and threat in Europe continues to diminish and the alliances on both sides are facing fundamental questions about their role in this new situation.  Security and defence doctrines based on what might be called East-West thinking are undergoing fundamental reassessment.</P>
    <P>The United Nations is playing an <Col N="910" /> increasingly important role in the current difficult international situation, and one which is closer to that envisaged for it in the Charter, of an international body with genuine responsibility for international peace and security.  This is a development we welcome.</P>
    <P>The CSCE process has played a vital role in the positive developments in Europe of which I spoke, in providing an overall framework within which movement towards a new concept of European security has been possible.  We believe that it has the potential to contribute further and are in favour of building it up by providing it with institutions and giving it a role in areas such as conflict prevention and verifying military and security commitments, as well as providing a forum for disarmament negotiations among the 34 member states.</P>
    <P>We are looking, therefore, at a situation in which the parameters of the debate on foreign policy and on security are very different from what they were four or five years ago.  These are the parameters within which we, along with our partners, must look at our approach in the areas of foreign policy and security policy.</P>
    <P>At the Rome Council 11 member states, including Ireland, were able to agree that these major developments on our continent required us to get the objective of a common foreign and security policy in order to strengthen the identity of the Community and the coherence of its action on the international scene. We agreed that this action will be open to the world and will give a significant role to development policy.  We also agreed that the Community will strengthen its links with other European countries and that for this purpose closer co-operation structures will be sought.</P>
    <P>The Presidency's Conclusions make it clear that while there is agreement on the overall objectives the content and detailed rules of the role of the Community in relation to a common foreign and security policy have yet to be defined. Furthermore they are to be defined gradually and without prejudice to the obligations arising out of the present <Col N="911" /> security arrangements to which member states are party.</P>
    <P>Here I should say that the position I have put forward already on this issue, and which reflects the position of successive Irish Governments, is that if the Community were at some stage to embark on arrangements for its own security and with its own security concept, then Ireland as a fully committed member state would be willing to consider participation.  The creation of the Internal Market and of an economic and monetary union, the development of the concept of Community citizenship, the increase in the scope and responsibilities of the Community will create a powerful bond between the member states and solidarity between their peoples.  It will give rise to an area, a territorial unit, with the closest political, economic and social ties.  The question, therefore, is whether there is now emerging a common security interest specific to the Twelve and whether, in accordance with the commitments of successive Governments to which I have just referred, this country would be willing to work with partners towards a structure which would give that interest expression.</P>
    <P>As yet member states have not put forward specific proposals or defined what is meant by security or what the limits of the concept might be.  In so far as the concept has been talked about it has given rise to a fairly wide range of differing views.  Some member states suggest &mdash; and I agree with them &mdash; that there is a distinction between the concepts of security and defence.  The Single Act refers to the political and economic aspects of security.  There are two dimensions. There are others apart from the military aspect.  For instance, security can cover the defence of the Community and its citizens from international terrorism.</P>
    <P>It could have a disarmament dimension. The Community could be seen to be providing its own security by taking a positive attitude and playing an active united role on issues of international disarmament. There are other aspects.  One thing is clear to me.  A common security <Col N="912" /> policy in the Community is not likely to include the defence or military aspects for some time to come.  Why do I say that?  I say so because a number of the member states who are most concerned about these matters are adamant that European defence and military matters are for NATO and NATO alone.  Others see the WEU as the right vehicle for these matters.</P>
    <P>We are now at a stage of pre-negotiation. The negotiating phase will begin with the IGC.  Among the questions it will discuss will be what areas a common foreign and security policy could cover, how such a policy could be introduced in terms of the Treaties, in the light of existing obligations of other member states, how decisions should be taken and what institutional and structural changes should be made to enable a new policy to be implemented coherently and effectively. We will be putting our views forward in these negotiations and we expect our partners will be doing likewise.</P>
    <P>We will look very carefully at the role of the European Council in this area.  We will wish to ensure that the new Treaty to be negotiated sets out clearly the limits of partners' commitments in this sensitive field and that these are not decided in any <i>ad hoc</i> manner.  In any case, we would find it difficult to envisage that decision making at any level in an area such as this, being brought for the first time within the competence of Community machinery, should be otherwise than by consensus.</P>
    <P>I have thought it right to describe to the Dáil the major issues likely to arise at the two intergovernmental conferences. In some cases &mdash; such as economic and monetary union &mdash; the issues are now relatively clear and I have given you the main lines of Ireland's position as we enter into the negotiations.  Others &mdash; such as a common foreign and security policy &mdash; are less well defined and will require a great deal more preparation.  In these cases I have sought to bring out the key points at this stage and to outline our overall approval.  The negotiations opening in December will be crucial for the Community, setting its course for the foreseeable future.  They will be crucial <Col N="913" /> also for Ireland whose destiny is now irrevocably linked to that of its partners in the process of European integration.</P>
    <P>The discussions on economic and monetary union and on political union naturally occupied a great deal of the attention of Heads of State and Government at the Rome meeting, but we dealt also with a range of other matters of great current importance in international relations.</P>
    <P>The European Council heard a preliminary report from the Commission following its talks with the Soviet Government &mdash; pursuant to its mandate from the European Council in Dublin in June &mdash; to prepare proposals for Community assistance.  The Council expressed the willingness of the Community to contribute to the success of the reforms recently adopted by the Soviet Government and asked the Commission to submit its proposals before the next meeting of the European Council in December.  If, in the meantime, emergency action is required the Council will take whatever decisions are necessary on the basis of proposals from the Commission. The European Council also asked the Commission to put forward proposals for a major commercial, scientific and technical co-operation agreement with the Soviet Union.</P>
    <P>In relation to Eastern Europe, the European Council took stock of the progress made in the programmes of financial and technical assistance and in the Community's discussions on association agreements with the countries of the region.  Noting that these countries are experiencing additional adjustment difficulties because of the international situation, the European Council agreed that the Community has a duty to help consolidate and develop the reform process notably by playing its part in the stabilisation of their financial situation. Particular attention is paid to the situations in Yugoslavia and Hungary.</P>

      <P>I will not be much longer, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>
      <P>Heads of State and Government also considered developments in the current round of GATT negotiations.  We confirmed the Community's commitment to making a full contribution to the round in the interest of strengthening free trade and fostering worldwide prosperity.  In this connection the European Council called on the Community's international negotiating partners to make efforts towards a successful conclusion.  In regard to the Community's offer on agriculture, the European Council requested the Council of Ministers to adopt an agreement enabling the offer to be submitted. So far as Ireland is concerned, member states are now clear at the highest level about our position and I am confident that our interest will be fully taken into account in the forthcoming discussions in the Agriculture Council.</P>
      <P>Under the foreign policy heading, the Heads of State and Government condemned the Iraqi practice of holding foreign nationals as hostages and affirmed their determination not to enter into the Iraqi logic of dividing the international community on this issue, not to send official representatives to negotiate with Iraq on it and to discourage others from doing so.  They suggest their concern at the persistent Iraqi violation of international legality, in particular the prolonged and destructive occupation of Kuwait.  The European Council also set out the Twelve's position of principle on the Arab-Israeli conflict in the Middle East and the situation in the Lebanon. The Council welcomed the normalisation of relations between the Community and its member states and the Islamic Republic of Iran.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the eve of the Paris Summit on the CSCE, the European Council reaffirmed the essential role of that process and expressed the determination of the Community and its member states to subscribe to all the commitments in the document to be signed by them at the summit. <Col N="915" /> The Dáil will see that the European Council in Rome dealt with questions of great significance for the future of the Community and with important issues in the current international situation. Decisions were taken and guidelines given which represent significant progress in the affairs of the Community on a basis that ensures the protection and advancement of Irish areas and interest.  I would like to pay tribute to the courtesy and efficiency with which the Council was run by Prime Minister Andreotti and the Italian Presidency aided by the Council Secretariat and the Commission.  A number of the themes we addressed will be taken up when Heads of State and Government meet in Rome in December. I will report again at that stage to the House on progress achieved and on Ireland's contribution.</P>
    <P>I hope I have been of help to the House in offering these views and comments.  I will genuinely welcome contributions by Deputies on these matters.  In some areas I have given a fairly clear indication of policy.  In others I have just outlined the issues that re-arise and, particularly on those issues, I will warmly welcome the views of the parties in the House.</P>
    <P>Also may I wish the Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs, chaired by Deputy Peter Barry, success in the work they have to do on behalf of this Parliament in this area and at their forthcoming conference.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>When I wrote to the Taoiseach and the leaders of other parties suggesting that we have a debate in this House on the future of Europe, this was agreed to by the Taoiseach and other members to whom I am grateful. However, it is not taking the form or duration I would have wished.  Rather it has become more a report by the Taoiseach on the Heads of State meeting in Rome last weekend, which is useful and takes place twice annually here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now at a crucial point in the development of the European Community. It is essential that this House and the committee of which I am chairman be <Col N="916" /> given an opportunity to debate in detail what route the Government think we should be taking and what proposal we should be advancing for the developed European Community both from the monetary and political points of view in the future.  The decisions that will be taken as a result of the intergovernmental conference &mdash; whose meetings will probably stretch into next year &mdash; will affect this country for perhaps a century to come, or even longer.  Therefore, we would want an opportunity to hear the Government's views.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said a few seconds ago that he has put forward some firm views &mdash; I dispute that &mdash; and indicated a number of problems that might arise.  I think it quite fair for this House to ask the Government to put before it a White Paper underlining what they see as a solution to the problems this country will face in bringing about an integrated Europe in the future.  Last weekend's meeting of European Heads of Government in Rome underlines once again the need for a comprehensive reappraisal of our foreign policy and a clear statement of our priorities and polices for the next phase of a developed EC.  That can come only from the Government.  They are the only people who have the machinery and the staff to undertake a detailed analysis and present to this House the various options under different headings and their preferred option as far as the future of European development is concerned.</P>
    <P>We have to have that debate on the basis of a paper before the Intergovernmental Conference starts in the middle of December.  I presume the Government intend to put a paper before that conference and will not just be reacting to papers that are now being prepared in other capitals and will be the basis of a discussion at those conferences.  The Government have an obligation to prepare such paper and we have the right, and I would say the obligation, to debate it in this House.</P>
    <P>Rapid and profound changes are taking place both within the EC and in the broader European framework.  We need to clarify what greater political unity will <Col N="917" /> mean and we must do so in the context of a whole range of changing circumstances and relationships.  The EC is facing two very different and major challenges.  The first is to draw up the blueprint for European monetary union and to refashion European institutions to facilitate greater political unity.  The second is to work out a strategy for the wider association of European countries.  In this regard the Community would have to assess critically the best method of helping the Central European and Eastern European countries to achieve the start of a stable, prosperous, liberal-democratic state while also recognising the changing needs of the 12 member states within the EC.</P>
    <P>German unification will have a dramatic effect on the future policies of the EC.  The Taoiseach may recall that I have been pointing out here for the last 12 months that the unification of Germany was in effect an enlargement of the Community because it brought in what was in essence a 13th member state, a state the size of Ireland and Denmark put together.  The Taoiseach dismissed my concern in that regard and said there was no country in Europe better equipped to do this and it would have absolutely no effect, and he had been given this assurance by Chancellor Kohl on Ireland and on the Community as a whole.  I am sorry to have to say that I think my assessment of that position earlier this year was more correct than the Taoiseach's.  It is quite obvious that the unification of Germany is going to have quite a serious effect on the EC and we should have been preparing for that and not dismissing it as something that would not have the dramatic impact I thought it would have &mdash; and is having &mdash; on the Community.</P>
    <P>We in Ireland must be clear about our role in the process of changing developments and we must be clear about the demands these changes will have on our society and our political institutions. Many political commentators have written about the scale of the challenge facing the emerging democratic states in Central and Eastern Europe.  Although the countries of the EC face a very different <Col N="918" /> challenge, the new relationships and circumstances developing within the Community have a potential impact that I believe is equally profound.  We will have to adapt to a different set of political relationships both within the EC and in the broader European framework.  The fact that we have a centralised Government system and very poorly developed local and regional structures will have negative consequences for the democratic participation and for the notion of democratic accountability.  In many ways we are very badly equipped for the closer integration of the EC.</P>
    <P>In his speech this morning the Taoiseach referred at some length to the principle of subsidiarity.  It is a principle to which I subscribe, but the most efficient form of democratic government is that the centre would do only the tasks the local communities are unable to undertake themselves.  We have to recognise that, even though we support the principle of subsidiarity in Europe, we do not support the practice of subsidiarity in Ireland.  One of the problems we have to address here is that we have to break this country down into regions that genuinely have power to do things for themselves. That will strengthen the democratic process much more, because of all the countries of Europe we have probably the most centralised system of government.</P>
    <P>The evolution of a Community that is more economically and politically unified will present a real challenge to our political institutions as they exist.  As I said, Oireachtas Éireann is probably the most under-developed legislative assembly in the whole of the EC.  We lack an Oireachtas committee on foreign affairs &mdash; to which I have been referring, and the normal response to that is to ask why we did not do it when we were in Government.  Since the Single European Act came into force in 1987 we have had to play a much greater role in political co-operation in the EC.  The necessity for the accountability of that role back here at home has been very much more stark. For that reason a foreign affairs committee should be established here as quickly as possible because the lack of <Col N="919" /> such a committee compounds the kind of over-centralisation in Government powers I talked about earlier.</P>
    <P>A committee on foreign affairs consisting of representatives of all parties in both Houses of the Oireachtas could play a crucial and very constructive role in identifying and assessing the political priorities in a rapidly changing international situation.  Let me say, not in a carping fashion &mdash; though I suppose it is in a carping fashion &mdash; that I have written to the Taoiseach on three occasions in the last 12 months suggesting a formula for the establishment of an Oireachtas committee on foreign affairs.  I am sorry to have to say I did not get a reply. He might look into that.  I suggested a formula.  He may remember we had a debate here in this House last March on a committee of foreign affairs which was defeated by the Government votes.  At the end of that debate I suggested to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that those interested spokespersons from the various parties could sit down in a non-contentious way and draw up terms of reference.  That was not the only thing, of course.  The Government's principal worry was that we draw up terms of reference that would be acceptable to the Government and which could from the basis for a committee on foreign affairs. I followed up that letter by writing to the Taoiseach in the following month &mdash; I cannot remember the exact date &mdash; and I have sent two reminders since then, so he might look into this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for that, but on this aspect of European affairs I am always puzzled that the committee the Deputy chairs cannot be seen as the necessary committee vehicle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another point and I will be glad to discuss that with the Taoiseach, but the terms of reference of the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities need to be changed to allow us to do that.  They would not allow us to discuss foreign policy, for instance, and <Col N="920" /> not necessarily forthcoming events.  Of course, I cannot speak for other parties but if that was sufficiently broadened I would be happy to take that on.  I would put forward my proposals in that regard to the Taoiseach and I hope he will examine them fairly sympathetically.  My colleagues on the committee and I will have to discuss that first.</P>
      <P>Some work is being done on the future role of the 12 national parliaments and their relationship with the European Parliament. With more power concentrated in European institutions it is important that national and regional institutions maintain some power and decision-making ability.</P>
      <P>I have mentioned democratic accountability. Among the greatest challenges facing member states will be to preserve and maintain this notion in a more integrated Community.  Let me say in that regard that, if the role of the committee which I chair can be expanded, I do not think it is necessarily the committee's job to put forward views.  Of course it is their job to put forward their set of views, but the Government must also have a role in this.  This is a committee that is not properly funded or staffed.  If we want European and foreign affairs debated in a serious manner on that committee we must have the staff and funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Assises which the Taoiseach referred to earlier, which come from a suggestion by President Mitterrand, in regard to the protection of the national parliaments is a very important part of the future development of Europe.  The national parliament's role, and importance, must be underlined and accepted. President Mitterrand suggested that a debate should be undertaken by all the parliaments in Europe and the European Parliament, and that the Assises would be made up of special committees of European affairs of the 12 national parliaments. The 12 national parliaments have been consulting with each other, and with the institutional committee of the European Parliament, and these discussions centre around the organisation of what is called the future relations of the double legitimacy of the European <Col N="921" /> Parliament on the one hand and the national parliaments on the other hand. Our Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities are participating in this work but are seriously underfunded.  Much more research needs to be done and we need to have the proper staff and the proper funding even to undertake the work which must be done between now and the next meeting at the end of November. We need extra staff and funding to be able to properly prepare and represent this Parliament because that is what we will be representing.  We will not just be representing the committee but this Parliament at those Assises.  We, therefore, need to be properly funded.</P>
    <P>The role of the national parliaments, and their relationship with the European Parliament is crucial for future development. We must work out clearly what the relationship should be and set out our policy in this regard.  The Government have so far given no indication of their interest or concern in this area.  As I indicated earlier, I am glad to get an indication from the Taoiseach that he will look into the matter.</P>
    <P>I believe that their preparations for the meeting of the intergovernmental conference in Rome must contain a comprehensive policy statement on the role of national parliaments and their relationship with the European Parliament as well as on the whole area of political union.  This should all be written down on paper so that we can discuss it either here or in the committee.</P>
    <P>The centrepiece of Irish foreign policy over the years has been our neutrality. The substance of that policy is that while we whole-heartedly belong to the group of Western Liberal Democratic States, we believe that military conflict is an unacceptable way to solve international disputes or disagreements.  Both the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach have mentioned the question of participation in a security arrangement in a more integrated European Community.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, neither the Minister or the Taoiseach have spelt out exactly what <Col N="922" /> this security arrangement might entail or initiated a national debate on foreign policy in general and on neutrality in particular.  A national debate on this topic is vital if our foreign policy is to continue to have a broad-based support.  A policy best serves a society if it is widely understood and supported.  The place to start that debate is here, but there are other fora also.</P>
    <P>The Government have had numerous opportunities to discuss neutrality and the implications for Ireland of a common security policy.  They have not done so. As usual, they have walked away from a debate they thought might be difficult or contentious.  I want to draw attention to comments by the Taoiseach which I think should be enlarged upon.  It is because Fianna Fáil have failed to change and develop in the last ten years that that party have held back the political development of our people and of our political institutions.  The Taoiseach today referred to the policy of successive Irish Governments but it has not been the policy of all political parties at all times.  It is the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party when they are in Government but it is not the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party when they are in Opposition.  It is that kind of inconsistency that leads to confusion in people's minds as to what neutrality means and what security means.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me intervene very briefly, and in the best good manners, I hope.  This debate would be much more helpful if the Deputy would give me his own views on these matters.

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it was not.  There were two comments on the security area that <Col N="923" /> need explanation from the Government. The first is the reference that &ldquo;at the Rome Council, 11 member states&rdquo; and so on.  This is something members of the Community should pay attention to. There were about three references in the Taoiseach's speech this morning to 11 member states.  I know, of course, that the United Kindgdom is the odd man out there.  I am not sure what the solution to it is, but we cannot advance European integration unless there is a change of attitude in Britain about Europe.  That is a matter that should not alone be discussed by the 11 member states, but by the Twelve also.</P>
      <P>An integrated Europe without the UK would not be real.  Therefore, we must find a way to have a more constructive role in the European Community for the United Kingdom.  I had not appreciated, until I read what the Taoiseach said this morning, how many decisions they step-aside from and leave to the other 11 member states.  A two-speed group is not something that anybody wants to see developing.  The problem must be assessed.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach said:</P>
      <P>At the Rome Council 11 member states, including Ireland, were able to agree that these major developments on our continent required us to set the objective of a common foreign and security policy in order to strengthen the identity of the Community and the coherence of its action on the international scene.  We agreed that this action will be open to the world and will give a significant role to development policy.</P>
      <P>Frankly I do not know what that means. I cannot understand it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="The Taoiseach Charles J. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not clear to me.  I hope it is clear to the other 11 member states. I hope the Minister, who, I presume, will speak later in the day, will spell that out for us.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Barry will forgive me, unfortunately I must leave, but I will read what the Deputy says.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Taoiseach has the time.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach also said: &ldquo;A common security policy in the Community is not likely to include the defence or military aspects for some time to come&rdquo;.  That is an ominous phrase, something I am anxious to draw attention to.  It should be debated in the House at some future time because I do not think it is possible to put a foot on this road of a common security and defence policy without realising where that road may lead to.  In the hypothetical situation of, say, Turkey attacking Greece or Norway attacking Denmark, would we be obliged to send troops to defend Greece or Denmark? The use of the phrase, &ldquo;for some time to come&rdquo;, implies that that time will come and we should be quite clear at this stage of where it may lead.  I have views on this.  When the Government explain what their views are I will have something to say about that, but at the moment we cannot leave it as vague as the Taoiseach left it this morning.  We must have a mature, an informed and, above all, a balanced debate on the question of a common European security policy and the effects of such a policy on Irish neutrality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggested previously, and I hope someone listened to me, that when you and I, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, were members of the New Ireland Forum we were successful in changing public attitudes here about the North.  It was the most successful undertaking in that regard with national opinion sitting down and producing a document, which has been a reference point since, on the views on Northern Ireland.  I hope we will have something similar, and that we can discuss neutrality and a common defence policy in Europe where people other than politicians could contribute to the debate. A process similar to the New Ireland Forum might best serve the interests of <Col N="925" /> democracy and accountability but regrettably the Government have resolutely refused to initiate this or any similar process. They have continually failed to spell out what they consider a common European security policy would entail.  They must do so before the intergovernmental conference in December.</P>
    <P>The Government continue to display a lack of any sense of urgency about the forthcoming intergovernmental conference and do not seem to realise that decisions will be taken which will affect our economic, political and social development into the next century.  Our success, perhaps even our survival, will depend on how we cope with the changing developments in the European Community. We must not go to the intergovernmental conference merely to react to the proposals of others.  Other governments and countries are preparing cases which will be the basis for discussion and we must go to the conference with a clear set of proposals and priorities of our own so that we are not just tagging along.</P>
    <P>The question of the role of the European institutions also demands reflection and analysis by the Government and the Oireachtas and while the move towards the single market continues, questions arise as to the shape of the political institutions necessary to facilitate European integration, for instance, what role the Council of Ministers will play.  If the decision making process is dominated by the Council of Ministers, the role of the Opposition parties in the member states will be weakened and the possibility of Opposition parties contributing to policy making will be effectively ended.  The impact on national policy will be devastating and in the end the notion of a European Community will come into disrepute.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said that he is accounting to the House for what happened at the intergovernmental conference.  Ministers go to the European Council meetings and take decisions there and they are only made accountable to this House when the Taoiseach reports back to the House or when we have infrequent debates on foreign and European affairs.  When we <Col N="926" /> originally joined the Community an undertaking was given that a six months review would be prepared and debated in the House.  It is some years since we had such a debate.  I understand the pressures on Departments, particularly in times of cutbacks to produce such debates and I understand the pressures on Ministers especially nowadays when they spend so much of their time away on European business.  However, other ways must be found to deal with the issue. The Minister for Foreign Affairs as our representative on the Council of Ministers must be accountable to the House.</P>
    <P>I said before that I thought most Members would be willing to come back one Friday or Monday a month to debate European affairs but it would have to be on the basis of a paper prepared and distributed beforehand and not on a script issued that morning by the Minister. In that way adequate time could be given particularly to the Committee on Secondary Legislation to discuss the paper.  As a result a more constructive fact finding debate could take place in the House rather than a kind of political confrontational debate.  It is not a Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil position, even though we might have different opinions on the road forward, but an Irish position that needs to be put clearly to Europe.</P>
    <P>The case has been made for expanding the role of the European Parliament.  The Taoiseach appeared to be against that this morning.  The Parliament is the only directly elected European institution and therefore it fulfils the prerequisite of democratic accountability as well as maintaining a direct link with the people. How can the role of the Parliament be expanded and strengthened?  The Taoiseach appears to have reservations about expanding the role of the Parliament, and perhaps he will have an opportunity later to tell us why and let us know what role the Parliament should play.  We are trying to get the Government's views on many areas so that we can debate them.</P>
    <P>The role of the Commission must also be examined.  What should be the role of the Commission in a more integrated and <Col N="927" /> perhaps eventually enlarged Community? How do we tackle what the President of the Commission has called the democratic deficit at the heart of Europe? The Taoiseach has given an indication of the Government's thinking here and I agree with it.  He said there is a strong case to be made for a smaller Commission. I agree with that &mdash; and when I am in agreement with him I will say so &mdash; however, that is, provided it is not at the expense of the rotation of smaller member state's seats in that Commission. Every country should be represented, but perhaps the two seats for some countries should be done away with.  That is one point he put forward which is an Irish viewpoint.  Perhaps there are other points I would agree with if only they were put forward.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that in the past the Commission played a very strong role in the development of the Community.  It set the agenda and forced the pace of change and reform.  As the Community becomes more integrated politically. There is a danger that the Commission will become a source of power that dominates the Community institutions.  There are indications that that is happening but I must balance that remark by saying that the Commission has been an extremely good friend to this country over the 18 years we have been members.</P>
    <P>There is a further difficulty with the role of the Commission as the Community expands.  If it becomes too large and unwieldy it could become an ineffective and inefficient decision making body.  The task for the member states is to identify a role for the institutions of the Community that balances decision making power with responsibility and accountability.  I recognise that is far easier said than done but the Government must be very clear about our position in that regard.</P>
    <P>The future of a unified Germany lies within the European Community, but how will the Community deal with applications for membership from Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and, perhaps, other emerging democracies in <Col N="928" /> Central and Eastern Europe?  The question of whether the European Community should aim for deeper or broader development is the issue here.  I come down in favour of the former.</P>
    <P>Those who favour deeper development maintain that a strong unified European Community can act as a stabilising factor in the future of Europe.  This argument further maintains that the Community will have to deal with quite a large degree of change in the next few years and that it would be unwise for it to expand too soon.  The impact of German unification is only beginning to be assessed and it will undoubtedly result in policy changes within the European Community.</P>
    <P>The argument for a broader European Community suggests that being members or even associated members of the European Community will help the Central and Eastern European countries to make the transition from centralised economies to social market economies in the liberal democratic model.  I am inclined to favour the deeper rather than the broader development at this time.  A too rapid expansion could destablilise the Community and exacerbate existing difficulties and challenges.  In the short term, I do not think that Central and Eastern European countries would benefit from membership and association. The pressure that membership would exert on their economic and political systems might prove to be detrimental to their political development.  The emerging democracies of Central and Eastern Europe need time to develop their own system and they also need time to identify their own political priorities and aspirations. If the European Community is to progress and develop, the effectiveness of its decision making process must be strengthened.</P>
    <P>Last weekend's summit in Rome was inconclusive and a number of urgent issues, including the GATT talks, remain to be resolved.  The Community seems unsure of its stance and its strategy with regard to the talks.  The completion of the Uruguay Round of GATT talks is crucial to agriculture and to all aspects of world trade.  It is essential that the <Col N="929" /> Community adopt a clear negotiating position and that talks proceed on that basis.  The future success of the Community may depend on the capacity of the Council of Ministers to make decisions and carry them through.</P>
    <P>One of the central issues in a more integrated and unified European Community will be the question of security arrangements.  For many of our European colleagues the two are interlinked. Their notion of a common security policy suggests that if any one member state is attacked then all are attacked.  The response of the Community would be to mobilise in defence of the member attacked.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was very clear at the weekend about our commitment to the process of European Political Unity. However, he was less than clear about what that means.  Does he agree that participation in an integrated European Community requires an undertaking to defend that Community?  For us in Ireland it may be difficult to differentiate between a security role and a defence role.  However, this is an area that must be discussed and the Taoiseach must make a clear statement on this issue. Will the Western European Union be the centre piece of a European defence strategy?  There are a number of key questions which the Community must face with regard to security arrangements.</P>
    <P>What form will the NATO alliance take and what will the relationship of the European Community be to that alliance?  All these issues have a bearing on our political future and we must be clear about our priorities and our policies. Otherwise we will find ourselves reacting to events rather than initiating debate.  That is a point I have made twice and one I want to repeat.  We cannot go into the intergovernmental conference in December and react to papers that have been submitted by other people.  This country must produce its own paper on what it believes should be the direction of European integration, particularly in the areas of monetary union, political union, security and defence.  We must <Col N="930" /> put forward our points of view on those issues.  I hope the Government will produce such a paper and that we will have an opportunity of debating it here in the future.</P>
    <P>I am firmly convinced that the Government are not approaching the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference in Rome with the degree of seriousness and attention it demands.  We cannot and must not go to this meeting unprepared and unsure of our political goals and strategies for the future.  The Government must commit to paper their views on the future development of the European Community and our contribution to that process.  It is not good enough for the Government to come into this House and give us generalisations and assurances. The construction of an integrated and politically unified European Community will take courage, determination and a great deal of imagination.  I do not think this Government have demonstrated that they have these qualities.  If they do not prove to have them our future as a people and as a political entity will be less secure and less sucessful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene in this debate as one of the Labour Party representatives on the Joint Committee on EC Legislation which has been presented with many documents dealing with the interegovernmental conference and the Rome Assises.  I welcomed the opportunity of listening to the Taoiseach's introductory statement on what is a very important debate.  I agree with the comments made by the previous speaker, Deputy Peter Barry, who is chairman of that committee, in calling for reviewed terms of reference for our committee. That committee is a structure which could not only develop our foreign policy but could also deal with other European matters, make an input into inter-governmental conferences and present the Government's position at these conferences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree it is imperative that the Government publish their own views, particularly as they relate to political union, to which the Taoiseach referred in his <Col N="931" /> speech, although not to a very great extent.  It is imperative that the country and the Oireachtas know the Government's position.  One way of doing that would be for the Government to publish a paper for discussion in the House, which would be circulated to the Joint Committee on EC Legislation for deliberation before 14 December.  If we could have agreement on the broadening of our terms of reference, the committee of which we are members could play a useful role in preparing for the tremendous changes and challenges that confront us. Major changes will take place which will demand policy responses from each country, including Ireland.</P>
    <P>We have to consider the question of German unification, the changes in the USSR, Central Europe and Eastern Europe, the EC and EFTA relationship, trade relations between the US, Japan and the Pacific Basin, the GATT negotiations, which are occupying all our thoughts just now, and of course our attitude towards Third World problems.  We are confronted with the major crisis in the Gulf, to which the Taoiseach has referred.  There is an on-going crisis in the Middle East, with an escalation of the Israeli-Palestinian problem.  Oil prices are escalating and there is also a problem with the rise of fundamentalism. Within the European Community we are concerned with major decisions about 1992 and the implications for this small country on the periphery of Europe.  We are also faced with the challenges that arise from the result of the Single European Act referendum.  This of course leads to economic and monetary union and political union.</P>
    <P>I will deal with the few items the Taoiseach has mentioned in the area of political union.  The Taoiseach has put down his, and possibly the Government's view on this aspect.  In his speech he dealt with the question of a disarmament dimension. In all our debates on membership of the Community and in the referenda which followed our accession to Europe and indeed the Single European Act, the Labour Party and other parties of the left <Col N="932" /> conclusively and consistently stated that Ireland is a neutral nation.  It is our view in the Labour Party that our neutrality is not for trading.  It is important to realise that we are totally committed in our opposition to any major military bloc. We are opposed, without fear of contradiction, to membership of NATO. Other fora have been suggested in Europe to discuss the defence of the European community.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach mentioned that the Government would give careful consideration to this aspect and to the demands that might be made on us in the area of political union.  It is essential that everybody in this country knows the Government's position in relation to a possible compromise in the area of our neutrality or our participation in Europe in areas outside of economic development. Membership of the Community was always confirmed to be membership of an economic power bloc.  It had nothing to do with the defence of Europe, joining NATO or any other military pact.</P>
    <P>We have a proud record as a small neutral nation within the United Nations. We have participated in their peace-keeping agenda and sent our troops to assist in peace-keeping in most of the conflict areas of the world.  We feel it could be quite dangerous to move away from that position and to get caught up in any alliance that might be involved in the maintenance of security of Europe or in any other matter which has been referred to by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>During the coming months, particularly December, we will see the launching of the two intergovernmental conferences which will deal with EMU and EPU.  This country will be challenged to produce a clear, strategic response to the wide and controversial issues which have emerged.  The work of the Inter-governmental Conference on European Political Union will be overshadowed by the Gulf crisis.  We will be confronted by demands for new Community moves in the area of security and defence.  This autumn will see the convening of the conference which was initially called by President Gorbachev to discuss the <Col N="933" /> future of European security in the aftermath of the ending of the Cold War and the collapse of the Warsaw Pact.  Ireland must approach this important conference with clear ideas about its preferred model for future European security and co-operation.</P>
    <P>The intergovernmental conference and the CSCE procedures will lead to new political positions for all European nations, including Ireland.  They will also lead to proposals for changes in Community treaties, to perhaps a second Single European Act and hence to another referendum which will probably take place here in 1992.  This presents a challenge to all of us, particularly those of us on the left, to review and update our policies on economic, environmental and social issues and foreign and security matters.  We are trying to define our attitudes in this matter and we suggest that the Government should state their policy quite clearly in this area.</P>
    <P>Other points for consideration will be European monetary union and the economic and monetary policies of the Community. We want to make sure there is a proper balance in the debate as regards policy proposals and that everything is not weighted towards monetary objectives. As regard the structures of the EMU, the European Central Bank will have responsibility for issuing the currency, ECU.</P>
    <P>What is the appropriate model for such an institution?  How should its accountability be ensured?  What will be the role of the European Parliament?  Will this new perceived Central Bank structure be answerable to the European Parliament or to the Irish Parliament?  Will we have representation on the Central Bank in the European context?  We will have to know the relative roles of the EC and the national institutions to this policy option. What about convergence, economic and social cohesion and the balance between market and other mechanisms?</P>
    <P>Our party leader, Deputy Spring, earlier this year addressing a conference of socialist leaders in Ireland, made a very strong statement in connection with the possibility of the implication for Ireland <Col N="934" /> and for us as a socialist party within Ireland and the Community.  He said:</P>
    <P>Economic and monetary union is a logical step from the internal market process.  Its purpose is to present Europe with the possibility of currency and price stability and an end to damaging fluctuations in interest rates. EMU will, of course, bring with it the need for much greater financial discipline in each of the economies of Europe and that may represent a particularly painful part of the process. The overall concept may well demand both an EC Central Banking system and perhaps, ultimately, a single currency and we fully accept the need to proceed with work on both these concepts....</P>
    <P>We are not interested in EMU simply for its own sake or as part of a process of liberating financial markets to greater heights of speculation.  The European Community and its member states must not be sacrificed on the altar of strict monetary policy unconnected to broader economic concerns. European monetary union must imply both economic and monetary policy considerations.  The overall approach must support an economic policy aimed at securing sustainable growth and the translation of that growth into jobs through a coherent industrial strategy.  In addition the issues of regional development and convergence must remain as central to the economic policies of the Community together with policies aimed at ending the poverty and marginalisation of so many of our people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Spring was saying that all the talk is about the monetary union aspects of these principles and concepts such as the Central Bank, the common currency, interest rates and the question of the full integration of this programme.  However, very little is said about the economic consequences and what the economic policy of European monetary union will mean for the regions of Europe which are disadvantaged or marginalised.  That applies, to a very large extent, to the Irish <Col N="935" /> economy which has major problems in the area of the development of the regions.  This has been shown by our recent application for reclassification and redefinition of disadvantaged areas because we have the most disadvantaged regions in Europe.</P>
    <P>It is important, in any monetary union, that we should have regard for the disadvantaged areas because many people in rural Ireland depend on the benefits of a regional and structural programme and that has not been pursued by this Government with any vigour even in the present structures of the limited regional funds which are available.</P>
    <P>Mr. Spring continued:</P>
    <P>All of these issues &mdash; economic and monetary, industrial, regional, environmental and policies aimed at improving the rights of working people &mdash; are interrelated.  And all of them are much more likely to find proper expression if the goals of economic and monetary union are set by national and community democratic institutions, including the European Parliament and Council, rather than by Central Bank Governors.</P>
    <P>It is very important to have an understanding of what we feel about the democratic deficit in the European context.  It is important that, when you have directly elected people in the European Parliament, their role and powers should be extended.  It is very important that we all believe in the collective responsibility of the directly elected European Parliament rather than imposing powers.  We know that this Government, in particular, are very loath to do that because, within the context of the European Parliament, they are a minority grouping which have no influence on European policy or the European Parliament.  They have only limited powers within the Commission and the Council of Ministers from a socialist point of view.  It is also important that democracy should be seen in these areas of the Commission and the Council because they are appointed by Government. Although the Taoiseach felt that <Col N="936" /> they were directly representing the people, they are not elected by the people to these roles and most of their work is carried out behind closed doors.  We only hear about decisions when they have been made and policies decided; we are literally discussing the decisions with hindsight.  Therefore, it is important that those two institutions are democratic.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that, with the direct franchise of the people, the directly elected European Parliament has been given a democratic role.  However, there is a democratic deficit within that parliament because many of their roles are restricted. The Labour Party want a liberalisation of that democratic role and further powers conferred on them.  I know these matters will arise when we have a debate on any further referendum which might be involved in 1992 in connection with a further European Act.</P>
    <P>The link between national parliaments and EC institutions must be strengthened and the so-called principle of subsidiarity must be applied.  National parliaments may also need to be reformed, as mentioned by Deputy Barry.  There is no doubt that in participating in the structure of national parliaments one would welcome a reform which would allow the democratic process in this parliament to be renewed and reviewed; we hope that changes will take place because it is important that we are all more accountable and relevant than we are sometimes seen to be.  This new role and relationship is essential if our own national identity and input are to be maintained.</P>
    <P>The socialist group in the parliament, the largest group, have made a submission to the parliament on the matters which we have been discussing this morning. The Labour Party do not have any problems with the items dealt with by the Taoiseach regarding economic and monetary union.  The Taoiseach said that 11 member states had agreed to an open market system, price stability, growth, employment, sound financial and budgetary conditions and greater economic and social cohesion.  We identify with all these aspirations.  The Taoiseach also said that there is a procedure for preparing the <Col N="937" /> move to the third and final phase of EMU but that, before this is done, there must be a report to the European Council on the functioning of the second phase and, in particular, the progress achieved on real convergence.  We do not have any problems generally with that aspect of the Taoiseach's speech.</P>
    <P>The socialist group in their report considering a range of policy issues which were raised in the process of moving towards monetary and economic union in the Community suggested that the starting point in this was the Delors report which is the primary source of the concrete proposals for monetary integration now being debated here and throughout the other 11 member states. The summary of their submissions on monetary union to the parliament suggest:</P>
    <P>1.  Centralisation of monetary policy at the European level is an essential condition for achieving the economic and social goals of the Community. Under the present EMS, inflation has been brought down significantly in most countries, but monetary policy in the Community remains too fragmented to protect internal economic policy from financial market forces.  A centralised monetary system is essential to enable other aspects of policy to be directed at objectives of balanced economic development and higher employment without jeopardising price stability.</P>
    <P>2.  The measures now being taken in the transition to monetary union leave national governments even more vulnerable to financial market pressure than before.  The abolition of capital controls and the removal of restrictions on competition reduce the means available to governments to balance internal and external objectives and achieve an acceptable compromise between domestic economic development and the maintenance of financial stability. To the extent that they are less able to keep their exchange rates within the <Col N="938" /> bands fixed under EMS without jeopardising internal growth and employment aims, there is an increasing risk of withdrawal, or at the very least frequent parity changes.</P>
    <P>The socialist group go on to say that:</P>
    <P>4.  Any central monetary authority established at the Community level must have final responsibility for conducting monetary policy.  It should be charged with securing financial stability and avoiding excessive inflation, but in pursuing these aims it should be obliged to take account of other objectives, balanced economic development and the maintenance of high levels of employment across the Community in particular.</P>
    <P>These trends in relation to developing the economy and the economic consequences of monetary union are reflected not only in the socialist document but in Deputy Spring's speech.  It is essential that in anything we do in the area of monetary union we do not marginalise the people at risk, the unemployed and the people who are forced to emigrate.  They must not be forgotten and further marginalised by any union within the Community.  Any central monetary authority must be accountable to a democratically elected body.  The European Parliament is an obvious body. The European Central Bank system must be accountable to a representative body to which people representing each country can be appointed.  It must be a democratically elected body, because elected representatives are responsible in the last analysis to the people.  This does not mean that there should be political interference in the day-to-day operations of the bank.  The authority should be obliged to report regularly on its activities and justify policies.  The governor of the bank should submit a report to the European Parliament and should be examined by the parliamentary committee and we through the Oireachtas joint Committee on EC legislation should be able to debate the report.</P>
    <P>In relation to budgetary policy for <Col N="939" /> macro-economic development the socialist group suggests that:</P>
    <P>The aim should be to agree a set of principles for the conduct of budgetary policy which would allow national governments to pursue legitimate development objectives.  Though running budget deficits on current account over the long term might normally be discouraged, governments must be allowed to run deficits to counter temporary downturns in economic activity or to meet high debt interest payments. Governments must also be allowed to borrow to finance expenditure programmes aimed at strengthening their economies and/or achieving a better balance of activity.  Such spending programmes should include not only investment in physical capital but also in education, training and know-how which increase the skill level and capabilities of the domestic labour force.</P>
    <P>To some extent our Government are pursuing that sort of policy under the aegis of FÁS, and we are using European funds to assist us.  These schemes however are only interim schemes to retrain people.  If we retrain people we must ensure that the economic policy following from EMU accepts that employment must be created in our own economy.  We cannot depend on outside sources to produce the jobs.  We have often depended in the past on the private sector and have been disappointed.  The private sector have not always translated profits into creating additional jobs.  The first priority of the private sector is to make profits.  That means that the State must have a central role in creating job opportunities, and in creating an environment which will stimulate the private sector.  There should be a greater use of the National Development Agency to co-ordinate efforts between the public and private sectors.  The National Development Agency has been made practically redundant by this Government.  If we are using Structural Funds to retrain our unemployed workforce, they must have something to work towards at the end of <Col N="940" /> the day, not just the emigrant ship or employment opportunities in England, America or on the Continent.</P>
    <P>There will be an increasing demand for jobs from the emerging Eastern European democracies.  These countries are underdeveloped and the change over to a different system will create large-scale unemployment in these areas.  This will put additional demand on the Community. Europe as an economic structure should welcome the membership of the weaker nations.  The European Community will expand into Eastern Europe and the emerging nations in Eastern Europe should be welcome into the economic Community but they have a huge impact on the existing monetary structure in the Community.  We must prepare for that.  I hope that today's debate will highlight the implications for all of us.  I hope the Government will take another opportunity to return to the House in relation to the development of political union. That will have a great significance for members of this party, for this country and for its future neutrality within the EC.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The point which needs to be made at the beginning of this series of statements is that this is not an adequate way to deal with some of the most important discussions and debates that are going on at the moment within the European Community.  A series of events will take place over the next couple of months.  This weekened there will be a meeting in Paris of the non-governmental organisations related to the CSCE.  Later in November there will be a Heads of State meeting under CSCE.  There will be a Conference of National Parliaments and the European Parliament around the end of November and the inter-governmental conferences will be held in the middle of December. They will be shaping the Europe of the future and, to a large extent, this Parliament, our committees and the public are not involved in the debate and are unaware of the issues being debated which, as I have said, will have such a profound impact on the future political <Col N="941" /> life of this country.  For instance, they should have a profound impact on the way this House does its business but there is no indication of any thinking going on in relation to what that impact might be or how we will in the future relate to the European Parliament, the European Council, the Commission and a whole range of other institutions in existence and which may be altered, or created in the future.</P>
      <P>The matters which are currently being debated, and which will produce decisions one way or the other in the not too distant future, will result in changes at least as great and profound as the changes which arose here as a result of our entry to the EC in the early seventies or, indeed, the impact of the Single European Act, which was passed here in the mid to late eighties.  While I, therefore, welcome today's debate, the level of information which has been provided by the Government both to the Oireachtas and the general public on their discussions in the Council of Ministers, and their intentions with regard to political and monetary union, is for all practical purposes non-existent.  We have had, virtually for the first time, a statement from the Taoiseach which outlines a number of options but gives no clear indication of the Government's thinking in relation to those options.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To take the implications from the rapid movement towards political union, for instance, I find it amazing that despite the Irish EC Presidency earlier this year there has been no clarification from the Irish Government of their position on issues such as Irish neutrality, European Security, the United Nations or subsidiarity as it affects the European Parliament and the national parliaments of member states.  Indeed, there are no proposals for tackling the democratic deficit which is referred to constantly within the European context.  That is not to say that the Taoiseach did not address or refer to those issues, but he offered no clear ideas or signals of the direction in which the Government are moving.  At the time of the Irish Presidency the explanation given was that as President of all the <Col N="942" /> Europeans we were facilitating all member states to discuss the issues and not imposing our position.</P>
    <P>We are now approaching the inter-governmental conference in mid-December and still there is no clarification of where the Government stand.  Take the example of the current Italian Presidency, still only half way through its term, which shows a very clear determination to lead the debate on where they want the Community to go.  In very sharp contrast also, there have been proposals from the Belgian, Dutch, Danish, Spanish and Greek Governments, and the detailed reflections of the Commission itself.  Despite very specific proposals from the Italian Foreign Minister for a unified European security and defence system, we still do not know where exactly the Irish Government stand on the issue.  More recently I have read that it is now proposed that progress towards a unified security policy can take place while allowing a country such as Ireland to remain outside the debate and decision-making.  That would leave Ireland neutered, not neutral.</P>
    <P>To my knowledge the Department of Foreign Affairs have expressed no position on the matter.  Initial comments from the Minister for Foreign Affairs such as, &ldquo;what has Gianni de Migelis said now&rdquo;, are no response to the intense series of initiatives and proposals to create a new security network in the Community. It is simply not good enough for the Government to stand back from the discussions as if they, or the discussions, were irrelevant.  When asked on 10 September last if he supported the US contention that Article 52 of the UN Charter provides legal cover for a military operation, he is reported as having said, &ldquo;we have had no discussion on that&rdquo;, and that he could not give an opinion &ldquo;on what could be discussed at some future EC meeting.&rdquo;  This is a further example of dodging, and failing to establish a clear position on where Ireland as a neutral country stands on the role of the United Nations in international peacekeeping and enforcement of international law.</P>
    <P>I want to reiterate that neutrality <Col N="943" /> should not be defined as isolationist and should not result in us being marginalised and stood in a corner while the big boys decide on the future of Europe.  It must mean that we are in there arguing, debating, discussing and pushing our concept of what Europe and political union should be and what security and the future defence, if necessary, of Europe should include.  The Taoiseach indicated in his statement that the question of disarmament might be an aspect of defence and security.  If Ireland is neutral in any sense of that word in the modern world then surely disarmament has to be &mdash; and we must insist on this &mdash; part of the discussion and debate about future security. It has to mean that we stand out against the possibility that the European Community as a body would acquire chemical or biological weapons and insist on the disposal and destruction of nuclear weapons within the European Community. We should be taking a stand on all of these issues and not standing back from the debate.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is on record as stating that he is in favour of development of the CSCE process as a means of dealing with security issues throughout Europe. Everyone is in favour of the CSCE.  The Taoiseach should tell us how he proposes to make the CSCE a viable and effective structure in the post Cold War situation. The CSCE needs stengthening if it is to play a long term and meaningful role in the new world order.  CSCE Heads of State are scheduled to meet at the end of November in Paris and Ireland must be prepared to adopt more than a passive role on that occasion.  Ireland, for instance, is not a member of the neutral and non-aligned group in the CSCE. Can the Taoiseach explain the continuation of this anomaly?  The explanation given in the past was that as members of the European Community, the Community adopts a single position within the CSCE.  However, that should not preclude us from having an association with other neutral and non-aligned countries within that body.</P>
    <P>It would seem that when the era of the <Col N="944" /> old military blocs is disintegrating, closer association by Ireland with countries like Austria, Sweden, and Finland, and the newly independent Central and East European states, would be a logical means of assisting the creation of a new European and world security order.  Yet the Taoiseach tells us nothing about what discussions, if any, he has had with the Governments of these countries on security issues in the past year, presumably because there have not been any such discussions.</P>
    <P>I contend that Ireland should be actively promoting new structures within CSCE itself to deal with issues such as inter-regional conflicts and disputes in Europe and verification and enforcement measures to ensure compliance with security arrangements.  Reassessment of current decision-making procedures, such as consensus, is required.  Setting in place a more binding and legal framework for CSCE must also be examined.</P>
    <P>Ensuring the full involvement of the US and Canada in these structures will also be important, not least to allay any fears of a &ldquo;fortress Europe&rdquo; emerging on the other side of the Atlantic.  It would also assist in ensuring that the United States Government in particular operate within the constraints and demands of the world community in much the same way as they have been constrained in the Gulf crisis by the United Nations.</P>
    <P>The Warsaw Pact and NATO now resemble two struggling dinosaurs. Ireland, having remained outside such military blocs and structures in the past, should now be to the forefront in proposing new and fresh paths for a Europe in which there would be neither an expectation nor toleration of war.  It strikes me that the Government have no interest in our intention of playing such a role.  The oft resorted to statement that we are &ldquo;militarily but not politically neutral&rdquo; leaves the Government, as it left their predecessors, afraid to take any initiative which has not been cleared elsewhere. Ireland's low standing in this regard seems to have been illustrated by the fact that neither the US nor USSR Governments seriously considered this country <Col N="945" /> as a neutral venue for any of the arms reduction talks which led to the ending of the Cold War.</P>
    <P>It now appears that the &ldquo;with it&rdquo; strategists in the European Community may not even believe that Irish neutrality is worth wasting energy on.  Their approach seems to be: &ldquo;Ignore it and let us get on with devising a new EC military and security policy.  The Irish will not mind being left in the corner.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party believe that Ireland must play a full part in the discussions on the future of European security. It is ridiculous that we can profess to belong to an economic and political community and yet pretend that its discussions on issues such as a European army, the production and deployment of nuclear weapons, sales of arms to the Third World and reaction to world trouble spots, are not our concern. However, there is a world of difference between participating in such discussions with a view to pursuing the issues of peace and disarmament and discussing the level of our participation in a military pact.</P>
    <P>We must take an active role in insisting that the European Community follows a non-aggressive security policy.  We must question why the membership applications of countries such as Austria are being delayed.  The argument apparently is, in the words of Deputy Barry, that we must deepen the Community before we broaden it, but I suspect it has much more to do with the existing members being anxious to copperfasten their already privileged position, economically and politically, before allowing outsiders in to share the spoils.  If Ireland does not convey a clear position of its policies in these areas then we will become as peripheral politically as we are geographically.</P>
    <P>There is a need also for Ireland to refine and develop its view on the function of the United Nations.  With the ending of the Cold War, the United Nations recently took on a more significant role in world affairs.  Its activity in assisting in the transition to independence of Namibia and its current more far reaching proposals to oversee <Col N="946" /> democratic elections and implementation of a peace settlement in Cambodia are two clear examples.</P>
    <P>The United Nations structures are now four decades old.  They were devised out of the ruins of the Second World War and hindered in their development by the politics of the Cold War.  It is now time to re-examine the workings of the United Nations to make it a more truly representative voice of its member states.  We need to examine the nature and composition of the Security Council and the role of the veto exercised by the permanent representatives on that body.  In addition, there is a need to examine the powers which the United Nations should have in dealing with world trouble spots. The United Nations rather than any individual or group of states must be the only permissable &ldquo;world policeman&rdquo;.  We should be prepared to play a full role in promoting the development of the United Nations along these lines.  This would be one useful means of developing Ireland's neutrality in a more positive and modern way.</P>
    <P>The current crisis in Iraq is worth examining.  The Government have rightly supported a coherent and united approach by both the European Community and the United Nations to the Iraqi invasion and occupation of Kuwait. It is to be regretted, however, that the Government have failed to take any specific initiative which would move the situation on to the next stage.  A clear emphasis on the primacy of the United Nations in the early stages of the crisis when the United States Government were forcing their hand and leading a military build-up in the region would have been one appropriate action for a neutral country such as Ireland.</P>
    <P>Within the past few days we have heard new threats from the United States that an invasion of Kuwait and/or Iraq is on the cards.  I would like to see the Government issue a clear assertion that the United Nations is the only body which is entitled to make such decisions on military action.  Unilateral action by any one country, especially if an attempt is made to dress it up under UN auspices, would <Col N="947" /> destroy the credibility of the United Nations, as happened with the Korean crises over three decades ago.  Indeed, the negative effect would probably be even greater this time round as there is not even the excuse of a Cold War to fall back on.</P>
    <P>Many other issues of continuing international tension require the attention of the Government, the European Community and the United Nations.  The Palestinian question is one such example. Numerous United Nations resolutions on this issue have either been blocked by a United States veto or, if adopted, ignored by Israel without any sanction by the United Nations whatsoever.  The international community must act decisively to force the Israeli authorities to agree to an international conference, which would involve the Palestinian Liberation Organisation as full participants, with the function of agreeing a homeland for the Palestinian people and guaranteeing the security of Israel.</P>
    <P>There is a broader issue of development aid.  Two-thirds of the world's population live in a state of underdevelopment. Hundreds of millions of people live on the verge of starvation and every year an estimated 40 million children die due to lack of food and basic medical care.  The ending of the Cold War offers a new and vibrant opportunity to tackle this scandal.  We must seek a transfer of funding away from arms spending and production and the promotion of vast sales of arms to Third World countries; instead it should be spent on assisting economic and social development measures.</P>
    <P>The question of the &ldquo;democratic deficit&rdquo; within the European Community was addressed by the Taoiseach in an indirect way in his contribution this morning and it must be addressed seriously.  The huge momentum of the past year would certainly indicate that the time has indeed arrived in the European Community to &ldquo;transform relations as a whole among their states into a European union and to invest this union with the necessary means of action&rdquo; as predicted in the <Col N="948" /> Single European Act and further asserted in the joint letter of 18 April last from President Mitterrand of France and Chancellor Kohl of Germany.</P>
    <P>The holding of a congress of European Parliaments, formerly known as the Assises, offers the potential to allow the Community's democratically elected bodies to partake in a truly democratic discussion and decision on how the process of European union could be achieved.  The problem is that the agenda is still far from clear and neither is there any clear view of what should result from the congress.  By virtue of the failure of the Irish and other EC Governments to promote the congress as a means of facilitating democratic discussion and decision making, there is a danger that it may result in simple rhetoric and hot air.  The European Parliament will not have been assisted to take on a truly effective role in representing the Community's 340 million citizens and I hope that this is not the desired outcome as far as national governments are concerned.</P>
    <P>With regard to the issue of the democratic deficit there is an even wider question. This morning the Taoiseach stated that he believed the European Council and the Council of Ministers are democratically accountable to the citizens of Europe but the reality is much different. The fact is their meetings are held in secret and we only know what they choose to tell us.  They report after the fact to this House on what decisions they have made.  For instance, the Government have not told us today what proposals they intend putting forward to the Heads of Government at the CSCE or at the IGC in the middle of December. There is no real accountability.  After decisions have been made we are told what they have done and in many cases we are not even told this much.  We are then given the opportunity to stand up here and make statements in response to the statement made by the Taoiseach having only received that statement half an hour earlier.  That is not an adequate way of dealing with the major changes taking place in Europe or of dealing with <Col N="949" /> decision-making within the European Community.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of the democratic deficit relates to the fact that in Ireland and in other countries there is a very under-developed system of regional government. Our local government structures are highly undemocratic in the way they operate.  There is a need to consider that point and also the way they relate to central Government.  The democratic deficit does not exist only at European parliamentary level but also at national level.  The issue of democratic accountability can no longer be ignored.  Recent years have seen power increasingly transferred from national parliaments to the centre of the Community.  This power has not been taken on by the democratically-elected European Parliament.  Instead it has been transferred to a group of 12 ministers who meet in virtual secrecy. As a body they are effectively beyond democratic control and influence from national parliaments, from public opinion or accountability.  They are isolated even from criticism itself.  Likewise the European Commission is not a valid body to represent the democratic wishes of the citizens of the EC.</P>
    <P>The European Parliament has had to struggle to obtain its current limited status.  It is farcical to suggest that we can move rapidly towards European union and refuse to move equally rapidly towards European democracy.  At present decisions are being made by technocrats and diplomats and are being presented to parliaments as a <i>fait accompli.</i></P>
    <P>The amount of time devoted by the Oireachtas is a case study of how vital European issues are never referred for proper discussion.  Even during the recent Irish EC Presidency, the Dáil was simply allowed to make statements rather than adequately debate the Irish Government's role.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting, of course, that all powers be transferred from national parliaments to the European Parliament, but rather that there be a complementary democratic role and links between the <Col N="950" /> European Parliament and its counterparts in member states.  It is clear that on some issues such as control on the proposed European Central Bank, national parliaments will be unable to exercise the necessary control over general policy direction.  They will not be able to do so either individually or acting as a disjointed collective.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the Taoiseach could not bring himself even to refer to the European Central Bank in his speech today.  He talked about institutions which would arise from the co-operation of national banks.  He was, of course, talking about the European Central Bank but refused to use the phrase.</P>
    <P>There are, however, many matters which can be better handled by the national parliaments.  The objective must be to keep the democratic institutions of the EC as close as possible to the citizens. A closer and more structured relationship between the national and European parliaments, involving frequent consultative meetings, regular fora such as the forthcoming congress of parliaments and provision for reciprocal attendance of committee members at each others' meetings would be some of the ways in which this could be furthered.</P>
    <P>Arising from this there is a vital need to strengthen the rights of the individual citizen under political union.  This should be guaranteed through the adoption of a democratic charter in the Community.</P>
    <P>We must not forget the millions of people who live within the Community but are not legal citizens of the Community. They are one of the most exploited groups in the Community. When we are talking about the rights of European citizens we must not forget those who are not citizens.  It is estimated that about 70 MEPs could be elected by migrant workers in the EC if they had a vote.  This is an area about which Ireland should be concerned.  We have unfortunately a long tradition of sending our people outside this country to live and work, both within and without the EC, and we know the problems they have faced over generations.</P>
    <P>On economic and monetary union, <Col N="951" /> increased attention must be paid to the effects of the economic situation on peripheral regions such as Ireland and to the need for adequate guarantees and action to safeguard and improve people's social rights in the new internal market.</P>
    <P>The proposals, now well advanced, for the establishment of a European Central Bank, or EuroFed, will have dramatic implications for fiscal policy and economic direction in this country.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Basic Document of the European Commission for the Integovernmental Conference proposes virtually no role for the European Parliament in controlling EuroFed. While the Commission and Council will have a central role in appointments, surveillance and drawing up overall economic policy, the Parliament will simply be &ldquo;consulted&rdquo;, &ldquo;will debate&rdquo; or be &ldquo;associated&rdquo; with the work of the other two institutions.  This reads like a recipe for economic and fiscal policy being decided by dictat, with the democratically elected European Parliament relegated to commenting or complaining about the results afterwards.</P>
    <P>All the evidence points to an escalation of the trends towards economic peripherality for regions such as Ireland under EMU.  Policy must be geared to a reduction in existing regional disparities, with a substantial upward revision of Structural and Regional Fund allocations to enable peripheral regions to adapt to and survive in a completed Single Market.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Government have so far failed to defend the interests of the citizens of this country in their negotiations on the Single Market or to ensure the development of a Social Europe &mdash; one committed to the wellbeing of Europe's people as well as its economy and industry.</P>
    <P>The detrimental effects of the Single Market on Ireland's peripheral economy must be tackled by an EC policy geared to assist this country to overcome the effect of changes in taxation and customs regulations, and for any loss of industry and jobs which will result from the <Col N="952" /> removal of trade and economic frontiers in the Community.</P>
    <P>Living standards in Ireland relative to other states failed to improve during the eighties.  We are still at just two-thirds of the average.  This process of peripheral regions losing out economically will continue and accelerate under the Single Market unless decisive action is taken to reverse it.  At the end of 1991 the European Commission will make a full assessment of structural policies and make recommendations on their continuation and improvement.</P>
    <P>The Government should be moving now to strengthen structural policy and funding, rather than be content to continually seek a bigger handout in the begging bowl.  The restructuring of CAP, rather than being allowed to drag on for years, should be grasped and used as a means to launch a Common Industrial Policy, which would see funds transferred to job creation measures &mdash; both in agriculture and industry.  As funding for CAP is reduced, it should be transferred to Structural Funds, where Ireland, as a peripheral region, could rightly demand and insist on increased allocations to assist economic development.</P>
    <P>This should be in areas where we can hope to successfully compete with European competition in the open market. Two areas which immediately spring to mind are food processing, based on our grossly underutilised agricultural production, and high technology, based on the low cost of transport of raw materials and finished product and the likely increasing market in this area in future.</P>
    <P>Most of the current structural funding spent in Ireland is on infrastructural development.  While such development is necessary, it must be accompanied by industrial investment and expansion or we will continue to experience industrial decline and rampant emigration.</P>
    <P>Consideration should also be given to widening the eligibility criteria in structural policies as a means of assisting development in less favoured regions of the Community.  For instance, overcrowding and lack of resources in education in Ireland require urgent tackling.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="953" /> Recent Governments have deliberately refused to allocate sufficient resources to reduce class sizes.  Community funding would help tackle this problem and ensure equal opportunity of access to children of working class families.</P>
    <P>On the question of social legislation, the Irish Presidency saw little or no progress in implementing an action programme on the Social Charter.  Tens of thousands of people continue to be exploited in part-time, temporary and contract employment here.  They are exploited through low pay, poor working conditions and lack of job security.</P>
    <P>Earlier this month the Minister for Labour yet again promised legislation to tackle such abuse of the most vulnerable members of the workforce.  I hope this Dáil session will finally see the long awaited Government Bill.</P>
    <P>At EC level there is need for a strengthening of the Social Charter to make its provisions binding on member states rather than aspirational.  I am thinking of other vulnerable sectors whose position will be affected in the absence of adequate EC social legislation, people such as the disabled, senior citizens, women, the young and indeed the migrant workers to whom I have referred already.  I should like to see the Irish Government bring forward proposals to strengthen the Social Charter in these areas.  In short the Government face a major task in ensuring that the current rapid moves towards political, monetary and security union are not effected at the expense of the interests of our people or those in disadvantaged areas in Europe or the Third World.</P>
    <P>I urge the Taoiseach and the Government to take on board the points I have made and ensure that they are pursued at all levels of EC debate in the coming months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this rare opportunity for back benchers to make a contribution and express our feelings about European development generally.  While this debate is more in the nature of statements it may be of considerable benefit to the public at large, especially many <Col N="954" /> who do not realise the work done by some of the subcommittees of this House. I might refer in particular to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the EC.  There are a number of subcommittees of that committee which are very active, producing regular reports which are presented to this House but which, unfortunately, are not debated on many occasions.  It is important that the work of those sub-committees be brought to the attention of the public.  This debate affords us an opportunity to demonstrate to the public the effects of some of the decisions of those sub-committees.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's statement earlier to the effect that he feels that the terms of reference of that sub-committee should be reviewed now.  That sub-committee has been operational since 1973 when we first became a member of the EC.  After a period of 17 years it is time we reviewed the constraints under which we operate.  The fact that the Taoiseach has said also that that committee could possibly serve as a foreign affairs committee constitutes a major step in its development and future.  Not alone will it be a committee which will deal with the legislation prepared within the EC but it will have a role to play also in making available the comments of Members of this House on foreign policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we examine the development of our country since entering the EC in 1973 we can see the decided benefits of our membership and the enormous improvements that have taken place as a result of EC aid here generally.  We can witness the ongoing developments with regard to our roads and other facets of Irish community life, in addition to the developments that have taken place in agriculture, education and the various other EC heads.  Indeed our future development will be assisted greatly in future years by the utilisation of Structural Funds.  The Structural Funds &mdash; to which I will revert later &mdash; have a potentially enormous contribution to make with regard to our future development generally.  We hear criticism of the fact that we have not made full use of the aids <Col N="955" /> available to us within the EC.  Because of the constraints on national resources we may have suffered somewhat on occasion because of not having the resources here to back up some of the schemes that could have been availed of within Europe. Nonetheless we have improved our takeup rate in recent years.  It is important that we ensure that the maximum funds available are taken up by all our institutions.</P>
    <P>This debate affords us an opportunity also to examine a wider range of areas. It would be important that we examine our position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the EC and its strength as a trading bloc.  There has been so much comment in recent weeks on the GATT talks one wonders how we would have fared had we not joined the EC in 1973.  At present we approach the GATT talks from a common position within the twelve member states.  It is important that we demonstrate the political muscle and Community support necessary to ensure that the GATT talks are conclusive and will be to the benefit of this country and the EC in general.  There is no point in our going off on tangents, contending that if one sector wins another must lose. We must strike a balance.  At the same time we must not sell out the principles of those talks which must be maintained <i>vis-à-vis</i> our basic position here.</P>
    <P>With regard to the agricultural position of the EC within those talks it is important that smaller family farms are protected. We should not approach those talks on the lines that X number of small farmers throughout Europe will disappear from rural areas.  That would not be a positive approach.  We have a position to maintain and I have no doubt that will be done.  Indeed our national interests, especially on the agricultural front, have been well protected to date by our Minister for Agriculture.  I am sure that, at the future meetings to take place in coming weeks, our Minister will reiterate the position of Irish agriculture and our feelings with regard to those talks. Within that context we should examine our position with regard to imports to the Community from non-Community <Col N="956" /> countries and their effect on the Community and especially on ourselves as an agricultural country.  We are the only country within the EC mainly dependent on agriculture for our livelihood.  We must accept, therefore, that we have a vested interest in those talks.  Were we seen to be lax in any way at those talks we would do this country such a disservice that we politicians would never be forgiven.</P>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy has been beneficial to Ireland in recent years but it is time it was re-examined.  For example, it is unfair that a farmer who produces 300,000 gallons of milk should receive the same rate of subsidy as another who produces only 20,000 gallons. As of now it is an inequitable system.  In view of the quotas and restrictions being imposed, it is important that we initiate an overall review of the Common Agricultural Policy in the years ahead with the aim of protecting its basic principles, which are to protect the smaller family units, so vital to this country.  If that must be effected by means of additional subsidisation of our smaller farmers then it should be done in that way.  We should not apologise for so doing.  It would be regrettable if we reached the stage at which quotas were so small, were supported to such a high degree, that they would prevent farmers developing to a reasonable standard.  In agriculture or any other sphere, it is vital that people make a livelihood from their produce.  They should not have to depend on subsidies but, if there is to be a subsidy system, then let it be equitable.  Let us ensure that the people who most need it receive the highest rate and are allowed to develop to a level at which they will not need any subsidisation.  That train of thought would appear to be beginning to be accepted by many of our European partners.</P>
    <P>With regard to the American position at the GATT round of talks, their Secretary for Agriculture came to Europe and proposed a reduction beyond what could be accepted by Europeans.  They did not make it clear that under their own system their farmers have a much higher <Col N="957" /> subsidy rate than European farmers have.  That should be stressed and brought to the attention of the public.</P>
    <P>We cannot look at Europe in the context of the Twelve.  We must look at it in the context of Europe as a group with common policies.  We must look at it with regard to our external relations and our relations with Eastern bloc and Third World countries.  The changes that have taken place in recent months in Eastern Europe will have enormous consequences for the EC.  They are the sort of changes none of us could contemplate five or ten years ago.  The changes have come so quickly and are free-wheeling at such a pace that we need to be very vigilant.  On the recent unification of Germany for instance nobody could have told us two or three years ago that the Berlin Wall would be sold in pieces right across the world to souvenir hunters.  It was the sort of thing that was dreamed of but nobody believed it could happen.  It happened mainly because East European countries, and communist countries in general, realised that our system of democracy is much more beneficial to the ordinary citizen than the system they have operated under since the Second World War.  German unification will have major implications for the Community. Germany has been one of the major contributors of funds to the Community but now will no doubt see a need to help develop the other half of their country.  I hope their commitment to development at home will not move down on the scale of priority their assistance towards the development of the Community and of member states.</P>
    <P>We are a peripheral state of Europe. We depend on subsidisation under various headings to help us develop.  If Germany's policy on funding the Community was to change it would have major consequences for this country.  We could find that much of the assistance we received in past years would be reduced.  That would be detrimental and would be against the basic principles of the EC. The Twelve in their deliberations over the coming months should continue to develop Europe as a unit, not as states <Col N="958" /> but as a European unit that will be in a position to match forces both economically and politically against blocs such as EFTA who now see that the EC has developed as a major player in the world.  We are no longer the Six that started out.  It is now 12 countries spread across Europe and, in the foreseeable future, it will have to expand.  The number of countries who have applied for membership and associate membership of the Community mean we must take a realistic, long term look at Europe to see how developments will take place.</P>
    <P>It is hoped the internal market will be completed in two years' time.  That is a major challenge to us.  It is a major challenge to industry here to be able to compete on a level playing pitch.  We have wanted it for many years but while a playing pitch may look level, like all playing surfaces it will have its bumps. Some industries may find it very hard to compete against their European counterparts. For instance, at the moment our agricultural products are being sold at approximately 70 to 80 per cent of the price being received in other member states.  We may develop our roads but we will have the extra cost of transport to the major market of Europe.</P>
    <P>Any of us could talk on this topic for an hour without having to refer to notes. It is of major importance to every citizen. How the EC develops over the coming years will be of major importance, maybe not so much to my generation but to those at all levels of education.  They will have to face the fact that when they leave qualified they will be Europeans, not Irish, English or French.  It is time the nationalistic approach that has been adopted especially by one member of the Community at the moment should be reviewed.  The British attitude is that they are greater than the other 11.  We are all equal members of a Community that was built on trust and negotiation, a Community that was prepared to compromise. Consensus should be the approach but the British approach in recent times has been one of defiance.  If they had been a little more forthcoming over the past four or five years in deciding to join <Col N="959" /> the EMS and make other decisions which were of major importance, they would not have the economic problems they have today.  Those economic problems are affecting us because interest rates in the UK affect Irish industries.  The free movement of capital in the years ahead will mean we will have to compete against a very lacklustre UK economy.  Their recent decision to join the EMS was one of necessity to try to turn the tide in favour of a Government who are now at a very low ebb as far as public support is concerned.</P>
    <P>In the time ahead it is important that we play a full role in Europe's development. We should not be seen as one who stands back but as a leader, as a country prepared to make a contribution.  Indeed, in recent times this country has made a contribution, maybe not in the public eye.  The parliamentarians of this House made a contribution at recent conferences with regard to the Rome Assises.  We stressed the fact that the new goals of the Community with regard to economic and monetary union and political union have consequences as far as we are concerned and that those consequences must be dealt with in a fair manner.  The problems that arise must be settled by negotiation and in no other manner.</P>
    <P>We have a role to play.  The Dáil, and the Seanad, have a role to play, but we as parliamentarians have a major role to play to see to it that we continue to press for the development of an integrated Europe.  It is in our interest to do so.  It is not in the interests of any group other than our citizens.  We do not want to find ourselves left out.  We are the only island state as far as Europe is concerned because yesterday's breakthrough with the channel tunnel when the two groups of workers met means the UK is now part of Europe.  They have a land link.  It may be under water, but it is there and we are now the only island.  It is up to us to see to it that we are not left as a peripheral state, that we make sure that the developments taking place will help to integrate <Col N="960" /> us into the EC at a faster rate than we have developed over the years.</P>
    <P>A Chathaoirligh, I want to say thank you for the opportunity of putting my views before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the last speaker I am delighted to have the opportunity to make a contribution to this debate for a number of reasons, one of which is that I, too, am a member of the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.  Since I became a member of that committee I have had the opportunity to observe development towards European unity since long before European unity was mooted.</P>
      <P>One of the things I found encouraging this morning was the constructive exchange between the Taoiseach and Deputy Peter Barry with regard to the possible expansion of the role of that committee.  We, the members of that committee, would certainly like to see its role expanded so that we might discuss without restriction the major developments that take place in Europe virtually on a daily basis which have an impact on this country.  If that means a broadening of that committee towards a foreign affairs committee, so be it.  The name of the committee could be changed if necessary.  The broadening of that committee would be desirable and it is something I would wholeheartedly support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this juncture I would like to review the portrait painted for us over the past five or six years of a united Europe.  I do so on similar lines to those drawn by Deputy Ellis.  This country has undoubtedly benefited greatly from our membership of the European Community.  We should never forget also that we have been very constructive members of that Community and have contributed a great deal to ensuring that the Community developed towards its now stated objectives. The various Governments representing this country have been most constructive in their approach to Europe and have supported the EC from the beginning.  There are those who might say that we had a vested interest in so doing, but whatever our interests we <Col N="961" /> remained constructive throughout the various changes of Governments over the last number of years.  We should not lose sight of the fact that the approach of our public representatives to Europe was always constructive.</P>
    <P>As Fine Gael junior spokesman on trade and marketing I have some reservations about just how influential we are within the Community at present, and this cannot be over-emphasised in the context of this country's interests.  I know it can be said that certain developments are inevitable, but if we go into any arena assuming the inevitability of the outcome, then there can only be one outcome. That is something we should never forget.  I mention that specifically in relation to Europe and the GATT negotiations.</P>
    <P>I feel we have been let down by our European partners on a number of fronts. We have been let down by the European Commission &mdash; I do not want to be political or personal about it but I feel that the greater European interests are being upheld at the expense of our national interests.  I speak as a strong supporter of European integration, economic and monetary union and all that they entail. I realise fully that the alternatives are limited.  I have to say, however, that if we proceed along the lines we have been going over the past two or three years, then we will become a very small cog in a very big wheel.</P>
    <P>In the last ten years or so the picture that was painted for us was of the strength of the economic unit of the European Community.  That strength was obvious to everybody.  We were given to understand that the changes in relation to transport and free open economies would be beneficial.  We hear a lot about open market economies.  This is not a new concept; it has been running since time immemorial.  The odd thing about it is that some of the people who now speak of the merits of this alleged new concept are the people who themselves created barriers and tariffs and obstacles to it.</P>
    <P>Those comments are a roundabout introduction to what I feel has been the European Community's almost total <Col N="962" /> capitulation to the US approach to the GATT.  I accept that rationalisation is to be expected.  I accept also that certain changes must take place in relation to both agriculture and industry which will not be exactly beneficial to many interests here; but if we allow things to go ahead as they appear to be then the impact of our initial entry into the European Community will have been lost, and we all know that many industries suffered greatly as a result of our initial introduction to the forces within the Community. The further suffering would be colossal in comparison to previous suffering. I say that not by way of criticisms but by way of genuine concern about what is likely to happen.</P>
    <P>There are various buzz words emanating on a daily basis by way of Eurospeak. Let us look at some of them.  We have heard about the two speed Europe. Everybody objected to that, and rightly so, because nobody wanted to see the interests of the major powers advanced to the detriment of minor powers, such as ourselves.  The next buzz word was &ldquo;fortress Europe&rdquo;, but the Americans demolished that very quickly in the course of the GATT talks.  Fortress Europe is long gone.  We now have reciprocity. That is almost gone as well.  Now we have subsidiarity.  I could go on and on with the Eurospeak that I believe has been thought up by some bureaucrat to confuse us so that we will not know what it means.</P>
    <P>The security we were to gain from our support of and involvement in the total European concept is not what we were led to believe it would be.  Outside forces, such as the US, have put extraordinary pressure on the Community, forcing it to change policy dramatically in line with the requirements not of the Community itself but of those outside interests. Where, then, is the strength that lay in our involvement in the entire Community? What about the huge market we have there?  Where is the force of that market if we are so easily pushed aside in the course of these negotiations which are now taking place?  Surely it was in someone's interest to point out that we <Col N="963" /> cannot allow ourselves, or the European Community cannot allow itself, to be pushed around in a negotiating area like that, and I use that word advisedly.</P>
    <P>A two speed Europe now appears to be emerging in that we have the super powers deciding, virtually on a daily basis, on what they see as being desirable and invariably it coincides with what is desirable from their own economic viewpoint. The previous speaker referred to the attitude of the British Prime Minister in recent times.  I agree that the European Community would be better off if the UK had adopted a more constructive attitude to it.</P>
    <P>With the developments that have taken place in Eastern Europe there is obviously a change of emphasis and a shift in the balance of world power.  We had an opportunity to say a few words about that on the very short debate we had on agricultural matters.  I expressed the view then that if the balance of world power was the same now as it had been four or five years ago attitudes to GATT would be vastly different as would attitudes to Europe, and the attitude of the strong economic powers in Europe <i>vis-á-vis</i> us would also be different.  There was greater recognition of the so called pivotal role which small economies could play then than there is now.</P>
    <P>The Commission must be told that their interests lie in Europe first and that their duty is to represent us Europeans. They must be told that our interests are inextricably tied up with theirs.  They should remember that.  The Council of Ministers need to be told that their interests must first lie with their own country.  It is all very fine to say that inevitably certain changes will result in half of our farmers disappearing off the horizon, but if that happens somebody, somewhere, will pay a price.  It will not be the Commission or the Council of Ministers who will pay the price, it will be those Deputies in the House who represent the people.  We must have regard to the way our case is dealt with at European level and the way in which Europe deals with others on our behalf.  I try not <Col N="964" /> to be overly political in debates of this nature which should transcend all political barriers, but I am parochial enough to think of our own people first and recognise that we have a duty to them.</P>
    <P>One of the things that would have amused me if it had not been so serious was that in the heat of the negotiations taking place in relation to the testing of the water with GATT and so on, a proposal was made to dramatically reduce agricultural supports while at the same time certain agreements would be made with other European member states the result of which would have meant the continued importation of cheap feed substitutes which would ultimately lead to a further deterioration in our agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>I am sure Mr. Andriessen is a very competent Commissioner who does a good job.  I know he cannot answer for himself but that attitude rankled with the people I represent and it begs the question: what role now for the smaller countries or the less influential countries within the EC?  We in the Oireachtas should nail our colours to the mast and let it be widely known that while we may be a minor entity in the Community we have interests and have served the Community well to date.  We have never diverged from the central objective of a united Europe.  We have been supportive at times when our support was vital.  Let our bigger brothers within the Community remember that.  It is not inevitable that as a result of market changes a large sector of our population should lose their livelihoods nor is it inevitable that we must bow before the superior negotiating powers of other agencies.  It is not inevitable that our vacuum packed beef will come from Texas.  However that will be the position if we allow ourselves to be kowtowed into that subservient role.</P>
    <P>I note that some people said a few years ago that involvement in the Community would ultimately result in a diminution of our sovereignty.  We have received documentation from people who hold that fear in the last few days.  I do not accept their view.  We can play as strong a role now as we did seven years ago.  It <Col N="965" /> is up to us decide exactly what we want.  It is up to us to ensure that we put the best foot forward and adopt the strongest possible stance.  It is in our interest not to allow ourselves to be pushed around by the greater powers in Europe.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that changes will not take place &mdash; these have been referred to by previous speakers.  I know the developments that have taken place in Germany are having an impact and I recognise the important and constructive role played by Germany in the Community to date.  That should not go unmentioned.  We recognise the huge responsibility Germany has taken on in recent times and we wish them well. However, they and the other European powers must recognise that we also have a role to play.  We looked after the interests of the European Community in the only way we could.  It is now the turn of the major powers to ensure that our interests are looked after if new developments take place.  If that is not done there will be a huge backlash and it will impact on us.</P>
    <P>I hope we will have an opportunity to speak on these issues in the near future. I support the suggestion put forward by Deputy Barry that we should have a debate on this issue on Fridays so that all Members could contribute.  We would be able to express our views freely and, more essentially, on a fairly non-political basis, because the interests of this country rest entirely with the total contribution of the Members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a tremendous amount in what Deputy Durkan has said that I can agree with, particularly his last phrase.  This is a matter that is completely non-political and is something with which we are going to sink or swim.  While I agree with the bulk of Deputy Durkan's contribution, he was being a little pessimistic in using such phrases as &ldquo;total capitulation&rdquo; and &ldquo;being pushed around&rdquo;.  Since we joined the Community all Governments have done their utmost to make certain that <Col N="966" /> Ireland's role is always to the fore, as the Deputy has said, and that the good of Ireland and the Irish people is always emphasised.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach said this morning: &ldquo;In so far as Ireland is concerned, member states are now clear at the highest level about our position and I am confident that our interest will be fully taken into account in the forthcoming discussions in the Agricultural Council&rdquo;.  I agree with Deputy Ellis's suggestion in relation to the future allocation of agricultural subsidies. The Deputy comes from the west where there is an enormous number of small farmers.  We feel it is about time that Commission policy was changed to take into account the small family farm that was referred to in the initial Rome Treaty.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to cover what the Minister for Foreign Affairs will say later but I would like to say a few words about the commitment of the European Community to developing countries, and point out that this commitment will not be diluted in any way by closer European integration.</P>
      <P>The House will be well aware that the Community is one of the world's major donors.  Next Monday at the Development Council in Brussels I will be discussing with my colleagues Commission proposals for a major expansion and improvement of our relations with the developing countries of Asia and Latin America.  It is, of course, too early to be precise about the outcome of the proposals but it is fair to say that it will involve a very significant increase in the Community's aid both in terms of quality as well as quantity.  The Community is determined to ensure that its presence in the world should be seen to have a positive impact at a time when some of our partners have expressed fears about Europe becoming absorbed by events within its own continent.  At the same time the Community is also discussing the improvement of its co-operation with the developing countries of the Mediterranean region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning now to the countries of the African, Caribbean and Pacific region, <Col N="967" /> Deputies will be aware that the Fourth Lomé Convention was signed last December between the Community and the ACP group.  I hope that in the course of the present Dáil session the House will have the opportunity to approve the terms of the convention.  The Lomé Convention is widely recognised as a model for relations between the developed and developing worlds, based as it is on partnership and equality as well as the contractual nature of the commitments entered into.  This is a point worth emphasising. Developments in European integration cannot alter our commitments.</P>
    <P>The convention was negotiated at a time when momentous events were happening in Europe.  The content of the convention, and its increased financial resources, are a sufficient testimony to our determination to assist our partners. As regards the level of aid, for example, it is very commendable that, in an international economic environment which is not favourable to increasing aid, the Community's financial contribution has more than kept pace with inflation.  In actual figures the amount for the first five years of Lomé IV will involve 12 billion ECUs compared with 8.5 billion ECUs under Lomé III, an increase of over 40 per cent in nominal terms and over 20 per cent in real terms.  While the ACP states would feel that the overall amount could be somewhat larger, nevertheless they recognise the highly concessional nature of the finance available.  Indeed this concessional nature has been increased with the removal of the replenishment aspect of STABEX and the emphasis on grants for structural adjustment.</P>
    <P>As far as Ireland is concerned, our financial contribution to the convention over the first five year period will be 60.17 million ECUs, approximately IR £46.8 million.  It is highly significant, in terms of the doubts that have been expressed as to the Community's intentions, that the Fourth Lomé Convention was negotiated for a ten-year period rather than for the five-year period of the previous three conventions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="968" /> Our contractual relationship with the ACP states is absolutely firm and the convention is their guarantee.  At the signing ceremony for the new convention last December, which I was honoured to attend on behalf of Ireland, both the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr. Marin, and the then President of the Council, the French Prime Minister, Mr. Rocard, emphasised that the improvement of our relations with Eastern European countries is perfectly compatible with increased support for development of ACP countries.  During our own Presidency, I have reassured the ACP-EC Joint Assembly as well as the ACP/EC Council of Ministers that our relations with the countries of Eastern Europe and with the ACP group are complementary, not competitive.  The volume of resources which the Community has devoted to the convention is ample evidence of this.  I can say now that exactly the same applies to the Community's commitments to other developing countries.</P>
    <P>As President of the Council at that time, I also reassured developing countries that the completion of the internal market is not designed to cut the Community off from the rest of the world. The Community is determined also that it should not damage their economic interests, nor affect the commitments we have entered into with them.  A single European market can be an important source of economic growth and consequently it can provide new trade opportunities in which the ACP and other developing countries can share.</P>
    <P>This is not to deny that difficulties will undoubtedly arise from the structural weakness of many developing countries' economies faced with tough international competition.  This is why, for example, the Irish Presidency assured the ACP countries of the Community's wish to help them in using to the full the instruments of the Lomé Convention for the improvement of their competitive position.  Where our developing country partners have genuine concerns, the Community is prepared to assist them to overcome concrete difficulties which may arise for them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="969" /> It is true that, as a member of the European Community and of the G24 OECD Group, Ireland is asked to contribute its fair share of the cost of aid to Eastern Europe.  In line with the G24 approach to the provision of aid for Poland and Hungary whereby the allocation of multilateral funds would be supplemented by bilateral commitments, the Government decided to provide a special grant of economic aid of £650,000 for Poland and Hungary in 1990.  I would emphasise that the Poland-Hungary funds constituted a special extra allocation and therefore did not involve a diversion of ODA funds.  Our general policy in relation to bilateral assistance to Eastern Europe &mdash; this was stated just yesterday by the Minister in reply to a parliamentary question put down by Deputy Mary Flaherty &mdash; is that provision for Eastern Europe should not be made at the expense of developing countries.  This year the Government allocated £100,000 from the disaster relief fund for disaster relief in Romania. Also in 1988 the Government made a special allocation from the same fund for disaster relief in Armenia which is part of the USSR, not a developing country and not, therefore, classified for development assistance under DSE rules.  While normally such funds are used for developing countries, a disaster relief fund, which is not tied exclusively to developing countries, was the only source of funds available at that time to provide a quick response and that is what we have been doing.  However, all Government expenditures have to be decided in the light of overall budgetary requirements and our own budgetary position is very much more constrained than that of the EC.  It affects all allocations.</P>
    <P>I agreed with some of the remarks made by Deputy Ferris this morning but not with others.  I also wish to refer to a contribution he made to the confidence debate yesterday when he referred to a letter circulated to some people in Mayo referring to the Presidential election and which he stated was endorsed by me.  The first knowledge I had of that letter was <Col N="970" /> prior to taking the vote at approximately 7 p.m. last evening.  I subsequently got a copy of the letter and discovered that while it was signed by an individual my name was typed at the end.  I did not have any knowledge of the letter, was not consulted about it and, therefore, could not have endorsed it.  Deputy Ferris also told me he got the letter from Deputy Garret FitzGerald.  In view of the fact that Deputy Garret FitzGerald referred today in the <i>Irish Independent</i> to a letter and that the copy of the letter had a fax number, 09451833, a number of a well known Fine Gael activist, it appears to be true.  I am afraid that Deputy FitzGerald's recollection of the letter, which he only got yesterday, and reported to the <i>Irish Independent</i> is faulty as it leaves out a phrase which would give a completely different aspect and context to the letter.  It brings into sharp focus the question of his recollection of events in 1982.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the Summit meeting earlier this week.  In particular I want to refer to a report in the <i>London Independent</i> on the Summit because it has specific and clear implications for Irish military neutrality which is now at an end.</P>
      <P>It seems that the Taoiseach has agreed that Irish military neutrality can and will come to an end; the only thing which has happened is that the Irish people have not been told that that commitment has been entered into.  I want to quote from last Monday's edition of the <i>London Independent:</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>monetary union represents nothing less than a final mandate for the treaty <Col N="971" /> changing Intergovernmental Conference which opens on 14th December. The 11 signalled that equally explicit guidelines would be agreed in December for the parallel conference on political union due to open at the same time.  Yesterday's text still made it clear that political union would employ the creation of common defence and foreign policies and extension of the Community competences, increased use of majority voting by Ministers and some new powers for the European Parliament.  Britain noted reservations on all these points.</P>
    <P>It is very clear from that report &mdash; and from other reports carried in this country and outside it &mdash; that defence and military commitments are now on the agenda and will be specifically on the agenda for the next meeting of the European Council on 14 December.  If this is the case why has it not been discussed in the House or debated in the country?  It has been swept under the carpet and people have been told that it is not happening.  It is happening, discussions on the ending of Irish military neutrality are taking place in Europe and we are not being allowed discuss them here because it is pretended that it is not happening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Read the Taoiseach's speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not being told it is happening and there is a pretence that it is not happening.  The Minister of State has just advised me to read the Taoiseach's speech.  I am drawing attention to this because the Taoiseach's speech glossed over this important issue although it is very clear that it has been specifically agreed that the issue will be on the agenda for 14 December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time that this House and the country had a debate on our military neutrality so that we can understand the principles, if any, on which it is based and which can be departed from in certain circumstances.  If neutrality is there it is not good enough that it can be departed <Col N="972" /> from by stealth without as much as a by your leave to anyone in this House or the rest of the country and without any debate or discussion.  There should be a debate and discussion and we should know precisely the terms of these discussions.</P>
    <P>I do not have a principled stance in favour of neutrality.  Somewhere inside me I would prefer if countries in general could be neutral but that is not the reality. It did not stop Hitler from marching into any of the neutral countries in Europe when neutrality was the order of the day. People think that somehow, because you are neutral, you can escape the terrible horrors when a war is unleashed. However, according to <i>The Economist</i> of 26 January 1952 the then Minister for External Affairs, Frank Aiken, said that partition affected Ireland's approach to all questions of external policy and Éamon de Valera's post war broadcast of 16 May 1945 makes it clear that partition was the reason for our neutrality during the Second World War.  Those remarks are from an article I wrote in August 1986 for <i>The Sunday Tribune.</i></P>
    <P>The doyens of Irish neutrality often look to the late Seán McBride and others and say what great defenders of neutrality they were.  In 1949 &mdash; I have it on file &mdash; Seán McBride, the then Minister for External Affairs, said exactly what Frank Aiken and Éamon de Valera said, that Ireland will become a full chartered member of NATO the day after partition ends.  The only principle of Irish neutrality that has ever been put on the record is the one that we will not discuss our military neutrality while partition continues.</P>
    <P>Because of changes, particularly in the last 20 years, this so-called principled position has become somewhat watered down but somehow military neutrality has been put on a pedestal as an untouchable subject which is not even to be discussed. If anybody suggests that we have a civilised debate on the subject, so that we can all hear the points for and against neutrality, his head is shot off.  If you even ask for a debate you are accused of being a militarist.  I cannot understand <Col N="973" /> that, it is very sad that we have not yet debated the question of military neutrality and that it has not proved possible to have a civilised debate on the matter.</P>
    <P>The late Dr. Seán McBride in 1950-51 as Minister for External Affairs tried to negotiate a bilateral defence agreement between this country and the United States.  That is a matter of record.  Let the great neutralists who uphold Dr. McBride &mdash; a fine contributor to public affairs in this country &mdash; as a great neutralist look at what he did as Minister for External Affairs when he had the practical responsibility for the conduct of Foreign Affairs for this country.</P>
    <P>When it comes to providing for our neutrality, it makes me sick to hear the Labour Party and The Workers' Party talk about neutrality.  There is something seriously wrong when a person must be totally in favour of military neutrality in order to become a member of a party. That is the sort of thing that went on in Eastern Europe.  Is there not one member of either the Labour Party or The Workers' Party who has any doubts about our military neutrality?  There are people in my party who do not want military neutrality and people who do.  In every party, except the Labour Party or The Workers' Party, there are people like that.  The Labour Party and The Workers' Party will not have any discussion on it, but they will force their members to look at military neutrality as a holy cow which cannot be discussed because it is politically advantageous for their parties to advocate this and to try to convince people that we are all militarists if we dare to hold a contrary view.</P>
    <P>Some people talk about our proud history of military neutrality.  I am not proud of the neutrality that kept us neutral while six million Jewish men, women and children were sent to their deaths in concentration camps.  What proud recollection of military neutrality is that? To sit on the fence while thugs beat up an old lady is not neutrality, it is cowardice. There are circumstances in which we must make it clear that we will take our defence and military duties seriously.  It is time we defined those circumstances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="974" /> I wrote in that article in August 1986 that it was time to stop the nonsense and look at all the alternatives available to Ireland, including the possibility of joining NATO, and I indicated that this alternative might not be a long term possibility since NATO might disappear.  The Warsaw Pact is obviously finished, so one wonders will NATO continue.  I also said that neutrality is not a principle which cannot be modified.  It is a pragmatic stand having its origin in the question of partition.  The advent of EC membership has diluted our stand in this regard.  Our duties to the European Community will prevent Ireland observing the Fifth and Thirteenth Hague Conventions governing the procedures for neutral states during war time.  That is a fact.</P>
    <P>It is very clear that the European Community will discuss a defence community when it next meets on 14 December.  If there is to be a European defence community we should be members and we should make no apologies for that.  If the Community comes under attack we should defend it.  How can we have a political and economic union and not have a Community we are prepared to defend if it is attacked?  Do we expect Belgian or Dutch troops to defend our interests?  It is time we made it clear that we will defend our own interests.  We should not talk about military neutrality as if it is a sacred God.  What about all the socialist parties in Europe who have no time for military neutrality, who have no difficulty in sitting around the table of NATO let alone a European defence community, who are often paraded through this House by the Labour Party as being great men?  There is total and absolute nonsense and hypocrisy coming from the Socialist parties.  If there is a European defence community we should be members of it.  Let us debate it and point out why it is our responsibility to be there.  I have an open mind in relation to NATO, which I think is on the way out but I think we should be members of a European defence community.</P>
    <P>Sweden, Switzerland, Austria and Finland are seen as great neutral countries. Austria and Finland are not neutral by <Col N="975" /> choice; they were compelled to be neutral by a former oppressive neighbour. Sweden and Switzerland are armed to the teeth or are exporting arms or machine parts to be used in destructive weaponry. There is no equation between neutrality and pacifism which seems to be the case being made.  Let us be clear about it, the only reason for World War II was because Britain in particular and later the Allies were not equipped to stand up to Hitler. If someone geared up with weapons arrives on one's doorstep, one must be equipped to repel them.  It was appeasement that caused World War II, not an opponent who was armed.  We should get these things into perspective.</P>
    <P>It is time we made it clear that partition is not the only principle of Irish military neutrality.  We should make it clear that we are not going to just take what we can from the European Community but that we are prepared to take our duties seriously in defending the Community. People will say that when we went into the Community we did so on the basis of military neutrality.  Let us put it to the people again and ask them, if there are to be new Community structures and a new defence community in Europe, will they take their responsibilities and join it or should we pull out.  Surely the people are entitled to hear the arguments for and against.  We should have a reasoned and logical debate.  If there is a good reason to retain military neutrality I would like to hear it.  I am open to being convinced by logic and reason but I will not be convinced by somebody trotting out the argument that it is a long established proud principle, but who will not allow people in their parties to express a contrary view.  Nor will I be put down by people who suggest that one is a militarist because one agrees with joining a defence community.  Look at all the militarists in the other neutral countries.</P>
    <P>We do not provide for our military neutrality.  In fact, it was estimated in the early eighties by a former Army Chief of Staff that at that time we would need to have provided in excess of £650 million to defend our neutrality, when our <Col N="976" /> budget for the year for the Department of Defence, including pensions, was less than one third of that amount.  Other neutral countries have huge armies to defend their neutrality and they export all sorts of weaponry.  They are not pacifists. If somebody invaded my property in the morning and the gardaí were not capable of dealing with it, I would defend my property.  That is my right and it would be my duty to my family.  It is the same in the Community.  If thugs threaten the Community the Community has a right to stand up to them.  If somebody attacks the European Community we cannot sit here and continue to take what we can from the CAP, the Regional Funds and so on, and refuse to defend the Community.  That would be a totally immature attitude.</P>
    <P>The press have given the Labour Party and The Workers' Party too easy a ride on this.  Let them spell out their neutrality objectives and their objections to a defence commitment to the European Community.  Why have the press never asked them if members of their party are allowed to hold a contrary view?  We know about parties who have a 100 per cent view &mdash; they are unreal, they do not exist.</P>
    <P>Another reason there should be a debate on this issue is that if we do not set down the principles on which our neutrality is based &mdash; I am talking about military neutrality because politically and economically we are members of the western community of nations &mdash; presumably the principles can be departed from on the whim of the Taoiseach of the day, which is what we are in the process of doing here.  We are about to depart from the principles of military neutrality on the whim of the Taoiseach without so much as a by your leave to anybody, any discussion or any reason being given in this House as to why that should happen.</P>
    <P>The buzz term in Europe is the &ldquo;democratic deficit&rdquo;.  Most people who talk about the democratic deficit talk about the need for the European Parliament to be strengthened as part of the institutions of the European Community.  I do not have any difficulty with that but in <Col N="977" /> tandem with that there is a role for national Parliaments to be strengthened, there is a role for us.  It is all right for the European Parliament to hold the Commission and members of the Council of Ministers accountable but individual members of the Council of Ministers and the European Council are members of the national Parliament and answer to the national Parliament.  Both national and European Parliaments should be strengthened in this regard.  When the question of the democratic deficit is being addressed we should not simply address the problem of the shortage of powers of the European Parliament.  National Parliaments have a role in holding Governments accountable for their actions within Europe as well and that should not be lost sight of.  This is a very important point which I want to see developed.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to the question of development aid.  Given the very generous voluntary contributions made by the Irish people to tackle the problem of world hunger it is nothing short of a disgrace that not only have we not sought to reach the targets set by the UN for member states in regard to the percentage of our GNP which we contribute towards the solution of the problem of world hunger but that in recent years that percentage has regressed. There is a very strong case for omitting the budget for overseas aid from the cuts which have to be applied in Government Departments.  World hunger is a desperate and shocking thing and, from a humane point of view, we should make a decision on an all party basis in this House to aim again at the UN target so that we can get up to the target of, I think, 0.1 of 1 per cent of GNP &mdash; I cannot remember the amount.  We should aim for that target, stop regressing the contribution we make and increase it.  The Irish people generally are way ahead of the Irish politicians in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The concept of economic and <Col N="978" /> monetary union in the European Community is not new.  The founding fathers of the Community back in the fifties had this in mind as an ultimate objective.  It came to the forefront again in the seventies when Europe saw the need for a united and strong economic block to counter the competitive pressures from other sources.  For a time there was a real prospect of major developments but the oil crisis of 1973 effectively ended progress as member states became more defensive in their policies in reacting to this crisis.  At the end of the seventies the Community did, however, establish a monetary system which, after initial difficulties, has evolved into a zone of monetary stability.  The European Monetary System, as it is termed, is now established on a solid foundation and it provides a good basis for further monetary integration.  A major breakthrough was finally achieved after the mid-eighties and the Single Act has provided the right starting point and the right momentum for the successful evolution towards economic and monetary union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At its meeting in Hanover in June 1988, the European Council decided to set up a committee under the Chairmanship of Commissioner President Delors with the task of studying and proposing concrete stages leading towards economic and monetary union.  This committee reported in April 1989.  It proposed a three-stage transition to full union as follows: Stage 1 to start on 1 July 1990 and to include stronger co-ordination of economic and monetary policies with full participation by all member currencies in the European Monetary System; Stage II &mdash; the transition stage &mdash; to take the process of integration significantly further by creating a central monetary institution to be known as the European System of Central Banks, by narrowing the fluctuation margins of currencies, some pooling of reserves, and the setting of basic economic targets, including rules for the size and financing of budget deficits; and Stage III &mdash; the final stage &mdash; to encompass the permanent linking of exchange rates and the transfer of <Col N="979" /> responsibility for monetary policy to the European System of Central Banks and binding rules and procedures in the macro-economic and budgetary field.</P>
    <P>The committee did not concern itself with arguing the case for union but it did emphasise that much closer and more effective co-ordination of economic policies between member states of the Community would be needed to achieve a successful and durable union.</P>
    <P>The report of the Delors Committee was considered by the European Council at their meeting in Madrid in June 1988. The Council decided that the report provided a good basis for further work and that the first stage of the realisation of economic and monetary union would begin on 1 July 1990.  They asked the competent Community bodies to adopt the provisions necessary for the launch of the first stage and to carry out preparatory work for the organisation of an Intergovernmental Conference to prepare for the subsequent stages.  This work has been in progress since and it was decided at the Dublin Council meeting last June that the conference will begin in Rome in December.</P>
    <P>Under our Presidency, earlier this year, the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers of the Community, adopted decisions designed to improve progressively the procedures for co-ordination of economic and monetary policy. These were: (1) a decision on the attainment of progressive convergence of economic performance during Stage I of union; and (2) a decision amending a decison of 1964 on co-operation between the Central Banks of the member states of the Community.</P>
    <P>The first substantive discussion at ministerial level about the final stages of union took place at the meeting of Finance Ministers in Ashford Castle in March this year, again under the Irish Presidency.  There was a considerable degree of consensus among Ministers about the general design and many of the individual aspects of the Delors package. Generally, it was recognised that there must be a high degree of centralisation in <Col N="980" /> the monetary field with an independent and federally-structured central banking institution and appropriate democratic controls.  While greater flexibility should be allowable in relation to budget and other economic policies, it was recognised that there will have to be some arrangements to ensure closer co-operation between member states on economic policies and proper budget discipline.</P>
    <P>In the Delors report there is special recognition of the difficulties that economic and monetary union may present for the poorer and peripheral regions of the Community.  While not making any specific proposals, it did acknowledge that Community policies in the regional and structural field would be necessary in order to promote the best allocation of resources and to spread the gains throughout the Community.  It recommended that particular attention be paid to an effective Community policy aimed at narrowing regional and structural disparities and promoting a balanced development throughout the Community.</P>
    <P>In the on-going discussions on closer integration, Ireland has consistently argued that adequate policies to promote economic and social cohesion are fundamental to the lasting success of economic and monetary union.  Our contention is that the peripheral regions may fall behind unless appropriate counteracting measures are put in place and that these require to be supplemented by further action designed specifically to close the development gap between rich and poor regions.  Such measures may require an increase in, and a broadening of, the Community budget in due course, so as to strengthen existing policies and develop new ones in support of cohesion.</P>
    <P>Following the Ashford meeting, there have been continuing intensive discussions in preparation for the negotiations at the Intergovernmental Conference.  These have culminated in the guidelines which last weekend's meeting of the European Council in Rome laid down for the conference. <Col N="981" /> While the United Kingdom continues to oppose the principle of union, it has participated in a positive manner in the discussions and has put forward its own specific proposals, involving the development of a &ldquo;hard Ecu&rdquo; in the interests of achieving greater integration.</P>

      <P>The Government unequivocally accept the ruling of the European Court that, through the operation of the 48 hour rule in relation to travellers' allowances without a specific derogation, Ireland failed to fulfil its obligation under the EC Treaty.  However we cannot accept a situation in which there is extensive abuse of the travellers allowances regime to the serious detriment of Irish businesses and the general taxpayer.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, since the European Court's ruling we have proceeded on two fronts.  First, in order to safeguard the important financial and economic interests involved, the 48-hour rule has been maintained in operation, pending detailed consideration of the judgment and its full implications, and pending the outcome of consultations with the EC Commission.</P>
      <P>Second, we are seeking the consent of the EC to a temporary derogation in respect of very short duration travellers. Discussions in regard to our request are continuing.  As both member states and the Commission have reacted positively, I am confident that a mutually satisfactory solution can be agreed shortly.</P>

      <P>I do not accept the second part of the Deputy's question, because the way in which one proceeds in relation to derogations is clearly understood throughout the European Community. Full consultation is taking place at both Council of Ministers and Commission level.  It is not unusual for a period of grace to elapse before decisions of the European Court are implemented. While I do not have any specific details on action which has been taken, some examples clearly stand out.  For example, the Italians did not implement a decision of the court and were taken back a second time.  In other cases periods of up to 43 months elapsed before action was taken. Therefore it is going too far to suggest we are on our own standing out like a sore thumb.  It is quite clear that the period of grace I have referred to is being usefully availed of by the Government.  I expect further discussions and negotiations on this matter.  It will be on the agenda for the next meeting of the ECOFIN Ministers.</P>

Would he not further accept that the Government are acting illegally given that we have not been granted a derogation despite the implication of the Minister's reply to my supplementary? There is no derogation, yet we are still applying the 48 hour rule even though it <Col N="983" /> has been declared illegal and anti the provisions of the Treaty by the court.</P>

We have shown a clear distortion of trade existed before the introduction of the 48 hour rule which brought about clear results.  In relation to the principles governing trade between member states, no aspects of Community policy should lead to a distortion of trade which is the case between North and South, and for this reason, as I said, we have received a positive response from both the Council of Ministers and the Commission.

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>I would draw the attention of the Deputies to the statement issued by the Revenue Commissioners on 16 October 1990 in response to media comment as to the effect on tax revenues of recent increases in the price of petrol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This statement indicated that, when account is taken of all relevant factors, the recent price increases will have little or no effect on the overall tax yield from petrol sales.  When account is taken of the estimated effect on consumption of <Col N="985" /> the higher prices, the Revenue Commissioners have calculated that, for 1990, VAT receipts from petrol sales will be approximately £2 million higher than would have been the case if prices had remained at pre-August levels but this will be more than offset by losses of excise duty of about £4.5 million.  The Revenue Commissioners calculated that, on a full year basis, the estimated additional VAT yield of £15 million would be almost neutralised by the estimated excise loss of £14.5 million.  Of course, these calculations assume that present prices hold, which is by no means certain.</P>
    <P>As regards other oils the position is that any additional VAT resulting from higher prices is likely to be small, since businesses are entitled to reclaim VAT, and there would be an offset from a reduction in the excise yield to the extent that consumption is affected.</P>
    <P>I want to make it abundantly clear, once and for all, that there is no windfall or bonanza to the Exchequer as a result of the higher oil prices of recent months. The plain fact is that, when account is taken of the negative knock-on effects of the increased cost of petrol on the general level of consumer spending, the Exchequer's total revenue will be adversely affected.  This evaluation, I shall add, is in line with assessments by international agencies and by other countries, of the repercussions of the Gulf crisis on national budgets and on economic activity generally.  In plain language, the higher oil prices have resulted in a significant transfer of purchasing power away from oil-consuming countries which will curb growth prospects and thereby worsen their budgetary positions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the net point in my question &mdash; which does not seem to have been adequately answered by the Minister in his reply &mdash; is that the Government have some discretion in relation to the increase in oil prices brought about by market forces in so far as he could reduce the excise content of the increase which has come about?  Is he not prepared to do <Col N="986" /> this?  Surely he would agree that it would be beneficial to an economy which is becoming somewhat nervous of the short term economic prospects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Government have a control over the level of taxation they raise on these products, the instrument commonly used up to last year was the Imposition of Excise Duties Act, 1957.  The relevant section was struck down in the High Court, which left the Minister of the day without the instrument of a ministerial order to vary the amount levied.  The matter is under appeal to the Supreme Court but there is no instrument available to the Minister, subject to legislation.  It was the decision of the High Court that it must be underpinned by legislation.  Short of bringing in legislation every time the Government might want to order an increase or a decrease, it cannot be done.  The price of petrol and oil is reviewed and the decision announced by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and his Department.  The most recent comment in that Department, which my officials have confirmed, is that we can expect a decrease in price on 5 November in the region of 6p or 8p a gallon.  Prices can move up and down every month and the ministerial order is not available to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I really cannot accept the explanation.  Would the Minister not agree that the view of independent economists is that the Department of Finance are looking at a windfall of between £10 million and £12 million?  Is the Minister's reluctance related to the fact that the Government are currently having difficulty in finalising the Estimates and that extra money from whatever source is needed, irrespective of the inflationary impact on the economy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to reject the Deputy's comment that he cannot accept the explanation.  We all have to accept the position in relation to the ministerial orders and the statutory instruments available to me.  It is common fact, not <Col N="987" /> supposition or imagination.  Let us consider the calculation with which the Deputy appears to disagree.  Independent assessments have been carried out all over the world in relation to this matter. It is not something created fictitiously by the Revenue Commissioners.  They operate independently.  Various figures are being floated in the public arena, ranging from £10 million to £15 million to £40 million and £60 million, depending on which Opposition spokesman one follows.</P>

The £60 million of Deputy Seán Barrett, the £42 million of Deputies Mitchell and Bruton, the £10 million of Deputy Quinn and the £15 million of Deputy Rabbitte are off-the-wall stuff.

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Last November the Commission put forward revised proposals on rates of excise duties.  These proposals differed from previous proposals in that they allowed for flexibility. This flexible approach involves setting a minimum rate of duty for some products and a rate band for others.</P>
      <P>Under the Irish Presidency, initial discussions on these proposals took place and useful progress was made in clarifying member states' attitudes to this difficult issue.  However, in the absence of the Commission's complementary proposals on movement of goods and structures, member states were understandably unwilling to commit themselves on the rates issue.</P>
      <P>At the most recent ECOFIN Council meeting on 8 October last, Commissioner Schrievner presented the remaining excise proposals.  Since then, intensive discussions at expert level have commenced and Ireland is, of course, participating fully in these discussions.</P>
      <P>Ireland's concern with the cost of the harmonisation package is well known in this House.  This cost presents major budgetary problems for Ireland.  Despite this, in the 1990 budget, I made a first step towards harmonisation by reducing the standard rate of VAT from 25 to 23 per cent by reducing excise duty on television sets, videos and table waters and by abolishing excise duty on records, CDs, matches and lighters.  Further progress will depend on the outcome of the talks in the EC and on the general budgetary position.</P>

My information is that most of that paper, if suitable, is recycled.

The Government Supplies Agency arrange printing for the Houses of the Oireachtas and the cost of the services to the Houses, which would be papers, printing and publishing generally, would amount to approximately £1.5 million annually.  The majority of such material would not be available for recycling, some of it being private material which would not normally be recycled.  I am talking about Dáil and Seanad Debates, Acts of Parliament, Dáil and Seanad agendas and a whole variety of other reports of committees and so on.

Does the Minister not feel that his reply is completely at variance with the commitments given in the Government's environment action programme which laid very strong emphasis on recycling and, indeed, made finance available for such recycling, including the recycling of paper?

      <P>The responsibility for the administration of the tax system is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners. For reasons of confidentiality the Revenue Commissioners are precluded from commenting on the tax position of a particular company.</P>
      <P>To qualify for tax treatment under section 84 of the Corporation Tax Act, 1976, a borrower must be carrying on a specified trade and the loan must be used wholly and exclusively for the purposes of that trade.  Under the self-assessment system both the borrower and the bank would be required to make a return of profit computed in accordance with the tax legislation.  In deciding how to treat borrowings for the purposes of that return both parties must have regard to the provisions of section 84.  Confirmation that the requirements of section 84 have been met can be made only following an examination of the records of the borrowing company, which is a matter for the Revenue Commissioner also.  Such an examination forms part of the audit programme currently being introduced under the self-assessment system.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the other part of the question on what procedures are in place, I refer the Deputy to my answer that the Revenue Commissioners have total responsibility in this area.

      <P>The Deputy is referring to legal action in respect of a matter that is not concerned in this question.  I am dealing with the question the Deputy put down.  Maybe I should inform the Deputy as to the procedures for dealing with the audit of companies' accounts. Companies make their own self-assessment first in relation to their business in accordance with the time schedule and everything laid down.  Secondly, the banks who are participating in section 84's, and who get tax relief on the interest portion of section 84's, also make their own returns to the Revenue Commissioners. In the course of time those audits will be carried out by the Revenue Commissioners in relation to the banks on the one hand and in relation to the company concerned and, indeed, any other companies.  I have little doubt but that the Revenue Commissioners are well aware of the questions raised in the public arena by Deputy Rabbitte, and the media, and undoubtedly will pay special attention to them when the respective returns come in to them for examination.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Does it not follow from that, if the thrust of Deputy Rabbitte's question is correct, that while it may arise that a bank will not get its tax credit arising from lending done at low interest rates to a specific company, no liability could accrue to the Exchequer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not for me to prejudge what decisions the Revenue Commissioners will make in relation to the aspects raised by Deputy Noonan or Deputy Rabbitte.  It can occur as part of section 84 in relation to the passing on of capital allowances from an individual company into the bank to lower their tax liability.  On the other hand, it can also apply in areas where companies raise money for working capital purposes, for instance, at certain rates where differentials in rates apply.  It would be a normal write-off for a company on the trading side if this is adjudicated by the Revenue Commissioners to be part of a trade.  They will give them credit for that. On the other hand, from a bank's point of view they can give out the money at a lower interest rate because they have the advantage of capital allowances or other interest rate instruments on that side. You are dealing with two separate sets of accounts.  If the Revenue Commissioners find they are not complying with section 84 of the Act an assessment will be raised against either the company or the bank concerned.</P>

Then we could talk about those aspects.  In relation to any other allegations made, the Revenue Commissioners have full and absolute statutory authority to carry out investigations into every aspect of everyone's business if they are not satisfied with it. Is the Deputy suggesting the Revenue Commissioners are not going to do so in this situation?  I am in full and absolute concurrence with the Revenue Commissioners on how they carry out their duties.  If Deputy Rabbitte has any evidence to suggest the contrary I ask him to put it before me or the House.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that to date attachment orders have issued in some 300 cases.  In addition taxpayers have been put on notice of the Revenue Commissioners intention to issue such an order in a further 100 cases.</P>
      <P>Attachment is one of a number of enforcement options available to the Revenue Commissioners where the tax fails to comply on a voluntary basis.  Its use in a particular case is influenced by factors such as the nature of the default, the potential risk to the Exchequer and the effectiveness of alternative methods of enforcement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In advance of taking attachment action in a particular case the taxpayer is put upon formal notice by way of written demand of the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="1001" /> intention to embark upon enforcement action.  Specific reference is made in this demand to the power of attachment, so they are put on notice in advance.</P>
    <P>In the event that the taxpayer fails to respond to this demand with a reasonable proposal for payment of his liabilities, then the Revenue Commissioners issue the notice of attachment to the relevant third party.  Simultaneously a copy of the notice of attachment is served on the taxpayer.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Let me thank the Minister for his reply which contains very full information on the guidelines that apply.  Are attachment orders operated through the Revenue sheriffs or by the Revenue Commissioners directly to the third parties to collect outstanding amounts due by taxpayers? Has the Minister any information on the nature of the third parties being attached?  Have wages been attached, for example?  Have returns from co-operatives on the sale of milk or on the sale of animals at the mart been attached?  Could the Minister indicate how effective the compliance by third parties is when attachment orders are made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the commencement of attachment action in early 1989 this method of enforcement has been employed in some 400 cases to date. Of this number attachment orders have in fact issued in some 300 cases.  The amount recovered on foot of the action from the 400 cases at present stands at £2.8 million.  The power of attachment has been employed against a wide cross-section of occupational groups such as farmers, doctors, chemists, hauliers, solicitors, barristers, publicans, postmasters etc.  There are none against politicians as yet, I see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general the order of attachment is directed against a debtor or a financial institution.  Most of the banks have been the recipients of such orders together with building societies and life assurance companies.  In addition orders have been <Col N="1002" /> served on various Government Departments, in particular the Department of Agriculture, in respect of headage payments and grants.  The GMS has been the recipient of attachment orders in respect of doctors, dentists and chemists.</P>
    <P>In addition to the direct yield derived from the use of the power of attachment it is considered that its existence and use has contributed to the maintenance of ongoing current collection.  In common with all powers of enforcement the real benefit of attachment lies in its deterrent effects.  I do not have the information as to whether they are operated by the sheriffs or direct.  I will get it and communicate it to the Deputy.</P>

This was clearly indicated in the Brady, Shipman and Martin report which predicted the decline of these resorts.  Again, I would like to ask the Minister to consider the proposals seriously.  They include capital allowances similar to those operating in the urban renewal scheme, PRSI exemptions for employers from March until September, and rates relief.  If these were put in place I am confident that again the attraction of the major tourist resorts could be offset and that market forces would not prevail as is happening in places like Ballybunion, Kilkee, Lisdoonvarna and Ballyheigue.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to establish a public inquiry as suggested by the Deputy.  My function in the matter relates to banking legislation, and I outlined to the House in March 1990 the changes which had been made in the Central Bank Act, 1989, to strengthen the powers of the Central Bank in relation to the supervision of banks and to improve the protection of depositors generally.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that Mr. Patrick Shorthall, the liquidator of Merchant Banking, recently stated that clear parallels existed between the charges brought in Belfast against Patrick Gallagher and matters which were in the liquidator's own report to the High Court, and that he also drew attention to possible breaches to the Larceny Acts and the Companies Act, and in the light of those clear statements by the liquidator, Mr. Shorthall, would the Minister not agree that the only way to get to the bottom of this whole unhappy issue would be to have a full, up-front and open public inquiry?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware from reading the reports, and I happened to hear the interview with the liquidator, Patrick Shorthall, that the liquidator reported back to the courts, who in turn referred his report to the Director of Public Prosecutions who subsequently made his own decision in that regard.  I freely admitted to this House when I answered this question the last time around that there were defects in the <Col N="1005" /> supervisory legislation of the Central Bank at the time.  Those defects had been remedied in the 1989 Act and I also introduced the depositors protection scheme for small depositors in relation to it. Those defects in legislation were there at the time and from the seventies right up to 1982 when this liquidation was first instituted the Central Bank had brought to the attention of Merchant Banking Limited the whole question of what they saw as being out of place.  They did not have at that time the authority to inspect books or anything, but the strengthening of their powers has been carried out in three different sections in the Central Bank Act, 1989.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Am I to understand that the Minister is fully satisfied that the new supervisory powers in the Central Bank Act, 1989, are sufficient to deal with the issues that arise from the collapse of Merchant Banking in 1982 and that he has no intention of strengthening the supervisory powers of the Central Bank further?  Could the Minister assure the House that the provisions of the Central Bank Act, 1989, are sufficient and that there will be no possibility of recurrence of such a collapse?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied from all the advice available to me that the defects shown up in the supervisory powers and legislation underpinning those powers have been remedied in the Central Bank Act, 1989 and no additional adjustments are required to be made to the Act to take care of the kind of situation thrown up by Merchant Banking. The 1989 Act covers small depositors in this regard.  The DPP's decision is a matter for himself.  He has not given nor is he obliged to give any reason for not prosecuting.  The question of further prosecutions is a matter for the Department of Justice.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has powers under the Companies Act to send in an inspection team if he feels it is necessary to do so. There is no lack of investigatory powers. I have set out clearly the position in <Col N="1006" /> relation to the Central Bank now and what it was then.  Sections 38, 47 and 36 fill all the loopholes that were shown up.</P>

      <P>Prior to the filling of the loopholes would the Minister comment on the allegation that the existing powers of the Central Bank were negligently applied in this case?  Would he agree that the decision of the DPP not to prosecute having regard to the fact that convictions were successfully achieved in another jurisdiction seems incomprehensible to the public?  Considering that many small depositors lost money in this collapse, does the Minister not agree that the least the Government could do to restore confidence and give some hope to those people is to set up an inquiry as sought in this question?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>There were many inquiries.  The question of prosecution is a matter for the Department of Justice and I suggest that the Deputy put down a question to the relevant Minister in that regard.  It would be totally inappropriate for me to comment on the matter.  As regards small depositors, I understand that the amount is something in excess of £1.2 million.  The new scheme under the 1989 Act, which I understand is adequate to deal with whatever situation might arise, introduces a scheme to look after such matters.  People were not unaware of what was happening.  There have been many Governments since the mid-seventies when the problems of Merchant Banking were first identified.  It is ludicrous to give the impression that these problems just occurred overnight.  They did not.  As regards depositors, the Central Bank stopped Merchant Banking from taking deposits in the seventies.  In the circumstances, the question of compensation does not arise so far as I am concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, significant &mdash; even radical &mdash; progress has been made already, especially in the last three years in reforming the tax system.  Improvements have been achieved which only a short while ago would have seemed impossible.  These, it should be noted, have been made possible because of the overall budgetary discipline observed in recent years and the consequent reduction in the debt-GNP ratio.</P>
      <P>In income tax alone, concessions over the last three budgets have exceeded £800 million.  Both the standard and top rates of personal taxation have been reduced by five percentage points and tax exemption limits have been increased significantly. The proportion of taxpayers in the standard band has been raised.  We have also started to improve levels of indirect taxation &mdash; the standard VAT rate has been reduced from 25 to 23 per cent, and some excise rates have been significantly reduced while others have fallen in real terms.  The corporation tax system has been fundamentally restructured. Accelerated capital allowances have been reduced and will be phased out completely by 1992 and section 84 loans are being curtailed.  The standard rate of corporation tax which has already been reduced to 43 per cent from 50 per cent will be reduced to 40 per cent in 1991.  In addition, major improvements have been made in the tax administration and collection systems, including the introduction of self-assessment for the self-employed, for companies and for capital acquisitions tax.</P>
      <P>Overall, these improvements have resulted in a wider tax base, a reduction in the incidence of tax default and greater equity in the tax system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The &ldquo;Programme for Government, 1989-1993&rdquo; commits the Government to <Col N="1008" /> continue reform of the tax system.  I would not like there to be any misapprehension, however, as to the difficulties facing us in relation to further tax concessions.  The recent report of the NESC makes these difficulties plain when it recognises that over the medium-term the scope for a reduction in the overall tax burden is extremely circumscribed. In short, we have no choice but to continue the progress towards stability in the public finances to which the Government are committed and it is against this background that tax reform must be seen. NESC pointed to necessary re-structuring in the tax system as the way of spreading the burden as equitably as possible. This must be the way forward.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt but that the question of tax reform will figure prominently in the discussions which are just beginning on a new programme for economic and social development.  However, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on these discussions at this point.</P>

That may well delay the plans rather than expedite them.  As I have said, we have recently received a brief from the Revenue Commissioners as to their requirements.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It is also inflationary.  If you give any child less than a pound coin you are in trouble.  A note of a smaller denomination than the £5 note is now required, and I would ask the Minister to take this up with the Central Bank as a serious suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Deputy is saying.  There is mixed reaction to the pound coin.  The complaint of confusion with the 10p coin is the most common one that I hear about and that the Central Bank receive most calls about.  The Central Bank plans to introduce smaller and the lighter 5p, 10p and 50p coins.  That is their next programme. They are going to give priority to the 10p coin as the one which is causing the most trouble in relation to the one pound coin. Their plan was to go ahead with the alternation of the 50p coin first but that is not creating any problem.  It is heavy and is distinctively different from the others. Therefore, the 10p coin will now get precedence over it.</P>
      <P>There also have been some complaints in that the one pound coin is the same size as the old pre-decimal penny, and that large quantities of these coins have been used in some vending machines. The bank assured the Department earlier this year, before we issued the coin, that following discussions with manufacturers of vending machines it was possible to distinguish electronically between the one pound coin and the old one penny coin on the basis of metal composition and, in some cases, design.  However, there appears to be a problem with certain old machines and this is being investigated by the Central Bank.  The Department have asked the bank to work closely with the trade bodies to advise on conversion of machines and, where possible, to withdraw such old penny coins as show up in those old machines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There also have been some reports in the media of alleged one pound counterfeit coins but these have so far proved to be false.  In the UK Royal Mint less than <Col N="1013" /> a dozen defective coins out of a total of 40 million have so far come to notice. The Central Bank is in contact with the Royal Mint to ensure more adequate quality control.  The objective it to clear up those matters first.  There is no perceptive demand for a £2 note.  Priority will be given to the 10p coin which is causing the most problems with the new one pound coin.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There are circumstances where you take a taxi and the driver does not have a £5 note, therefore you end up with six or seven pound coins stuffed into your pocket. People are carrying around a lot of coinage at the moment and that is inconvenient. There is a strong case to be made for a note of a lower denomination than the £5 note.  Five pounds is a sizeable amount of money and it should be possible to have a note of a lower denomination. The Minister should take up this suggestion.  I know it would cost more to issue notes rather than coins because they do not last very long, and I know there is a reluctance on the part of the Central Bank and the Department to restore notes.  They have been trying to remove notes from circulation for quite some time.  As I have said, there is a case to be made for a note along the lines suggested by Deputy Barry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly the Deputy is right in saying that the Department are reluctant to issue notes because of the cost involved.  The Central Bank has to bear the full cost of issuing notes, which would be very high.  We will certainly reconsider the whole matter but I am not giving a commitment to the Deputy or the House that we will issue a two pound note.  There are arguments for and against it.  It is true that with the introduction of any new coinage there are certain teething problems and it takes a while to get used to them.  You do not have to give a pound to every child &mdash; there are 50p, 10p and all sorts of coins. Deputy Noonan told us one time in the House that the condition of our notes was disgraceful and that they should not be <Col N="1014" /> used.  He was absolutely right and we were glad to get away from the £1 notes. They were very expensive to issue and they did not last very long.

      <P>In view of the fact that reports are coming in from various gun clubs that the laws are being abused, especially by foreign tourists, I would like to ask the Minister what steps he proposes to take to prevent the present uncontrolled and indiscriminate shooting of our song birds and migratory birds?  I would also ask the Minister to explain why Bord Fáilte, although they state that the average tourist will shoot less than four birds per visit, advertise in foreign brochures that the norm is 40 to 50 birds?</P>

      <P>Although we received claims from time to time from some regional game councils &mdash; and from the National council &mdash; that songbirds and others are being subjected to severe hunting pressures by these out of State hunters, there is no evidence to substantiate the claims. Field staff in the Wildlife Service are <Col N="1015" /> constantly monitoring the situation.  The wildlife rangers also constantly monitor the situation and all gun clubs are authorised under statute to initiate proceedings against people infringing the regulations and orders.  We have no other real evidence to substantiate the claims made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have that information but if the Deputy puts down a separate question I will get it for him. The numbers are very limited, the claims have been sporadic and are usually made after the events are supposed to have taken place.  It is very difficult to get details of specific cases where prosecutions can be brought.  As I said, we have instructed the Wildlife Service and the wildlife rangers employed by the State to monitor the situation.  Very severe penalties are involved as we can confiscate their gear and guns and revoke their licences.</P>

Unfortunately, even though we hear reports about this there is no real evidence to substantiate the claims.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister be more precise in terms of when we might expect the yard to become operational? Will he give an indication of the proportion of the formerly skilled workforce which might expect to be employed there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The yard should be open in a matter of weeks.  We are waiting for EC clearance to take it over which we expect in a matter of weeks.  We do not foresee any problems in this regard although there was some concern in relation to the workforce and the movement of the floating dock.  However, there is a misconception about the floating dock because it was never used as part and parcel of the shipbuilding operation at Verolme.  It was never part of the assets sold by the receiver and, consequently, did not serve the purpose about which we read in newspapers, especially in the Cork area.  It was only used for repair purposes and was offered to the new purchasers who were not interested in it.  It does not signify any setback in relation to Verolme itself.  The build-up of staff requires a fine legal point to be clarified in relation to the free exemption clause, the clause put in to protect the State in case of certain eventualities during the first five years.  It would give the State the right to repurchase if performances were not along the lines laid down.  The build-up of jobs was announced at the time and has been confirmed since by the company.  In 1990 there will be 55 jobs; 1991, 120 jobs; in <Col N="1017" /> 1992, 230 jobs; in 1993, 310 jobs; in 1994, 390 jobs; and in 1995, 450 jobs.  That is the exact build-up included in the business plan of the company for the take-over of Verolme Cork dockyard.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the Killarney red deer will be under threat if the land, suggested to become part of a third golf course in Killarney, County Kerry, is leased for this purpose as the land is a sizeable portion of the deer's grazing land; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>
      </QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 21 together.</P>
      <P>I am of course aware that there is concern at the proposal to lease approximately 90 acres of Killarney National Park to Killarney golf club as part of a third golf course.  However, I am satisfied that, rather than undermine conservation and amenity values, any agreement with the golf club will benefit these qualities.</P>
      <P>The area in question is located on the periphery of the national park.  It has been let for grazing cattle as it is not regarded as an integral feature of the national park.  It forms only a small part of the red deer's grazing land within the park but in any event that area would continue to be available for grazing by the red deer herd under any agreement that may be reached with the golf club.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Negotiations with the golf club are ongoing at present and consequently, I am unable at this stage to give precise details of the terms and conditions that would attach to any agreement between <Col N="1018" /> the parties.  I can, however, indicate that in order to meet the requirements of the Office of Public Works the lease would have to contain the following conditions. (a) Building development on the lands will be prohibited; (b) There should be no interference with the movement or grazing of the red deer over any lands controlled by Killarney golf club; (c) A public footpath will be developed through the lands linking Killarney town with Fossa; (d) The club will have to keep to a minimum any tree removal on all lands to be included in the proposed third golf course.  The club will also have to provide compensatory planting in accordance with a plan agreed in advance with the Office of Public Works; and (e) A lease of the area in question for a term of 99 years and subject to the foregoing conditions, would be granted to the golf club provided the State gained the full commercial value of the lease.  In this regard the Office of Public Works proposed that the club acquire lands for conservation by way of extension of the national park.  This has been accepted in principle by the golf club's committee and negotiations are proceeding on this basis.</P>
    <P>It is evident, therefore, that this proposal does not represent a potentially damaging precedent for our national parks.  Indeed, I would consider the leasing of peripheral land on conditions that will continue to protect its amenity, and heritage values, and in return for a significant extension to the national park, is a precedent which could only be regarded as beneficial to conservation generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RogerTGarland" hpid="Mr. Garland Mr. Garland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Garland</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the treatment by the Office of Public Works of the golf club contrasts very strongly with their treatment of St. Brendan's GAA club who, having occupied a very small area of the national park for many years, have been told to go?  This is clearly a case of elitism in favour of the golf club as against the GAA club which obviously caters for a different category of the population.</P>

      <P>That is an inaccurate statement. I have been in contact with the president of St. Brendan's GAA club and informed him that no decisions will be made until we have a complete discussion with him.  Recently in Killarney I launched a plan, the first, for a national park which was widely welcomed by everybody representing various clubs and organisations in the Killarney area.  It also received an enthusiastic welcome from the Green Party in Killarney.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for the courtesy of allowing me to make a statement here this afternoon.  On the Order of Business this morning Deputy Michael Ahern said, as reported in the Official Report:</P>
      <P>Last night on television Deputy De Rossa claimed that when his candidate &mdash; that is the Independent candidate &mdash; is in the Áras, he will have access to all the files in the Áras ...</P>
      <P>He went on to ask whether I could expand on how I would get those files.  The suggestion that I would seek access to Presidential files or seek to exert influence on an incoming President to release files, clearly impugns my integrity.  I made no such statement.  The transcript of the interview I gave to &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; on Wednesday shows that I did not make any such statement, and I do not hold the views Deputy Ahern ascribed to me.  The transcript of my interview with &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; shows that what I said was that I felt that &ldquo;tonight is not the end of the story as far as the events of &lsquo;82 are concerned. There should be a revelation of the log of the Garda and Defence Forces in relation to that night so that we can have out in public precisely what did happen and now that the existing incumbent in the Phoenix Park, Dr. Hillery, will no longer be there in a few week's time, I think we will then be far freer to investigate the whole events.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It will not matter next Thursday anyway because Brian Lenihan will show you a clean pair of heels.  You will be caught out by the transcipt every time.  In the economic area, it is now felt generally that new institutions are not required but that the arrangements governing existing bodies, such as the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers and the European Parliament, may need to be altered in certain respects.  There is agreement that budgetary discipline is of key importance if union is to function in a successful and stable way.  Broad agreement exists that key elements in such discipline are the limiting or prohibition of monetary financing of budget deficits, the limiting or prohibition of any process of automatic bailing-out of member states who get into monetary or budgetary difficulties and the avoidance of excessive budget deficits. These principles are likely to be included in a new Treaty and developed in secondary legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extent to which there should be legal prohibitions or limits on budgetary deficits that are considered excessive is being given considerable attention in the preparations for the Conference.  A few countries are of the view that voluntary co-operation may be sufficient.  Other countries &mdash; and I include Ireland in this list &mdash; tend to the view that more formal <Col N="1049" /> arrangements may be necessary.  The extent to which the Council should have the right to enforce a deficit reduction for a particular country, and the manner in which it might seek to do so, are not yet agreed.</P>
    <P>In the monetary area there is support from 11 member states for a common monetary policy which would be administered by an independent and federally-structured banking system.  That system would, of course, have to be democratically accountable.  Its overriding objective would be the maintenance of price stability and subject to this, the system would also be required to support the general economic policy set at Community level.  The new monetary institution would have control over monetary conditions in the Community; for instance, the level of interest rates and money supply.  It is envisaged that, with the final phase of EMU, the Community will have a single currency, the ECU, which will be the expression of its solidarity and unity.</P>
    <P>There is general understanding that the Community's political authority should be responsible for key decisions in the area of external exchange rate policy but that day-to-day operations would be a matter for the new Central Bank. However, the precise demarcation lines of these two areas of competence is still to be decided.  Linked to the issue of a common monetary policy is that of a single currency.  Most of the member states can see this as an integral feature of the final stage of union.  The nature and degree of democratic control to be exercised in an economic and monetary union, particularly in respect of any new structures, is another fundamental issue that has yet to be analysed in detail.  In general, it is envisaged that democratic controls will be the prerogative of the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament.  There are varying opinions about control procedures and there is every likelihood of further lengthy discussions before a consensus on this emerges.  The Ministers favour a pre-eminent role for the Council.</P>
    <P>A particularly difficult issue that arises <Col N="1050" /> in the context of economic and monetary union is the question of tax harmonisation. As Deputies are aware, there is a great variety of tax regimes and tax practices throughout the Community and little progress has been made to date in achieving greater uniformity.  There is a general realisation that harmonisation is essential and that this matter must be addressed with greater urgency.</P>
    <P>One area where work has been going on steadily in the last year or so, and where some progress is being made, is on the VAT regime to apply after 1992.  The broad outline of a new system, which will allow imports and exports to move freely without border controls, has been agreed.  Discussions are now centred on the technical arrangements to make this system work and decisions on these are due to be taken by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>One major component of the new regime still to be decided is the level of VAT and excise rates to apply after 1992. It is abundantly clear that, when customs controls disappear, our rates will need to approximate closely to those in Northern Ireland if serious diversions of trade are not to occur.  Such distortions would be contrary to the Single Market philosophy which is grounded on the principle of greater economic convergence. However, the process of bringing our rates into line with lower UK rates will be expensive &mdash; up to £600 million annually &mdash; and we must look to the Community as a whole to assist in a solution to this problem.</P>
    <P>As I indicated earlier, the first stage of the programme for union is already in operation since the beginning of July. The main monetary requirements for achieving the objectives of this stage are that the currencies of the member states are in the narrow band of the European Monetary System and that there is full freedom of capital movements throughout the Community.  We have made considerable progress in these respects and the entry of sterling into the EMS, even if only into the outer band, is a major step forward.  Capital controls have been largely eliminated throughout the Community. In our case, we have already <Col N="1051" /> made progress in this respect and we will eliminate all remaining controls by the deadline of end-1992 which has been set for us.  The Delors report envisages that, by the end of stage I, it will be necessary to have prepared and ratified the necessary changes in the Treaty to provide for full union.</P>
    <P>The recent European Council agreed that the second phase of union should begin on 1 January 1994 provided a number of conditions are met.  These include the achievement of the Single Market programme, the ratification of the new Treaty and the prohibition of the monetary financing of budget deficits.  As regards the final phase, the European Council stated that, within three years of the start of the second phase, reports should be prepared on the functioning of the second phase in order to prepare a decision on the passage to the third phase.  Significantly, the Council specified that the third phase should occur within a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have seen references to the possibility of a two-speed approach to economic and monetary union because of the inability or unwillingness of some members to sustain the pace that is favoured by the majority.  I would hope that this situation will not emerge and I know that members generally will make every effort to avoid it.  If, however, it should prove unavoidable, it is our intention to move ahead with the leading group.  In terms of economic indicators &mdash; inflation, balance of payments, budget deficit &mdash; we meet the economic conditions that are needed for union.</P>
    <P>The objective of economic and monetary union is to achieve greater prosperity throughout the Community.  A fully integrated economy will in the first place lead to the development of a strong economic bloc in Europe that will be a powerful force in the world economy.  Internally, the removal of transaction costs and the convergence of individual economies will lead to improved benefits; there may also be costs for some member states in surrendering flexibility.  A quantification of costs and benefits is not practicable <Col N="1052" /> because of the variety of possible scenarios. The Commission has recently completed an assessment of costs and benefits.  Its general conclusion is that sizeable benefits will accrue from greater efficiencies and greater stability.  It points to potential costs in terms of loss of flexibility in relation to monetary and exchange rate policy but its overall conclusion is that benefits should well outweigh costs.</P>
    <P>In our case, a qualitative assessment leads to the conclusion that the balance of advantage is weighted substantially in favour of full integration.  The greatest benefit is likely to be stability based on low inflation.  There will be greater confidence in our currency and economy when we are part of a large integrated system.  This should benefit investment and reduce, over a period, the premium on Irish interest rates.  The disciplines imposed in order to achieve convergence of budget and general economic policies will also help to sustain a favourable economic environment.  Since the foundation of the State up to 1979 we were in a monetary union &mdash; the sterling area &mdash; and we had no voice in relation to the management of monetary affairs within this union.  On this occasion we will be partners with a voice in every forum and an assurance that economic progress must be made in parallel with monetary developments.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier our particular concern that there be special provisions in the Treaty for possible adverse effects on the poorer and peripheral regions.  We want to have the assurance of special action for these regions if there is evidence that they are falling behind and not getting an equal share of the benefits of union.</P>
    <P>This is not to be equated with the begging bowl mentality that some Members of this House would have us adopt.  We are not making demands for automatic increases in transfers as a condition for participation in union.  We are making a legitimate case for balanced regional development in accordance with the fundamental principles that underlie the Treaty of Rome.  We are not alone in this <Col N="1053" /> respect.  Other countries will be making the same case and I am confident that our partners will recognise the validity of the case that is being put forward.  In this context, I should mention that there will be a review of the impact of the Structural Funds by the end of 1991.  It is too early to draw conclusions about the precise effect of these funds in terms of narrowing the gap in living standards within the Community.  My view, however, is that additional measures will be needed to narrow the gap between the richer and poorer in accordance with the objectives of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn now to the question of political union.  Discussions on this matter are still at an early stage, so the European Council Conclusions are expressed in very general terms.  One of the themes to be discussed in this area is the transfer of new competences to the Community or the extension of existing competences.  Nothing specific is emerging at this stage, though mention has been made of areas such as health, education, culture and energy policy which might be considered.</P>
    <P>We would wish to examine detailed proposals in these areas in the light of their impact on progress towards cohesion and on domestic costs and expenditures.  Extending competence to the Community could simply mean a regulatory function which might impose new obligations on the member states through Community standards or guidelines being established without any Community financing being made available. Our aim in the discussions and negotiations will be to ensure that any new competences have specific regard to Article 130B of the Treaty, which requires the common policies to contribute towards the strengthening of economic and social cohesion.</P>
    <P>The principle of subsidiarity is also being considered in the context of political union.  There has not yet been much discussion on how precisely subsidiarity should be interpreted.  If narrowly interpreted, the transfer of new competences to the Community could appear to be in conflict with subsidiarity.  This need not <Col N="1054" /> be the case.  Our view is that the Community must be given the power and resources needed to achieve its objectives, including whatever is needed to achieve the objective of cohesion.  We should not take too narrow a view of subsidiarity.</P>
    <P>While two separate intergovernmental conferences will be taking place &mdash; on EMU and political union &mdash; the two are very much inter-related.  Both are aimed at furthering the integration of the Community. In EMU, we have been stressing the need for parallel progress in the monetary and economic areas.  Similarly, we must now ensure parallel progress on EMU and political union.  The degree of economic integration that can be achieved in dependent, to a large extent, on the degree to which political integration is also taking place.  The NESC report pointed this out indicating that a significant degree of &ldquo;political homogeneity&rdquo; will need to be achieved to support the transfers needed for an advanced degree of economic and social cohesion.  We will be ensuring that the developments in the two intergovernmental conferences are co-ordinated as far as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> In 1969, four years before Ireland joined the EEC, the Heads of State or Government meeting in The Hague agreed that a plan should be drawn up to bring about the creation of economic and monetary union within the Community.  The Werner report, presented in 1970, proposed a plan for the attainment of such a union. Although certain important policy moves followed the Werner report by mid-1970 the progress of integration was running out of steam.  By 1979, the process was relaunched with the creation of the European monetary system and the European currency unit which, in turn, contributed to the adoption in 1985 of the internal market programme with the signing of the Single European Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>European monetary union, even though it is a natural consequence of the creation of the internal market, represents a quantum leap forward and will <Col N="1055" /> involve change in the Community and for all member states of a nature and magnitude different and greater than anything since the Treaty of Rome.  At its meeting in Hanover on 27-28 June 1988 the European Council reaffirmed its commitment in principle to European monetary union and set up a committee to be chaired by Mr. Jacques Delors, President of the European Commission, to study and propose concrete stages that would lead to European monetary union. The report was ready for the Madrid meeting in June 1989 and its findings have received increasing support from member states.</P>
    <P>At the Dublin Summit in June the Council reconfirmed its commitment to European monetary union and reviewed the preparatory work undertaken in advance of the Intergovernmental Conference in Rome on European monetary union in December this year.  The Taoiseach, and the Minister, in two very informative speeches, have outlined fairly clearly today what the national position now is.  We know that the Delors report is being adopted as the basis for Government policy in this respect. Consequently, it is compulsory reading for anyone contributing to this debate.</P>
    <P>The requirements of economic and monetary union go far beyond the internal market programme.  We know from the Delors report, on which Government policy is based, what the main elements of economic and monetary union are. First, we have the single market within which persons, goods, services and capital can move freely.  Secondly, there is a commitment to eliminate regional disparities within the Community.  Thirdly, there is a commitment to co-ordinate monetary, fiscal and macro-economic policy and, fourthly, there is a commitment to the establishment of irreversible fixed rates leading to a single currency.  I understand that the target date for this is now the turn of the century, the year 2000.  It is clear, therefore, that economic and monetary union will have the most profound effect on our political, social and economic life.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1056" /> As the Minister pointed out, Ireland experienced monetary union previously but, of course, we have also experienced both economic and monetary union and monetary union separately.  Shortly after the Act of Union in 1800, from about 1823-24 right up to 1922, we had economic and monetary union with Great Britain and, subsequently, from the foundation of the State in 1922 to our entry into the European monetary system in 1979 we had monetary union to which the Minister referred.  Our previous experience should make us pause.  While economic and monetary union in Europe may bring us to a brave new world, if we enter under the wrong conditions it may institutionalise the regional disparities which exist in Europe at present.  If this were to happen this would take out of our hands the instruments of economic management which could reverse the disparities in Ireland's case.</P>
    <P>In relation to the framework laid down by Mr. Delors, I would like to remark first on the completion of the Single Market.  It is not yet completed as there are still many factors which impede the free movement of goods and services and of persons and capital.  Those which impede the movement of goods and services are being systematically removed. For example, the harmonisation of qualifications will free the movement of persons &mdash; this process is well under way &mdash; while agreement has been reached on the movement of capital but much remains to be done before we achieve the objective of the Single European Act, a Europe without frontiers.</P>
    <P>Little progress has been made on the harmonisation of taxes.  Commissioner Schrivener has departed from the proposals of her predecessor.  She believes that if minimum rates of taxes were set the removal of border posts would result in a free flow of goods and services and the forces of cross-frontier competition would force member states to approximate their tax rates.  From an economic theoretic point of view this is correct.  If frontier posts are removed this, of course, will happen but, as I remarked at Question Time, there is a huge difference <Col N="1057" /> between the commitment to economic and monetary union and political unity in Europe and the difficulties facing the Minister for Finance in removing the 48-hour rule to allow, as I said previously, Dundalk housewives to shop in Newry. While it is great to be able to come into the House and paint large visionary pictures of a Europe united from the Atlantic to the Urals, when it comes down to the little details, for example, how one can cross the Border and bring home the weekend shopping in the boot of the car, it seems to be vastly more difficult.</P>
    <P>That leads me on to the first major obstacle which is the harmonisation of taxes.  The Minister in his speech referred to the loss which would accrue to the Exchequer which is very high indeed.  For example, the loss which would accrue if DIRT was abolished would be about £300 million on this year's budgetary figures. The proposal to harmonise deposit interest relief tax seems to have been put on and off the table and I am not sure what its status is at the moment but I understand&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an inactive proposal on the table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i>&mdash;&mdash;the costings given by the Minister do not take DIRT into account and only refer to VAT and excise duty.  He has come up with a figure of £600 million and £700 million. Unless deposit interest relief tax is harmonised with much lower rates in the Community then measures such as those announced yesterday by the Minister on the free movement of capital and the removal of exchange controls become an absolute pipe dream.  If one allows the free movement of money on deposit around the Community it would not be reasonable to ask people to keep money in a bank or a building society in Dublin where 33 per cent is deducted automatically from the interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now 30 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The <Col N="1058" /> temptation would be to deposit that money, if it was legal to do so, in a bank in a Community country where tax was not charged at the rate of 30 per cent, such as Luxembourg where the rate is 10 per cent.</P>
      <P>The question of the harmonisation of taxes presents a major difficulty and the Minister admitted this in his contribution. As I said, this does not apply just to VAT and excise duty, it also impinges on areas such as DIRT.  If we are looking for economic union taxes must be made compatible and harmonised.  For example, if personal tax levels are significantly higher in one Community country, and there is free movement of labour with qualifications recognised right across the Community it would not be reasonable to believe that young, highly skilled, mobile people, such as those who come through our universities, spend every summer abroad and are experienced travellers, would stay in a high tax regime if there is absolutely no inhibition on travelling to a country with low tax rates within the Community where their qualifications are recognised.</P>
      <P>The Government have adopted an almost passive attitude to negotiations with the European Community.  I have tried on a number of occasions to establish what the Irish negotiating position is in relation to the harmonisation of taxes but the Minister claims he cannot show his hand for negotiation and strategic reasons.  However, I suspect the reason the Minister does not show his hand is because he does not have a hand to show.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I do not think the Government have taken up a position on the issue of the harmonisation of taxes.  Our approach is to wait for the Commission, influenced by the stronger countries within the European Community, to make proposals and react to those proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Constantly we see Ministers at the negotiating table reacting to proposals from other member states and to proposals from the Commission.  We <Col N="1059" /> compromise on other people's ground and we do not seem to put forward a consistent series of Irish proposals on the major issues of the day which affect us. We should adopt an active European policy and enter all EC negotiations with a clear set of policy objectives.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Irish Government put forward any proposals on the harmonisation of VAT, but I suspect not.  I do not know if the Minister has proposals on the harmonisation of excise duties which take the Irish position into account.  If there are such proposals they are carefully hidden and have not been released in the House, even at Question Time today.</P>
    <P>A Europe without frontiers will only work, and we will only prosper within it, if competitive forces are allowed to operate freely.  In many areas of Irish life competition does not operate.  Prices are very unresponsive to change in domestic and international circumstances.  This is particularly so if the tendency is towards a price reduction rather than a price increase.  Examples earlier in the year confirm my view.  When our pound strengthened against sterling there was little or no reduction in the price of UK goods in the shops and no reduction took place until the representatives of the large supermarket chains were brought kicking and screaming into the Department of Industry and Commerce.  The banks and building societies were very slow to pass on the second last round of interest rate decreases in May and June. When I made a public statement and the Minister and his Department intervened, immediately the reduction came through. That is the sequence of events.  I admire the action the Minister took but if he had not taken it they would not have been responsive to the reduction throughout the summer.</P>
    <P>A recent survey has shown that petrol stations have been particularly notorious in not passing on decreases.  They pass on the increases very rapidly indeed and we have had a run of increases in the past couple of months.  The Minister announced today that a decrease of about <Col N="1060" /> 6p is coming through as the international price of crude oil fluctuates.  Even when the reduction is announced by the Department of Industry and Commerce, in many instances the old price will prevail. Our economy is particularly unresponsive to price competition.  It can only be explained by the presence of widespread informal price-fixing cartels who on all occasions are willing to take a windfall profit at the expense of the consumer.  Exhortations by the Ministers for Industry and Commerce and Finance and interventions by civil servants will not solve the problem.  The Government must legislate.  We should long since have incorporated in Irish law those Articles of the Treaty of Rome which outlaw anti-competitive practices.  We must ensure that anti-competitive measures are enforceable and are enforced.  There is no point talking about the operation of a Single Market if competition does not operate within that market.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the problem of how to deal with regional disparities.  There are major regional disparities within the Community and market forces alone will tend to magnify rather than reduce them. Even in very strong economies there are major disparities &mdash; in France, Provence; in Italy, the Mezzogiorno, and the northern regions of Germany.  These regions lag well behind the more prosperous areas in those countries.  If events are left to market forces alone EMU will lead to further impoverishment of the poorer regions.  The totality of the Community will prosper but the centre will prosper at the expense of the periphery.  The mobile young on the periphery will migrate to the central areas of growth and mobile capital will do likewise.  In the absence of an adequate regional policy EMU will work against our interests.  In an economic and monetary union there will be no national instrument of policy available to offset regional imbalances.  Consequently a fully integrated EC regional policy is a prerequisite to entry.</P>
    <P>The principles of such a policy enunciated by the Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Maurice Doyle, in a submission to the Delors Commission should <Col N="1061" /> be the blueprint of our negotiations in this respect.  He recommends the following principles for regional policy: the need to eliminate the locational disadvantages of the poorer regions in the production of goods and services; the large scale movements of labour must not become a major adjustment factor; regional transfers should be sufficiently large to effect the necessary reduction in disparities between member states; the need for aid should be determined on the basis of regions, not of countries, and aid should be concentrated in the poorer regions; the composition of regional transfers should be weighted in favour of programme financing rather than project financing; moreover, it should be designed as far as possible to capitalise private sector investment in the regions so that they become self-sustaining; Community regional transfers should be financed from the own resources of the Community and be complemented by the macro-economic policies directed towards financial stability in the medium term; and there must be a sizeable Community budget to implement this.</P>
    <P>They were the submissions made by the Governor of our Central Bank to the Delors Commission.  That is the basis for the blueprint of a regional policy which would accommodate our needs.  Unless we negotiate a regional policy along those lines, then once we have freely yielded the national instruments of policy which can deal with our problems to central agencies in Europe, economic and monetary union could turn us into the prairie province of the Community as quickly as leading to prosperity.</P>
    <P>I turn now to policy co-ordination and the irreversibility of fixed exchange rates. Policy co-ordination must pre-date fixed exchange rates.  Fixed exchange rates will only be possible if monetary, fiscal and macro-economic policies are fully co-ordinated to bring about the conditions to make fixed exchange rates possible. Then they must continue to be co-ordinated and irreversible.  The Minister dealt with this in some detail when he talked about the state of the negotiation position in allowing member states to run deficits <Col N="1062" /> and the circumstances in which the Community would not intervene if deficits became too large.  The negotiating point seems to be whether the restraints would be voluntarily imposed or whether there would be a central requirement to impose restraints.</P>
    <P>Whatever way it is done the co-ordination will require a new European institution.  The Minister referred to the European system of central banks which will run the system.  I gather it is envisaged that this will be a confederation of national central banks rather than a new European institution.  That is new information in the Minister's speech.  Whatever way it is done, it will involve a transfer or pooling of sovereignty not only different in magnitude but also different in kind from anything we have experienced since accession.</P>
    <P>There is a bigger leap forward here than signing the Single European Act. Central Banks are independent of national Governments in the exercise of their function.  A European Central Bank will be independent of both national Governments and the Community institutions in the exercise of its function.  The functions which will be transferred from national Governments to this new institution will not only involve those functions at present exercised by national Central Banks but also budgetary and macro-economic functions at present exercised by member Governments.  This is one of the crunch issues.  All transfers of sovereignty up to now have been transfers from the national Government to an institution where the sovereign Governments participated anyway.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance represents us at ECOFIN, taking the decisions there which formerly his predecessor would have taken here.  In the case of the Central Bank which is independent of Government, one is transferring an institution which is independent of the domestic national Parliament to a European institution which is independent as well. I believe that will not work.  It is not possible for a European institution &mdash; over which there is no democratic control &mdash; to take decisions for all of Europe. <Col N="1063" /> That is the crunch issue.  In the first instance I believe that the transfer will have to be to the Minister's own committee &mdash; most of it must go to ECOFIN &mdash; but there will also have to be powers transferred to the Parliament.</P>

      <P>With the co-operation of the House I understand that Deputies Garland and Barnes are anxious to make short contributions.  The Minister for Social Welfare has kindly agreed to wait and use his 20 minutes later.

      <P>I found the Taoiseach's remarks this morning very disturbing.  His vision of the long term goals of this country is very different from mine.  His statement that the ratification of the Single European Act has made the Community stronger is correct.  He was also correct when he said:</P>
      <P>It has made the Community strong and given it resources to help not only the poor parts of its member states but others in the developing world.</P>
      <P>Having the resources is one thing; distributing them is another.  The continued neglect by the EC of our less advantaged areas here is notorious, and the role of the EC in the exploitation of the developing world is absolutely scandalous.  The Taoiseach's reference to growth and enhanced prosperity &mdash; which he says now accrues to the EC &mdash; is simply not true.  Continued growth in EC countries based on over-dependence on fossil fuels as an energy source is not sustainable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish people do not want this country to become a mere province in a federal West European superstate with a common defence and foreign policy along with a common currency, which is the political objective of these proposals. Such an eventuality would be the last straw to such democracy, independence and neutrality as we possess.  It would <Col N="1064" /> turn the Dáil and Seanad into mere provincial debating chambers in relation to most matters, placing us under the rule of people we do not elect and over whom we would have virtually no control.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs should resist pressures on him to have defence and military aspects of security made a function of the EC.  There is no military threat to the EC or its member states.  An EC military union has little relevance to the present needs of Europe, a Europe that has 34, not 12, states. Ireland's policy of neutrality is a more appropriate model for this larger Europe than that of an EC superpower armed with nuclear weapons and disposed to collective intervention in the Third World.  The proposal that a political union treaty should extend the law-making competence of Brussels to new areas such as education, health, culture, energy and policing would further erode our democracy, national independence and capacity for development.</P>
    <P>An economic and monetary union with fixed exchange rates, an EC central bank and a single currency &mdash; in the absence of a fiscal union whereby the EC underwrites much of our public spending and social services &mdash; would lead to massive increases in unemployment, emigration and lack of development here.  This was clearly implied in the NESC report on Ireland and the European Community of last year.  Our previous experience of EMU with Britain, which did involve fiscal union, bears that out.  The EMU now being proposed by Brussels envisages no commitment to compensate less developed areas like Ireland for the drawbacks of having monetary policy, credit, interest rates and exchange rates decided, as inevitably they will be, in the interests of the developed central EC member states.  In any case an EC with an expenditure of approximately 1 per cent of the gross national product of the Twelve would be incapable of financing adequate compensatory transfers when one considers that national public spending normally amounts to approximately 30 per cent of the national income of <Col N="1065" /> individual member states.  In that connection it may be observed that, even with fiscal union and a federal budget equivalent to 30 per cent of GNP, the USA cannot prevent the depopulation of states like North Dakota.  An EMU with an EC central bank would also put an end to the sovereignty of the Government in relation to public finances.</P>

      <P>May I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the Minister for Social Welfare and Deputy Garland for being so co-operative.</P>
      <P>I want to place on record &mdash; appropriately in the presence of the Minister for Social Welfare &mdash; the social dimension of the European Community.  I do not share Deputy Garland's pessimism or bleak forecast about a united Europe. Rather I look forward, as I hope also would Deputy Garland, to the House of Europe which was envisioned &mdash; because a vision it was at the time &mdash; by Mikhail Gorbachev, and accepted by the leading statesmen of Europe as not merely a vision but a reality towards which we would all work.  Indeed the events of 1989 and 1990 to date have borne out this vision.  Hopefully, therefore, the relevant debate will not be about the Warsaw Pact or NATO but rather about the continued lowering of nuclear weapons, the building and furnishing of a House of Europe, thereby eliminating many of Deputy Garland's fears particularly with regard to its security and military might.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Community &mdash; it should be acknowledged &mdash; has already contributed enormously to this country and its people.  Of course we recognise that the peripheral, marginal areas of Europe remain under-resourced and are not treated in the same way as or on an equal footing with the centre.  Beginning with the Treaty of Rome, advancing to the second and third programmes, particularly embracing the Social Charter and the Structural and Social Funds, it must be recognised that much has been achieved.  I believe the commitment to further development is there.  I shall rely consistently on our Ministers at every meeting to be held over the next few <Col N="1066" /> years to ensure that that overall equality is worked toward, particularly the elimination of inequality in regard to half the population of Europe.</P>
    <P>Of course the centralisation of our economies and monetary systems and, as Deputy Noonan said, even the crunch aspect of a central bank in Europe, are crucial to our survival within Europe. Here I might quote Jacques Delors, one of the great architects and visionaries of Europe, who said that the social cohesion of Europe and its political content, which is about people, is at least, if not more, important.  Hopefully the economic questions will be resolved.  It is my belief that the security aspects will be teased out. We must put constantly at the top of the agenda social cohesion, the removal of the inequalities, extending equality of opportunities to those who do not yet have it and who hopefully will be given it within an integrated Europe.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister and the Government to fight at every single opportunity not only for the extension of agri business but for the employment of women within that sector &mdash; bearing in mind the realities which our farmers and others in Europe must face &mdash; to ensure that funds are made available and projects and models adopted in which women have been engaged traditionally so that they may contribute to the larger farm income at present denied but there for the taking.</P>
    <P>I want to place on record something said by a woman researcher in Europe. She has undertaken research into the impact of an integrated market in 1992. She points out that some of the greatest legislative opportunities have come about as a result of our membership of the EC but makes the point also that the greatest fall-out for members of the Community has been borne by women, particularly by way of unemployment and lack of access to training.</P>
    <P>The researcher I am quoting is Pauline Jackson, an Irishwoman working in Brussels.  She says it has become acceptable, even fashionable, to berate the waste of resources involved in transport congestion, environmental pollution and <Col N="1067" /> artificial barriers to trade.  She does not negate the importance of that, but she ends up by saying that women in Europe, both employed and unemployed, constitute an under-utilised resource with intellectual and physical capacities which have for far too long been ignored and undervalued.  I am glad I have been able to record that in the five minutes given to me in this House.  I hope the Government will continue to keep it high on the agenda.</P>

      <P>I am standing in for the Minister for Foreign Affairs who is away on official duties.  He had hoped to be back in time.</P>
      <P>I am glad to note the wide measure of agreement across the House on the value of our Community membership and the need, while affording full and active protection of our national interests, for this country to play a positive role in the construction of the new Europe.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach this morning reported on the outcome of the Rome European Council last weekend.  In doing so he took the opportunity to give a full and comprehensive account to the House of the work being done on political, economic and monetary union.  He detailed the proposals that are under discussion in the preparatory work for the two Intergovernmental Conferences that will open in December, and outlined Ireland's approach.  It amounts to one of the fullest authoritative descriptions to date of the work under way.  Furthermore, the Taoiseach undertook to report again in December on progress achieved and on Ireland's contribution. In the light of this I cannot understand Deputy Barry's contention that insufficient information has been made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There can be no doubt that we are in the process of creating a more integrated and dynamic Community.  The events of the last 12 months have shown the need <Col N="1068" /> for this and have pointed to the role the Community can play in the affairs of our continent and in international life.  Two examples will illustrate what I mean. First, there was the collapse of the old regimes in central and Eastern Europe and the need to provide swift and effective support for the new democratic governments emerging in their place. The Community was among the first to respond and was chosen by its major democratic partners to co-ordinate the international effort to assist those countries.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the unification of Germany, the union of the two Germanies under a European roof, became a priority of the Community after the fall of the Berlin Wall 12 months ago, when the member states reacted quickly and positively to the demands made of them.  The detailed and often complex transitional measures which were required to make the GDR a part of the Community were agreed without difficulty.  The warmth of the political welcome for the new Germany was sincerely expressed at the Dublin European Council in April.</P>
    <P>Reporting on that meeting the Taoiseach told the European Parliament at its May session that we looked forward to the positive contribution which the population of the former GDR could make to the future prosperity of the Community, thus echoing a sentiment widely shared by our partners.</P>
    <P>I am proud, and I think the country can be proud, that the main lines of the Community's response to one of the most significant events in post-war European history were settled during Ireland's presidency.  In the meantime the work that has been done on the interim measures shortly to be completed on transitional arrangements has been undertaken with the full participation of all members states.  I am satisfied that our interests are being fully protected in that regard.</P>
    <P>The capacity which the Community has shown in dealing with the historic changes which have taken place in Europe in the last year should be seen against the background of the achievements flowing from <Col N="1069" /> the Single Act.  The progress towards full economic and monetary union and the completion of the internal market, the reform and expansion of the Structural Funds and the putting in place of long term arrangements for the operation of the Community budget are certainly among the most important of the achievements &mdash; but there are others.  The five year plan for research and development, the increased action being taken in the environment area, the Social Charter and the detailed action programme which will flow from it, are notable developments in Community integration.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act, and its implementation, thus provides a very clear example of the Community's capacity to face up to challenges and to find the means to overcome them.  Part of the reason for the success of the process set in train by the Single Act was the effective co-operation established between the Community institutions.</P>
    <P>In the course of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conferences it is important that the institutions of the Community work effectively together to achieve the common aim of a further real step towards integration.</P>
    <P>We have at our disposal many ideas and proposals for the development of the Community.  The Taoiseach has outlined the conclusions reached at the European Council in Rome.  In addition, the Commission have just recently published their opinion on the Intergovernmental Conference on Political Union.  The European Parliament has adopted a series of reports on aspects of political union ranging from subsidiarity to a draft constitution of the European union.  Parliament is still actively examining the issues involved prior to giving its formal opinion on the Intergovernmental Conference on Political Union as it is required to do under the Treaty.  There is much to consider in this work and I should like to examine some of the main points put forward by the Parliament and the Commission. There is no doubt that the Parliament played an important role in the process which led to the adoption of the Single Act.  The work of Altiero Spinelli, and <Col N="1070" /> the draft Treaty which bears his name was one of the inspirations for the Single Act and it is clear that it remains an important source for Parliament today as it elaborates its own perspective on political union.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs was able to hear the views of Parliament in Strasbourg last week at an inter-institutional meeting between the Council, the Parliament and the Commission. At the meeting the members of the Parliament's delegation outlined their main proposals which are contained in its various reports and resolutions.</P>
    <P>These call for the achievement of EMU according to a specific, automatic and mandatory timetable; the full integration of European political co-operation into the Community framework; the strengthening of Community competence in the area of social and environmental policy; the inscription of a declaration on fundamental rights and freedoms in the treaty; increased use of majority voting in the Council; the reinforcement of the powers in the Council; the reinforcement of the powers of the Commission; reform of the system of Community &ldquo;own resources&rdquo;; increased powers for the Parliament including, co-decision with the Council on Community legislation, the right to initiate legislative proposals, the right to elect the President of the Commission and to give assent to the appointment of the Commission, the Court of Justice and the Court of Auditors; ratification of all constitutional decisions which also require ratification by the member states and co-decision in external agreements and international conventions, including trade agreements.</P>
    <P>Many of these proposals are under consideration in the preparatory work leading up to the Intergovernmental Conference on Political Union which the Taoiseach addressed in his speech this morning.  Some of them have the support of member states, in particular, the full integration of European political co-operation into the Community framework, strengthening of social and environmental policy, inscription of <Col N="1071" /> rights and freedoms in the Treaty and the extension of majority voting.</P>
    <P>More problematic, perhaps, will be the increase in its decision-making powers to the degree sought by the Parliament.  For many member states, including Ireland, the Council of Ministers must continue to be the principal decision-making body. That is not to say that we cannot look carefully at the demands of Parliament, see what improvements can be made to existing procedures and reflect together on what additional powers might be granted to Parliament and in which areas. For example, we might envisage the extension of the co-operation procedure between Parliament and the Council.</P>
    <P>One important further consideration is that any additional powers that are given to the European Parliament must be directly related to the overall shape of the Treaty reforms to emerge from the Intergovernmental Conference.  They should be commensurate with the scale of any such changes and should take account of the need to preserve balance and efficiency in the operation of the Community institutions.</P>
    <P>National parliaments have expressed concern at what they see as the gradual erosion of their powers, especially following the adoption of the Single European Act.  The European Parliament has taken the initiative in establishing contacts with the national parliaments and in associating them with its work on maintaining the momentum of European integration. It has already held a number of joint meetings with the national parliaments. As Deputies know, this process is to culminate in a Congress of the European Parliament and the national parliaments which will meet in Rome at the end of this month.</P>
    <P>At the Rome meeting the European Parliament will, I expect, seek to persuade the national parliaments that their powers have not been transferred to it but rather to the Council of Ministers, an intergovernmental body which, it will be argued, cannot be called into account. To correct this, the proposition may be put that the prerogatives which the <Col N="1072" /> Treaty of Rome and subsequent legalisation have transferred to the Community from the parliaments of the member states should be given to the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>I have two points to make on this argument. First, the members of the Council of Ministers are responsible to their national parliaments for their actions and have a clear and direct democratic mandate. Second, it is relevant to recall that the attitude of member states to the role of the European Parliament in the decision-making process varies greatly. Some, including Ireland, are very conscious of the fact that they cannot exercise through the participation of their representatives in the work of the European Parliament, the influence which it is open to them to exercise through their participation in the work of the Council of Ministers.  In addition, the decisions taken by the Council of Ministers generally result from a genuine negotiation involving an effort to accommodate the interests of each of the member states.</P>
    <P>I am not arguing here against the development of the European Parliament's role in the legislative sphere. This is something to which a majority of Heads of State and Government subscribed last weekend and which will be taken up in the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>What I am saying is that in seeking to ensure the democratic legitimacy of the Community and its democratic accountability, all the institutions are involved and we must take care that the balance between them is preserved.</P>
    <P>The Commission published its opinion on 21 October on the proposal for amendment of the Treaty with a view to political union.</P>
    <P>It is a well reasoned document and one which will make a valuable contribution to the work of the Intergovernmental Conference.  It argues that the historic legacy of the founding fathers and the cumulative commitment to European integration, favours concentrating the revision of the Treaty on the integration <Col N="1073" /> of new objectives into a single Community with a single institutionial structure.</P>
    <P>This, it believes, is the only way to bridge a gap which has opened up between progress on common policies and advances on political co-operation.</P>
    <P>The Commission advocates a flexible institutional structure which would be capable of taking account of: (a) the state of public opinion on the future of European integration, which varies considerably from country to country, and the way member states perceive the joint exercise of pooled sovereignty; (b) the need for caution, which militates against defining the final shape of European Union at this early stage and in favour of keeping to the course charted by the Treaty of Rome, leading eventually to a federal-type organization; and (c) the likelihood of further institutional change to accommodate enlargement of the Community.  Common sense dictates that in a much larger Community the institutions will have to be radically reformed to prevent it degenerating into a mere free trade area with loose arrangements for foreign policy consultation.</P>
    <P>These general considerations are ones we could support as they confirm our approach to the Intergovernmental Conference on Political Union.</P>
    <P>The Commission adopts a more restrictive attitude than some member states and the European Parliament to the extension of the scope of the Community.</P>
    <P>It proposes that any increase in the Community's powers should concentrate on social affairs, major infrastructural networks and aspects of the policy of free movements of persons.  As far as the environment and research areas are concerned, the Commission feels that qualified majority voting should be used more frequently and it could also be used in the taxation area.  It would also wish to see an extension of Community competence into the cultural area, by providing for a cultural dimension to the Community's activities, and a consolidation of the provisions of the Treaty in the energy area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1074" /> We are still examining the implications for Ireland of extending Community competence and additional use of majority voting.  I am conscious of the very great contribution which majority voting has made to decision making in the area of the Single Market since the adoption of the Single Act.</P>
    <P>However there is a number of areas where I believe we must proceed cautiously. Taxation is one example.</P>
    <P>The Commission is anxious to ensure that Parliament's powers are increased and that it will have a more substantial say in decision-making.</P>
    <P>We will examine the Commission's views but I should say that one proposal made in the Commission paper &mdash; that Parliament be given a limited right to raise taxes &mdash; seems at the very least premature and out of line with the existing budgetary system.</P>
    <P>Finally, it is worth noting that the Commission proposes that the implementation of economic and social cohesion should be one of the tasks of the union. We fully share this view and support it. The reason is quite straightforward.  The Treaty of Rome talks, in its very first sentence, of laying &ldquo;the foundations of an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Unless in the process of further integration it is recognised that the common policies must bring benefits to all of the people of the Community, I think we cannot hope to succeed in the construction of a prosperous Community in which solidarity among all its members and peoples is an accepted principle.</P>
    <P>The Council of Ministers is at present involved in the task of preparing the Intergovernmental Conference.  This work is still at a preparatory stage and positions have not crystallised on specific issues.</P>
    <P>The conclusions adopted at the European Council in Rome at the weekend give a reasonable indication of the state of play at this stage.</P>
    <P>Essentially delegations are in the process of considering the various options in the following areas: extension of the scope of the Community, democratic <Col N="1075" /> legitimacy, inceasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the Community, and the unity and coherence of the Community's international action.</P>
    <P>I have covered the first three of these issues in some detail already and I would now like to deal with the issue of foreign policy.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of the high-level meetings during the Irish Presidency, including the informal session of Foreign Ministers at Parknasilla in May, was that the further development of the European Community is not only in the interests of the Twelve member states themselves but has become a crucial element in establishing a reliable framework for peace and security in Europe as a whole.</P>
    <P>The European Council meeting in Rome on 27-28 October has now agreed, with some reservations on the part of the United Kingdom Government on the question of seeming to pre-empt the Intergovernmental Conference, on the objective of a common foreign and security policy and on the objective of going a step further on a common security policy.</P>
    <P>The prospect of the Twelve elaborating a common foreign and security policy has aroused public interest, as this debate demonstrates.  Security is a broad concept. There is more to it than military defence.  Increased force alone does not lead to security.  The security we now enjoy in Europe has been brought about by a reduction in tension and an increase in co-operation.  We have never felt that our security was guaranteed by an arms race between two military blocs in Europe, which now thankfully, has ended.  Nor, in our view, has the world been made more secure by the doctrine of nuclear deterrence.  We are very happy to see the military stand-off in Europe coming to an end at last.</P>
    <P>In this context the CSCE is of special importance.  As its name says, it deals with security as well as co-operation in Europe.  All of the Twelve participate in it and act together there as Twelve.  The CSCE is an important framework for relations in Europe and has made a very significant contribution to the reduction <Col N="1076" /> of tensions in Europe.  I believe, as do our partners in the Twelve, that the CSCE Summit in Paris in November will make a decisive contribution to strengthening stability and co-operation in Europe and to disarmament.  The CSCE has never, of course, been exclusive of reciprocal arrangements for security in Europe.</P>
    <P>I have given some idea of the extent to which security for us is a concept which cannot simply be equated with military defence.  That is a view reflected in the position of many of our partners among The Twelve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Barry also raised the issue of security and what that might comprise.  The Taoiseach did say that the defence or military aspects would not be the subject of a common security policy for some time to come.  The process of integration under the heading of a common foreign and security policy must be seen as a gradual one.  Indeed the conclusions of the European Council themselves specify that the content and detailed rule for the role of the union in securities here will have to be defined gradually in the light of the various aspects covered by this concept and without prejudice to the obligations arising out of the security arrangement to which member states are party.  A number of our partners consider that a distinction should be drawn between security policy in the broad sense and defence policy which should, for the time being, be dealt with in NATO and WEU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1077" /> The Government agree that such a distinction should be drawn and we shall approach the Intergovernmental Conference from this perspective.  This point should also be made in response to Deputy Ferris' comment about joining NATO or any other military pact.  There is no suggestion being made that Ireland should join NATO or any other military pact.  The Italian proposal that the WEU and the Community should be merged is not one that Ireland, or indeed a number of other member states, consider acceptable or appropriate.  In general, however, I would like to emphasise that what is happening at present is the preparation of the Intergovernmental Conference, that is, a clarification of what the issues are that will be negotiated during the IGC.  The negotiations will begin then and continue in the course of next year, the Intergovernmental Conference, having set its own agenda as is agreed.  In the meantime the views of Deputies as conveyed to the House today will be taken into account in our preparations for the Conference.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa expressed his agreement with some of the Taoiseach's views in the context of a common security policy.  Of course, disarmament should be included.  I assure him also that the Government agree that Ireland should not be neutered instead of being neutral. It is generally accepted that the outcome of the IGC should be one Community. Ireland will not accept a Community in which we would habitually opt out on certain questions while being bound by the decisions of others.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa's comments on the CSCE and the UN were very interesting. However, these are issues which go wider than the Twelve and will not be negotiated in the IGC.  I said that many of our partners consider that security is a wider concept than that of defence.</P>
    <P>These partners too consider that military defence should remain the prerogative of the Western European Union and/or the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.  That is their right, as was recognised in the Single European Act. <Col N="1078" /> There are certainly those among the Twelve who wish to see a coming together of the European Community and the Western European Union. However, Ireland is not alone in dissenting from that idea and, even among those who would like to see it come about, it is being viewed as an unrealistic goal for now.</P>
    <P>I am not surprised that that assessment is being made now that the subject is being closely examined.  There is a consensus on a common foreign and security policy as an objective.  Defining what might be such a policy in the security area for the Twelve as such is clearly going to require more effort on the part of all involved.  Therefore, more preparation is foreseen and the details will, of course, have to be worked out in the Intergovernmental Conference itself.</P>
    <P>There is recognition of the fact that individual member states have existing obligations, including military commitments, that go outside the Twelve. Furthermore, among the Twelve there are two nuclear powers, eleven of the Twelve are parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, two of the Twelve hold seats as permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.  This gives some idea of the diversity of positions which will need to be accommodated if we are serious about defining and implementing a common foreign and security policy.  The content and detailed rules for the role of the Union in the security sphere will have to be defined gradually in the light of the various aspects covered by this concept and without prejudice to the obligations arising out of the security arrangements to which member states are party.  Ireland is therefore only being practical and realistic when we say it is necessary to define clearly what is meant by a security policy for the Twelve as such.</P>
    <P>A major feature of security in our view is a reduction of tension in Europe and elsewhere.  Of course we have to look at other realistic components of a common foreign and security policy. Some of the suggestions that have been <Col N="1079" /> made &mdash; and they are in an early stage of gestation &mdash; are the industrial and technological development of defence equipment, disarmament and arms control, non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, control of arms exports, control of exports of sophisticated defence technology, UN-sponsored initiatives of a peace-keeping and peace-enforcing nature.</P>
    <P>These are suggestions which raise some important questions.  In particular, any policy concept that regulates Twelve action in those fields could not be imported from outside the Twelve: it would have to be developed by the Twelve themselves, for themselves.</P>
    <P>We have every interest in the idea of the Twelve formulating a common policy on non-proliferation.  One of the achievements of our Presidency was to secure a declaration on nuclear non-proliferation by the European Council in June.  The Twelve's commitment on that occasion to the maintenance of an effective international nuclear non-proliferation regime was an important step forward. The principle of general and complete disarmament has already been subscribed to by all of the Twelve at the United Nations.  It should be realistic to expect that the further elaboration of it could constitute a real component part of any security policy evolved by the Twelve. As I have said, however, a commitment to act in such areas as Twelve carries the implication that it will be in accordance with a Twelve concept.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that UN-sponsored initiatives of a peace-keeping or peace-enforcing nature might be dealt with in the framework of a common foreign and security policy is one worth considering. At first glance one might expect that it would appeal to this country since we have a tradition of strong support for UN-sponsored initiatives.  However, if it is envisaged that the Twelve, as Twelve, would be formulating proposals for action in the UN framework, we would need to be very clear about what those proposals might involve.  For example, account would have to be taken when it <Col N="1080" /> comes to peace enforcement that two of the Twelve hold permanent seats on the Security Council.  In addition there would need to be agreement on the interpretation of the Charter of the United Nations, agreement on the types of action permitted by the charter and the circumstances in which they could be undertaken.</P>
    <P>I have until now talked of the concept of security in the international domain, which is certainly the popular perception of the subject.  However, I do not think that the debate will necessarily be confined to international security but may also consider security within the Community, including for example, how the Twelve might more effectively combat major transnational crime like drugs and terrorism.  There is, of course, established co-operation between the Twelve in these areas and it can undoubtedly be developed further.</P>
    <P>The negotiation on the Intergovernmental Conference will not begin until December.  I do not wish to pre-empt those negotiations but have attempted to give Deputies an idea of what might be addressed under the heading of a common foreign and security policy.</P>
    <P>One issue which it will be necessary for the IGC to address will be the manner in which decisions are to be taken both as regards what constitutes a common foreign and security policy and how that policy is to be implemented.</P>
    <P>Proposals have been put forward for either the continued use of the consensus principle or for the qualifying of the consensus rule in some manner in order to permit decisions to be taken in spite of the disagreement of one or more member states.  It is our view that realistically the consensus rule will continue to apply in the domain of European political co-operation. It would be hard to imagine decisions being taken by any other method in respect of any area being brought within the competence of Community machinery for the first time.</P>
    <P>Attention has focussed on the ideal of a common security policy but there are other important matters which will be <Col N="1081" /> addressed, and I expect successfully, at the IGC.  In the Irish Presidency we took practical steps to bring the Community and European political co-operation into a more effective working relationship. We want to see this carried significantly further in the IGC.  There are many organisational measures which could be envisaged as a means of improving the effectiveness of the foreign policy process, for example, the creation of a suitable structure to deal with crises when they arise.</P>
    <P>Many of you will be familiar with the European Parliament's Martin Report to which I have already referred and which calls, among other things, for appropriate use of the missions of the Community and its member states in third countries and for the functions of the EPC Secretariat to be absorbed by the Commission and the Council.</P>
    <P>Collaboration between the Twelve's diplomatic services in other countries and reinforced secretariats are practical proposals but nonetheless important and I am sure there will be more proposals of this nature for the IGC to address.  All of these proposed measures are practical and give rise to few problems of principle. We shall accordingly be approaching such proposals in a pragmatic spirit, prepared to agree on the arrangements which are most effective and efficient, once the issues of principle in regard to scope and decision-making are decided.</P>
    <P>I have given some idea of the extent to which security for us is a concept which cannot simply be equated with military defence.  That is a view reflected in the position of many of our partners among the Twelve.  At the Rome European Council at the weekend there was real optimism about the Community's ability to meet the historic challenge of political union.  We should share that optimism as we look at the period ahead.  It is not just a challenge to be faced but an opportunity to be seized.</P>
    <P>The idea of a committee to examine the implications of political union and economic monetary union has been mentioned by several speakers.  This morning the Taoiseach suggested that the Committee <Col N="1082" /> on Secondary Legislation of the EC might be an appropriate forum for this work.  In this connection I would recall that the committee has on previous occasions determined that it has the power to examine such questions as the European Parliament's draft Treaty establishing European Union, the Spinelli Treaty and the Single European Act. When Deputy Collins, Minister for Foreign Affairs, was the chairman they produced detailed reports on both of these. It is something on which the current chairman might like to reflect.</P>
    <P>How then should Ireland face into the period ahead and, in particular, into the two Intergovernmental Conferences?  In his statement, the Taoiseach has drawn attention to some of the key issues which we must address and has given a clear indication of the broad approach which the Government intend to adopt in the preparatory stages and in the negotiations proper.  He has outlined the basic principles behind our approach.</P>
    <P>I believe that Ireland should look to the future, first, with optimism that the Community is about to take a further significant step on the path towards European union.  The importance of our membership of the Community to our economy and the benefits which we derive from the operation of common policies means that our position of net beneficiary should be consolidated and enhanced as a result of present moves towards fuller integration.</P>
    <P>Secondly, we should regard the future with confidence that Ireland, more particularly our businessmen, our workers, and our farmers, will continue to seize the opportunities afforded by the Community.  These opportunities may present themselves differently in the future but will ultimately be enhanced by the two Intergovernmental Conferences, by the enlarged Community following German unification and by the advent of 1992.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, we should move forward with realism, since the success of the Community has always been based on an imagination firmly rooted in the real world in which we live, on limited but <Col N="1083" /> significant steps in the right direction rather than giant steps into the void. Ireland, as always, will approach the challenges ahead and in particular the questions which will be posed by the two Intergovernmental Conferences with a pragmatic, serious application of our imagination.  We will look at each matter which arises and ask objectively whether it is in our interests and whether it is in the interests of the Community.  I thank the Deputies and I hope they found this elaboration to be of value.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies who have been waiting to raise matters on the Adjournment for their patience.  Deputy Alan Shatter has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the position of Romanian children and other foreign children adopted outside Ireland by Irish couples, and the subject matter of a recent question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In the last five years there has been a dramatic decrease in the number of adoption orders made by the Adoption Board.  For over 20 years, over 1,000 children each year were adopted through the Adoption Acts in this country.  There has been a seed change in this to the extent that in 1988 only 649 adoption orders were made and in 1989, 615 adoption orders were made.  In the context of the 1988-89 figures one-third of the adoption orders made were made <Col N="1084" /> in favour of relations of the child adopted &mdash; for example, a natural mother jointly adopting her own child with her husband. This, in practice, has meant that during each of the last two years no more than 400 childless couples each year have been able to adopt.  The number of adoption orders we made in favour of childless couples in the year 1990, I would estimate, is probably in the region of 375. That has meant that couples in Ireland who wish to adopt are looking to the possibility of adopting abroad.</P>
      <P>In recent years some couples have adopted children in South American countries, India and elsewhere.  A dramatic example of the search made by young Irish couples to adopt was seen this year when in a period of ten months over 50 Irish couples made their way to Romania to adopt children.  It is my belief that every week at least one or two couples make the trip to Romania.  There is a major problem in this area, that we have no laws which set out the legal position of children adopted abroad. Children adopted in Romania by Irish couples going through the proper Romanian legal system come home to Ireland but under Irish law they are not regarded as having been properly adopted or as having any relationship to their adoptive parents and they have none of the inheritance rights which children adopted under Irish law would have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Major practical problems will arise in a number of areas, one of which was brought to the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Question No. 39 yesterday when I asked him what arrangements would be made to ensure that Irish passports would be made available to the 50 or so Romanian children adopted so far.  The response I got from the Minister could best be described as a piece of bureaucratic gobbledegook which ensures that the children adopted from Romania will be locked into a sort of legal limbo or legal twilight zone. Indeed I received no assurances that this issue would be properly tackled when I asked the Taoiseach yesterday if the Government would implement the Law <Col N="1085" /> Reform Commission's recommendations of June 1989 on the recognition of Romanian adoption orders.</P>
    <P>The reply on the issue of passports was that if a couple come back from Romania with a child they have adopted in that country, the child can seek Irish naturalisation and, under certain conditions, the Department of Justice will make that child an Irish citizen.  The reply did not say what the conditions were.  It went on to say that even if the child was made an Irish citizen, a passport would not be issued without the consent of the child's parents, the child's guardians under Irish law.  That means that in effect none of these children will be able to get Irish passports until they attain the age of 18 years because under Irish law the parents who have adopted them in Romania are not regarded as parents or as guardians of their children.</P>
    <P>The reason I raise this matter today is to ask the Government to take immediate action to tackle this problem.  I would ask them to implement the report of the Law Reform Commission, which provides that legislation should be enacted to give recognition to foreign adoption orders.  I would ask that the Minister for Health be given power to designate the countries whose adoption orders we recognise.  I would ask that new legislation retrospectively recognise and give validity to adoption orders obtained by all Irish couples up to the time of its enactment, under the proper judicial system of foreign countries.  There is a need for the Department of Foreign Affairs to make special provision to ensure that parents who have gone to Romania to adopt young children do not experience difficulties in obtaining passports for the children they have brought home to Ireland, whom they regard as part of their family and are giving a home to in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is another need in the context of adopting abroad.  When you go through a proper legal system abroad, be it in Romania, South America or anywhere else, the foreign courts require social worker assessments of the parents. <Col N="1086" /> Health boards currently are not co-operating with Irish couples providing such social assessment reports.  I would ask the Minister for Health to direct health boards to provide such reports.</P>
    <P>Thank you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this matter.  In one final sentence I would say that this problem will not be resolved if it remains a matter that has to go through the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Justice and the Department of Health.  The current unco-ordinated approach to this issue means nothing will be done.  A single Minister should be given the responsibility for implementing the action programme in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Deputy Shatter for having raised this very important matter.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked a parliamentary question this week regarding the grant of passports to children adopted by Irish parents in Romania.  As the Deputy is aware Irish passport facilities are granted only to Irish citizens.  All applicants are required to produce evidence of such citizenship. Usually this is in the form of an Irish birth certificate.  In addition in the case of minors, that is children under 18 years of age, the Passport Office requires that written witnessed evidence of the parents or legal guardians consent is produced. In some cases a court order may exist relating to the legal custody of the child.  In such cases the requirements for consent are modified to meet the terms of the order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of adopted minors the situation is more complicated.  The Irish citizenship of minors adopted under the Irish Adoption Act of 1952 by Irish parents, is governed by the terms of section II of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956.  This section bestows <Col N="1087" /> citizenship automatically on such children. Applications for passport facilities on behalf of such minors should be accompanied by a copy of the relevant adoption order.  The written witnessed consent of the persons nominated as guardians in the order is acceptable.</P>
    <P>In the case of minors who are adopted under non-Irish law, into which category the children adopted in Romania fall, they must also meet our requirements.  On the issue of citizenship the only way in which such children can become Irish citizens is via the naturalisation process laid down in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts, 1956 and 1986.  As Deputies are probably aware the Minister for Justice has sole responsibility for the administration of the relevant section of these Acts.  I understand that he is prepared to consider applications for citizenship via naturalisation for such minors subject to certain conditions.  I would suggest that the Deputy might pursue any inquiries which he may have in this context with my colleague, the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>Of course, a certificate of naturalisation granted by the Minister for Justice establishes the Irish citizenship of the holder and is acceptable by the Passport Office for its requirements under this heading.</P>
    <P>Applications in respect of minors who are adopted under non-Irish law must satisfy our requirements for the written witnessed consent of the child's legal guardians.  In the case of children adopted in Romania, or indeed anywhere outside Ireland, such consent can only be accepted from persons whose legal status as guardian is recognised under Irish law. The Passport Office would, of course, be guided in such matters by the current law on the subject.</P>
    <P>As indicated in the answer to the parliamentary question no application for passport facilites in respect of children adopted in Romania have so far been received and hence no passport facilities have been extended in respect of such children.  I will bear in mind Deputy Shatter's comments on this matter.</P>

    <Col N="1088" />
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>On Tuesday last, 30 October, I spoke to three of the Birmingham Six prisoners, Paddy Hill, Billy Power and Dick McIlkenny in Gartree Prison in England.  The Minister, and the House, are already well informed of the very grave injustice perpetrated on the Birmingham Six by the British courts, the British police and the British prison authorities.  The prisoners have this month completed their 16th year in prison for a crime they did not commit.</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann has accepted their complete innocence and the fact that they should be released.  Other Deputies and I have raised their case in the past with successive Ministers for Foreign Affairs and those Ministers, including the present one, have made representations to the British authorities.  Despite all this the six men are fearful that they will be forced to spend this Christmas &mdash; their 17th successive one &mdash; behind British prison bars.  The prisoners to whom I spoke say that they cannot endure another year in prison; they say that the Devon and Cornwall police investigation into the West Midland Serious Crime Squad has produced the most conclusive evidence yet that they are innocent and that a police conspiracy, based on falsified police interviews, was one of the main factors which caused their original conviction.</P>
      <P>When the Devon and Cornwall Inquiry findings were given to the British Home Secretary he took only days to refer their case to the Appeal Court.  Now, with the same evidence available to the DPP, he has indicated the men will have to wait until after the final report of the Devon and Cornwall Inquiry has been completed before any decision can be reached.  This would, envitably, put any decision on their release back well into 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prisoners very strongly believe that the available evidence is now so conclusive in their favour that they should be released immediately.  The prisoners are adamant that it is no longer acceptable for the Irish Government to voice <Col N="1089" /> expressions of concern on their behalf. Expressions of concern have not helped them in the past and &mdash; they say &mdash; will not help them now.  The prisoners want the Irish Government to make immediate and direct contact with the British Government to demand that they be released now and that this demand should be based on the evidence available to the British Government arising from the Devon and Cornwall police inquiry.</P>
    <P>The prisoners also state that their defence solicitors are being impeded in their preparations for a new appeal by the Crown Prosecution Service not making available any documentation in the two months since the Home Secretary referred their case to the Appeal Court. The prisoners believe this is a clear indication that a political conspiracy against them is continuing and that attempts are being made to minimise the impact and repercussions on the British judicial establishment which their inevitable release will bring.</P>
    <P>The prisoners expressed their very deep disappointment that the Taoiseach and the Government did not make any efforts on their behalf during Ireland's term of the European Presidency and at the fact that the Irish official delegation to the Conference on Security and Co-Operation did not assist in any way the non-Governmental organisation representing the Birmingham Six at that conference, but then afterwards hypocritically claimed that they had facilitated the Birmingham Six organisation in every way possible.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister now tell the House the last occasion on which the Irish Government raised the Birmingham Six case with the British Government and if there are specific intentions to raise this appalling injustice in the immediate future as requested by the prisoners and as I have outlined?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary) Sean Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the Government's firm position on this case reflects the broadly based, non-partisan desire of this House to have justice secured for the Birmingham Six, who, it <Col N="1090" /> must be remembered, will shortly have completed 16 years in prison.  I should like, therefore, to commend the many Deputies who have maintained an active and continuing interest in this important case, whose support and concern have been of importance to the Government in presenting their views to the British authorities.</P>
      <P>In a little more than a year, there have been a number of unprecedented developments in certain cases involving Irish cases in Britain, cases which date from the seventies and which have been of the deepest concern to the Government. Deputies will have shared the Government's great relief and satisfaction at the quashing of the convictions of the Guildford Four, and at the encouraging announcements, arising out of the May inquiry, made by the British Director of Public Prosecutions and the Home Secretary in relation to the Maguire family and their friends.  As Deputies will be aware, the Birmingham Six case dates from the same period as the other two and shares with them many of the same disturbing features.</P>
      <P>Before going on to the substance of the debate, I should say that the Birmingham Six case is now before the courts and this will inevitably limit the scope of my remarks.</P>
      <P>When the Home Secretary announced on 29 August that he was referring the Birmingham Six case to the Court of Appeal, the Taoiseach, in welcoming this decision, expressed the Government's hope that, in the interest of justice, this protracted case also was at last close to a satisfactory solution.  While the Home Secretary's statement made it clear that his decision was taken on the basis of a particular aspect of the case, the effect of that decision is that the whole case is now once more before the court, where it will be treated as an appeal by each of the six men.  It will, therefore, be open to each of the six to raise with the Court of Appeal any matter which they consider relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the moment, the question of the timing of the appeal hearing is in the hands of the British Director of Public <Col N="1091" /> Prosecutions, who is, as in this country, an independent law officer.  The Government will continue, however, to convey to the British authorities their wish for the earliest possible resolution of the case.  In this regard, the Government's views and concerns have been most recently conveyed to the British authorities through the Anglo-Irish Inter-governmental Conference.</P>
    <P>I regret that Deputy Gregory has decided to be polemical about the Government's activities in support of the Birmingham Six.  In saying this, I do, of course, understand the frustration and impatience of men imprisoned for 16 years for crimes which, it is widely believed, they did not commit.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be fully aware of the active role of the Government in seeking justice on behalf of the Birmingham Six. We have repeatedly and forcefully conveyed our views and concerns about this issue to the British authorities at the highest level.  The Taoiseach has, for instance, raised the matter with the British Prime Minister.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has discussed the case with the Home Secretary, the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  The Minister for Justice has, likewise, raised the case with his British opposite number.  We have also, when we considered it appropriate, raised the case in the international context, including at the United Nations General Assembly.</P>
    <P>The Government have also been extremely concerned about the prison conditions of the men; in this regard, we welcomed their reclassification last year from category A to category B.  On instructions, officials of the Embassy in London have been making regular visits on a structured basis to the men and have done everything possible to ensure their welfare.  The embassy has also facilitated prison visits by a number of Deputies to the Six &mdash; including most recently, I am happy to say, a visit by Deputy Gregory.</P>
    <P>To sum up, the Government have consistently conveyed to the British authorities over a period of years their serious <Col N="1092" /> concern about the convictions of the Birmingham Six, and their strong view that a complete review of the case was urgently required.  We welcomed as an important development the referral of the case to the Court of Appeal, arising out of the Devon and Cornwall police investigation. We now fervently hope, as the Minister said in his address to the United Nations General Assembly on 26 September last, that there will be a satisfactory resolution of this case at the earliest possible date. Deputies can be assured that this strong and consistent position will be conveyed to the British authorities on a continuing basis.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for accepting my request to have this matter raised.  This subject interests many people particularly those involved in social welfare &mdash; the Dublin Welfare Office, the Association of the Unemployed and the social partners &mdash; who have been involved with the Government, various political parties and so on. Recently the Minister for Social Welfare announced Christmas bonuses to be paid to a large segment of social welfare recipients. Unfortunately this year, like every other year, people in social employment schemes were excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Labour announced in the region of 15,000 extra jobs to be created through the social employment schemes.  We are aware of the extraordinarily good work done in communities by people on social employment schemes.  When these schemes were recently approved by the national monitoring committee a large number of the people interviewed for participation in <Col N="1093" /> the schemes raised questions in relation to the payment of the Christmas bonus. This is a very important payment particularly for families at a time of the year when the budget of social welfare recipients is at its lowest.  I appeal to the Minister for Social Welfare and to the Minister for Labour to ensure that people participating in these schemes are not discriminated against vis-a-vis social welfare benefits.  As it is, they do not have free fuel or butter vouchers and they do not have disability benefit paid to them in the event of their getting sick.  Because the funding for this is from the EC I hope the Minister in his wisdom will include workers on social employment schemes in the Christmas bonus payments as the amount of money is very small compared to the good it would do.  At a maximum 15,000 people would be involved and the consequences of that goodwill gesture would be considerable.  It would be appreciated by those people and their families.  My case rests in pleading with the Minister to actively consider a genuine request from those of us who have been trying to stimulate activity in this area so that we will not have people on the unemployment register while large amounts of community work need to be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern) Bertie Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Christmas bonus is payable to persons in receipt of long term social welfare payments and to persons who are long term unemployed and in receipt of unemployment compensation payments, also to persons who are in receipt of payments which are directly linked to the rates of unemployment payments.  Participants in the social employment scheme are in receipt of payments which are not directly linked to the unemployment payments they were receiving while they were on the Live Register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of payment on the scheme is pitched above that which such persons would be entitled to had they remained on social welfare.  The clear intention at all times was that the added increased payments compensated for the loss of added benefits such as the Christmas <Col N="1094" /> bonus which persons might be entitled to had they remained on the Live Register.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, I announced increases in the rates payable under the scheme.  The rate payable to participants without dependants increased from £65 per week to £69 per week, the rate for an adult dependant increased from £27 per week to £29.50 per week and the rate for a child dependant increased from up to £10 per week per child to up to £11 per week per child.</P>
    <P>I introduced the child dependant allowance at the beginning of this year to encourage greater numbers of older long term unemployed to participate in the scheme.  At the end of 1989 only 30 per cent of participants had dependants. However, at the end of August, because of the availability of the child dependant allowance, the percentage of participants with adults and child dependants has increased to 48 per cent.</P>
    <P>Like all politicians I would like to be in a position to increase the payments to persons depending on social welfare or manpower programme payments for a living.  At the same time I must also act in a responsible way by having regard to the capacity of the Exchequer to make such payments and I am using the funds made available to me for the social employment scheme to provide opportunities for the long term unemployed on the basis of normal weekly payments. This year over 11,000 people will participate in the scheme.</P>
    <P>The scheme provides the opportunity for persons who have been long term unemployed to become involved in a work related situation, albeit on a part time basis, for one year.  The projects undertaken are of significant benefit to local communities.  It is generally accepted that participation in the scheme is worth while and helps the long term unemployed to improve their prospects of obtaining employment when opportunities become available.  I do not disagree with the points made by Deputy Ferris.  It is a matter of Exchequer funding and of what we get from the European Social Fund.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1095" /> Last year, with the trade union monitoring committee, I undertook to look at some improvements in the scheme and from that commitment arose the £10 per child which is significant because people with three or four children who would not be in the scheme before now get from £30 to £40.  That has had a desirable effect.  We have also changed a number of other criteria arrangements.  Submissions have been put forward in the discussions on the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> not only on this aspect but on other aspects and I have agreed to look at the proposals.  It is unlikely that that would make any difference for this year, but there will be changes in the overall scheme if a programme is agreed.</P>

In reply to a further Dáil Question today I discovered that there are 5,300 taxpayers whose tax affairs are embargoed in the office of the Inspector of Taxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I rise because the reply I got yesterday was unsatisfactory.  I want to ask the Minister, first, when this couple's affairs will <Col N="1096" /> be sorted out; second, when they will get their rebate; and, third, when they will get the interest accruing on the rebate to which they are entitled.  May I suggest to the Minister that if the tax affairs of 3,500 taxpayers are in chaos the very least the Revenue Commissioners should do is write to them individually and explain the reasons for the problems.  It should not be left to us to resolve the issue by way of a Dáil Question.</P>

      <P>I wish to propose the decentralisation of Government offices to Tuam.  I hope that when the Government are next deciding on the centres to which offices will be decentralised that they decide to locate a Department or a section of it in Tuam.</P>
      <P>There has been a serious unemployment problem in Tuam for some time &mdash; 1,500 people are unemployed in the greater Tuam area.  Five hundred permanent and temporary jobs were lost in the area when the sugar factory closed down in 1986.  Later on, the Coca Cola plant and the textile factory closed down while the Goodman project which was to be set up in Tuam was not set up there. Many of the people who are unemployed in the area have very good skills which they acquired when they worked in the sugar factory.  I ask the Government to look at the suitability of Tuam as a centre for decentralisation.  There are five second level schools in Tuam and those young people will be looking for jobs when they leave school.  I hope the Government will come down in favour of Tuam as an area for decentralisation.  It is a very attractive town in which to live and it is situated near a university and third level colleges.</P>

      <P>The matter I wish to raise relates to the cost of implementing the proposed privatisation of Irish Life. At the time the ill advised Bill was put through the House I offered the opinion that the financial institutions would be the main beneficiaries and would make a financial killing.  I want to ask the Minister if he will comment on a recent report in a Sunday newspaper that the cost of <Col N="1097" /> underwriting and professional fees will total £6 million.  Specifically, in relation to the reference I made during the debate, on the presumption that the Government's favourite financial consultants, NCB, would be recruited, and I now see that on the basis of old friends are best they do indeed have such a role in advising the Government, may I ask him how much NCB will get out of this little nixer for the Government?</P>

      <P>My request is to the Minister of State at the Department of Finance who has responsibility for public works, including wildlife.  I ask him to consider the simple proposition of transferring to the Garda Síochána the processing of applications for foreshore and inland water shooting permits because of the undue delay in the processing of those permits within the Department.  There seems to be no reason the Garda who issue certificates for the guns used by the people who apply for these permits would not be the agency who process the applications for the permits.  They would have time and the people who would be involved would, perhaps, know more about this issue than those in the Department. It would certainly get over the difficulties in that section of the Department of Finance which has a shortage of staff.  I ask the Minister to consider this very simple proposition.</P>

      <P>The river Moy in County Mayo is one of the finest fishing rivers in Europe.  Large tracts of this river have been under private and foreign ownership for several hundred years.  One of the last acts of the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition in 1987 was to purchase the very lucrative stretch of the Moy River in Ballina.  That was over three years ago but there is still no development plan. This part of the river has lain idle and is under-developed and under-resourced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The North Western Regional Fisheries Board have made several submissions to the Minister and his predecessor on this matter.  I have asked several questions in the House about it and have received numerous assurances that a plan is <Col N="1098" /> imminent.  This asset which has enormous potential could be a central and major part of the development of a region devastated by unemployment and emigration. It is a scandal that nothing has been done to develop it and I urge the Minister to bring forward a plan at the earliest possible date.</P>

As the Minister is aware we are now into the stormy weather of the winter when the lives of fishermen and people who travel by sea are put at risk.

      <P>My second request is directed to the Minister for the Marine. When does the Minister propose to meet with the Howth Fishermen's Association to discuss with them the six point agenda they submitted to him, together with a request for a meeting, earlier this year? I wrote to the Minister on 24 July reminding him of this request and asked him to consider it.  I received an acknowledgment from him on 24 September 1990.  However, because I have not received an affirmative answer from the Minister to date I now want to ask him when he will meet with the Howth Fishermen's Association.  Howth is the second richest port in the country and the Howth Fishermen's Association is a legally constituted representative association who have very legitimate points to raise and discuss with the Minister.  The Minister's predecessor visited the area and I should now like to extend an invitation to the Minister to come to Howth and meet with the fishermen there to discuss their future prospects.</P>

      <P>Deputy Kitt raised the question of the decentralisation of Government offices to Tuam.  I suppose Deputy Treacy has an interest in this matter also.  I will not go through my long reply because I would take up some of my colleague's time.  The first and second programmes of decentralisation are going ahead.  These have proven to be very beneficial to the locations that were chosen.  The reason certain locations were chosen was the availability of sites in the first instance and advance planning.  We all recall that the Government who succeeded us set us back years in relation to decentralisation. We are going ahead with this programme and many centres have been opened.  The remainder are either being built or at the planning stage.  Tuam, along with 40 other locations, was considered but was not chosen.  However it will be considered when the next phase comes up for discussion. I am also considering the possibility of decentralising the Ordnance Survey Office and setting up small regional centres around the country and Tuam will be considered in this regard and in regard to other opportunities for decentralisation that may arise.</P>

    <P>In reply to Deputy McCartan who raised the issue of wildlife services, approximately 320 applications have been received this year while 287 permissions have been granted under section 30 of the Wildlife Act, 1976.  Thirty <Col N="1102" /> applications are still with local management for examination, which covers the suitability of the applicant and whether the lake is a State lake, wild fowl sanctury or nature reserve.  On average it takes three to four weeks to process each application.  Even though one application has been refused this year, I am satisfied that the existing arrangements are working satisfactorily and I have no plans to consider alternative arrangements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick West):</i> In relation to the matter raised by Deputy J. Higgins, two separate questions arise; first, the management of the salmon fishery on the Moy which is owned by my Department and, second, the general development of the River Moy system which is a matter for the local regional board.  My Department purchased the commercial and rod salmon fishery in the lower reaches of the River Moy in the environs of Ballina three years ago.  Known as the Moy Fishery, it was formerly operated by the Moy Fishery Company, a private concern, and was in a considerably dilapidated condition when it came into State ownership.</P>
      <P>My Department have been responsible since 1987 for the day-to-day management of the fishery and there has been a vast improvement in all aspects of the fishery.  We have, in addition, been examining in detail how the long term development of the fishery could best be managed.  In this regard we have been looking at detailed development requirements and alternative management arrangements.  As regards the latter I have received the views of the local regional fisheries board and have also raised the matter with the Central Fisheries Board.  I am glad to say that we will soon be in a position to make a fully considered decision in this matter with a view to optimising the long term benefits to the region of this valuable fishery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the second issue of the general development of the Moy system, this is principally a matter for the local <Col N="1103" /> regional fisheries board acting in co-operation with the various owners involved.</P>
    <P>In relation to the matter raised by Deputy Taylor-Quinn, as the Deputy is aware, the committee set up to examine the air-sea search and rescue service made six main recommendations in their report.  My Department invited tenders for the supply of a search and rescue helicopter service, to be based at Shannon Airport.  The closing date for the receipt of tenders was 23 October 1990. The contract specification required that the helicopter service be in place by 1 January 1991.  I have established a helicopter contract group, which is chaired by the Secretary of my Department, to examine the tenders received and to advise me on the placing of the contract. I expect the group to report on these complex tenders as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the new division is primarily an integration and reorganisation of existing services.  The co-ordination of local marine emergencies will be devolved to rescue sub-centres at the coast radio stations at Valentia and Malin Head and a new sub-centre to be <Col N="1104" /> established in Dublin.  This new regional structure will enable more local knowledge to be brought to bear on emergencies, the integration of marine communications and co-ordination facilities and the devotion of much larger personnel resources to emergency response.</P>
    <P>My Department have also identified the equipment requirements for the new structure.  The key element in establishing the new structure is the recruitment of a director for the new service. This and other personnel aspects are being pursued with the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>Finally, in reply to Deputy McCartan, the proposed meeting was deferred until the harbour development programme which we recently announced was finalised. That programme includes improvements costing £800,000 at Howth.  We will be happy to discuss this and other matters with the Howth Fishermen's Association on a date to be arranged.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.55 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 13 November 1990.</P>

      <P>The scope, structure and level of indirect taxes as they apply to consumer goods and services are generally kept under regular review.  The annual budget is the normal medium for implementing any policy changes considered necessary.</P>
      <P>Revenue from petroleum products is raised through a combination of excise duty and VAT.  Excise duty is raised on the volume of product at specific rates of duty.  These rates vary depending on the use and nature of the product.  VAT is levied on the excise-inclusive price of petroleum products.  This regime of taxes on petroleum products is the norm for the member states of the EC and is envisaged in the Commission's 1992 proposals as broadly continuing following completion of the Community Single Market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taxation of petroleum products is a very important source of revenue for the Exchequer and, as I have said, is regularly reviewed in the most appropriate context for consideration of these <Col N="1021" /> matters.  I am satisfied that the existing regime is operating efficiently.</P>

    <P>Apart from the schemes covered by the above circulars special arrangements exist for the grant of special leave for the following purposes: to take up a position with European Communities or other international organisations; to serve overseas with missionary or charitable organisations; to serve with voluntary <Col N="1022" /> social, cultural or charitable organisations in this country; for isolation after contact with infectious diseases; for short term assignments to other public sector organisations; for court attendance, for members of local authorities to attend meetings; to represent Ireland at major international sporting events abroad; and to set up an employment generating scheme in Ireland.</P>
    <P>While each individual scheme includes specific qualifying conditions, the over-riding criteria which apply to special leave schemes in general are, as follows: the grant of special leave must at all times be subject to the exigencies of the public service; the purpose for which special leave is granted must be compatible with the recipient's position in State employment; and civil servants on special leave retain their civil service status.  During the period of special leave they remain subject to the provisions of the Civil Service Regulations Acts, 1956 and 1958, and any other regulations governing the conduct of civil servants particularly those relating to civil servants and politics.</P>
    <P>As the grant of special leave must be subject at all times to the exigencies of the work this may result in certain grades within a particular Department or Departments being excluded from the purview of such special leave schemes from time to time.</P>
    <P>Departments or offices have the delegated power to refuse special leave arrangements to staff because of the exigencies of the work either at their own discretion or in consultation with my Department depending on the nature of the special leave being sought.  Accordingly, it is not possible to say in respect of special leave schemes generally which individual departments or offices have declined to release staff because of the exigencies of the work.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the Dublin tax district which deals with non-PAYE taxpayers is six months behind with the processing of queries arising out of assessments raised in the tax year 1989-90; the reason for this delay; if he will outline the action he intends to take to rectify this situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>Practically all tax returns for 1989-90 have been processed by this time. Dublin tax district has been under considerable pressure in dealing with correspondence resulting from the processing of these returns.  These difficulties are not matched in any other district.  Most country districts are effectively up to date, with small manageable levels of correspondence in others.</P>
      <P>The large volume of correspondence has arisen primarily due to the system of assessment which applied for years of assessment up to and including 1989-90. Under this system some incomes, e.g. trades, were assessable on the basis of income of the year preceding the year of assessment while other sources, e.g. dividend incomes, were assessable on the basis of the income of the year of assessment. This mixed basis of assessment resulted in two years returns being necessary to finalise the liability for one year for a significant number of taxpayers. Accordingly, the processing of the 1989-90 tax returns resulted in revised assessments for 1988-89 as well as assessments for 1989-90 in a large number of cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The transition to self-assessment has <Col N="1024" /> itself generated an increase in the overall level of correspondence coming into districts. This is to be expected in the early stages as practitioners and taxpayers become accustomed to the new arrangements but is not expected to be a significant long term factor.</P>
    <P>The problem of the two years' returns being necessary to finalise liability for one year was addressed in Chapter II of this year's Finance Act.  Under this, the basis of assessment has been changed so that one return will determine the liability for a year for 1990-91 and future years &mdash; all income is assessable on the basis of the income of the year of assessment and this will be included in a return which will be completed after the end of the tax year. The doubling up of work which arose for back years, and particularly for 1988-89 and 1989-90, in Revenue offices will no longer arise.  This change will also help taxpayers and tax practitioners.  It is expected that the current year basis of assessment will bring about a big reduction in correspondence in future years.</P>
    <P>As part of on-going efforts being made to speed up the processing of returns and dealing with correspondence generally, Dublin tax district has been heavily computerised. The installation and widespread use of this equipment has led to certain difficulties and remedial work is in progress at the momemt.</P>
    <P>Other improvements were also introduced: revised work arrangements to deal with repayments were devised in March last but were only finally agreed by staff representatives in late August. These revised work arrangements are already having an effect on the speed at which repayments are handled.  Also, a revised scheme of work organisation has been agreed with staff representatives and this is in the course of implementation at the moment.  In addition, most of the resources previously allocated to the processing of returns are now engaged in dealing with queries, etc.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are conscious of the need to respond to taxpayers' queries quickly and without fuss. They are constantly examining their <Col N="1025" /> procedures with a view to eliminating, as far as possible, the need for practitioners and taxpayers to be in extended contact with their tax office.</P>
    <P>Present indications are that the arrears will be cleared within two months.</P>

      <P>The Government welcome the decision of the British Government to join the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) of the European Monetary System (EMS), as it should bring a welcome measure of stability to the exchange rate of sterling against the punt.  The future effects on border trade will depend on how the UK economy develops in this new situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Statistics on merchandise trade into and out of Ireland, including trade with Northern Ireland but excluding personal shopping, are compiled and published by <Col N="1026" /> the Central Statistics Office (CSO) from data collected by the Customs and Excise Service of the Revenue Commissioners. These statistics are monitored as part of the ongoing work of the Department of Finance and will continue to be so monitored. Merchandise trade with Northern Ireland last year accounted for over 5 per cent of our total exports and just 4 per cent of our imports.  The principal products exported to Northern Ireland were live animals, meat, dairy products, cereals, drinks, textiles and clothing; principal products imported were meat, dairy products, drinks and fertilisers.</P>
    <P>Sterling's entry into the ERM does not require any specific action in regard to merchandise trade, beyond the ongoing need to remain competitive in production.</P>
    <P>The other element in cross-Border trade is personal shopping which, because of its nature, is more difficult to measure.  However, a number of factors have combined to reduce to some extent the incentive to cross-Border shopping which reached its highest levels in the early to mid-eighties.  Our inflation rate has been well below that of the UK in recent years: from 1987 to 1989, the cumulative increase in our inflation rate was 9.6 per cent compared to an increase of 18.5 per cent in the UK in the same period.  In 1990, the expected increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), at around 3.5 per cent, will be less than half the expected increase, over 9 per cent, in the UK's Retail Prices Index (RPI).  The incentive for cross-Border shopping has been further reduced by the moves towards harmonisation of indirect taxes in this year's budget with the reduction of the standard VAT rate and the removal or reduction of certain excise duties.</P>
    <P>In addition, the imposition in 1987 of the 48-hour rule, whereby travellers' shopping allowances were restricted to those whose journey was in excess of 48 hours, had the desired impact of reducing cross-Border shopping.  This measure has been found to be in breach of our obligations under the EC Treaty by the <Col N="1027" /> European Court, and while the Government fully accept the court ruling, we are currently in negotiation with the Commission and our EC partners on a derogation from the full travellers' allowance regime which will prevent a recurrence of the abuses of allowances which occurred prior to 1987.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that Deputy Gay Mitchell wrote to the Inspector of Taxes dealing with the taxpayer's affairs on 12 September 1990.  A detailed reply setting out the taxpayer's entitlements from an exemption and an allowance point of view was issued to the Deputy on 25 September 1990 and a further copy of the reply has now been sent to the Deputy.  As the taxpayer's total income exceeds the relevant exemption limit of £4,350 she is not entitled to exemption from income tax for the year 1990-91, nor is she entitled to marginal relief.  The tax-free allowance certificate which was issued to the taxpayer on 19 April 1990, granting her a total tax-free allowance of £268, tax at Table A &mdash; 30 per cent &mdash; is correct: as her social welfare pension is paid in full without deduction of income tax, the tax attributable to it is collected under PAYE by restriction of her allowances against her pension from her employer by the estimated amount of her social welfare pension in the current year.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was awarded a widow's non-contributory pension at the maximum rate in September with effect from the date of her husband's death in June 1990.  Subsequently, she voluntarily surrendered her pension book indicating that she was being assessed for a grant and pension from another EC country.  She has been advised that her non-contributory pension entitlement continues to be available. In the interim, she is receiving supplementary welfare allowance while the Irish pension is suspended at her request.</P>
      <P>Her entitlement to a contributory widow's pension is also being examined by my Department.  On initial investigation her claim could not be allowed as my Department had no record of PRSI contributions paid by her late husband in 1988/89 and 1989/90 while he was apparently engaged in self-employment.</P>
      <P>The person concerned has been requested to supply certain information concerning her late husband's liability for PRSI contributions as a self-employed person.  When these details are provided her entitlement to a contributory pension will be reviewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Entitlement to an EC <i>pro rata,</i> reduced rate, contributory pension could arise here in the event that her <Col N="1035" /> claim with the other administration proves successful leading to a reduced non-contributory entitlement.  Any contributions due in respect of her late husband's self-employment could increase the rate of the Irish <i>pro rata</i> pension if one can be awarded.</P>
    <P>The interim award of the full non-contributory pension represents the best advantage that can be established on her behalf at this time.  That award does not prejudice the possibility that some more favourable outcome might be possible under my Department's schemes.  In this type of circumstance claimants are awarded the most beneficial of the non-contributory, contributory or EC <i>pro rata</i> pensions when final decisions are possible.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is set out in the following tables.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The opening hours of the stations referred to are designed to strike an appropriate balance between the provision of the necessary indoor office service and the outdoor parol duties which are central to the prevention and detection of crime.  The current Garda strength <Col N="1036" /> at these stations is the same as at the end of 1987.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Garda authorities are keeping the crime problem in Meath, as elsewhere, under continuing review and can be relied upon to do whatever is necessary to tackle it.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that they have in fact taken a number of specific measures to deal with the situation in the county.  These include the deployment of mobile patrols, the recent allocation of additional patrol cars to Athboy and Dunshaughlin and the setting up of a crime-prevention patrol for the Louth/Meath Division.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities inform me that the manpower and operational arrangements in Meath are being kept under review and that further measures will be taken as considered necessary.</P>

      <P>Article 21 (2) (c) of the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations, 1989 provides that a person shall not apply for a first provisional licence in respect of vehicles in category EB, EC1, EC, ED1, or ED &ldquo;unless the person holds a driving licence in respect of the drawing <Col N="1040" /> vehicle appropriate to the category which is the subject of the application.</P>
      <P>As the person referred to by the Deputy does not hold a full category C driving licence, i.e. for a truck, he cannot qualify for a category EC provisional licence, i.e. for a truck with a trailer attached.  The fact that he holds a full category D licence, i.e. for a bus does not affect the issue.</P>

      <P>School authorities, in particular the principal teacher, are responsible for arranging the organisation of the school so as to ensure that no class group exceeds 39 (in the case of a single-grade class-group); 38 (in the case of a class-group with two consecutive grades); 35 (in the case of a multi-grade class group).</P>

No applications were made to my Department from either school for the appointment of an additional assistant on breach of the maximum class size guidelines.</P>
