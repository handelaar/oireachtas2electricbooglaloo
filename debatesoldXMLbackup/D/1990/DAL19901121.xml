      <P>It is proposed to take No. 13.  It is also proposed, subject to the agreement of the House, that business shall be interrupted at 10 p.m. tonight, that the proceedings on all amendments put down to Parts I to IV, inclusive, of No. 13 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 10 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall include only amendments put down by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Private Members' Business shall be No. 26.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister about two items of promised legislation and if he agrees that reports today suggest that these items are now of heightened urgency.  The first relates to legislation promised to provide a statutory basis for the activities of the Department of Education, which a judge of the High Court yesterday said was very necessary, when he stated that large numbers of <Col N="1994" /> regulations were being made without statutory authority by the Minister, which is highly unsatisfactory in a country which is supposed to be governed by laws. Second, when will the Minister for Finance bring forward legislation to update the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General, which currently date from 1866, in view of the fact that, for example, in his work so far, with his limited powers, he has discovered that the Garda radio link will cost literally ten times the estimated amount?  Would the Minister not agree that it is now a matter of urgency to have proper legislation which will prevent this type of scandalous overrun?</P>

      <P>The amendment also implies, indeed, that the Minister would embark on an application to the court, for what may turn out to be a complex investigation, as some sort of &ldquo;line of least resistance&rdquo; instead of, say, bringing a criminal prosecution.

      <P>Perhaps I could make a point to the Minister in relation to amendment No. 16.  We have had the experience, Sir, of the use of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, particularly in relation to the Goodman affair and how that legislation is working.  It is obvious that the load that was placed on the shoulders of the examiner in relation to the Goodman Group was a very heavy one to carry.  To sort out the mess of the Goodman Group is a task that one individual would find extremely difficult. My amendment No. 16 would be of great benefit to society as a whole if that same individual were asked to pursue areas where fraudulent activities could have taken place in a similar situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 16, between lines 42 and 43, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) an application has been made to appoint an examiner to the company under section 2 of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not delay the House.  I want to make a point.  I totally accept the need of the Minister to take powers in relation to investigations of companies affairs. There is one obvious circumstance where the Minister should have this power, whether or not he ever uses it.  I do not see how it could affect the situation in any way if the Minister sees fit, in certain circumstances, to use the powers given to him, under the provisions of section 8 of this Bill, to investigate a company that <Col N="2004" /> would have had, or sought to have, an examiner appointed.  It is obvious that the powers to appoint an examiner as set out in the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, could be a means to abuse normal trading practices.  I am not saying that will be the case but it could be.  While the examiner does have power to report any fraudulent activities he may come across in the course of his duties, we must remember that the examiner in the case of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, will have been appointed at the request of the owners of the company being examined.  As a director or a shareholder of a company it is a peculiar situation to find oneself in where you ask that an examiner be appointed to sort out the problems in your company and that person will investigate whether there were any fraudulent activities.</P>
    <P>The tremendous amount of work to be done by the examiner in the case of the Goodman Group case would lead me to believe that it would be worthwhile to have an independent inspector look into the affairs in this circumstance.  I am asking that the Minister take powers which he could use, if he so wishes, to have an inspector appointed where it may be felt it is in the public interest that certain activities be investigated.</P>
    <P>I am not forcing the issue, but it would be wise for the Minister to accept these powers.  I would like to hear from my colleagues on this side of the House whether they think there is merit in this proposal.  I do not see how it would weaken the legislation in any way; in fact, it would give more power to a Minister. It must be accepted that a Minister will not use powers afforded to him, under section 8, unless he or she thinks it is in the public interest that it should be done. We learn as we go along, and I think we have learned a considerable amount over the past couple of months from the work done by the examiner in the case of the Goodman Group.</P>
    <P>I fail to see how we can have a situation where, as in the Goodman Group, an examiner was appointed at the request of the director and shareholder of that group, and that that same person has to <Col N="2005" /> carry a huge load and deal with all the other provisions in the Bill.  It would be better, if necessary, for the Minister to appoint an independent inspector to investigate certain activities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot accept this amendment because it is based primarily on the assumption that because an examiner has been appointed to a company that implies there has been wrongdoing in the company concerned. While it may be that there has been wrongdoing in such a company, as much as in any other company, I do not accept that the fact that an examiner has been appointed is a ground or reason of itself for the appointment of an inspector.  In fact, it would be a complete misunderstanding as to what the whole concept of the examiner and indeed what company rehabilitation is about.</P>
      <P>It really boils down to whether in the circumstances of each case, the Minister of the day has reason to believe that an investigation should be undertaken &mdash; in my view, the fact that an examiner has been appointed is irrelevant to that.  If there were a case in which an examiner had been appointed and certain matters came to light and the Minister thought it appropriate to appoint an inspector to pursue some other aspects further, the time for him to do it would be after the examinership is over.  Therefore, the amendment would only allow him to do it while the examinership was still on.  I think it would be wrong to have two investigations going on in parallel, given in particular that the examiner is already required by the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, to give an opinion as to whether further inquiries should be made regarding either reckless trading or fraudulent trading.  If he were to so decide then that matter would be pursued by the court.  If the Minister were to pursue it he should do it afterwards when the examinership is over, not in the currency of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Deputy looks at the three headings in section 8 (1) he will see there are three matters about which the court has <Col N="2006" /> to be satisfied &mdash; that there are circumstances suggesting that the affairs of the company were conducted with intent to defraud its creditors; that the persons connected with its formation or management have been guilty of fraud, misfeasance or other misconduct or that its members have not been given all the information relating to its affairs which they might reasonably expect.</P>
    <P>The appointment of an examiner <i>simpliciter</i> does not lie easily with the three of those matters.  It will be a great discouragement to people to apply for the appointment of an examiner if it is seen as a ground the same as alleged fraud for the appointment of an inspector.  It is a different thing and the appropriate time to do it would be afterwards.  Under section 8, as it stands, the Minister would have power to make the application after the end of the examinership in any event. For that reason I ask the Deputy not to press his amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16a:</P>
      <P>In page 16, line 43, to delete &ldquo;subsection (1)&rdquo;, and substitute &ldquo;section 7 or this section&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 8 (2) (a) as it now stands makes it clear that the court's power to appoint an inspector under section 8 is exercisable notwithstanding the fact that the company concerned may be in the course of being wound up and, following the adoption of amendment No. 17 which was discussed with amendment No. 14 the last day, this will apply whether the winding-up is compulsory or voluntary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the very existence of subsection (2) (a) in section 8 seems to cast doubt as to whether the court has a similar power to act in these circumstances under section 7 &mdash; in other words, on the application to it of a creditor, the company itself and so on.  I would obviously be very concerned if section 7 could only be used in respect of a &ldquo;live&rdquo;<Col N="2007" /> company, since the liquidation of a company is often the first indication to creditors or shareholders of the company that there are matters which require investigation.</P>
    <P>This amendment is intended to provide conclusively that the court's power under section 7 is also exercisable notwithstanding that it is in the course of being wound up, whether voluntarily or by the court.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>When this section was discussed on Committee Stage, there was a wide-ranging debate about the extent of the powers we were giving inspectors under section 9, how far into a group of companies they should be allowed to go, and so on. Having considered the matter further in the meantime, I think the section does <Col N="2008" /> not, in fact, go far enough, since it confines the additional companies which may be included in the investigation to any body corporate which is: &ldquo;the company's subsidiary or holding company, or a subsidiary of its holding company, or a holding company of its subsidiary&rdquo;.  I do not think this is wide enough, particularly since we have a wider definition of related company for other purposes in the Bill and, indeed, in the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, as well.  The specific definition I have in mind appears in section 138, in Part VI of the Bill, and is somewhat wider than the more restrictive wording we have in section 9 here.</P>
    <P>In a nutshell, I think we should adopt the wider definition for the purposes of section 9, and that is what this amendment would do.  The mention of a related company in the amendment means that the definition in section 138 will automatically apply here, since the term &ldquo;related company&rdquo; is signposted in the &ldquo;General Definitions&rdquo; section of the Bill, section 3.</P>

      <P>In page 17, line 33, to delete &ldquo;, or past director,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 19 and 20 are designed to widen the possible scope of inquiry under section 10 (3), and thus to close off a possible loophole in the present text, identified by Deputies O'Dea and McCreevy on Committee Stage.  The main idea is to ensure that full information can be obtained regarding bank accounts operated, not just by directors, but by people connected with them, within the meaning of section 25 of the Bill, in much the same way as <Col N="2009" /> subsection (2) will enable documents and information to be obtained from persons other than officers under subsection (1).</P>
    <P>Going further, I think the inspector should also be able to examine the accounts of shadow directors, who may not, of course, be &ldquo;connected&rdquo;, as that term is defined in section 25, as well as past connected persons and past shadow directors.</P>
    <P>The insertion of a definition of &ldquo;director&rdquo;, for the purposes of subsection (3), should achieve this aim and I have chosen to insert such a definition here to avoid the many complicated references there would otherwise have to be in the subsection to connected persons, shadow directors and so on.</P>

      <P>In page 18, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(6) Without prejudice to its power under subsection (5), the court may, after a hearing under that subsection, make any order or direction it thinks fit, including a direction to the person concerned to attend or re-attend before the inspector or produce particular books or documents or answer particular questions put to him by the inspector, or a direction that the person concerned need not produce a particular book or document or answer a particular <Col N="2010" /> question put to him by the inspector.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment arises from the Committee Stage debate on section 10 (5) and, in particular, from comments made by Deputy Bruton.  The Deputy's essential point was that where an inspector fails to get information or responses to questions and he reports the matter to the court, the court's only remedy seemed to be contempt of court &mdash; the court could not, for example, direct that the person concerned need not produce the documents or whatever or alternatively direct that the person should actually answer the question asked by the inspector.  I agree with Deputy Bruton that it would be desirable that, in addition to the alternative of contempt, the court should have these other options and that is what this amendment seeks to provide.</P>
    <P>A somewhat analagous set of options already exists in section 116 (4)-(8) of the Bill, as amended in Committee.</P>

      <P>In page 19, line 6, to delete &ldquo;(including an employee)&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;(including an employee, or a trade union representing employees&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We have just been talking about how a court may appoint an inspector under either section 7 or section 8.  This amendment relates to whom the court may issue a copy of its report or reports from time to time.  Specifically, section 11 (3) (b) (v) refers to the freedom of the court, if it thinks fit, to issue the report to any other person, including an employee.  My amendment seeks to substitute for the words &ldquo;including an employee&rdquo; the words &ldquo;including an employee, or a trade union representing employees&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without wishing to raise the hackles of the Minister, I cannot appreciate any reason other than an ideological one why he should resist this amendment.  A trade union may feel more free or more <Col N="2011" /> competent to consider the impact or significance of any such report.  The forwarding by the court of a copy of the report is qualified by the phrase &ldquo;if it thinks fit&rdquo; in subsection (3).  If the court considers for any reason that the report ought not be passed to a trade union representing employees, presumably it will make that decision.  In the very nature of the powers conferred by sections 7 and 8, it is important that a trade union should have the freedom to evaluate the significance of any report rather than the onus being put on an employee in circumstances where it may be felt that it would be better dealt with by the trade union.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I heartily support the thrust of this amendment.  All the trade unions and congress have been calling for this type of legislation to give the right to trade unions to get the type of information they want.  This has been denied to representatives of workers over the years in regard to the closure of companies in difficulties.  The point is well made by Deputy Rabbitte.  Most of the unions, at least the larger ones, will have the type of expertise required to carry out an examination of the affairs of a company, with particular reference to payments made or not made to workers' pension schemes and so on.  It is appropriate that the trade union movement should be recognised in a formal way in the Bill.</P>

It would be a step forward to recognise the role of the trade union movement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment relates to a report made by inspectors appointed to a company under sections 7 <Col N="2012" /> or 8.  Section 11 (3) provides that the court may furnish a copy of the inspector's report to certain persons set out in the subsection.  In particular subparagraph (v) of paragraph (b) of the subsection provides that the court may, if it thinks fit and if requested to do so, furnish a copy of the report to an employee where the court is of the opinion that the employee's financial interests are affected by the matter dealt with in the report.</P>
      <P>The question of the inclusion of a trade union as a party that should be given copies of reports relating to companies whose employees they represent has been debated continually on numerous occasions during the passage of this Bill through the Seanad and on Committee Stage in this House.  In response to these debates I have specifically made provision for employees to be able to obtain such reports where this was not originally provided for.  That has been as far as I have been prepared to go.</P>
      <P>There is no way in which it can be said that a trade union has been directly affected by the activities of a company. Clearly some members of the trade union who are employees of the company may be affected and in the case of an insolvency they will often be very badly affected.  The employees have the right to request a copy of the inspector's report and undoubtedly they would use this right where appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having reflected further on the matter, I am satisfied, within the context of companies legislation, that this is the appropriate approach and in the circumstances I am not prepared to accept this amendment. I would remind the House that the words in brackets in subparagraph (v) were inserted as an amendment in the Seanad, at the request of the Opposition, to make it clear that employees would get these reports.  I have made that change numerous times in the Special Committee and I do not want to encourage the belief that we should go back and re-amend the amendments.  We had the same debate on the 1990 Act and the House accepted that if the employees are <Col N="2013" /> given the report that is perfectly adequate and reasonable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>In introducing the amendment I may have said that I was referring to an amendment to subsection (5).  I was referring to an amendment to subsection (3), paragraph (v).</P>
      <P>I am very disappointed with the Minister's response.  Notwithstanding what he said, I find it difficult to understand his reasoning.  The distinction he seeks to draw between the members of a union and the union itself is an entirely jesuitical one.  Surely if the interests of the employees could, as he concedes, be affected, it follows that the union which represents them is involved and affected. Arguably, some of the matters which the inspector may be investigating may concern the trade union directly.  The union may be owed moneys for a number of reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand, in a country where the trade union movement is so <Col N="2014" /> long established, why the Minister should resist throughout the Bill enshrining the recognition that trade unions represent a majority of the workforce.  All we are seeking is an acknowledgement of that fact.  In many instances trade union expertise and professional back-up would be necessary to evaluate the significance of any report issuing from the court under subsection (3).  Employees may in certain circumstances not have that professional competence and even if they have they would want their trade union to do the job for them.  In very many situations, where an employee would qualify for a report he or she would probably go hot foot to the union with the report.  Why the Minister should resist enshrining that entitlement to a trade union <i>per se</i> escapes me.  Nothing that has happened in the Seanad or on Committee Stage should change that.  I ask the Minister to reconsider.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
      <P>In page 19, line 22, after &ldquo;report&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;for the purpose of remedying any disabilities suffered by any parties whose interests were adversely affected by the conduct of the company, provided that such orders shall not disadvantage other parties who were in no way responsible for the conduct of the company&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 12 as it stands at present provides that &ldquo;having considered a report made under section 11, the court may make such order as it deems fit in relation to matters arising from that report including an order of its own motion for the winding up of a body corporate&rdquo;.  As that section is worded it gives wide powers to the court to do what it sees fit to do, given what is contained in the report.  In this <Col N="2017" /> amendment I am attempting to include after &ldquo;report&rdquo; the words &ldquo;for the purpose of remedying any disabilities suffered by any parties whose interests were adversely affected by the conduct of the company,&rdquo;&mdash; and this is the important part &mdash;&ldquo;provided that such orders shall not disadvantage other parties who were in no way responsible for the conduct of the company&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am stating here a general principle. It is grand to be afforded rights under this legislation as a particular group, class or person, whether it is the company themselves or whatever, to have an investigation carried out and seek a remedy for perhaps something that was done not in accordance with the law, and the court will have the power to make such an order.  However, there are groups of people who could be affected by this order who were in no way responsible for anything.  I want to ensure in this legislation that the court is aware that when making its decision it is conscious of the fact that that decision could affect somebody else or another group who were no way involved in anything other than normal trade.</P>
    <P>I do not think the legislation is clear enough in many respects when it says that the court may do what it deems fit but in no way gives a guideline to the court that it should be aware of other parties who could be injured as a result of the decision of the court but who were in no way responsible for the activity which brought about that decision of the court.  We see it in the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, in a scheme of arrangement.  A majority of a class of creditors may come together and agree on something.  A wide group of people who will have no say could be seriously affected as a result of that.  In relation to this legislation, I am stating a principle and asking the Minister to incorporate into this section that general principle that in making a decision the court will be conscious at all times that there are other people who could be affected who were in no way responsible in the first place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am agreeable in principle to this amendment as the Deputy requested, but I think it should be framed in a wider way.  For example, I do not think it is clear from the amendment as drafted by the Deputy that the court would still be free to make a winding up order of its own motion as the present text of the section would allow.  It is important that the court continue to have this power which would be taken away from it by the amendment as drafted.</P>
      <P>However, I can accept that the purpose set out in the amendment could be one of the purposes for which the court might make an order here.  If the House is agreeable to this approach and to a somewhat modified wording, I suggest that the amendment be recast, when I would be in a position to agree to it, and it would read as follows: &lsquo;In page 19 to delete lines 22 and 23 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>from that report including (a) an order of its own motion for the winding up of a body corporate, or (b) an order for the purpose of remedying any disability suffered by any person whose interests were adversely affected by the conduct of the affairs of the company, provided that in making any such order the court shall have regard to the interests of any other person who may be adversely affected by the order.</P>

      <P>We now come to amendment No. 23a in the name of Deputy Pat Rabbitte.  I observe that amendment No. 24 is an alternative.  We might discuss Nos. 23a and 24 together, with separate decisions if required.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 23a:</P>
      <P>In page 19, line 44, to delete &ldquo;£200,000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£50,000&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2019" /> This relates to the power of the court in certain circumstances to recoup the expenses of the investigation up to a ceiling of £200,000.  The contention behind my amendment, and I suspect behind the amendment from Deputies Bruton and Barrett, is that that ceiling could, in certain circumstances be excessive, indeed punitive or, in other circumstances, make an investigation impossible.</P>
    <P>Section 13 (2) provides that where it has been found that a prosecution was necessary and somebody was convicted, the court may, in the same action, ensure that it makes an order as to the expenses.  In those circumstances, therefore, if there is a bona fide applicant, for example a creditor, who seeks to have the investigation he could face a liability for the expenses to a figure as high as an aggregate of £200,000.  The contention is that that is excessive, that it ought to have regard to the status of company as well as the scale of company, that it could be a deterrent in certain circumstances and that a figure of £50,000 is more reasonable.  I note the alternative construction being submitted by Deputies Bruton and Barrett.  I am not sure but that in the interests of uniformity we ought not agree a figure of £100,000 maximum which I previously agreed to on section 7 (3).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>I imagine that when the Bill was being drafted the figure of £200,000 was put in section 13 for the sake of consistency since it was in section 7.  I do not wish to barter with the Minister <Col N="2020" /> in relation to an issue like this.  I accept that one has to pick a figure and I would hope that the court would use its discretion and be wise in making its decision when it comes to apportioning the costs to be levied on an applicant or applicants. If one has not got a bob it will not make a whole lot of difference whether the maximum figure is £100,000 or £200,000. One will not be able to pay it any way. There is a need to look at the maximum that should apply and both Deputy Bruton and I, in tabling our amendment, thought that half the costs of the investigation would be a reasonable figure to insert.  I have been waiting to hear from the Minister as to whether he will stick with the £100,000 that is now in section 7 and, if so, perhaps that would be reasonable. Again, the court, in an instance like this, should take into account the ability to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I see this amendment in the same light as amendment No. 11 to section 7, also tabled by Deputy Rabbitte.  My reason is the same as then applied, but I agree to reduce the amount of the security that a court can require an applicant to put up before ordering an investigation under section 7.  For that same reason, and for the sake of consistency, I am prepared to accept amendment No. 23a, subject to the substitution of £100,000 for £50,000.</P>
      <P>I have to repeat that this sum of £100,000 is a maximum that an applicant or applicants can be required to pay, and under subsection (3) the inspector may, on his own initiative, and shall if directed by the court, include in his report his recommendations as to the directions the court should take in regard to the contribution which an applicant should be required to make towards the cost of the investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of my acceptance of amendment No. 23a, as amended, reducing the maximum amount an applicant can be required to contribute to £100,000, I do not feel it necessary to introduce a further computation, as set out in amendment <Col N="2021" /> No. 24, to be made by the court by reference to half the actual cost of the investigation in question to determine the total amount which an applicant or applicants would be required to pay.  In all this it has to be remembered that the party other than the applicant or applicants can be required to contribute to the cost of the investigation.  Moreover, subject only to the maximum new limit of £100,000, the court is free to require the applicant to pay whatever sum it considers appropriate, and in deciding this matter the court may have the recommendation of the inspector available to guide it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 25:</P>
      <P>In page 20, line 2, after &ldquo;convicted&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;on indictment&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment would ensure that it is only where a person has been convicted on indictment of an offence arising from the investigation under this power that he can be ordered to pay all or part of the costs of the investigation.  Former Deputy McDowell suggested on Committee Stage that if the provision were left as it was it could be open to constitutional challenge because the person convicted on foot of summary proceedings could be liable for costs beyond what the District Court can impose.</P>

      <P>In page 20, line 14, after &ldquo;be&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;, and any such order shall not be executed until the person concerned has received his damages or the property has been restored, as the case may be&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2022" /> This amendment, which was also suggested on Committee Stage, addresses the situation where the court awards damages or orders that property be restored to a person and, in the same proceedings, orders the person to contribute a sum not exceeding 10 per cent of the award towards the cost of the initial investigation.  It was pointed out on Committee Stage that there can often be a difficulty in collecting an award made in court and this amendment will ensure that a successful litigant will not have to make his contribution towards the cost of the initial investigation until he collects what was awarded to him.  In other words, it will avoid a person having to pay out before he collects.</P>

      <P>In page 20, line 26, to delete &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;of the opinion&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These two amendments arise from comments made by Deputies Bruton and McDowell on Committee Stage that if the Minister were to depend on the present wording of being &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo; he would run the risk of having any investigation he initiated being subjected to judicial review on the technicality that the exercise of his discretion involved an element of objectivity.  This could seriously undermine the usefulness of these sections and give rise to all kinds of obstructive tactics which were previously encountered under the investigation procedures which this Part of the Bill is replacing, and the substitution of the phrase &ldquo;of the opinion&rdquo; should lessen, indeed hopefully eliminate, the possibility of investigations being frustrated in this way.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 28:</P>
      <P>In page 20, line 44, to delete &ldquo;and 10 (5)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have been reflecting further, since Committee Stage, that the procedures we are proposing should be adopted in the case of ministerial investigations under section 14; as opposed to what might be called general investigations under section 7.  In this connection, one aspect of section 14 which I think needs to be strengthened is the question of what happens if attempts are made to frustrate the inquiries undertaken by inspectors appointed by the Minister.  Under the Bill as it stands, if a person refuses to answer a question, produce documents to the inspector, or whatever, he will simply commit a criminal offence, which then has to be prosecuted. This is too cumbersome, since what we really ought to be doing is making sure the person concerned answers the questions asked of him or produces the books or documents, as the case may be.  There is, in my view, a much better way of making sure of this, and that is to use the mechanism we are already proposing in section 10 (5) of the Bill, as well as subsection (6) of section 10, which we have now added through amendment No. 21.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the present amendments, therefore, is that the inspector can refer the case of a person refusing to answer questions to the court, who will have a number of options as to what to do.  These will include treating the person as being in contempt, or compelling him to answer or, on the other hand, judging that, in the circumstances, he should not have to answer.  This would be a much more effective way of proceeding here rather than simply making refusal to answer proper questions an offence, and I feel <Col N="2024" /> strongly that the amendments concerned here should be made.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 33:</P>
      <P>In page 26, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7)  Nothing in this section shall prevent the Minister from authorising a person other than an officer of his to exercise the functions which an officer of his may exercise under this section and, where the Minister so authorises, such person shall have the same rights, duties and obligations as if he were such officer.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage, Deputy Bruton, in particular, rightly identified section 19 as perhaps the most useful in the whole of Part II of the Bill.  He said it was the section of which most use would be made. I have put further thought into this aspect of Part II in the meantime, and it struck me that it would be a significant improvement if the Minister were able to authorise not just one of his own officers but any suitable person to undertake these direct requirements on his behalf, and that is what amendment No. 33 would do.  In other words, if the Minister felt that any of the circumstances listed in section 19 (2) existed, he would be able to authorise any person to require or inspect the books and documents of the company concerned.  The person concerned could be an accountant in some cases, a lawyer in others, an actuary and so on, depending on the type of company involved.  It could, of course, still be one of the Minister's own officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The corollary of this is that once the books and documents are produced, section 21 lists the people to whom this information may be shown.  Here, too, it would be useful if information gathered could be shown to people other than those currently listed in section 21 (3).  For example, if the business of the company concerned was primarily related to property it might be useful for the Minister to be assisted by a professional valuer who might not have been the person who obtained the information in the first place.  These two amendments would considerably improve the usefulness of <Col N="2026" /> section 19 and I commend them to the House accordingly.</P>

      <P>I support these amendments. This is a very sensible move.  We are all aware of the stress and strain on those who are employed in various Departments.

This is a very sensible amendment and I have great pleasure in supporting it.</P>

      <P>In page 26, line 30, before &ldquo;19&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;14, 15 or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Again, this amendment is intended to strengthen the provisions of Part II of the Bill to make sure they are fully workable. In the current text of the Bill section 20 is tied to section 19 but, on reflection, I think its scope should be expanded.  As we have seen where the Minister comes to the view that any of the circumstances listed in section 19 (2) exist he may require the company to produce to him specified books and documents for inspection.  Where the Minister's inquiries in this regard are frustrated, section 20 allows him to seek a search warrant from the courts to have the company's premises searched and the books concerned seized or protected.  However, it is equally possible that the Minister's inquiries under other sections in Part II could be frustrated in this way, and this amendment would expand the scope of section 20 to enable the Minister to seek a search warrant in those cases too.  The sections of Part II mentioned in the amendment are sections 14 and 15, which deal with ministerial investigations and inquiries concerning the real ownership of shareholdings in companies.  This would be a useful and effective addition to Part II and I commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>In page 27, to delete lines 42 to 45, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>22.  &mdash;A document purporting to be a copy of a report of an inspector appointed under the provisions of this Part shall be admissible in any civil proceedings as evidence&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  of the facts set out therein without further proof unless the contrary is shown, and</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from comments made by Deputy McDowell on Committee Stage debate on this section I propose to replace section 22 and in the process make three changes which I am satisfied will improve the section. First, the Deputy suggested that it should not be necessary for the inspector to be required to prove that the copy of his report which was actually before the court is a true copy of the report.  Second, the Deputy suggested that where an inspector sets out in his report his opinion on a given matter, that of itself should be admissible as evidence of such opinion. In other words, he should not be required <Col N="2028" /> to come into court to verify that it is indeed his opinion.  Finally, the Deputy suggested that where an inspector draws a finding of fact in his report it should be admissible as evidence of those facts, subject to contradiction in the court.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 37b.</P>
      <P>In page 28, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  The publication, in pursuance of any provision of this Part, of any report, information, book or document shall be privileged.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Sections 11 and 14 of the Bill provide for the preparation of reports by inspectors appointed by the court and the Minister, respectively, and both sections provide for the omission of parts of the reports before they are made available to the specified interested parties.  Similarly, section 21 provides that no information, book or document relating to a body which has been obtained under section 19 or 20 can be published or disclosed, except to a competent authority as defined in the section, without the written consent of the body in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite these stringent safeguards, and for the avoidance of any doubt in the <Col N="2029" /> matter, I am satisfied that the privilege which previously attached to inspectors' reports under section 169 (3) of the 1963 Act should be available to the publication of reports, information, books or documents under the provisions I have just mentioned, and that is what amendment 37b will do.</P>
    <P>Amendment 58a arises from, and is consequential on, amendment No. 37b. The same considerations apply to any report published under section 65; hence the necessity for this amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 38:</P>
      <P>In page 28, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>24.  &mdash;(1)  If, in any respect, any difficulty arises in bringing any provision of this Part into operation or in relation to the operation of any such provision, the Minister may by regulations do anything which appears to him to be necessary or expedient for removing that difficulty, for bringing the provision into operation, or for securing or facilitating its operation, and any such regulations may modify any provision of this Part so far as may be necessary or expedient for carrying such provision into effect for the purposes aforesaid.</P>
      <P>(2)  Every regulation made by the Minister under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the regulation is passed by either House within the next 21 days on which that House has sat after the regulation is laid before it, the regulation shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment would enable the Minister to make regulations to overcome any difficulty which may arise from the <Col N="2030" /> implementation of the new procedures being introduced under Part II of the Bill. While the immediate need for it became apparent on the Committee Stage debate on section 13, it would seem useful for the Minister to have this sort of power under Part II generally.</P>
    <P>Under section 13 specifically, for example, the situations where ministerial regulations might arise could include how the expenses of investigations should be met as an investigation is actually proceeding or if practical difficulties arise between the different courts which decide who has to bear the cost of the investigation and how reimbursements are made if other parties are subsequently ordered to meet part of the costs and so on.  Of course I cannot give the House examples of difficulties which might arise under other provisions of Part II.  Indeed, if I could I would, no doubt, be taking amendments now to get over them.  Suffice it to say that I am very anxious to see these provisions working effectively and it would be a pity if the Minister were not to have the opportunity to iron out, by way of regulations, any procedural or practical difficulties which appear subsequently.</P>
    <P>This amendment is based on section 4 of the Building Societies Act, 1989, and has in fact already been adopted under another Part of this Bill.  The appropriate reference here is section 227 of the Bill as amended in Committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always a little worried about the question of regulations but I am pleased to note in the amendment that the Minister indicated any such regulations would come before, and would be subject to, a motion of the House.  On that basis I will support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>My reading of subsection (2) is that it is the direct opposite and a regulation will not have to be brought before the House.  It says &ldquo;... shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the regulation is passed by either House within the next 21 days ...&rdquo;.  The onus <Col N="2031" /> is on a Member of the group to put down a motion annulling the regulation.</P>
      <P>I spent four years as Government Whip and I always felt that Opposition parties who wished to discuss regulations made by the Minister in the House were treated extremely unfairly and that it was undemocratic.  We did not afford time for regulations to be debated in this House and it is common practice that, in Government, the Whip will say that Private Members' time can be used to discuss a particular regulation.  However, we all know that Private Members' time is not easily available within the period to discuss regulations.  There are various things which Ministers will have to do from time to time, of a minor technical nature, such as laying a regulation before the House and, unless it is annulled within 21 days, it is probably a reasonable way of dealing with it.  However, when a Minister is taking extensive powers, something should be written into the legislation.  I do not say that every regulation has to be brought before the House but there should be a provision in the amendment which says that, if requested, time must be given for debating the resolution within the period in question so that the Opposition &mdash; whoever they are &mdash; are guaranteed such time.  That would be democratic and in the best interests of this House.  Every Minister knows &mdash; and I am not saying I would be different if I was in the Minister's seat &mdash; that it is very convenient to have this provision but I still believe it is wrong that an Opposition party are denied the opportunity of debating a regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of voting against this amendment as a means of putting my objections on record, I ask the Minister to include in subsection (2) wording which would give a guarantee that if an appropriate request was made, time must be afforded to debate a regulation within the period in question.  That would satisfy everyone. The other is a sham and we should recognise it as such.  We must try to find a compromise.  Every regulation does not have to be debated here but there are occasions when regulations should be <Col N="2032" /> debated.  Often the public are concerned about something and we, in the elected Assembly, do not have an opportunity to voice our opinion before the regulation is made.  That is not democratic and this position should not be tolerated any longer.  I put on record that as Government Whip I felt a sense of guilt when I had to use the tactic of saying a Deputy could use his Private Members' time when Private Members' time is divided between three parties in opposition.  We are denying a political party the opportunity to do something that is their democratic right and their duty.  It must not be tolerated any longer and it could be resolved if we inserted the appropriate wording that if a request is made time must be given to debate such a regulation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Workers' Party have consistently put down amendments to provide for this.  It is not proper that regulations are placed in the Library and almost creep through the House by stealth. In addition, a Deputy may not ask the Taoiseach about a particular regulation on the Order of Business.  The rules governing the Order of Business expressly exclude questions concerning the making of regulations.  I agree entirely that if there are unforseen possibilities of frustrating the bringing into operation of any provision of this part of the Bill, the Minister ought to take whatever reasonable steps are open to him to provide for them.  It is prudent that he should do so.  Subsection (1) gives him the power to remove whatever obstacle there is to bringing in this provision. He said he cannot envisage what these difficulties might be but, for example, the section gives him power to bring in a regulation that may modify any provisions of this part of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer the Minister to section 23.  He said he could not envisage any such difficulty but I will pose one for him.  Does he see any possibility that section 23 could be used to frustrate the operation of any provision in Part II?  Under section 23 it is possible to plead on the grounds of legal professional privilege and not produce any document or come forward <Col N="2033" /> with information that the inspector may consider essential.  There are all kinds of abuses of the system, for example, using the banks as nominees to conceal the real ownership of companies or subsidiary companies.  In the Goodman affair we saw the extraordinary lengths to which people went to conceal real ownership. If section 23 created such a difficulty could the Minister, by order, remove that difficulty?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my colleague Deputy Barrett in relation to the importance of regulations.  As any civil servant will tell you, an Act is read in conjunction with the regulations which very often can be far reaching and have a considerable impact on the legislation.  It is fine to place regulations in the Library but the likeihood of an annulment of such regulations is quite slim unless in the case of an emergency.  I have no doubt but that if there were an emergency it could be done.  It would be a good idea to encourage the Minister to introduce a facility which would allow a debate of such regulations in the House on an ongoing basis. There is not much sense in having the provision in the Bill unless there is provision for an annulment as well.  I am not suggesting that an annulment will be necessary, but in the event of an emergency we would have to go through the procedure as stated here.  From experience, we know the likelihood of such a debate taking place except in Private Members' time is very slim.  The Minister should take on board the suggestions made by Deputy Barrett.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have noted what has been said in relation to the question of the annulment of the regulation and the opportunity that might be given to the House to annual it.  The vast majority of regulations have to be made in these <Col N="2034" /> terms.  One of the reasons is that if you are waiting for an opportunity to have them affirmatively made or passed by the House you could be waiting for six months.  In this part of the Bill we are trying to deal with fraudulent persons and similar matters, and it would be disadvantageous if that were the position.</P>
      <P>The Deputy made a point in regard to regulations generally and I am sure there is validity in what he said.  Rather than trying to make special provision for it in each Bill where the question of the Minister making regulations arises, it would be better to deal with it in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. There was a complaint that topical matters could not be raised on the day they arose.  Provision has not been made for them to be raised each day.  A Deputy can refer to the matter either for five minutes or for one minute.  Ministers are taking pairs so that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>Rather than writing it into each section, the correct approach would be to make some arrangement whereby for half an hour on a particular day, even if it were only once a month, it would be open to a Member to move for the disallowance or annulment of a regulation.  It would be better to approach it that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are not normal regulations. They are described in the amendment as supplementary.  They are designed to try to get over an emergency.  We have had examples of this to quite some extent in the last few years, examples of obstruction of investigations, concealment of information to which one would expect public authorities to be entitled, and extraordinary lengths have been resorted to to conceal the ownership of companies and shares.  I have been greatly frustrated by the lengths that have been gone to, the absolute denials about ownership of certain compaines, to the extent that I was threatened with yet another writ for saying that somebody owned a particular group of companies.  I see this group of <Col N="2035" /> companies now listed among the person's assets in a current proceeding.  For that reason it is necessary that we should go further than normal in these matters to enable the Minister to try to prevent the kind of obstruction that goes on on the part of some people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte asked in particular whether section 23 might be used for such obstructive purposes.  We cannot do away with the right to claim privilege.  If we do away with that, we would do away with all sorts of privileged relationships and the public at large will lose out.  If privileged relationships are to be abolished, people who are in difficulty cannot resort to certain other skilled or professional people for advice or guidance in their difficulty.  If the public at large cannot do that, the public good will suffer.  We have to protect a privileged relationship and the information that passes in a privileged relationship up to a point.  A lot depends on the attitude of the practitioners concerned. If they are bona fide in protecting privileged relationship they could not be regarded as abusing their position or as obstructing.  On the other hand, if the professional persons concerned went beyond that and unnecessarily obstructed the inquiries that are being made under this guise, I would regard that as an abuse.  If somebody were in doubt about that situation one would have to bring it before the court and let the court adjudicate whether it was an abuse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>If a very small minority of professional people are prepared on occasions to facilitate the activities of somebody who is slightly disreputable, I would deplore that.  It is a matter that should be brought to the court for adjudication. The House should not abolish the fact of privilege just because a small miniority of people may abuse it.  The cost to the bona fide members of the public and people in genuine difficulties would be too great.  For that reason we should <Col N="2036" /> leave section 23 there.  It will not be possible under these regulations to get around section 23.  That would be wrong, but if there are specific elements of abuse then under these regulations it might be possible to deal with them.  I would not like to speculate on that because a lot would depend on the nature of the case.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, I would ask the House to agree to amendment No. 38, which gives power to make these regulations. There is not one Member in the House who would disagree with the making of the regulations.  The points that rose were in regard to the mechanics of how to deal with them afterwards.</P>

      <Col N="2037" /> The purpose of this amendment is to make directors under company law aware of the need to take account of the interests not alone of the shareholders but of employees of the company.  It has been the general practice in company law for directors to take account of the interests of their shareholders.  This is an antiquated viewpoint in this day and age when we are encouraging more and more participation by employees, whether through share options schemes, profit sharing or through accepting responsibility to be part of the whole operation. Many people invest many years of their lives working for a particular group of companies and, by and large, there has not been an obligation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 55, which proposes to insert a new section, is an alternative to amendment No. 38a, which has been tabled by Deputy Barrett and which is almost identical to one he moved in the Special Committee.  The Deputy's amendment is too far-reaching, and when the matter was discussed in the Special Committee I undertook to consider introducing a more moderate one along the lines of a corresponding British company law provision.  That is the basis of my proposed amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thrust of the new section is to state for the first time in Irish company legislation that in addition to taking into account the interests of the shareholders <Col N="2039" /> of the company, the directors will be under a general duty to have regard also to the interests of their employees.  When Deputies Barrett and Bruton put forward their amendment on Committee Stage, I was very fearful of its open-ended effect and indeed that it could have led to widespread disruption and divisiveness in commercial affairs.  There is no point in reopening the Committee Stage debate; suffice it to say that, having considered the matter in the meantime, I have now come forward with a proposed new section for insertion in Part III of the Bill, which is along the lines I undertook to consider, and I commend it to the House accordingly.</P>

The insertion of amendment No. 55 should lead to employees having more confidence in their companies.  That would be a good thing.</P>

      <P>I, too, welcome this amendment from the Minister.  As has been said, up to now company law seemed to have been there for the protection of members, the members being the shareholders.  The workforce were rarely recognised in company law, so this is a step forward.  In other more progressive European countries the phrase used instead of &ldquo;the protection of <Col N="2040" /> members&rdquo; is &ldquo;for the protection of stake-holders&rdquo;, who are clearly understood to be the workforce as well as shareholders. Therefore, section 51 represents a major improvement on what we have had and the enshrining of this amendment, amendment No. 55, in the legislation is welcome.</P>

      <P>In reply to the debate on amendment No. 38a in my name, let me say that I am very pleased the Minister has accepted the principle that I and my colleague, Deputy Bruton, endeavoured to establish with amendment No. 38a on Committee Stage.  Great credit is due to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions for the mature approach which has been developed during the years in the relationship between employer and employee.  This has done nothing but good in terms of the protection of jobs and employment.  Their participation in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> has done nothing but good and I wish them well in their further negotiations on the next agreement.  The fact that the Minister has come into the House to accept and incorporate into company law a principle we have been endeavouring to have established for a number of months is a sign that there has been a move forward in this direction.  I sincerely hope, given the Minister's willingness to accept the principle of my amendment and incorporate it in his own amendment, that it will do nothing but good for industrial relations in the future and the development of industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should all be conscious of the fact that in a company the person on the shop floor who, on a daily basis, works for a wage or salary but who is part and parcel of the activity is just as important as everybody else.  The principle we are incorporating for the first time in company law recognises the obligation on directors to take into account the interests of their employees.  This represents a major step forward and I congratulate the Minister for accepting this <Col N="2041" /> principle, which we endeavoured to establish during the course of the debate on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>In page 35, line 6, to delete &ldquo;a listing&rdquo;, and substitute &ldquo;dealing facilities&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is straightforward drafting amendment which is consequential on an amendment made on Committee Stage. The general intention of section 29 is to prevent speculative dealing by company directors in their company's share options.  On Committee Stage in the definition of &ldquo;relevant shares&rdquo; in subsection (2) (a) we substituted a reference to dealing facilities for the word &ldquo;listing&rdquo;, since the latter was to restrictive for the purposes of the section.  An identical amendment should have been made consequentially in subsection (2) (b), which defines relevant debentures, but this was not done on Committe stage.  The present amendment rectifies this.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment arises from a query <Col N="2042" /> raised by Deputy O'Dea in the Special Committee.  Section 29 (1) refers throughout to the delivery of shares at a specified price.  The Deputy rightly pointed out that this does not cover options which were framed in terms of a specified price range &mdash; between 99 pence and £1.02, for example.  The amendment before the House tackles this point by interpreting a specified price as including a specified price range.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(5)  This section shall also apply to any person (not being a director of the company) who&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  buys a right referred to in subsection (1), and</P>
      <P>(b)  does so on behalf or at the instigation of a director of the company.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These two related amendments, amendments Nos. 41 and 42, address two issues which arose in the Special Committee debate on a Committee Stage amendment to section 30 of the Bill tabled by Deputies Barrett and Bruton.  I note that the same amendment has been retabled by Deputy Barrett, amendment No. 42a. The first of these two issues arose from the terms of the Deputies' amendment itself and involved argument as to the appropriateness of the words &ldquo;no reason to believe&rdquo; as a defence to a prosecution under the section rather than the more usual lack of knowledge.  Having reflected on the matter, I am prepared to <Col N="2043" /> accept the existing wording is not the most appropriate.</P>
    <P>The second issue which arose concerned the basic scope of section 30 itself; in other words, should it continue to be confined to spouses and minor children of company directors or should it be extended beyond that.  The basic mischief which the section aims to prevent is the possibility of a director getting around the prohibition in section 29 on speculative dealing in company options by the simple device of dealing in the name of the director's spouse or minor child.  While I have considered a number of options in the meantime I thought the most direct way to tackle the problem would be to add a further subsection to section 29 in the terms of amendment No. 41, which leaves no doubt as to the mischief which is being tackled, and then to delete section 30 altogether.  That is what the two amendments collectively would do.  The new subsection (5) which I propose should be inserted in section 29 would extend the scope of what is currently section 30 to any person who buys such options on behalf of or at the instigation of a director of the company concerned. In doing so I agree that it was unsatisfactory to confine the scope of the prohibition merely to the spouses and minor children of directors.  In these circumstances I am satisfied that I have addressed the concerns expressed and as section 30 is removed, amendment No. 42a is no longer necessary.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 43:</P>
      <P>In page 36, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>33.&mdash;(1) This section applies to a company in respect of which the total amount outstanding under any arrangements referred to in section 32 comes to exceed 10 per cent of the company's relevant assets for any reason, but in particular because the value of those assets has fallen.</P>
      <P>(2)  Where the directors of a company become aware, or ought reasonably to become aware, that there exists a situation referred to in subsection (1), it shall be the duty of the company, its directors and any persons for whom the arrangements referred to in that subsection were made, to amend, within two months, the terms of the arrangements concerned so that the total amount outstanding under the arrangements again falls within the percentage limit referred to in that subsection.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These three amendments, Nos. 43, 48 and 49, arise from the debate in the Special Committee on the introduction of what is now section 32 of the Bill, and an example will, I think, best illustrate the point raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suppose the total value of loans made by a company to its directors came to 9 per cent of the company's net assets. In this case, any further loan would be permissible, so long as the new aggregate was still less than 10 per cent of the company's net assets.  However, suppose the net asset position then deteriorated later on in the financial year, so that the total <Col N="2045" /> value of loans outstanding actually went over the 10 per cent limit &mdash; the question was, what is then to happen to outstanding loans &mdash; should they be repaid, should the auditors draw attention to the situation, and so on?</P>
    <P>In the first of these two amendments &mdash; in other words the new section 33 &mdash; the solution I am proposing is to require the directors of the company to re-organise or re-negotiate the loans so that they remain within the 10 per cent limit at all times.  Incidentally, this would apply where the 10 per cent limit is breached for any reason and not just because the value of the net assets has fallen.</P>
    <P>The second amendment I am proposing, under section 41 of the Bill, would require the company's annual accounts to disclose specifically the actual aggregate value of the loans, and so on, which exist at the end of the financial year, together with details of any renegotiation of the loans arising from the need to stay within the 10 per cent limit. As well as requiring disclosure in its own right of these matters, this will mean that the company's auditors will, by virtue of section 45, have the function of monitoring observance of the 10 per cent limit, a point which also arose in the Special Committee debate.</P>

      <P>Section 33 is one of five new sections into which the previous section 32 was split by amendments in the Dáil Special Committee. However, while it was appropriate, under the previous text, to refer to a director of a company being &ldquo;associated&rdquo; with another company in a group of companies, Deputy O'Dea pointed out that that term is no longer appropriate, since section 25 no longer uses this concept of &ldquo;association&rdquo;.  The proper term would now be &ldquo;connected&rdquo;, rather than &ldquo;associated&rdquo; and this amendment so provides.</P>

      <P>In page 38, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  In deciding the extent of any personal liability under this section, the court shall have particular regard to the extent to which the arrangement in question contributed materially to the company's inability to pay its debts or substantially impeded the orderly winding up of the company.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment arises from the Special Committee debate on the introduction of what is now section 38 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton made the point that the personal liability provisions of section 38 were too open-ended, and that some degree of limitation should be put on the court's discretion to impose unlimited personal liability on a company director. In this particular case, I agreed that it might, in some cases, be unfair to leave open the possibility of unlimited liability for the company's debts, where the responsibility of the director concerned was arguable or marginal.</P>
      <P>In putting forward this amendment, however, I am not proposing an actual limit on liability, as such &mdash; what I propose is that the judge in the case should be required to address his mind specifically to the extent to which any loans taken out by the director concerned materially affected the company's solvency; in other words, not just whether there was a material effect, but the extent of that effect.  This is as far as I would be prepared to go on this particular point.</P>

      <P>These three related amendments are of a technical drafting nature and the need for them was pointed out at the Special Committee.  There is a need to clarify the phrase &ldquo;relevant period&rdquo; in sections 40, 42 and 44 and that is the reason for the amendments.  For instance, in section 40 (1) and in section 42 (2) it is clear that &ldquo;relevant period&rdquo; refers to group accounts prepared not earlier than six months after the sections concerned come into effect but section 40 (2) and section 42 (5), which are meant to be mirror images for individually prepared company accounts, do not currently provide exactly the same thing.  The best way to approach this is to define in a separate subsection in section 40 the meaning of the phrase &ldquo;relevant period&rdquo; for the three sections.  That is what the second of these related amendments would do.  This then gives rise to the other two consequential amendments in section 40 (1) and section 42 (2).</P>

Making the amendment to subsection (1) also has the effect of ensuring that the company advise the Registrar of Companies as to where the variations are kept, a point also suggested by Deputy O'Dea.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(4)  Where any right or interest is restricted under subsection (3), any person in default under that subsection or any other person affected by such restriction may apply to the court for relief against a disability imposed by or arising out of subsection (3) and the court on being satisfied that the default was accidental, or due to inadvertence, or some other sufficient cause, or that on other grounds it is just and equitable to grant relief, may grant such relief either generally, or as respects any particular right or interest on such terms and conditions as it sees fit.</P>

    <P>I have tabled amendments Nos. 57, 59 and 64 to address a particular difficulty raised by Deputy Bruton in the Special Committee, which the Deputy felt could arise out of the present wording of section 103 (2) and (3).  Exactly the same difficulty would arise under sections 57 and 78, which explains why the three amendments are grouped here for discussion purposes.  The Deputy's concern was that, as currently worded, the person in default would be the only party who could seek relief from the restrictions imposed by the sections concerned, whereas any other person who had, subsequent to the default, acquired an interest in the shares from the defaulter would not be able to make application to the court to regularise matters.</P>
    <P>I undertook to look at the possibility of rewording the provision before Report Stage, and the present amendments arise from that undertaking.  While the amendments I am proposing today will continue to allow the actual defaulter to seek relief from the court, as the current text already does, it will also allow any other person who may be incidentally affected by the <Col N="2053" /> default to seek relief.  I think this is what the Deputy was seeking to achieve.</P>

      <P>These two amendments arise from a debate in the Special Committee debate on an amendment by Deputies Barrett and Bruton.  While I agreed at the time to accept an adjusted wording on the floor of the Committee, I indicated that I might return to the matter on Report Stage, and that is why these two amendments are before the House.</P>
      <P>When I reflected on the matter in the meantime, I discovered that there is no corresponding provision in Chapter 2 of this part, which deals with individual and group acquisitions in plcs.  It would seem just as appropriate, indeed even more so, that a plc should have its register of interests in shares available at its annual general meeting and I propose to take the opportunity to rectify this omission, as well as coming back with an appropriately adjusted wording to section 59 (9).</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(5)  Where the Exchange receives a declaration under this section it shall, subject to subsection (6), publish, in such manner as it shall determine, and within three days of its receipt, the information contained in that declaration.</P>
      <P>(6)  The Exchange may decide not to publish the information contained in the declaration if, but only if, it is satisfied&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  that the disclosure of such information would be contrary to the public interest, or</P>
      <P>(b)  that such disclosure would be seriously detrimental to the company or companies concerned:</P>

      <P>(i)  the Exchange shall not decide not to publish the information under paragraph (b) unless it is satisfied that a decision to do so would be unlikely to mislead the public with regard to the facts and circumstances knowledge of which is necessary for the assessment of the interests in question, and</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2056" /> (ii)  notwithstanding any decision taken under this subsection, the Exchange may publish the information later than three days after its receipt where it is satisfied that the considerations in paragraph (a) or (b) no longer apply.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment arises from a query raised in the Special Committee by Deputy O'Dea.  The case pointed to by the Deputy was where the Stock Exchange decided, under what is now section 90 (6), not to publish information it had received from a shareholder, for example, on the grounds that it would be seriously detrimental to the company concerned.  However, if the exchange then decided, after a week or so, that the public interest no longer required the &ldquo;non-publication&rdquo; of the information, the exchange would be caught by subsection (5), which only gives it three days to publish from the date it received the information in the first place.  While the &ldquo;anomaly&rdquo; raised by the Deputy may not arise very much in practice, I did give a firm undertaking to rectify the matter on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>The amendment before the House would, accordingly, make two changes to the existing text.  First, there is a minor change to subsection (6) involving the replacement of the words &ldquo;but in any event not later than&rdquo; by the less absolute word &ldquo;within&rdquo;.  Second, the proviso to subsection (6) would be expanded by including a new paragraph to make it clear that the exchange could, notwithstanding the fact that more than three days had passed, nevertheless decide to publish information which it had previously withheld under paragraph (a) or (b) of the subsection.</P>

      <P>This amendment arises from a debate in the Special Committee on section 100 of the Bill, particularly subsection (3).  That subsection allows the court to make specific types of exemptions from any disclosure order it may already have made in respect of particular shares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton felt that the powers of the court under this subsection were too sweeping and should at least be clarified, and I agreed to consider a short form of words suggested by the Deputy to this end.  On reflection, however, I think a better solution would be to amend subsection (3) in the way set out in the proposed amendment.  The amendment would insert two particular matters which the court would have to address before exercising its power under subsection (3). These are, first, whether it would be just <Col N="2058" /> and equitable to give the exemption sought and, second, whether the financial interest of the original applicant for a disclosure order would thereby be prejudiced.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 66 and 67 arise from the debate in the Special Committee on an amendment by Deputies Bruton and Barrett.  I agreed to accept the amendment, with the option of refining it on Report Stage, and that is what the two amendments here would do.</P>
      <P>Under the amendments, we would effectively be making two changes to the present text of section 104.  First, if, when making regulations about permissible costs chargeable by companies for copying company share registers and so on under the provisions listed in subsection (1) (b), the Minister is to be required to have regard to the commercial cost normally associated with this, as the Deputies suggested, this requirement should really apply, in addition, to straightforward fee increases for inspecting these types of documents as well, under the provisions listed in subsection (1) (a).  In other words, the Deputies' amendment on Committee Stage was deficient, by amending subsection (2) only.</P>

      <P>Again, amendment No. 68 arises from a debate in the Special Committee, particularly contributions by Deputy Bruton, about the general fairness of requirements to notify changes in interests in shares to a company within five days, with the Deputy generally arguing that this period should be longer.  For my own part, I did not accept that five days was unreasonable in general, but I did undertake, nevertheless, to consider extending a transitional provision in what is now section 105 from ten days to 14 days, on a once-off basis.  That is what the amendment before the House does &mdash; when these provisions come into force, existing shareholders will have to notify their existing shareholdings to their company with 14 days of the commencement of section 105, as opposed to ten days, as at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy):</NameTxt>
      <P>Due to non-compliance by certain oil companies with requirements in accordance with the provisions of EC Directive 76/491/EC, the appropriate returns have not yet been made to the European Commission. My Department continue to press the chief executives of the oil companies concerned and expect to be shortly in a position to have the returns completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it is totally unsatisfactory that this is the same reply he gave me nine months ago when I raised this question? Is it not the case that had these returns been revealed, as they were back <Col N="2065" /> in 1987, they would show Irish distribution costs to be at least two and a half times the European average?  Will he not agree that his Department have been complacent to the point of negligence in failing to go with this evidence to the Fair Trade Commission who are looking at distribution costs in the oil sector and have it examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Distribution costs are a matter for the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I suggest, if the Deputy wishes to raise any matter relating to distribution costs, it would be more appropriate to direct it to my colleague the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The question of consideration of evidence by the Fair Trade Commission is again the responsibility of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The Deputy seems to be under a misunderstanding in regard to these figures and believes they are in some way inhibiting the Fair Trade Commission in their consideration of the oil company distribution arrangements here.  They are not, and it has not been brought to my attention at any time that the delay in producing these figures for the Community has interfered in any way with the work of the Fair Trade Commission who, incidentally, I expect will be finalising their report on the oil distribution industry within the next few weeks.  Certainly, the Minister for Industry and Commerce hopes to have it before Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Deputy in regard to the reply given last March.  If the House will bear with me I will explain what has happened since then.  Let me stress at the outset that the returns in question are the only oil returns required by the EC which are not dealt with by my Department.  I reject utterly and absolutely the Deputy's false accusation against the Minister, and staff in the Department of Energy, in regard to these matters.  We have not been dilatory in any way.  The fault lies elsewhere and I have explained that to the Deputy.  I agree with him that it is not satisfactory at all that these figures should be delayed in the way they have been.  The net sales proceeds returns are <Col N="2066" /> completed by individual oil companies and, for confidentiality reasons, are amalgamated by an accountancy firm.  Since the last parliamentary question in this matter was taken in the House representatives from my Department visited Brussels to discuss certain aspects of the returns with them.  The outcome of these discussions necessitated a revision of data by the oil companies in respect of certain costs.  This led to a delay in forwarding data by the oil companies.  I am confident that that final return can be made shortly to the Commission.  I assure the Deputy, and the House, that I will be keeping these developments under constant review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that what he has said is just flannel? Will he not agree that the Fair Trade Commission commented publicly in their report that they could make no statement on the proper distribution margins because they did not have access to the information to judge that issue?  The Minister is responsible for collecting that information.  Will he not agree that he promised to take action urgently in the past and we have not seen it?</P>

The joint committee have on several occasions requested the participation of the INPC in an examination by the committee of their affairs.  While I, like previous Ministers for Energy and the INPC themselves, have been most anxious to facilitate the wishes of the committee, certain issues which would be examined by the committee are <i>sub judice</i> and it was and is considered unlikely that they could be dealt with without prejudice to the interests of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 6, 8, 9, 21, 33, 40 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>The Government's decision not to accede to Bord na Móna's request for an injection of £105 million equity was based on the belief that, at a time when the need for discipline in the public finances remains paramount and when there are many other demands on the Exchequer, the company can support their existing level of debt and continue to operate successfully.</P>
      <P>This decision was taken after a detailed review of Bord na Móna's financial position by my Department and independent consultants.  This review indicated that equity is not needed in the company's core business &mdash; the milled peat and solid fuel divisions.  In fact, these divisions should be in a position to contribute to the other sections of the business.</P>
      <P>A need for capital was identified to develop the horticultural business and new products.  It is proposed that worthwhile projects in these areas will be financed either from internally generated funds or by co-financing developments with joint venture partners.</P>
      <P>As regards the future prospects for the company, the board's finances have improved markedly in recent years.  The company are now returning a profit and this positive operational performance is projected to continue.  I am quite satisfied that the company can operate profitably and remain an important contributor to the Irish economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's report from consultants, and form his Department, seems to be totally at variance with the Bord na Móna report on their prospects.  In view of the restructing of the company to have three separate divisions, I presume with the Minister's agreement, each to operate independently and be profit making on their own, how does the Minister propose that the core business, that is milled peat and so on, should subsidise the horticultural area which requires the capital? That seems to be totally at variance with <Col N="2071" /> the new structures set up in the company, with which I presume the Minister agreed. There are two further questions I wish to ask the Minister.  Can he say if the financial difficulties of the company have been exacerbated by the redundancy programme which was forced on them by the Government?  Can the Minister specifically say how the deficit of £12.1 million in the pension fund arose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised a number of questions.  He asks me why the views expressed by the board seem to be at variance with the views expressed by the Government in regard to the ability of this company to trade profitably without the necessity for a massive equity injection by the State.  I would answer that by saying that we have very carefully studied the Bord na Móna operation by having outside consultants examine the company and there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that they need this kind of equity injection in order for them to continue to trade profitably, and that the opposite is in fact the case.  Because of the successful reorganisation and rationalisation programme that has been carried out, the company have restored themselves to a very satisfactory trading position returning profits for last year and this year and projected profits for next year.  Because of that, they are clearly in a position to fund their debt.  It is the core business in Bord na Móna which provides the weight of employment which is of great importance to the midlands and the areas where Bord na Móna are operating. My concern is to ensure the continuation of the core business and to do what is necessary to protect employment in those areas.  The rationalisation programme that has been carried out has greatly strengthened the company; has introduced greater efficiencies which have resulted in these profits, which are a better guarantee than anything else for the continuation of the successful trading of the company and the stability of employment for the majority of the people working in the company.  That is the <Col N="2072" /> answer to the primary question and that is the position that obtains.</P>
      <P>The question of the pension fund is a separate matter which I have answered in great detail in the Seanad and I would be happy to supply the Deputy with detailed information on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The valuation of the 400,000 hectare forest estate transferred to Coillte Teo was based on discounted cash flow.  This method of valuation is well estabished in the forest industry, and was adopted by the Forest Review Group in 1985 for its own evaluation of forestry operations.</P>
      <P>The open market value of the estate was, and is, in practice unascertainable, as the sale of an entire forest estate of this size is unprecedented in this country. The experience of selling small forest areas is quite limited and confined to specific choice lots, and cannot be extrapolated with any degree of accuracy to the whole estate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the review group set the valuation of the forestry at the time at £800 million which, indexed up to current values, would be over £1,000 million, almost double what the Minister sold it for?  Would the Minister not agree that the undervaluation of the forestry will mean the taxpayer is losing an asset and it will interfere with the competitiveness of Coillte as against other companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The final valuation was £575 million for the transferred forest estate and the other properties and, in my opinion, that is a reasonable figure. It neither subsidises the company unfairly nor prevents them from earning a <Col N="2073" /> commercial rate of return after improving their efficiency.</P>
      <P>I should also point out that the estate was not &ldquo;handed over&rdquo; to the company, but, rather, transferred in return for shares issued to the same value to the Minister for Finance.  Coillte are quite aware of the taxpayers' investment in the forest estate and have been given a specific mandate to carry on the business of forestry on a commercial basis.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 39 and 41 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2074" /> I am satisfied that there are sufficient supplies of low smoke fuel to meet demand this winter.  Meetings took place with the main solid fuel distributors over the summer to ensure that plans for adequate supplies of smokeless fuel were in place.  My Department continue to be in regular contact with the distributors and are informed that there are ample supplies of low-smoke solid fuels available as specified under the Air Pollution Regulations.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the various solid fuels now on sale in Dublin have characteristics somewhat different to bituminous coal and a period of adjustment to these fuels was to have been expected.  Certain solid fuels may not be all that suitable for standard grates and should only be used when mixed with high ash fuel.  Eolas, in conjunction with the Department of the Environment, have produced a full range of information on how to get the best out of these fuels both in terms of heating effectiveness and suitability.</P>
    <P>As I am anxious that all solid fuels be suitable, my Department has been in consultation with the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of the Environment on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that petro-coke fuels on sale in this country have been proven to be dangerous in Great Britain, where they have been banned for domestic use because they are designed for commercial heating systems?  Could the Minister tell me what steps he is taking to publicise this information so that people will not be faced with the prospect of burnt out back boilers and damaged fireplaces and chimneys and the real threat of fire through over-heated chimney flues?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, a number of different Departments are involved with safety aspects, including my own Department, the Department of the Environment and the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I am aware that this problem exists with petroleum cokes. I have before me the Eolas leaflet which says that with petroleum cokes which <Col N="2075" /> produce virtually no ash there is a contrasting concern due to the intensity of heat in the firebed without any shielding effect from ash.  As a result, if used alone, petroleum cokes can cause severe damage to grates.  When I said in my reply that I was consulting other Departments in the matter, what I intended there was to see whether it might be necessary to introduce some legislation to ensure that petroleum cokes are not sold on their own.  Maybe it would be more appropriate that they should be mixed with some other fuel when they are offered to the public for sale.  They are being used incorrectly by a number of people and they have this effect of intense heat and cracking of some grates.</P>

      <P>There have been a number of efforts.  I have here the information leaflets and these are available through coal distributors.

Why has it taken so long?  Information is coming in now.  The Government seem to be acting on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  Eolas must be called in.  New information must be disseminated.  This ban has been in force for some considerable time now and no <Col N="2076" /> pre-arrangements seem to have been made.  Will the Minister say that he will now ensure that there is enclosed with all this smokeless fuel a leaflet indicating exactly what should be done to use it properly?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the companies and the Department of the Environment undertook a publicity campaign where they gave out the required information in regard to these fuels.  We are in a transitional period and it was expected that some difficulties would arise during the course of the changeover.  Unfortunately, there are some people who have not paid heed to the warnings that have issued.  This is a matter that I have asked the other Departments to have a look at to see if there is anything further they can do to bring the message home to such people.  It is important to stress that we are not dealing with bituminous coal and they have different burning characteristics. There is a need for the distributors or the suppliers of the fuel to pass on the accurate information on these fuels to the people buying them.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that there are up to 100,000 dwellings in 350 non-gas housing estates in Dublin including St. Anne's, KCR, Dublin 12; that since the ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of coal, many housing estates would like the option to use natural gas; if it is his intention to speed up the extension of the gas grid to non-gas estates; and if he will, in conjunction with An Bord Gáis, ensure that the installation fees for residents is moderately priced to ensure a large take-up of this, our own non-imported energy supply.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the position relating to non-gas estates in the Dublin area referred to in the Deputy's question. As I said in my reply to the Deputy on the Adjournment on Wednesday last, 14 November, Bord Gáis Éireann (BGE) have recently drawn up a register of non-gas estates in the Dublin area and are currently involved in drawing up a programme for connection of those estates to the gas distribution network.  This programme should be ready early in the new year.  The board will then be in a position to indicate when particular estates may be connected.</P>
      <P>A construction project of that size requires detailed planning and co-ordination, and the installation of the necessary mains will take place over a four to five year period.</P>
      <P>BGE are obliged to earn a commercial return on capital invested and only those estates which would provide a satisfactory return on the board's investment will be supplied.  It will, therefore, be necessary to survey every estate to evaluate the level of take-up in each case. The connection fee charged by BGE to individual householders will continue to be set, as heretofore, at a level which reflects the board's own costs in making a gas supply available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that forward planning is vital since we discovered natural gas off the head of Kinsale and that plans are afoot to interlink the Irish gas grid with the continental gas grid, certainly with Britain and <Col N="2079" /> Europe?  The least his Department should do is ensure that the 100,000 homes in the Dublin city area which are without gas have the gas pipeline extended to them so that they can play their part in improving the environment. Would the Minister agree that it is imperative that Dublin Gas service not only those estates into which there is a gas pipe line but also the non-gas estates, in which there is a total of 100,000 homes?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have answered the Deputy twice on this matter.  Bord Gáis Éireann are drawing up a programme extending over a period of four years to see if the gas supply can be made available to all the remaining non-gas estates in the Dublin area.  If all the houses in Dublin were to be connected to the supply it would cost about £60 million and therefore it is not something that can be achieved over a short period of time. I hope the House will agree that Bord Gáis Éireann's efforts in this matter are to be commended.  When their programme is available the householders in these estates will be able to gauge when it is likely that piped gas will be supplied to their homes.</P>

Will he agree, therefore, that the sole commercial test which he has demanded from Bord Gáis Éireann ignores the social benefits of the <Col N="2080" /> cleanest &mdash; and indigenous &mdash; fuel, natural gas, being used more extensively in our city?</P>

      <P>Bord Gáis Éireann are examining ways in which they can help householders to install gas central heating systems in their homes.  They have devised some schemes already and are in the process of examining others which might help to ease the initial cost for householders.  They are to be commended for the work they have undertaken. Indeed, they are working flat out at present extending gas into homes and their workload is at a very high level.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister share my concern that in Orwell Park estate or Perrystown, for example, it is punitive to ask the potential consumer of gas to pay exorbitant sums of £1,000 per household to have the gas infrastructure laid to their door?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Other fuels compete with gas and one must bear in mind that where the company undertake the heavy capital investment in extending the gas main, they do not get the full uptake in those areas because of the fact that people are already committed to other fuels, because they do not wish to change over and because, in some cases, of the cost involved.  The best way to bring down the initial installation costs would be if Dublin Gas could achieve a higher uptake in the areas where they already have a gas main laid on.  They have identified this as a market where there is room for expansion and will continue their efforts to increase the uptake wherever possible.</P>

      <P>When an application for grant approval is made to the Department for forestry grants, one of the procedures is that the local authority and their planning section are asked to give an opinion on the proposed planting and whether there are any special provisions in the county development plan in relation to that particular area.  They are also asked if there are any other aspects, from a planning point of view, which should be borne in mind by the Department before approving a grant.  Of course, in certain cases, planning permission must be obtained if the area to be planted is in excess of 200 hectares and an environmental impact assessment must also be carried out in those cases.  I am quite satisfied that the Department exercise extreme caution in regard to the forestry development programme <i>vis-á-vis</i> our environmental concerns and would have drawn up guidelines in regard to all the main areas of concern such as fishery waters, archaeological sites and so on.  It is kept constantly in mind and, in certain instances in relation to areas of scientific interest, we would not be empowered to approve the payment of a grant if the area had been specially designated by the Office of Public Works as an area of national or international interest from this point of view.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 15 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Planning for the proposed gas interconnector pipeline is at an advanced stage.  Subsea surveys have been recently carried out and the results are now being analysed in order to determine the best route or routes.  The final choice of route will also depend on the choice of supplier. <Col N="2084" /> Decisions on these matters will be taken when we have reached agreement for a gas supply.</P>
    <P>Preliminary engineering will commence early in 1991.  Purchase of materials will commence in mid-1991 and construction should commence in 1993. The current target is for first deliveries of gas to be received in time for the winter of 1993-94.  An interconnection working group, which reported to the then Minister for Energy in 1988, found that an electricity interconnector with the UK would be economically viable and deserved further consideration.</P>
    <P>Our first priority is, however, the successful implementation of the gas interconnector. Not only will this meet our gas market requirements, it will, of course, ensure that increased electricity generation from imported gas can be provided. While the question of direct electricity interconnection will be kept under review, it does not now arise as an immediate priority.  In any event, it would be difficult to make effective progress on the off-take of electricity from the UK grid until the new institutional arrangements for electricity in Britain are put into place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to understand how the Minister can be so precise in his plans and dates right up to 1993 when he said that the choice of route and supplier had not yet been decided.  I understood that the choice of supplier had already been decided and that the route had also been more or less decided. I cannot understand how the Minister can say that no route or supplier has been decided on but can say how it will all happen.  Does he understand the vital importance of this, particularly for the area north of the Dublin-Galway line? Does he understand the effect the supply of an interconnector for natural gas would have on the environment, particularly as far as the ESB are concerned?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy I am giving top priority to this project.  I have <Col N="2085" /> devoted substantial departmental resources to it in order to bring it to fruition in the shortest possible time.  My Department have employed the best experts to assist us in the planning of this major project and this is proceeding satisfactorily. All the matters the Deputy referred to are the subject of ongoing studies which will be taken into consideration when final decisions are made. What I have quoted in the timespan I have given the Deputy in regard to the various projects is from the critical path we have laid out for the achievement of this project.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is not right in his assumption that a supplier has been decided on. That decision has yet to be made.  Sea surveys have been completed.  The route to be used has not been finally decided. An enormous amount of study has to be undertaken on these matters before final decisions are taken, and they must marry. Three different routes were surveyed so there are three options.  There are a small number of potential suppliers with whom we are in constant negotiation with regard to price, quantity and other matters.</P>
      <P>All these studies are advancing and the time will come when I will have to decide whether the project is viable.  That time cannot be arrived at until we know as accurately as we can estimate the costs, who the suppliers are, the length of the contract and so on.  The decision with regard to viability and proceeding with the project, which will be a Government decision, will have to be made around the end of March.  The Deputy's concept of how these things are planned is wrong.  I have given as much information as possible. The project is proceeding satisfactorily to date.  It is a major project and one of the biggest undertaken by my Department in a long time.  We are anxious to ensure we get it right.</P>

There has been some dispute about costs, <Col N="2086" /> bearing in mind the previous estimate of £70 million by An Bord Gáis.

Any figure which has been mentioned to date is only an estimate.  There are no hard figures and there will not be any before March.  I have never said that the cost is a set figure. It is wrong for the Deputy to refer, as he does in his regular press statements, to an enormous escalation in the cost of this project.  Different estimates have been given at different times. There is no set figure.  It is foolish to base assumptions on a figure which was only given in order to be helpful.  There is no point adding to that until we know the real costs.  At the end of March or in early April I will be able to tell the House what we estimate the figure will be.  At that stage we will be seeking contracts but if there is confidential information I will not be in a position to disclose it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I find that hard to believe. Surely the Minister is aware that the real value of the grant aid between the private side and Coillte Teoranta amounts to approximately £133 per hectare.  That arises because the payment of grants to the private side is staggered whereas payment to Coillte Teoranta is almost immediate.  Does the Minister agree that there is a bias in favour of Coillte Teoranta against the private sector?  Coillte Teoranta administer the grants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is wrong on all counts.  There is no advantage.  Grants are not paid in Coillte Teoranta immediately. The position is that Coillte Teoranta are owed £9 million from EC funds. Far from being paid instantly, as applicants are, they get their first payment after approval and their second payment after a period of years when the plantation has been established.  The advantage lies with the private sector whose grants are paid instantly.  The public sector position is that grants are delayed and Coillte Teoranta have to carry the cost in their interest payments.</P>

It is misleading to use the Tina experience as an indication of what might happen in any area where a new mining operation might be allowed.  The planning and environmental requirements in operation now are extremely severe and will be extremely expensive for companies to comply with.  I assure the House that any mining licence I am asked to consider will receive careful scrutiny and will be considered only after an environmental impact assessment has been carried out by an independent authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 23 together.</P>
      <P>On 13 August 1990, I released details of the Arigna Task Force Report established to identify alternative employment opportunities in the region.  The report contained a wide range of constructive suggestions and recommendations for job creation to facilitate the transition from coal mining to a broader based economy. The report was accepted by the Government.</P>
      <P>The recommendations involving my Department related to forestry development and to the use of bogs for horticultural peat products.  Both of these recommendations are being actively pursued in my Department.</P>
      <P>As well as taking account of the issues relevant to my Department, I wrote to all my Government colleagues at the end of August asking them to arrange that their Departments and the bodies under their aegis take the necessary action to ensure that the recommendations are implemented.  The task force indicated that 300 jobs are expected to be created.</P>
      <P>The ESB are providing £1 million to assist with the job creation projects identified in the report.  To administer this ESB contribution and funding from other sources for job creation projects in the area, I am happy to say that I recently arranged to set up a locally based Arigna Development Fund Company and I am confident that this arrangement will help substantially towards providing new job opportunities for the redundant miners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the Arigna Development Fund, which will have an obvious interest in the matter, a core monitoring group, <Col N="2093" /> recommended in the task force, is being established by local interests with a view to monitoring the implementation of all aspects of the report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister states that the recommendations of his Department related to forestry and peat.  To go into it further, in Chapter 5 under subsection (7), there is a recommendation that the Department might designate the area as a location for the proposed wood pulp processing factory.  Will the Minister comment on that recommendation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy used the word &ldquo;proposed&rdquo; because there is no firm proposal yet to establish a pulp mill industry in this country.  Discussions have been taking place with an interested party but there are no firm proposals yet in regard to the actual pulp mill.  That is a matter which will be kept under consideration. The Government identified the need for a third pulp mill industry in this country to absorb forestry products because of the huge growth in the planting programme and in the maturing of forests throughout the country.  I agree with the implication in the Deputy's question that the west, north western region, will be a preferred location for such a pulp mill industry if one were to be constructed here.  I am aware of the desire of people not alone in the Arigna area but in practically every town and village in the country to have this pulp mill industry located in their area.  Until I have a firm proposal the Government will not be in a position to influence the matter.  Negotiations in these matters are carried out mainly by the IDA.  I suggest that any direct question with regard to this be directed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <P>A number of schemes have been established and I understand many of the former miners have applied to participate in the various training programmes which have been established.  A FAS skills training course for ex-miners and family members is now up and running and 23 persons have applied.  A 26 week business development course has also started on how to run and operate a business.  Twenty people have applied for places on that scheme.  A fulltime facility co-ordinator for the Arigna area has been appointed and it will be his function to encourage group formation so that job creation projects which will attract funding will be put forward by groups and an overall integerated rural development plan for the region is prepared to take full advantage of EC funds.  I had hoped, having worked on this matter throughout the summer months when the Dáil was in recess, that even one Deputy from this large area, consisting of Counties Leitrim, Roscommon and Sligo, would have offered one word of appreciation for my efforts with regard to the Arigna area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Rather than delay the passage of this important legislation, we have agreed to proceed as far as possible but I would urge the Minister to be as generous as possible with questions we may put because, as it was understood that only amendments to Part IV were being taken today, some of the amendments I would have liked to have included are not available at present.  In addition, I had an opportunity during the break to read some of the Committee Stage Report.  There were aspects of that report which indicated that the Minister would be prepared on Report Stage to consider some amendments but these do not appear on any of the lists I have received to date.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate if it will be possible at some later date to introduce further amendments on Report Stage to this legislation.  It may be that he did not have the opportunity either to have the amendments prepared.</P>

Obviously, we have not taken every single one of them on board because not all of them were appropriate but anything we considered appropriate or even reasonably appropriate appears in the amendments before us.  So far as the giving of explanations and so on is concerned from Part V onwards I will be happy to do so as fully as I can and as fully as Deputies require in the circumstances.</P>

    <P>I am grateful to Deputies opposite for agreeing to continue with this Bill.  It is in accordance with the order&mdash;it is not by special agreement&mdash;but we had not anticipated getting beyond Part V so I can understand that Members may not be fully prepared.  For that reason, I am particularly appreciative of what is now <Col N="2130" /> being done and I think it is in everyone's interest that we get as far as we can on the Bill today because it is generally agreed that it is extremely important that it be passed at the earliest possible date.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. a68a:</P>
      <P>In page 87, to delete lines 19 and 20.</P>
      <P>I tabled this amendment to try to extract from the Minister some further information in relation to the whole area of shadow directors.  He may have had the opportunity of reading an article in the business page of yesterday's <i>Irish Independent</i> under the heading &ldquo;Bill Will Hit Risk Capital Investment&rdquo;.  In that article fears had been expressed by the Confederation of Irish Industry in relation to the whole area of shadow directors and how the present definition may affect venture capital companies.  Until this whole issue is cleared up I would ask the Minister to have this amendment included.  When replying perhaps he would refer to the article I have quoted from because, if what it contains is correct, the effects on venture capital investments in the future could be serious and none of us would want that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fears were expressed also in the same article that some professional advisors could be regarded as shadow directors.  I have tabled this amendment to enable the Minister to respond to the newspaper article I have referred to and to get some assurances from him that the fears expressed are unfounded.  Reference was made also to the involvement of the IDA through their various programmes. Some of the people administering those programmes could be regarded as shadow directors.  In themselves, Irish venture capital companies are a very good thing for Irish industry and Irish businesses, particularly small businesses, who would be seeking to obtain venture capital to assist companies both in the promotion of what they are doing and <Col N="2131" /> also in terms of the employment opportunities that would arise from it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point the Minister made, that we did not have much time to study any of the amendments which have just been circulated.  I am not clear on what the amendment before the House would achieve.  I would have thought that by deleting the subsection in question we would weaken the overall effect of the section and maybe provide an opportunity for individuals to hide behind the so-called shadow director.  I am not convinced at this stage that deleting the subsection would be of benefit to anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the effect of the amendment is concerned, what Deputy Bell has said would represent my views also.  We are dealing here with the prohibition of insider dealing, and trying to cope with the consequences of it.  One rarely gets a director who has access to insider information actually dealing directly himself.  Sometimes he is a nominee for somebody else and it is the somebody else who comes within the definition of a shadow director in section 26.  He is the person about whose activities one would be apprehensive and with which this section and this Part seek to deal.  Therefore, to exclude shadow directors would be to exclude the more significant people in the operation &mdash; the string pullers rather than the puppets.  For that reason Deputy Barrett's amendment would not be acceptable.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked how venture capital companies are affected.  In that respect I would refer him to one of the amendments &mdash; unfortunately, I do not know the number because the numbering system has broken down.  Not alone are there letters after the numbers but there are letters before them.  For some curious reason, once an amendment is numbered it can never be renumbered.  I do not know why this is so.  It is causing much confusion today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the amendment in Part VII which will insert the new section 148.  I do not <Col N="2132" /> know the nominal title it comes under in this list but that will be the effect of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">

      <P>Will the Minister repeat that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 68s in Part VII will insert the new section 148. The composite definition of a shadow director in the 1963 Act comes from a combination of the definition in section 293 (4) and section 2 (2) and it is read in conjunction with the definition in section 26 of the Bill.  The effect of the new section 148 in Part VII &mdash; we can discuss this in more detail when we come to Part VII &mdash; would be to exempt the genuine representatives of venture capital companies from what might otherwise be the consequences of their being appointed to the board of a company that got into certain types of difficulties in relation to reckless trading and so on.  Of course, Part VII relates to the question of disqualification and restriction of ability to act as a director.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>This relates to insider dealing.  It is a somewhat different matter but, regardless of who one represents on the board of a company &mdash; a bank, the IDA, a venture capital company, the State, a Minister or whoever &mdash; one is still not entitled to engage in insider dealing. The question of exempting representatives of special categories is valid under part VII but it is never a valid suggestion that they be exempted from the prohibition on insider dealing.  This is why it is necessary to retain the definition of a shadow director within the definition of a director for the purposes of this Part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the IDA's possible concern.  The IDA consulted my Department before they gave an interview for the article to which the Deputy referred and I think appeared in yesterday's <i>Irish Independent.</i>  The IDA have expressed themselves as satisfied with the provision proposed in the new section 148.  Of course, the IDA do not <Col N="2133" /> see any difficulty in relation to the definition in section 106 because they accept that even their own nominees obviously cannot engage in insider dealing in any way and everybody will have to be subject to the same law in regard to that.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy needs more information, or perhaps more reassurances, in regard to the disqualification or restrictive aspects of shadow directors I can give it to him when we come to deal with Part VII.  The position on insider dealing is that in a sense the last people we should exempt would be the shadow directors, who are far more potentially insidious than the nominal directors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept totally what the Minister has said.  It was not my intention when tabling this amendment to find a loophole for anybody to engage in insider trading.  I have to admit that his amendment was tabled solely from the point of view of enabling the Minister to put on the record of the House his reply to the article in question.  I accept totally that it would be wrong to tolerate any situation where a shadow director or anybody else would be excluded from the general provisions in relation to insider trading.</P>
      <P>I hope the House will accept that the reason I tabled this amendment in a hurry at lunchtime was solely to get the Minister to put on the record his views on the article which appeared in the <i>Irish Independent</i> and to allay any fears which may exist in relation to the definition of a shadow director.  I was using parliamentary tactics to enable the Minister to put his views on the record.  I accept totally that when we are dealing with insider trading we should not provide any loopholes so that one category can escape the punishment which will apply to others as defined in the Act.  I look forward to a further discussion on shadow directors on amendment No. 68s.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The definition of a relevant authority of a Stock Exchange for the purposes of Part V was originally contained in what is now section 114.  It was clearly provided there that the committee of management of the exchange concerned, as well as its permanent manager, taken separately, was such a relevant authority.  When this definition was moved by way of a Committee Stage amendment to what is now section 106 the wording was changed to read as follows: &ldquo;relevant authority in relation to a recognised Stock Exchange means (i) its board of directors, committee of management or other management body, (ii) its management, however described&rdquo;.  However, as I said at the outset, I want to be certain that either of these parties can act independent of and without the necessity to get the agreement of the other but I am not certain that the present wording achieves this.  The amendment is, therefore, simply a clarificatory one to make this clear and it inserts the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; between subparagraphs (i) and (ii) to <Col N="2136" /> make it clear that they are alternative and not cumulative.</P>

It was argued at that time that, under the system proposed in Part V of the Bill, at least some of the people concerned would find themselves &ldquo;locked in&rdquo; to the shares they held, on the basis that they would always have some information which would fall within the definition of inside information in section <Col N="2137" /> 107.  The solution to this, it was suggested, would be to have some sort of &ldquo;window period&rdquo; in which it would be &ldquo;safe&rdquo; to deal in the shares.</P>
    <P>While I certainly see that some key executives in a quoted company might be in possession of inside information to such a frequent degree that they would find it difficult to deal at any time in the company's shares, I do wonder how widespread this difficulty is likely to be in practice &mdash; particularly having regard to the actual wording of the prohibition in section 107.  On the other hand, if we are serious in our intention to tackle the abuse of insider dealing the provisions we devise will simply have to be as tight as we can possibly make them.</P>
    <P>What I am proposing, therefore, is the introduction of two tightly framed exceptions to the general prohibition.  Under the first of these, in other words, amendment No. 68b, we would provide that the general prohibition will not apply where the following conditions are fulfilled: first, the person concerned must not take advantage of inside information to deal; second, he must give the Stock Exchange at least 21 days' notice of his intention to deal &mdash; this notice would be disclosed by the exchange; and, finally, the dealing would have to take place within a limited period after the publication of the company's interim or final financial results.</P>
    <P>The most important of these conditions is the requirement that the person's intention to deal would be disclosed to the market.  Since one of the main distinguishing features of insider dealing is secrecy, and inequality of information, the fact that a person who might be in a key position would have to declare his intention in advance would significantly reduce this element of secrecy.</P>
    <P>Overall, the amendment is designed to give a means whereby directors and senior executives can deal in the shares of their company &mdash; something which, under the existing provisions of the Bill, they might only be able to do at the risk of being accused of insider dealing.  While it will give them a certain degree of comfort, it will not at the same time give them <i>carte blanche</i> to deal &mdash; indeed, it will <Col N="2138" /> still be difficult.  One way or the other, what we wish to avoid at all costs is the opening up of an avenue of abuse here.</P>
    <P>The second amendment I am proposing here is related, although the reason for it is somewhat technical. Deputies Barrett and Bruton raised, in the Special Committee, the question as to the effect the provisions in Part V would have on employee profit-sharing schemes.</P>
    <P>The position under the Bill as it stands is that the very acquisition of shares under an employee profit-sharing scheme could be regarded as insider dealing by virtue of the definition of &ldquo;dealing&rdquo; in section 106.  This would be an unfortunate thing to happen, since the general body of a company's employees really have no control over such acquisitions, which are rather automatic in nature.  Therefore, while I am determined to leave no loopholes here, I am conscious of the value which these schemes have, and I do not wish to prevent them operating for what may be a technical reason.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 68c is designed, therefore, to enable employee profit-sharing schemes, approved by the Revenue Commissioners and by the shareholders of the company, to operate and be availed of, even by persons who might under the present text of the Bill be prohibited from benefiting from such a scheme, provided the conditions set out in the amendment are met.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that the exemption I am proposing is limited to the acquisition of shares under an employee profit-sharing scheme, and does not extend to any subsequent dealing in the shares.</P>
    <P>I commend both of these amendments to the House.</P>

      <P>It does not cover the sale.  I have said that the exemption is limited to the acquisition of shares under an employee profit-sharing scheme and does not extend to any subsequent dealing in the shares.  If he acquires under amendment No. 68c he will have to dispose under amendment No. 68b.  The fact that he had a certain limited exemption to acquire because he was an employee in an approved scheme does not automatically give him the right to dispose or to deal if he has insider information.  If he is a junior employee who has 500 shares or the like he does not have inside information and can deal whenever he likes.  If he is a senior person who has information he will have to deal in the window period as defined in amendment No. 68b.</P>

      <P>In page 91, line 32, after &ldquo;writing&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, to the parties to the transaction,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment arises from comments made in the Special Committee on section 111 of the Bill and is intended to provide a measure of certainty in a case <Col N="2140" /> to which subsection (2) applies.  The background to the problem is this.</P>
    <P>Section 111, subsection (1), provides that, where a person has been convicted of an insider dealing offence, he is prohibited from dealing for a period of 12 months.  However, where such a person was, say, half-way through a particular transaction at the time of his conviction, subsection (2) allows that transaction to be completed, provided the Stock Exchange has indicated, in writing, its satisfaction about a number of things. The question raised in the Special Committee was to whom the Stock Exchange's &ldquo;satisfaction&rdquo; should be conveyed.</P>
    <P>I agree that it would be desirable to specify to whom this should be done and, having reflected on the matter, I think that the parties to the transaction itself seem to be the obvious candidates to whom the &ldquo;clearance&rdquo; should be conveyed. The amendment before the House provides accordingly.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 68g:</P>
      <P>In page 94, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Where an alleged offence under this Part is investigated by an authorised person, the relevant authorities of the recognised Stock Exchange concerned shall be under a general duty to ensure that potential conflicts of interest are avoided, as far as possible, on the part of any such authorised person.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment has been prepared in response to an amendment tabled in the Special Committee by Deputies Barrett and Bruton, the intention of which was to prohibit completely the appointment of a member of a recognised stock exchange&mdash;in other words a stockbroker &mdash;as a person authorised to investigate suspected offences under Part V.  At the time, I pointed out that such persons could, in most instances, actually be the best qualified to conduct inquiries, but I did agree that where, for example, a potential breach of section 112 &mdash;&ldquo;Duty of agent not to deal&rdquo;&mdash; was involved, it might be inappropriate to have one stockbroker investigating another one, and this amendment is designed to ensure that such potential conflicts are avoided.</P>
      <P>In looking at this problem, however, it seemed to me that potential conflicts of interest need not necessarily be confined to the investigation of the activities of stockbrokers as agents under section 112 alone but could arise in other situations too.  It could arise in other circumstances also.  In those circumstances the amendment has been framed fairly widely and the responsibility for avoiding conflicts of interest is firmly placed on the relevant authorities of the recognised Stock Exchange.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for having taken on board the point made <Col N="2142" /> on Committee Stage.  This means the subsection will now read:</P>
      <P>(2)  Where an alleged offence under this Part is investigated by an authorised person, the relevant authorities of the recognised Stock Exchange concerned shall be under a general duty to ensure that potential conflicts of interest are avoided, as far as possible, on the part of any such authorised person.</P>
      <P>What exactly has the Minister in mind by the use of the phrase, &ldquo;on the part of any such authorised person&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>An authorised person is someone who is appointed by the committee of a recognised Stock Exchange to investigate a suspected insider dealing or a suspected infringement of Part V, or complaints generally, not just confined to Part V alone but generally, about conflicts of interest and matters of that kind. As the Deputy will recall, the point that he and Deputy John Bruton made was that it might not be good to have a stockbroker investigating another stockbroker. On the one hand I thought there was validity in that.  But, on the other hand, on the basis of &ldquo;aithníonn ciaróg ciaróg eile&rdquo; it might be as well perhaps not to exclude them because, in some respects, they might be best fitted to really trawl fully or deeply and ascertain precisely what is going on.</P>
      <P>I also recognise that it was not necessarily in respect of stockbrokers alone that this could arise.  I endeavoured to cast it as widely as possible in this amendment &mdash; I admit it is rather widely or generally expressed &mdash; but it very clearly makes the point that it is the duty of the Stock Exchange concerned to ensure that, when they are appointing somebody, it shall be their duty to avoid appointing somebody where a conflict of interest would arise as between him and the investigated party.</P>

What happens in circumstances in which it is considered that that duty &mdash; to avoid a potential conflict of interest &mdash; has failed; in other words, where there is suspected to be a conflict of interest? What powers of sanction has the authority of the Stock Exchange in those circumstances?</P>

      <P>My question is absolutely related.  It relates to the phrase &ldquo;...duty to ensure that potential conflicts of interest are avoided,&rdquo;; then, &ldquo;as far as possible&rdquo;.  Perhaps the words &ldquo;as far as possible&rdquo; weaken the import or perhaps it is necessary to have them included. When replying further the Minister might comment on that aspect.  It is directly related to what Deputy Rabbitte said. Where does the possibility end.  Or how does it become impossible to avoid a conflict of interest?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>If there were, say, quite a large number of stockbrokers where there could be a conflict of interests, what one would have to do is simply go further and get one where there was not such a conflict of interest.  If the committee thought that the appointment of any stockbroker could give rise to a possible conflict of interest then their duty would be to appoint somebody other than a stockbroker.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Rabbitte's query, the positon is that if they did consciously allow a conflict of interest to arise the Stock Exchange would be in breach of their statutory duty and could be prosecuted for so doing.</P>
      <P>In so far as individuals are concerned it is envisaged, under section 116 (1), that the Minister for Industry and Commerce would approve of a panel of investigators, or authorised persons as they are called in this section.

      <P>(a)  the number of written complaints received concerning possible contraventions of this Part,</P>
      <P>(b)  the number of reports made to the Director of Public Prosecutions under this Part,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c)  the number of instances in which, following the exercise of powers by authorised persons under <Col N="2145" /> this Part, reports were not made to the Director of Public Prosecutions, and</P>
    <P>(d)  such other information as may be prescribed.</P>
    <P>(2)  A copy of the report referred to in <i>subsection (1)</i> shall, subject to <i>subsection (3)</i>, be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>(3)  If the Minister, after consultation with a relevant authority of the recognised stock exchange concerned, is of the opinion that the disclosure of any information contained in the report referred to in <i>subsection (1)</i> would materially injure or unfairly prejudice the legitimate interests of any person, or that otherwise there is good reason for not divulging any part of such a report, he may lay the report under <i>subsection (2)</i> with that information or that part omitted.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is a response yet again to one tabled at the Special Committee by Deputies Seán Barrett and John Bruton, whose intention was to require the Minister to publish the annual report he gets from the Stock Exchange under this section. While I indicated my acceptance in principle of the Deputies' amendment, I felt the Minister ought be able to exercise some discretion as to what details of the Stock Exchange report he might or might not publish, for example, to take into account the existence of confidential or damaging information.</P>
    <P>This kind of provision is already to be found in Part II dealing with company investigations and in the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, dealing with companies under the protection of the court.  The general formula used in those provisions has been adapted for this amendment.</P>

    <P>120.&mdash;(1) If, in any respect, any difficulty arises in bringing any provision of this Part into operation or in relation to the operation of any such provision, the Minister may by regulations do anything which appears to him to be necessary or expedient for removing that difficulty, for bringing the provision into operation, or for securing or facilitating its operation, and any such regulations may modify any provision of this Part so far as may be necessary or expedient for carrying such provision into effect for the purposes aforesaid.</P>
    <P>(2)  Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), where the Minister considers it necessary or expedient to do so for the proper and effective administration of sections 114 and 116, he may make such regulations as he thinks appropriate in relation to&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the powers of authorised persons, or</P>
    <P>(b)  the matters in respect of which, or the persons from whom, authorised persons may require information under this Part.</P>
    <P>(3)  Every regulation made by the Minister under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the regulation is passed by either House within the next 21 days on which that House has sat after the regulation is laid before it, the regulation shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>
    <P>This amendment arises from the Special Committee debates although the only new matter is subsection (1) and the first line of subsection (2).  At present section 120 (1) of the Bill would allow the Minister to make regulations to overcome any difficulties that arise in the <Col N="2147" /> implementation of the provisions of sections 98 and 99.  However, given the novel nature of so much of this Part, and the fact that the effective implementation of the Part will be dependent on outside agencies, that is the Stock Exchange, I consider that the Minister's powers to overcome difficulties with the administration of the entire Part should be capable of being dealt with by regulation. That is what this amendment is designed to achieve.</P>
    <P>At the same time I propose to retain the specific powers in subsection (1) of the present text of the Bill, which is contained in subsection (2) of the proposed amendment.  A similar amendment has already been accepted by the House in Part II of the Bill.  Indeed, something similar exists already in section 227 of the Bill which deals with company auditors.</P>

      <P>I note that subparagraph (3) of the amendment talks about laying regulations before the Houses of the Oireachtas within 21 days.  As I understand it the way this is done normally is that it is dealt with on the Order of Business, that it is noted for the information of Members and a copy thereof is left in the Library, but the wording of subparagraph (3) would indicate to me that we should receive a copy of any such regulation.  In order to overcome that would it be possible for the Minister's Department to arrange that, when such an order is made, the order, as such, is circulated to each Member of the House, or certainly the spokespersons of the Opposition parties, so that we would be aware of and have a copy of the relevant regulations?

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment, which I accept totally, follows on amendment No. 68h, which refers to the annual report of a recognised Stock Exchange.  In this Part of the Bill we as a legislative assembly are empowering an outside body to regulate something which is vitally important to the common good, that is, how to deal with insider dealing. Deputy Bruton and I are anxious that a copy of the annual report be made available to both Houses of the Oireachtas to monitor how that power being passed to the Stock Exchange was being handled.  Therefore, it was important that we got information as to the number of written complaints received concerning possible contraventions of this Part of the Bill, the number of reports made to the Director of Public Prosecutions under this Part, the number of instances in which, following the exercise of powers by authorised persons under this Part, reports were not made to the Director of Public Prosecutions, and such other information as may be prescribed. Therefore, the initial workings <Col N="2149" /> of this Part of the Bill are quite important and I suggest the first 12 months will not tell us very much.</P>
      <P>The annual report will, according to the tradition of other annual reports, probably be issued about eight to nine months after the year ends, if we are lucky, so it will be up to two years after this Part of the Bill is implemented before we will have some indication as to how it is working.  Of course I am pleased that the Minister is taking powers to make regulations if things are not working in accordance with the intentions as prescribed in the Bill, but it is important for this House to avail of the opportunity, if necessary, to see how the overall performance of the Stock Exchange as the monitoring authority is working out.</P>
      <P>Both these amendments are interlinked. One is for the Minister to have powers to change things as a Minister. The other part of this whole exercise is that the Houses of the Oireachtas should also have the opportunity of seeing how it works.  Therefore, it is important, in a situation like this, when the Minister is making regulations to make various changes, to ensure that those who are responsible for policing this Part of the Bill are doing their job in accordance with what we all anticipate will happen. It is vital that we get the opportunity of being able to debate, if necessary, the proposed changes the Minister intends making, based on the information supplied to us through the annual report that will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We on this side of the House, the Fine Gael side, expressed some concern on Committee Stage about the role of the Stock Exchange solely in the whole monitoring process of this Part of the Bill.  We retained some reservations, although I have nothing but the height of regard and respect for the manner in which the Irish Stock Exchange is controlled and managed; but that is in the work it is doing at present and will be doing in future, this is a new role for the Stock Exchange, a role one could argue should be carried out by some other body on behalf of the State.  The Minister for his own good <Col N="2150" /> reasons has chosen that the Stock Exchange be the monitoring authority. Therefore, I think the Stock Exchange also would welcome the opportunity of putting its cards on the table and showing it is acting independently and doing its job as anticipated.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Bell, I think it is important that any changes by way of ministerial order be brought to the attention of the House.  I do not want to bore everybody by repeating what I said this morning.  I still believe that, while those who many years ago thought up that method of annulling a regulation, within 21 days, may have done so with all good intentions, it was used at a time when today's volume of legislation was not passing through this House and things were entirely different from what they are now.  The sooner the better we get out of the habit of using this convenient method of making provision for an order to be annulled within 21 days.</P>
    <P>The new leader of our party has been to the forefront in looking for Dáil reform and we on this side of the House and in the Minister's own party have campaigned in that regard.  It is quite absurd that we do not have some mechanism, some committee, some representative group, that could look at regulations and such matters, not necessarily having them debated in this Chamber.  We have committee rooms all over the place &mdash; not enough but we have some &mdash; and we could do our business that way.  Simply because this was put into legislation some 30 or 40 years ago we continue to do it today, and it has become a convenient way of handling a situation where the Minister is taking powers by way of regulation. It is an abuse of democracy.  We all know we cannot really get time to annul a regulation and as long as that is allowed to continue there will be these continuous complaints.  The more a legislative body pass on power to some outside group to monitor things done within the structures of the Civil Service or appointments made by the Minister in the past, and pass out that regulatory authority to various bodies such as the Stock Exchange, the more we need to <Col N="2151" /> ensure things are being done in accordance with the way we expect them to be done as we deal with the legislation that is going through today.</P>
    <P>I say to the Minister, Deputy Desmond O'Malley, that none of us will be here for all time.  There will be somebody different at some time sitting in the seat the Minister is at present occupying.  I do not doubt for one minute the present Minister's integrity when he states in this House that he intends certain things to happen but Ministers change, Governments change, and it does not always follow that the good intentions of Deputy Desmond O'Malley will be pursued by others occupying that august position.  It is in everybody's interest that we find a way, and the Minister, as leader of the Progressive Democrats and a Minister of the Government, has a say at the Cabinet table to ensure that the Government initiate changes which allow the House, where necessary and called for, to debate a regulation properly.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 68j:</P>
      <P>In page 96, to delete lines 7 to 10, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>121.&mdash;(1) Section 99 of the Principal Act is hereby amended&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  in subsection (2), by the substitution for paragraph (h) of the following paragraph&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2152" />&ldquo;(h)  a charge on a ship or aircraft or any share in a ship or aircraft;&rdquo;, and</P>
    <P>(b)  by the insertion of the following subsections&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2A)  The Minister may by regulations amend subsection (2) so as to add any description of charge to, or remove any description of charge from, the charges requiring registration under this section.</P>
    <P>(2B)  The power of the Minister under subsection (2A) shall include a power to amend by regulations the description of any charge referred to in subsection (2).</P>
    <P>(2C)  Every regulation made by the Minister under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the regulation is passed by either House within the next 21 days on which that House has sat after the regulation is laid before it, the regulation shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment arises from the Special Committee debate on what is now section 121, in which it was suggested that the list of charges in section 99 of the 1963 Act which required legislation in the Companies Registration Office should be further amended specifically to cover charges on forms of transport other than ships or aircraft.  Minister of State Harney responded, however, that the best solution might be to give the Minister the power by regulations to add to, subtract from or otherwise amend the list of charges in section 99 of the 1963 Act which require registration.  That is the approach I have adopted in this amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 68k:</P>
      <P>In page 96, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>123.&mdash;Section 231 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion after subsection (1) of the following subsection&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1A) (a) The liquidator of a company shall not sell by private contract a non-cash asset of the requisite value to a person who is, or who, within three years prior to the date of commencement of the winding-up, has been, an officer of the company unless the liquidator has given at least 14 days' notice of his intention to do so to all creditors of the company who are known to him or who have been intimated to him.</P>
      <P>(b) In this subsection&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) &ldquo;non-cash asset&rdquo; and &ldquo;requisite value&rdquo; have the meanings assigned to them by section 28 of the Companies Act, 1990, and</P>
      <P>(ii) &ldquo;director&rdquo; includes a person connected, within the meaning of section 25 of the Companies Act, 1990, with a director, and a shadow director.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment arises from a debate in the Special Committee on an amendment tabled by Deputies Barrett and Bruton. What the Deputies were suggesting was that a liquidator should not be able to sell company property to the former directors of the company without the approval of the court.  In the course of a long debate on the matter the Minister of State initially rejected the amendment as being unnecessary in some cases in the light of section 231 (3) of the 1963 Act and, indeed, could be counterproductive in other cases.  He went on to indicate that he would reflect on the possibility of an amendment on the lines of what is now section 168 (1) of the Bill, but following <Col N="2154" /> further discussion in committee he indicated that a lot more thought would be required before an amendment could be prepared for Report Stage.</P>
    <P>In the event, the amendment I am putting forward today is based on a compromise suggestion made, I believe, by Deputy Roche in the course of the Committee Stage debate.  That suggestion was that rather than prohibit a liquidator selling assets to a former director the situation should be that where a liquidator proposes to sell assets in this way he should be required to notify the creditors of the company of his intention to do so, thereby bringing the matter out into the open.  It would of course then be open to the creditors to object to the liquidator's proposal under section 231 (3) in the case of a court winding up or section 280 (1) in a voluntary winding up.</P>
    <P>I will be proposing at a later stage a similar amendment under Part VIII in the case of receivers who propose to sell company assets to former directors of the company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is probably one of the most important amendments that has been brought in.  Those of us who have dealt with liquidation and receivership, have seen, at first hand, virtually 48 hours after the liquidation or receivership, the liquidator and former owner of the business doing business all over again. Within a week or two weeks of the notice of liquidation the employer is down the road in another building and in the process shifted the machinery and plant he left behind him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment will give the creditors and employees an option.  I would like to have seen in that amendment a stipulation that the creditors should be notified that it was proposed to dispose of part of the assets, plant or machinery of the company to any person who was formerly involved.  Former employees would have an interest in the company's affairs because the sale of the assets of the company may have an overall effect on the end result and on outstanding payments <Col N="2155" /> due on behalf of workers to the Department of Social Welfare, the Revenue Commissioners and so on.</P>
    <P>I welcome this very much.  I hope that under that section the Minister can introduce a regulation setting down how this notification to the creditors should be dealt with.  For example, in many cases creditors are located outside the country. Will the Minister comment on that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, this is an area that has been abused in the past.  The amendment goes some way to putting in safeguards that workers and, I suspect, all creditors would welcome, particularly in the case of voluntary winding up or voluntary liquidation.  The liquidator is frequently the auditor and there is often a close relationship between the liquidator and the principal of the firm or directors of the firm.  The directors of the firm, or the chief executive, would have built up a relationship over a number of years with the auditor.</P>
      <P>In a voluntary liquidation, the situation is capable of being abused in so much as that insider track can be used to flog off assets, giving first option to the directors without any knowledge on the part of the creditors or on the part of the employees. As Deputy Bell has intimated, that can sometimes make a difference as to whether or not that company is capable of being put back on the road again. There have been quite deliberate windings up of what could otherwise be productive enterprises because it happened to suit the corporate strategy of the directors. The sale of essential machinery or whatever can present the directors with the possibility of arguing a plausible case to the workers that the company concerned was no longer viable.  Like Deputy Bell I would like to have seen employees included.  They may come under the amendment inasmuch as they too are creditors and would be given notice but I would have preferred to have seen them enshrined in their own right.  The amendment is an improvement and will be welcomed by the trade union movement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>This arises from an amendment tabled by Deputy Bruton and me at the Special Committee.  I have a copy of the debates from that meeting on 6 February 1990.  We have proposed an amendment to section 231 (2) (a) of the Principal Act to add the following words at the end of the subsection, &ldquo;Save that he shall not have the power without the consent of the court to sell any real or personal property or other interests belonging to the company to a former director of the company or to any person connected with the former director of the company within the terms of section 25 of the Companies Act, 1990&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, there was a long debate about this and we ended up with a tied vote of six all at the end of the day. We argued at that time, and continue to argue, that this goes to the kernel of dealing with the rogue director.  Numerous complaints have been made about companies suddenly folding up and starting up again with the former directors and shareholders vying with each other for the assets of the company that went into liquidation leaving the creditors high and dry.  I appreciate that the Minister has gone some of the way towards meeting the requirement in this amendment but what he is saying is: &ldquo;The liquidator of a company shall not sell by private contract a non-cash asset of the requisite value to a person who is, or who, within three years prior to the date of commencement of the winding up, has been, an officer of the company unless the liquidator has given at least 14 days' notice of his intention to do so to all creditors of the company who are known to him or who have been intimated to him.&rdquo;  The liquidator is now obliged to give 14 days' notice that he proposes to do something but the provision does not go on to say that he must get the consent of the court to do so.  While this goes some way towards dealing with the problem, I am not at all happy that this practice will not continue.  It is grand to give 14 days' notice but the liquidator will still have the power to sell those assets to a former director.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we were proposing and what we <Col N="2157" /> were anxious to establish is that the consent of the court would be necessary before these assets would be sold to a director.  We are here to protect the interest of creditors in this instance. There may be the case where a company will fold up and it will be in the interests of the creditors that the property be sold to a previous director, but that will not always be the case, nor has it been the case in the past.  Of all the matters in this Part of the Bill about which I have received complaints from various people, particularly small businessmen, this practice is the main one.  I am not happy that this amendment goes far enough towards meeting the problem, and I would ask the Minister to reconsider the wording of the amendment.  Of course the liquidator should give notice that he is going to do something like this but he should also get the approval of the court before he does so.  Suppose it happens that the creditors object to this procedure, they will have no guarantees so far as this amendment is concerned that the liquidator will not go ahead and sell the assets anyway after the 15th day.</P>
    <P>That is not what we wanted or what the committee, in the long debate of 6 February, were saying.  On that occasion the matter eventually went to a vote, which resulted in six all.  There was a belief among the members of the committee that strong action should be taken in this regard.  The Minister was represented on that occasion by the Minister of State, Deputy Leyden, who did not deal with the matter to our satisfaction. This is one of the amendments in relation to this Part of the Bill that we took extremely seriously, I would appeal to the Minister to reconsider this aspect of the legislation to prevent once and for all these rogue directors behaving in the way they have done in the past.  Some people are absolutely disgusted when debts owing to them are written off.  Somebody they gave credit to closes his business one day and sets up the following week in the same premises under a different name and with the same equipment.  The stock is sold to him by the appointed liquidator <Col N="2158" /> and the unfortunate creditor goes without his money.  That is no way to do business.</P>
    <P>There are various provisions in this Bill, with which we all agree, to stop abuses such as insider trading.  More responsibility is given to directors in the way they go about their business and people in business, on some occasions people who are genuinely performing properly on a day-to-day basis, are now being asked to do a lot more than they have been doing.  For example, there is an obligation to disclose interest in shares.  The one thing we should do in this Bill, and which the public have been demanding for a long time, is put a stop to the practices that have been going on in this country.  We should say, &ldquo;halt&rdquo;.  We should say we are not going to tolerate any more cases where rogue directors get away scot free while leaving genuine small businessmen high and dry, people who perhaps have to go into liquidation as a result of the irresponsibility of others.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister's amendment simply requires the liquidator to give 14 days' notice.  I had intended drafting a new amendment for Report Stage but my understanding was that we would deal with up to Part IV today.  The Minister has pointed out that the Order of Business is worded in such a way that it allows us to continue beyond Part IV. In good faith I agreed that we would complete up to Part IV.  We have no facilities or back-up services and this is difficult legislation to follow.  As can be seen, the numbers of sections on Committee Stage are entirely different from the numbers in the Bill when it finished Committee Stage.  It is impossible to follow this legislation.  I had intended going into detail on this section but I did not get the opportunity between the time we broke for lunch and the time we came back.  I understood we would not be dealing with this part of the Bill today.</P>
    <P>I believe it is within the Minister's powers to act on what was said on Committee Stage and to what is being said here this afternoon and to make certain that the wording of this amendment does not leave any loopholes for the future. We will not get an opportunity again to <Col N="2159" /> deal with this sort of situation.  This is the opportunity that many people have been waiting for.  I would be failing in my duty if I did not fight as hard as possible this afternoon to see to it that there is no loophole in regard to it.  We are not asking that a draconian measure be included in legislation.  This is a matter which has caused enormous problems to many people and it has lead to a great deal of disgust in the minds of many to see a company folding up one day and starting up the next day with the same machinery and in the same premises, with the unfortunate creditors left high and dry without their money.</P>
    <P>To ask the liquidator to give 14 days' notice before he sells back to the director is not sufficient.  The wording of our amendment was that he would have to go to the court for permission to do so. There are other aspects of this legislation where people would be in and out of court like yo-yos, and I fail to see why we cannot make such a provision in this instance because it would not be a very onerous task.  I fail to see why our amendment was not accepted on Committee Stage but a democratic vote was taken which resulted in six all.  Some people on that committee who voted against our amendment were uncomfortable in doing so.  They did so, I would suggest, in loyalty to the Government of the day but they were not happy in their own minds. If you read the report you will see the contributions that were made and the concerns expressed by people on all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>This is Report Stage and I can speak only once.  I am asking the Minister to seriously reconsider the wording of this amendment, to make it stronger so that we can be assured that the practices that have gone on in the past will not continue in the future.  Referring the matter back to court may not be the answer from the Minister's point of view but a stronger provision than the liquidator just giving 14 days' notice of his intention to do something is needed.  I would urge all Members on this side of the House who are present <Col N="2160" /> to support my request that we do something genuine in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to reinforce the points made by my colleague, Deputy Barrett.  No other part of the Companies Act causes as much aggravation as that in relation to either voluntary liquidation or companies put into liquidation by creditors. We all know of instances where the finger has been raised at the fact that assets were disposed of at concessionary rates in rather dubious circumstances to people who had a connection, in some cases a rather tenuous connection, with the company or a competitor of the company. The fact that 14 days' notice has to be given before a sale takes place is a warning to everyone concerned but I am not sure that it prohibits the sale from taking place.  There are other amendments which might take that into account.  We had a long and animated discussion on this section on Committee Stage.  I ask the Minister to devise some method whereby in the event of a liquidation there is fair play for all concerned. Not only are the employees and creditors of the firm put at risk but in some cases individual directors will have a grievance on the basis that certain sales took place in a certain fashion, even within their own company, by virtue of the alleged activities of other directors and so on. This is an area which received considerable attention on Committee Stage, and the points made by Deputy Barrett are valid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to what Deputy Barrett said in the course of the debate on this amendment.  I would remind him that the amendment was put down in response to some of the points he and Deputy Bruton urged on Committee Stage.  The reaction of the Minister of State who was dealing with it at the time was that it was not necessary but, on reflection, he said we would think about it and see if we could work something out for Report Stage.  That has now been done.  It is not just a question of giving 14 days' notice.  The principle behind giving notice to all the creditors that are known <Col N="2161" /> means that it is no longer a secret or private arrangement.  It becomes publicly known to many people.  Under two provisions in the 1963 Act the creditors can go to the court if they wish.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barrett said I should go further and make it obligatory to go to court but if there is a fault with the legislation it is that there are too many references to the court, at how many thousands of guineas a go.  I think we overdo the court provision at times when we consider how impecunious some of these people are and how difficult it is for them to cope with High Court costs.  We should not force people to resort to the court unless there is no other option.</P>
      <P>Under section 231 (3) of the 1963 Act the exercise by the liquidator in a winding up by the court of the powers conferred by this section shall be subject to the control of the court.  That applies to this new section.  Any creditor or contributor may apply to the court in relation to any exercise or proposed exercise of any of the powers.  In the past creditors or contributors very often did not get an opportunity to make such an application because they did not know the liquidator had sold off the business quietly on the side to the former directors or owners but now they will all know.  That power is now of real value to them.  It should be that they can go to court if they feel there is an abuse they want to stop and it should not be that before a liquidator can sell, for example, a bicycle he has to go to court.  That is the case where it is a compulsory winding up but where it is a voluntary member's winding up, section 280 of the 1963 Act applies and the provision is exactly the same.  We have gone a long way but we have not gone so far as to impose unnecessary costs on the individuals concerned.</P>

      <P>This group of amendments is strictly technical in nature and does not add anything of substance to the law under the Companies Acts. However, they remove some areas of overlap between sections 135 and 136 and sections 33 and 34 of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990.  Both sets of <Col N="2165" /> provisions essentially tackle the same issue, reckless trading and fraudulent trading, but in two different contexts and, therefore, it is necessary to do something about it.  The first of these amendments replaces the current subsection (1) of section 135 of the Bill by the version of the same idea which appears in section 34 (1) of the 1990 Act.  The wording in the 1990 Act is better because it applies to fraudulent trading provisions, whereas section 135 of the Bill could only be used up to now where a company was being wound up.</P>
      <P>The other three amendments in this group are designed to do the same thing, in other words, to bring to this Bill a better wording of an idea passed into law by the 1990 Act.  Of course this group of amendments is only half the story since, at a later stage, I will have to circulate amendments to make certain corresponding adjustments to the 1990 Act. I had hoped to be able to table all the technical amendments concerned at the same time but, unfortunately, this has not proved possible.  I repeat that the amendments we are currently discussing are solely for the technical reasons I described, to remove overlaps between similar provisions in the Bill and the 1990 Act.</P>

      <P>I seek clarification from the Minister.  I did not get a chance to study this amendment because I only got it when I came into the House.  How does this affect a situation where an examiner has been appointed to a company and, as a result of examining the company's affairs, the examiner reports to the court in relation to what he has found?  The only course of action he is recommending is that the company be wound up.  How does this new section in the Bill fit into that?  I ask because legislation has also been passed in relation to the examiner, that fraudulent acts and so on will be dealt with by the examiner.  I tabled an amendment this morning which tried to give power to the Minister to investigate a company where an examiner had been appointed if the Minister felt that there had been fraudulent acts.  We are deleting <Col N="2166" /> subsection (1) at the moment.  Is that correct?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the Special Committee debate on section 139 I mentioned the possibility of coming back on Report Stage in the light of a potential problem with subsection (6).  The problem is that the subsection enables an application to be made at the same time or at any time after the presentation of a winding up petition in respect of any of the companies involved.  This implies that the section can only be activated where at least one of the companies is being wound up by the court, which seems on the face of it an unnecessary restriction on the scope and usefulness of the section.  For example, there does not appear to be any reason why access to the section should not also be available where the companies concerned are in voluntary liquidation. Subsection (6) was not drafted with <Col N="2169" /> this limiting effect in mind but with a view to applying a set of mechanics to the section's operation.  Having sought advice in the meantime, the best thing to do in the circumstances is to delete subsection (6) altogether since it does not really add anything to the section.  In any event, this is the type of procedural provision which would be best left to the rules of the court.  The amendment will delete subsection (6) from section 139 since it serves no useful purpose and might be misleading.</P>

      <P>In page 110, line 4, to delete &ldquo;director, manager, liquidator, or receiver, or any officer&rdquo;, and substitute &ldquo;officer, liquidator, receiver or examiner&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These two amendments arose from comments made in the Special Committee on three aspects of section 140.  Deputy O'Dea noticed that while the reference in subsection (1) was to a past or present director, the reference to &ldquo;officer&rdquo; was simply to a serving officer.  The Deputy correctly implied that the effect was to exclude any previous company secretary who is defined as an officer under the 1963 Act.  The first of these amendments would rectify this anomoly.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barrett saw no reason why examiners should not be covered by the section, particularly since liquidators and receivers were covered.  On reflection, I agreed, and the two amendments would now include examiners within the scope of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present text of the section specifically mentions managers as a category of people who would be covered by the section.  This led to a substantial debate in the Special Committee.  Having reflected on the matter in the meantime, I accept that references to managers do not add <Col N="2170" /> anything to the section and the two amendments now before the House will delete the reference concerned.</P>

      <P>&lsquo;301A.&mdash;(1)  Where, at a meeting of creditors, a resolution is proposed for the appointment of a liquidator, any creditor who has a connection with the proposed liquidator shall, before the resolution is put, make such connection known to the chairman of the meeting who shall disclose that fact to the meeting, together with details thereof.</P>
      <P>(2)  Subsection (1) shall also apply to any person at the meeting, being a representative of a creditor and entitled to vote on the resolution on his behalf.</P>
      <P>(3)  Where the chairman of a meeting of creditors has any such connection as is mentioned in subsection (1), he shall disclose that fact to the meeting, together with details thereof.</P>

    <P>(5)  A person who fails to comply with this section shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £1,000.</P>
    <P>(6)  In exercising its jurisdiction under section 267 (2) or 272 (2) (which relate to the appointment or removal of a liquidator) the court may have regard to any failure to comply with this section.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I concur with Deputy Barrett.  Very useful contributions were made and suggestions adopted when we reflected on the Committee Stage debate.</P>
    <P>Section 145 of the Bill was the subject of a long discussion in the Special Committee, perhaps partly due to a misunderstanding as to the intention underlying it but also because some Deputies felt that the provision did not go far enough.  The section as it stands is modest and sets out to tackle the situation in which someone goes along to a creditors' meeting representing a creditor and then engineers the appointment as liquidator of someone from his own firm, without the other creditors being aware of the fact.  The Special Committee thought that this did not go far enough and that any connection between the creditor and the proposed liquidator should also be disclosed. On reflection I could see merit in the points made in the Special Committee debate and accordingly I have prepared an amendment to deal with the problem as a general one of disclosure rather than one of curtailing a possible abuse by a creditor's nominee.  Thus, the amendment provides that all parties attending a creditors' meeting will, if they are connected to the proposed liquidator, have to disclose that fact.  Once this disclosure is made there will be no restrictions on who a person can vote for to act as liquidator, unlike under the present wording of section 145.  It will also be noted that the same onus to disclose a <Col N="2172" /> connection will be imposed by subsection (3) of the amendment on the chairman of the creditors' meeting.  This would normally be a director of the company to be liquidated in accordance with section 266 of the principal Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>We thank the Minister for taking on board suggestions made on Committee Stage.  The new wording makes it obligatory to disclose any connection between the person being proposed as the liquidator and any of the creditors.  Subsection (4) says:</P>
      <P>For the purposes of this section, a person has a connection with a proposed liquidator if he is&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a parent, spouse, brother, sister or child of, or</P>
      <P>(b)  employed by, or partner of,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought we had got away from this brother, sister, spouse relationship.  We could list a lot of other relationships that would have the same effect and would come within the definition of a connection. A spouse is a connected person but a person living with someone is not a connected person.  I understand from an earlier amendment that the geniuses in the Department of Industry and Commerce had found a way out of this and that we have moved away from specifying relationships.  I can think of relationships that are far more likely to cause a problem than a parent or a child relationship. I can think of all sorts of combinations. Could we not have a reasonable wording for this?  If at a creditors' meeting a liquidator is being appointed, and a creditor has a close relationship that could be regarded as affecting the performance of the duty of the person to be appointed, then that creditor should have an obligation to disclose that.  I should not be given a way out by being cute enough to say the liquidator is not a parent, spouse, brother, sister, child or a partner of mine. The section should take into account that the person to be appointed may have a close influence on me or may not be in a position to do the job in a professional way because of the relationship between <Col N="2173" /> us.  There should be an onus on me to disclose that information just as there is an onus on public representatives at council meetings to declare a particular interest in or close association with a particular proposal being discussed at that meeting.  They are not allowed to get out of it by stating that they are not a parent, spouse and so on.  The rule states that if a person has a vested interest they should declare it, and we should do the same here.  The amendment states &ldquo;for the purpose of this section, a person has a connection with a proposed liquidator if he is...&rdquo; and then goes on to specify the categories of people covered.  One could get around it if the person concerned is not specified.  I do not think this is right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely with Deputy Barrett on this matter.  I have tried to come up with a wording which would cover all eventualities.  I first thought the words &ldquo;connected to or a relative of&rdquo; would be much broader-based but then wondered if &ldquo;connected to&rdquo; could be interpreted to mean a personal or lifelong friend and if such a wording would stand up in court if it became a point of law.  I am also not clear what the definition of &ldquo;connected to&rdquo; is.  It would be very difficult, if not impossible, to spell out what &ldquo;connected to&rdquo; or &ldquo;relative of&rdquo; would mean.  I presume &ldquo;a relative of&rdquo; would be interpreted to mean the various categories listed in the amendment at subsections (4) (a) and (b).  The definition of &ldquo;connected to&rdquo; is dealt with in subsection 4 (b), which reads &ldquo;employed by or a partner of&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>A much broader definition should be given as this matter of liquidation is an old pals game.  Recently, a well known company in my own county was put into liquidation and a well known friend of the owner of the business was appointed. Within two weeeks the person who closed down the place, owing massive debts including a debt of well in excess of £500,000 to the State, opened up down the road in another building using some of the plant and machinery from his former business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2174" /> However, I do not know how one could broaden the section to cover all eventualities. Does the Minister intend to introduce regulations under this section which would spell out in greater detail what is meant by the words &ldquo;employed by, or a partner of&rdquo;?  I support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcomed section 124 which put an end to the practice of an auditor of a particular company being eligible for appointment as liquidator, as I found out on a number of occasions that that was open to abuse.  I agree with the arguments made by both Deputy Barrett and Deputy Bell on this amendment because the least effective way of stamping out this abuse would be to address it on the basis of a family relationship.  The question of a family relationship is rarely an issue and usually only arises in cases where someone has appointed, say, his wife as a director, but with regard to the kind of abuse we are seeking to tackle here the old boys network is really what is at stake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not sufficient to make it a requirement that one declare one's interest in terms of some kind of filial relationship to the liquidator or the proposed liquidator before one can be appointed.  The country is small enough and regard must be had to the scale of abuse in this area, which facilitates rogue directors, the phoenix syndrome and the closing down of companies which might have considerable potential in terms of being renovated and set up again, all of which can be snuffed out through collusion between the liquidator and the directors or between the liquidator and the chief executive officer.  I do not think this section goes far enough because there are wheels within wheels in this country, more so than in any other, and for this reason the Minister should have come up with some kind of alternative construction. As Deputy Bell said, it is difficult to know exactly what is best but reference has been made, for example, to the obligation on members of local authorities, when confronted with major questions such as the rezoning of land, to declare whether they have a vested <Col N="2175" /> interest.  A great many of us would like to see a similar provision enshrined in the regulations of this House in respect of Deputies.  If there was a general duty on a creditor to declare a vested interest it might be more effective than merely imposing a requirement in the manner it is enshrined here, that is, either a filial relationship or a partnership with the proposed liquidator.  I do not think it goes far enough given that it is an area where there is &mdash; I was going to say widespread but let us not exaggerate &mdash; abuse which most of us have encountered and I am not so sure this will stamp it out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Barrett and other speakers.  It would be virtually impossible to eliminate all potential abuse, and I use that word advisedly, simply by specifying a parent, spouse, brother, sister, child or person employed by or a partner of the proposed liquidator. A person could operate under various guises in such circumstances and well within the confines of this section and the law.  An attempt should be made to tighten the wording up and we would not need to use a great deal of imagination to devise a means whereby a particular person could be represented at such meetings in such capacity as would afford preferential treatment to him or her.  It would have been preferable to omit the provision regarding disclosing family relationships etc. and find some other form of words to take on board any possible clash or conflict of interest that might arise in such instances.

      <P>We gave much thought to this matter on Committee Stage.  The points that have been advanced now were put forward at that time.  We have examined all possible aspects with a view to being more specific, if possible, but, after careful thought, reflection and study of <Col N="2176" /> any other relevant legislation, we have decided that this is the only form of words that can be used in relation to the recognised specific relationships that exist. Like other Deputies, I could list numerous scenarios of contacts, relationships, cumann or branch membership and so on.  Where does it end?  Does it extend to friendships in golf clubs?  Does it extend to close friendships in a pub?  The list is endless.  We have been scrupulous and conscientious in looking at this situation. I do not think anybody on the other side of the House has put forward a list here today that would be suitable.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 68q:</P>
      <P>In page 112, to delete line 42.</P>
      <P>This amendment arises from a query raised in the Special Committee by Deputy O'Dea who wondered why the scope of the section was confined to cases where the subsidiary being wound up was insolvent.  The Deputy felt &mdash; and on reflection I agree &mdash; that the section should apply whether or not the subsidiary concerned was insolvent.  The amendment so provides by deleting paragraph (a) of subsection (1).</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 68r:</P>
      <P>In page 113, to delete lines 36 to 42.</P>
      <P>This is an important group of amendments and I hope the House will bear with me, since I would like to introduce them in a comprehensive way.</P>
      <P>The version of section 148 which currently appears in the Bill was introduced by an amendment on Committe Stage, and represented a substantial change of emphasis compared to the version which existed prior to that.  What we did on Committe Stage was to remove the automatic application of the section in every case where a company went into liquidation and were unable to pay their debts.  The version of section 148 which currently appears in the Bill, therefore, provides that where a company are insolvent on their liquidation the court will declare that their directors will be subject to the restrictions in Chapter I of Part VII, unless the court is satisfied as to any of the matters specified in section 148. Therefore, it is now clearer than ever that directors who acted honestly and responsibly in the company concerned will have nothing to fear from the provision.</P>
      <P>When these changes were made on Committee Stage, however, a number of difficulties emerged, and I think the best way to address these is to replace section 148 of the Bill entirely, rather than attempt a number of piecemeal amendments to address the individual points involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first change I propose is to add a final clause to subsection (1), which <Col N="2181" /> essentially clarifies that where, in subsequent sections of this Chapter, a reference is made to &ldquo;a person to whom section 148 applies&rdquo;, this means a person in respect of whom the court has made a declaration under this subsection.</P>
    <P>The next change I am proposing is in subsection (2) and imports the substance of three amendments tabled in the Special Committee by Deputies Barrett and Bruton and which I said I would accept in principle.  One of the amendment was actually accepted by the Special Committee on the day, and comprises the proviso in subsection (2) (b) which appears in the latest text of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The substance of the other two Committee Stage amendments tabled by the Deputies had to do with the scope of subsections (2) (b) and (5) (c) respectively.</P>
    <P>In the amendment which I tabled in Committee, subsection (2) (b) provided that if a &ldquo;financial institution&rdquo; had put a director on a company board in certain circumstances the subsequent insolvency of that company would not of itself restrict that director from being involved in another company.  These circumstances were that the institution concerned had either lent money to, or invested in the shares of, the company concerned and had put the director on the board as a kind of <i>quid pro quo.</i></P>
    <P>However, what I really had in mind here were two distinct cases &mdash; firstly, where a bank or other moneylender had lent money to the company, or, secondly, where a venture capital company had invested in their shares.  Deputy Bruton objected, rightly, I think, to the two categories being lumped together &mdash; for example, where a bank, as opposed to a venture capital company, had invested in a company's shares, the bank's nominee director should not really enjoy the same treatment as it would if he had been nominated because the bank had lent the company money.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton's third Committee Stage amendment would have deleted subsection (5) (c) of the present text, which he claimed was far too openended.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2182" /> To get over these difficulties, I propose splitting the present subsection (2) (b) into two &mdash; in other words, subsections (2) (b) and (2) (c) in the proposed amendment. Subsection (2) (c) would now specifically mention a venture capital company, and subsection (5) would give a limited definition of the term.</P>
    <P>In subsection (3) of the amendment I propose to amend paragraph (b) in order to rectify a problem identified by Deputy Barrett, who correctly pointed out that under subsections (3) (b) and (c) all of the company's allotted share capital would have to be fully paid-up, in cash, whereas the real intention is that the &ldquo;paid-up, in cash&rdquo; requirement should apply only in respect of the minimum amounts set out in subsection (3) (a).</P>
    <P>In other words, if a plc has an allotted share capital of £5,000,000, say, we are requiring only that at least £100,000 of this should be fully paid-up in cash &mdash; to provide otherwise would, I agree, be totally unrealistic.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) represents part of my proposals to address a fundamental issue which Deputies Barrett and Bruton pursued in the Special Committee in relation to this entire Chapter, in other words, the question of restricted directors being put on what they called a black-list where their only crime may be that their company, through no fault of their own, went into insolvent liquidation.  As I mentioned at the outset, however, the fact is that under section 148 as we now have it the court will have examined the matter, including whether the person concerned acted &ldquo;honestly and responsibly&rdquo;, and it will have declared, in appropriate cases, that the person concerned should be subject to the restrictions involved.  In these circumstances, no one will find himself automatically on a black-list solely because he happened to be a director of an insolvent company.</P>
    <P>I think that the appropriate person to notify the Registrar of Companies of a restriction should be an officer of the court which imposes it, rather than the liquidator, as in section 149 (1) at present, and that is what the revised subsection (4) will now provide.  This means that <Col N="2183" /> section 149 (1) can be deleted, and that is what amendment No. 68t does.  It also means that the definition of &ldquo;relevant date&rdquo; in section 147 (4) can be deleted, and this is the effect of amendment No. 68r.</P>
    <P>Because I propose removing subsection (1) from section 149, this gives rise to a further consequential amendment to subsection (4) of section 149. That further amendment would be to remove the words &ldquo;(1) or&rdquo; from page 115, line 20.  If the House will agree, that further amendment might now be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister appears to have taken on board the various points made on Committee Stage.  We were endeavouring to see to it that the future career of a person would not be damaged simply because he happened to be the director of a company which went into liquidation, provided he had acted in good faith.  The Minister has amended the section so that only those people who have behaved improperly will be penalised by recording the fact that they were directors of a company and behaved improperly.  They would then appear on the famous list.  I welcome the fact also that it will be an officer of the court who will have the job of furnishing the information to the Registrar of Companies that somebody was a director of a particular company and behaved improperly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to learn that the Minister also agrees with the proposal we put forward on Committee Stage that we should not discourage venture capital companies from participating in the activities of companies in which they are investing by way of directorship and that, as a result, we are not in any way preventing mutual investment in companies by venture capital companies because of the fear that if something went wrong the nominee director in effect could find himself or herself in severe trouble.  From the point of view of the layman what Deputy John Bruton and I were endeavouring to do was ensure that normal business would proceed in this country; that people <Col N="2184" /> would be encouraged to invest, to help small companies to participate by way of equity, to take a place on the board of directors; that the company is run properly and that investment in that company is protected so that we progress in such a manner as will create jobs and encourage additional investment. At no time do we want to see circumstances arise in which, simply because one may be a nominee of a bank or venture capital company, if one behaves improperly one should be excluded from the provisions of the Bill in relation to the bad behaviour of directors, their incompetence or engaging in any fraudulent activities.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would assure me that what I have said is accurate.  I have listened to him very carefully and I note that he has taken on board the general principle of the points we made at the Special Committee.  Indeed, that demonstrates that all of the hard work put in at that Special Committee over many months has not gone straight out the window.  We are appreciative of that fact.</P>
    <P>Any further contribution of mine beyond that point would be nothing short of waffle because I had not had an opportunity of examining these amendments until I arrived in the Chamber.  I take the Minister's word that what he is endeavouring to do is in accordance with what we on this side of the House wish to have included in this Bill in relation to the future of business here, the encouragement of people to participate in business and to ensure that those who behave improperly will be dealt with severely; indeed, to answer that the few who do behave improperly will not in any way damage genuine people who wish to get on, creating jobs through their efforts, and will in no way discourage investment from any source in the future, so badly needed by many of our companies.</P>

      <P>In page 115, to delete lines 28 to 42, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>150.&mdash;(1)  A person to whom section 148 applies may, within not more than one year after a declaration has been made in respect of him under that section, apply to the court for relief, either in whole or in part, from the restrictions referred to in that section or from any order made in relation to him under section 149 and the court may, if it deems it just and equitable to do so, grant such relief on whatever terms and conditions it sees fit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2188" /> (2)  Where it is intended to make an application for relief under subsection (1) the applicant shall give not less than 14 days' notice of his intention to the liquidator (if any) of the company the insolvency of which caused him to be subject to this Chapter.</P>
    <P>(3)  On receipt of a notice under subsection (2), the liquidator shall forthwith notify such creditors and contributories of the company as have been notified to him or become known to him, that he has received such notice.</P>
    <P>(4)  On the hearing of an application under this section the liquidator or any creditor or contributory of the company, the insolvency of which caused the applicant to be subject to this Chapter, may appear and give evidence.</P>
    <P>(5)  Any liquidator who contravenes subsection (3) shall be guilty of an offence and liable to a fine.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment arises from an amendment tabled at the Special Committee by Deputies Seán Barrett and John Bruton. The Deputies' amendment, which I accepted on the floor of the Committee, removed a requirement that an applicant for relief under section 150 should give public notice &mdash; in other words, in the newspapers, of his intention to apply for such relief under section 150.  However, in accepting the amendment, I felt that the creditors should not thereby be kept in the dark, that, accordingly, the liquidator should be obliged to inform them that an application for relief was to be made.  Obviously, the creditors could not exercise their rights under subsection (3) of the section if they did not know an application was going to be made.  In revising the section, I am proposing five changes.  First, I have substituted the words &ldquo;section 148&rdquo; for the words &ldquo;this Chapter&rdquo; in the first line of subsection (1) for the same reason as applied in amendment No. 68u.  Second, I have made a minor change in deleting the words &ldquo;of this Act&rdquo; from subsection (1). Third, if the liquidator will now have to <Col N="2189" /> advise creditors that someone is going to apply for relief it would seem desirable to extend the period of notice in subsection (2) from ten days to 14 days. Fourth, the new subsection (3) will require the liquidator to pass on notice of intention to apply for relief, not just to creditors but to contributors as well since the latter also have <i>locus standi</i> under subsection (4).  Finally, the new subsection (5) will make it an offence for a liquidator to contravene the provisions of the new subsection (3).</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 68w.</P>
      <P>In page 115, between lines 42 and 43, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;151.&mdash;(1)  The registrar shall, subject to the provisions of this section, keep a register of the particulars which have been notified to him under section 148, and the following provisions of this section shall apply to the keeping of such a register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Where the court grants partial relief to a person under section 150, a prescribed officer of the court shall cause the registrar to be furnished with prescribed particulars of the relief, and the registrar shall, as soon as may be, <Col N="2190" /> enter the particulars on the register referred to in subsection (1).</P>
    <P>(3)  Where the court grants full relief to a person under section 150 a prescribed officer of the court shall cause the registrar to be so notified, and the registrar shall, as soon as may be, remove the particulars of any such person from the registrar referred to in subsection (1).</P>
    <P>(4)  The registrar shall also remove from the register any particulars in relation to a person on the expiry of five years from the date of the declaration to which the original notification under section 148 relates.</P>
    <P>(5)  Nothing in this section shall prevent the registrar from keeping the register required by this section as part of any other system of classification, whether pursuant to section 270 or otherwise.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>For the guidance of Deputies, I should say that what was numbered heretofore amendment No. 68a (d) is now numbered 70a.  Armed with this useful knowledge, we will proceed.</P>
    <P>There was a long debate in the Special Committee arising from section 149 (1) (b) in Chapter 1 of Part VII, with some Members of the Committee expressing strong objections to the keeping by the Registrar of Companies of what they claimed would be a &ldquo;black list&rdquo; of persons who had not been convicted of anything, and whose only &ldquo;crime&rdquo; was that they happened to have been directors of companies which went into insolvent liquidation.</P>
    <P>While the pros and cons of this were argued at some length, the Minister of State agreed unltimately to think carefully on the whole area before Report Stage to make sure, for example, that people did not stay on this list when their restriction period was finished or if they got relief from the court.  Similar arguments were made in the context of section 164, which deals with disqualified directors, under Chapter 2 of Part VII.</P>
    <P>I have given this whole issue very careful thought since Committee Stage. <Col N="2191" /> Taking first the category of people restricted under Chapter 1, my conclusion is that, rather than remove a requirement on the registrar to keep a list of these people, or indeed remain silent on the matter in the Bill, we should tackle this matter head-on, by positively requiring the registrar to keep such a list, since, on reflection, the people concerned will have been the subject of a court declaration following a thorough review of the case by the court.</P>
    <P>Thus, under the revised section 148, no one will find himself automatically subject to the restrictions in Chapter 1, and, therefore, on any list of such people, solely because he happened to be a director of an insolvent company, but rather because the court declared that he should be on such a list.</P>
    <P>Getting back to the proposed new section 151, this will require the registrar to keep a register of people in respect of whom declarations have been made by the court under section 148.  The new section will, however, also enable such people to get off the list in certain circumstances, for example where they get full relief under section 150, or where their period of restriction expires.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 70a proposes the insertion of a similar section in Chapter 2 of Part VII, to require the registrar to keep a similar register of disqualified directors.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly that these registers should be kept by the registrar, so that people who have dealings with companies will be able to find out where they stand. As regards the register dealing with people restricted under Chapter 1, the fact is that people will not now have their names entered on it simply because they were directors of insolvent companies, since section 148 now clearly provides that a person will not be restricted unless the court declares that he should be, having thoroughly examined his actions while a director of the company concerned.</P>
    <P>The two amendments I have tabled here more than adequately meet the point of amendment No. 70, in the name <Col N="2192" /> of Deputy Rabbitte which, I think, would now be unnecessary.</P>
    <P>I therefore commend these two amendments, Nos. 68w and 70a to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. S. Barrett Mr. S. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Barrett:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am seeking some clarification. Subsection (3) of amendment No. 68w provides that where the court grants full relief to a person under section 150, a prescribed officer of the court shall cause the registrar to be so notified, and the registrar shall, as soon as may be, remove the particulars of any such person from the register referred to in subsection (1).</P>
      <P>When we were discussing this matter on Committee Stage there was a general fear that people's names would go on a list without added protection or adequate guarantees that (a) they should not be on the list in the first place, (b) that there was a proper mechanism for them to go on the list, and (c) if they were to come off the list they would definitely come off the list.  Human beings are human beings and mistakes will be made.  Are there any requirements on the registrar, having deleted somebody's name, to confirm to that person in writing that the name had been deleted?  We all can find ourselves in a position where our name is on the list, or an instruction goes from one office to another that the name should no longer be on that list or a mistake can be made and the name appears on the list.  Surely there is a need to have some form of confirmation that, as a result of a request made by an officer of the court, the name has been deleted from the list and that the person in question knows his name has been so deleted.  If subsequently the person found that his name still appeared it could do serious damage to his reputation. Can we give some guarantee that there will be a mechanism whereby confirmation will be sent to that person that his name has been deleted from the list?</P>

      <P>We are getting into fairly complex amendments.  I understood the <Col N="2193" /> Minister to say that the court would decide on the people whose names would go on the list.  We are talking about a two year period.  If that be so, if for any reason a person wishes his name to be taken off the list within that two year period is there a mechanism for dealing with that or does the name automatically stay on the list as ordered by the court?  I am somewhat confused about that.</P>

      <P>It is important that this information be available and complied in the manner suggested here.  I prefer to accept that what the Minister has said effectively incorporates my amendment No. 70.  I take it that subsection (4) of the Minister's amendment means that in any event after the expiry of five years a name comes off that register.  My amendment suggested a period of ten years because of experiences we have had of business people who were involved in shady trading, sometimes at great cost to members of the public or to people directly employed by them, and who could with impunity start up again.  However, on mature reflection, perhaps five years is adequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>He does come off the list after five years.  In relation to Deputy Barrett's point, if somebody applies for and gets full relief under section 150 it is not that he gets some sort of card in the post telling him he is now off the list that is important, but that he is off the list.  If I were restricted or disqualified and I applied to the court under section 150 successfully and got full relief under section 150, one can be quite sure that within a matter of two or three days I would take myself to Dublin Castle to ensure that the registrar had so registered my coming off the list.  That would be the prudent thing to do.  I would not feel that all would be well if I got a letter or card telling me I was off the list.  Things may be different now, but the normal thing, as I recall it, was that if one lodged documents with the registrar he sent a notice back to the applicant or the lodging party to the effect that he had received the documents and/or the registration was <Col N="2194" /> now completed.  It is a little different here because he will get the notification from the court registrar.</P>
      <P>I suppose in the normal way he would send it back to the court registrar to confirm that he had done it.  He would not normally send it then to the party who was affected.  The party who was affected would, I have no doubt, if he had gone to the trouble of applying to the court under section 150, equally go to the very minor trouble and no expense of going down three or four days later to look at the file to see that his name was removed from it.  I do not think it is any extra benefit to him, certainly so far as the public are concerned, which is really what matters to him.  The fact that he got a letter saying that he was off it would not be much good to him.  It is getting off it that counts, and that, clearly, will be done.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 68x:</P>
      <P>In page 116, to delete lines 1 to 12, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;152.&mdash;(1)  This section applies to any company in relation to which a person who is the subject of a declaration under section 148 is appointed or acts in any way, whether directly or indirectly, as a director or secretary or is concerned in or takes part in the promotion or formation of that company.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2195" /> These two related amendments arise as a result of the changes to section 148 which were made in the special committee and to which I referred earlier.  In the Bill at present both paragraphs of section 152 (1) are expressed to apply from what is called the relevant date, which, under the current text of the Bill, is defined in section 147 (4) as the date on which it is proved to the court that the company are insolvent.</P>
    <P>However, because of the recasting of section 148 on Committee Stage the operative date for the provisions here should really be the date on which the court makes a declaration under section 148. The first of these two amendments rectifies this problem.</P>
    <P>Turning to the second amendment, which is 68y, the existing subsection (5) in section 152 is no longer necessary because the new subsection (1) provides that the section will apply to any company to which a restricted director is appointed or acts in any way and subsection (5) can accordingly now be omitted.</P>
    <P>In regard to the existing subsection (6) a change to the wording is required again to reflect the fact that the process of restriction will now be a court based one and that is what the new subsection (5) will do.</P>

      <P>This amendment arises from the long debate in the Special Committee on objections by Deputies Barrett and Bruton that the Minister's order-making power under this section could be abused, for example, by the Minister singling out particular companies or individuals for higher or lower figures by quintupling the amounts shortly after the enactment of the Bill or, indeed, any time, and so on. While I rejected these claims at the time, I undertook to replace the word &ldquo;cases&rdquo; in paragraph (c) by the word &ldquo;classes&rdquo;. Following further thought, I have, in framing the amendment, drawn on the wording of what is now section 169 (2) of the Bill, which is a somewhat analagous case.</P>

      <P>In page 119, lines 24 and 25, to delete &ldquo;or may require him to carry liability for any outstanding debts to any new company&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The particular part of subsection (2) which I am proposing to delete through <Col N="2197" /> this amendment was inserted in this section on Committee Stage by an amendment tabled by Deputy Rabbitte.  The Minister of State who represented me on that occasion argued strongly against acceptance of the amendment and I must say I agree with the arguments she made.</P>
    <P>I see a number of problems both in principle and in practice in leaving this option available to the court.  Section 157 is designed to deal with the question of disqualification of directors and subsection (2) sets down particular circumstances in which the court, of its own motion, or on the application of a specified person, can make a disqualification order.</P>
    <P>In principle, I do not wish to introduce sanctions into this section which the court could apply.  If the reason the court felt that a person should carry liability for the debts of a company to a new company arose from some fraud, for example, there are already many other sections in existing legislation and in the Bill where such sanctions can be imposed.  On the other hand, if a person is only guilty of a minor breach of duty, for instance, or has not made returns to the Registrar of Companies, I would see the carrying forward of liabilities in such circumstances as far too heavy a potential penalty.</P>
    <P>A further difficulty with this provision is that in practice the court would not know what the outstanding debts or ultimate deficiencies of the company concerned actually are until the end of the liquidation.  This could be years later and the director's position in the meantime would, contrary to any principles of natural justice or fair play, be completely uncertain.</P>
    <P>Finally, I think it is not appropriate simply to transfer one company's contracted debts to another company which may not even exist.  Even if it does already exist, or when it comes to exist, or when the person in question comes to be involved with it, it would be totally inequitable <i>vis-à-vis</i> the creditors of the new company to have their position worsened in this way.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 68ab accordingly <Col N="2198" /> proposes the deletion of the words inserted by Deputy Rabbitte's Committee Stage amendment and the return to the original wording of the section.  I would ask the House to accept that the disqualification provisions in Part VII of the Bill are strong enough by any standards and that to leave these extra words in section 157 (1) would be both impractical and inequitable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is certainly unusual, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, in my experience. Here we have a situation of an amendment that was actually carried on Committee Stage and now the Minister has had a look at it, does not like it and says that, notwithstanding the decision on Committee Stage, it will have to be excised now.  Deputy Barrett earlier made fair play out of an amendment on which the committee divided equally.  He adduced that as evidence of how strongly people felt about the amendment to that section, and I take his point.  Having regard to the manner in which the committee did their business, that was a very reasonable deduction.  We argued this matter <i>ad nauseam</i> on Committee Stage and the committee voted to incorporate the amendment into the section.</P>
      <P>It seems strange, to put it at its mildest, that the Minister now seeks to excise it. It is not as if it compels the court to make an order to require the person to carry the liability for outstanding debts with him to a new company; it is only in the case of the court considering it proper that it should do so.  The court may of its own motion make such a decision. Presumably, if the facts are such that it would be unfair, prejudicial or punitive in terms of the circumstances of the case, the court would not make such a decision. It seems that where an officer of the company has been guilty under the section and goes on to set up a new company it is perfectly fair in certain circumstances that he should take the mess with him. All this amendment seeks to do is to allow the court the freedom to make such a decision in that circumstance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arguments were thrashed out at great length on Committee Stage.  It was <Col N="2199" /> decided by a majority to enshrine that section in the Bill and I am very disappointed that the Minister now seeks to have it excised.  That was the wish of the select committee who had a great deal more time to study the implications of the matter than we have at our disposal this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell:</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Deputy Rabbitte's fears in this regard.  Section 157 (2) (f) refers to a person who has been persistently in default in relation to relevant requirements.  It indicates the powers the court would have in such a case.  I would much prefer to see that provision left in. It strengthens the Bill and gives the court the necessary teeth.  The Minister indicated that the court has this power under another section, but, nevertheless, it is very clear and specific in the section under discussion.  I assume it would not interfere with the section referred to by the Minister and, therefore, I see no logical reason why it cannot be left in.</P>
      <P>To return to the person who simply walks away from his responsibility, I dealt with a case where a person left £250,000 in debts behind him.  Within one week he bought the machinery, exported it and then set up another company down the road.  I do not see why the liabilities of such a person should not be carried to the new company.  The Minister said it is possible to do that under another section. The provision is very clear, simple and specific and I appeal to the Minister to retain it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully to what Deputies Rabbitte and Bell have said.  Deputy Rabbitte, in particular, based his argument more on what he feels is the impropriety or inadvisability of over-ruling a Committee Stage amendment that was carried in a special committee on 3 April.  It was not a high scoring game, the result was only 5 to 3, and we all know why.  Deputy Rabbitte, in particular, makes no rebuttal of the reasons I set out here as to why the amendment agreed on Committee Stage was not just undesirable but highly <Col N="2200" /> impractical and inequitable.  I will have to ask the House, on reflection, to realise that the amendment that was carried in the special committee clearly was one that was strongly opposed by myself before lunch and by the Minister of State after lunch on that day.  The arguments against it, a summary of which I repeated today, are still reasonable.</P>
      <P>There are a lot of other provisions in this Bill which will get at the kind of person referred to by Deputy Bell such as the provisions about reckless trading, fraudulent trading, the restrictions on directors under Chapter 1 of this Part, disqualification of directors and so on.  I do not think that in trying to get at these people &mdash; there is nobody more anxious to do so than me &mdash; we should go to the extent that this provision which I seek to exercise would do, because it is patently inequitable.  For example, a director may join somebody in a new company two years later, join with people who know nothing about his previous record, and they would suddenly find that because that person is now a director of their company they are landed with £50,000 worth of debt from a different company that went into liquidation two years earlier.  That would be terribly unfair on the contributaries in the new company. We really could not defend that case.</P>

      <P>The person would carry the liability for outstanding debts to any new company.  It is not just his personal liability we are talking about; it is the company's liability.  The instance I gave in my earlier remarks is of the effect it would have on contributories, members, shareholders, or other directors, who may have taken in that person in all innocence. What about the creditors of another company who did not know the position?  Let us say the new company owe people who are trading with them <Col N="2201" /> £100,000, and that is just about the limit of what they can carry, and the people are concerned, are watching their debt but suddenly, out of the blue and for no reason connected with the trading activities of the new company, a further £50,000 is landed on them.  The directors may meet and say they knew nothing about this, they are now gone beyond the point of no return, are insolvent and have to go into liquidation.  The existing trade creditors of the new company, who would have been able to recover their debts in the normal course of business, would suddenly find the company have gone into liquidation and they will either get nothing or some small dividend.  I am sure Deputy Rabbitte will agree, on reflection, that that would be very inequitable and it would be better that such a provision was not included in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I can see the difficulties which could face a company of which such a director might from part in the future.  I do not know how difficult it would be for a judge to make an order which was provisional in relation to somebody who started up a company and was the sole shareholder.  Should the judge have flexibility and, instead of disqualifying him, say that it was better for the creditors that the person could carry the liability and pay it back eventually?  I do not know if that would be feasible or possible in terms of company law but I can see the principle of Deputy Rabbitte's Committee Stage amendment on which there was a fair amount of discussion. As lay people, we tend to believe that somebody can serve a period of disqualification which may not be that onerous in financial terms&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I did not get an opportunity to speak on this matter.  Will the Minister agree that if a judge were given flexibility in the matter of a disqualification order against the person, the person in the course of evidence could say that if he was permitted to start a business where he was the sole shareholder he would be prepared to carry the liability because he wanted to clean the slate in relation to his debts?  Can the Minister see a situation where the judge would agree that, in those circumstances, he would permit it rather than disqualifying the person, because, from the point of view of the creditors, they would be far better off?  I think that is what Deputy Rabbitte was getting at and the committee were anxious to find a way around this.  It is a new concept but perhaps it should be applied to 1990.  Rather than shooting down what was agreed by the committee, maybe the Minister will concede those points?</P>

      <P>My question relates to the statement about which the Minister made so much play, that this could mean the difference between a solvent company trading, albeit with difficulty, and taking on board a new director together with all his baggage, indebtedness, from the past.  As a result, the company could go under.  Does the Minister agree that, in the event of this being enshrined in law, no company who were prudent about the management of their affairs would take a new director on board without clarifying whether he had such a liability in the past?  As Deputy Barrett said, it is a new concept and if it becomes part of company law no company that have their wits about them will take on somebody who walks in the back door, make him a director and find that they have an additional indebtedness of £50,000.  That would be cleared in advance and all that is being sought here is an alternative to disqualification.  The judge may consider, in all the circumstances, that it is a more <Col N="2203" /> reasonable method of handling this than disqualifying the person for whatever the stated period would be in that case.  For example, the indebtedness might be relatively small and the nature of the wind-up might be such that the particular person might be delighted to be allowed to start up again taking some encumbrances from the past.  It might suit the particular circumstances.</P>

      <P>I understand what Deputy Rabbitte was saying but, provided that all the other restrictions and conditions imposed would be sufficient to protect the company to whom the erring director would go, it is the only way to protect the innocent victims, in this case a company, who are unaware of the misdemeanours. It would work if the other conditions in the Bill are sufficient to protect the innocent party.  Having listened to Deputy Rabbitte and our own submissions on Committee Stage, the possibility of unscrupulous directors moving to new ground and bringing with them some liabilities which could have serious consequences for the company might be difficulty to insure against.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley:</NameTxt>
      <P>I will reply to these points which have just been raised by way of questions.  I am glad that Deputy Durkan agrees with me.  Deputy Rabbitte and, in a slightly different way, Deputy Sean Barrett made the point that perhaps this liability should be carried in so far as it applies to the director or an individual shareholder.  That is fair enough but, as this stands under the Committee Stage amendment, it is not a personal liability of the former director, it is a new corporate liability of the new company imposed on them, quite possibly <Col N="2204" /> without their knowledge.  I could fully sympathise with what Deputy Rabbitte said if it were only a personal liability he was carrying forward but I should like to remind him and Deputy Sean Barrett that one of the cases where a disqualification order can be made, because of the provisions of, <i>inter alia</i>, subsection 2 (c), of this section, is where a declaration has been granted under section 297a of the principal Act (inserted by section 137 of this Act) that is, that the former director has personal liability, so the point is met there.  It is enough for all of us that he should have personal liability and it is inequitable that others, unconnected with his misdemeanour, should have to pay for it.  Therefore, I ask the House to accept this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill as laid before the House by Deputy John Bruton.  The Bill proposes to improve and update section 23 of the Education Act of 1930.</P>
      <P>Section 23 empowers vocational education committees to make appointments of all staff needed to fulfil their educational responsibility in an area.  The committee have responsibility for the selection and appointment of all teaching staff including principals and vice-principals, education officers, secretarial staff, caretakers etc.</P>
      <P>Interestingly, under the 1930 Act, chief education officers must be appointed only by the local appointments committee. This was a very wise and far-seeing provision and I compliment the initiators of the Bill at that time for their wisdom.</P>
      <P>We have, however, a strange situation where there are eight vacancies for chief executive officers and the positions have been filled by acting chief executive officers.  Because this type of situation was not foreseen when the 1930 legislation was being enacted, the vocational committees concerned have appointed acting chief executive officers.  Indeed, in my own county we have such an appointment and the present Minister for Education was a member of the committee who made the appointment.</P>
      <P>I now call on the Minister to regularise the situation and make a decision about the future of vocational education committees &mdash; are they to be amalgamated or are they to continue, not knowing their destinies?  It is grossly unfair to acting chief executive officers to have them operating without security of tenure, unsure what lies ahead for them.</P>
      <P>The teaching profession is at a very low ebb.  Morale is very low.  There have been many rounds of cutbacks, presided over by this Minister.  The worsening of the pupil-teacher ratio by this Minister is something that will never be forgotten or forgiven by the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2206" /> We saw a Fianna Fáil spokesperson on education make promise after promise, but fail to deliver when returned to power.  We may well ask &ldquo;what is new&rdquo;? As a result of these cutbacks and deteriorating conditions teachers feel let down by this Minister.</P>
    <P>Teachers are a responsible professional body.  They provide an excellent professional service, despite the poor conditions and lack of resources under which they operate.  Indeed our teaching body are the envy of our partners in Europe. Having been a teacher for almost 20 years, I am very much aware of how stressful and difficult the job can be.  The teachers within the vocational school system deserve a professional approach to appointments and applications for posts of responsibility.  A vocational education committee is made up of locally elected representatives and a number of appointees.</P>
    <P>An interview panel to allocate positions is elected from this committee. This interview group can be any combination of members of the committee. Familiarity with schools or the teaching profession, skills in interview techniques or ability to select personnel, carry no weight in selecting an interview panel.  Is it reasonable to ask a teacher who is selected to sit on this interview panel to give a judgment on a number of his colleagues who have applied for a post of responsibility?  Is it reasonable for the teachers concerned to have their colleague decide their future?</P>
    <P>In many of the vocational education committees around the country we have teacher members who are sitting on these same interview panels.  They are interviewing their colleagues for posts of responsibility and for teaching posts. That is totally unacceptable.  It is reasonable that references, qualifications and details of one's working life be available to somebody who may be a work colleague, to somebody who may be a parent of a pupil at the school, to somebody who may be of an opposite political persuasion or maybe worst of all, to somebody who may be a rival with the same political party?  Is i <Col N="2207" /> reasonable that those details should be available to them?</P>
    <P>Are we all not aware of instances where interview panel or committee members have had to make such decisions?  Whereas I accept that decisions were made in good faith there is the suspicion of political favouritism, the suspicion that a candidate did not get a fair chance.  This, whether it be justified or not, leads to a suspicion of the appointments system and teachers can and do identify vocational education committees which they feel are grossly manipulated in this way.</P>
    <P>This is the system in place for our vocational teachers.  They deserve a more professional approach to appointments. They deserve an independent, impartial body who will give the job to the person best suited for the position, the person best suited to educate our young people.</P>
    <P>I urge all sides of the House to support this Bill.  Indeed the Minister speaking in 1989 saw some merits in just such a Bill. Indeed, I am delighted to see Deputy Quill in the House tonight.  It will be very interesting to see what approach the Progressive Democrats, the junior partners in Government, will adopt tonight, because it was Deputy Quill speaking in this House on 21 September 1989 on a similar Bill who said:</P>
    <P>I see no material in this Bill for any kind of controversy.  What it advocates is essentially right and I have no great quarrel about it.</P>
    <P>I wonder, when we come to 8.30 p.m. tonight and the bell tolls, which way Deputy Quill will go.  I know she will be faced with a dilemma.  Will she stand by her principles of 18 months ago or will she be steamrolled through the lobbies by the senior partner in Government?</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> This is the second time in less than two years that we have had a Bill of this kind before the House.  It seems to call into question the operation of the vocational education committee structure.  It seems to question the ability, professionalism and integrity of teachers in the system of education that has served us so well since 1930.  Deputies on the Opposition side have talked a lot about suspicion.  Are they really saying that the teachers we have in the Vocational Education Committee system only got the jobs because of their political affiliations or because they happened to know someone on the selection board or because a friend of a friend knew someone on the selection board?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> This is insulting to the whole profession and to the ability of the teachers in the VEC system. People go through a difficult system to qualify as teachers.  In many cases people have made sacrifices to become competent teachers.  In the VEC system we have the most professional and competent teachers in any sector of teaching here.  They do not deserve this ill-conceived, badly thought out Bill coming from the largest opposition party in the country.  It calls into question a most democratic education system at a time when all sides of the House are speaking about the need to reform local government and the need to give more power to local councillors and the people.  This appears to be a classic case of double <Col N="2209" /> standards in that on the one hand they want to give powers to local councillors and the people but on the other they want to take back the powers held by vocational education committees.</P>
      <P>The attitude of the top brass of the TUI, who support this Private Members' Bill, is hard to figure out.  In my years in politics &mdash; about ten or 11 &mdash; between the Dáil and the county councils and during the seven years I was a member of the County Wexford Vocational Education Committee I never received one complaint about the appointments system for vocational education teachers or about the ability of teachers appointed.  It seems that the executives of the TUI in supporting the Bill are placing a question mark over the ability of some of their teachers.  It is unbelievable that they are objecting to the continuation of the selection system that exists, the system they came through and were quite happy to accept on being appointed as teachers or to posts of responsibility, such as principal or vice-principal.  They issued statements during the past week or ten days to the effect that they support the Bill but did not explain their reasons.  It is important that they do because they have placed a question mark over the ability of some of their teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vocational education system is the most democratic system of education in Ireland.  Indeed, the 1930 Act is the only real education Act we have and it has proved to be very adaptable in the intervening period.  In my time the VECs offered the group certificate and trained people in the basics, which allowed them to go on to become apprentice mechanics, carpenters or blocklayers.  They have come a long way in the past 20 years and now offer both intermediate and leaving certificate courses.  The results achieved in VEC schools are on a par with those achieved in any other school. Indeed, the results achieved in the leaving certificate in some VEC schools in County Wexford were better than those achieved in other schools in the county and elsewhere.  That is an indication that the legislation has stood the test of time. <Col N="2210" /> I see no reason why we should change the system just for the sake of change or because there is a suspicion or doubt.</P>
    <P>The VECs are now offering a new range of subjects and programmes.  For example, we have the Youthreach programme, which is available in Deputy Howlin's home town, Wexford.  I would like to see the Minister make this programme available in my home town of Enniscorthy, as it is well known that the town has the highest rate of school leavers and youth unemployment in the country. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, to see to it that this programme is expanded to other towns where it should prove to be beneficial.</P>
    <P>Other programmes on offer include the vocational training opportunities programme, the vocational preparation and training programme, outdoor and adult education programmes.  That is an indication that teachers, principals and chief executive officers have been able to meet the challenge presented by the changes in education and provide a very valuable service to our young people.</P>
    <P>The Bill is based on suspicion, rumour and the isolated case of a bad appointment. Deputy Bruton said &mdash; and I wish to congratulate him on his appointment as Leader of Fine Gael and wish him well in that position &mdash; that the scheme has been 99.9 per cent successful.  If a scheme is so successful, why change it?</P>
    <P>We need to look at the political aspect of the selection process to which the other side of the House gave much attention. There are two selection boards in County Wexford on which the Fine Gael Party are represented.  They have always been fair and selected the best teachers available. I have at times been very critical of the selection boards because more often than not they selected teachers from outside the county even though I have always felt Wexford has the best teachers. However, they were not biased and selected teachers purely on their ability. It saddens me when I see politicians undermining their ability.  We cheapen ourselves too often and the role we have to play.  If we do not have any respect for ourselves we will soon find that the public <Col N="2211" /> will become cynical and will not have much respect for politicians.  The selection boards have done a good job and have selected only the best.  I commend them on their integrity and the professional way they have gone about their duties.  The teachers, principals and vice-principals they selected were top of the class and there is no doubt they are more than capable of teaching our young people in the way they deserve to be taught.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche:</NameTxt>
      <P>On a memorable occasion Deputy Michael D. Higgins attacked the view that because an activity is associated with politics it must necessarily be venal. I, too, await the bells at 8.30 p.m. to see if he will stand by that principle.  Deputy John Bruton was leader of this House and is now leader of the country's second largest political party.  I wish him well in his appointment.  He aspires to be the political leader of the nation but I do not wish him well in that aspiration.  He has stated that politics is an honourable practice but in this ill-conceived measure he impugns not just those democratically elected men and women who sit on our VECs but attacks the sagacity and commonsense of those who elected them, the people of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a fundamentally flawed proposition. It contains a number of very serious flaws.  First, it is based on the evidently contradictory view as to the proper role of local government in Ireland.  In this regard it is yet another example of the tendency of Deputy John Bruton to always try to face in at least two directions at the same time.  From time to time he and his party talk about creating a vibrant and relevant local government system but if this Bill is implemented it will be a further step in the wrong direction and in destroying those little areas of decision-making left to local government.  Second, the Bill, if enacted, will further centralise and hamstring the operations of the vocational education sector, which is already over burdened &mdash; we all accept this &mdash; with bureaucratic centralism.  Third, the Bill, <Col N="2212" /> and the speeches made in support of it, casts a slur on the members of the vocational education committees who serve without ever seeking personal advantage.  It casts a shadow of suspicion on each and every teacher working in the VEC sector at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche:</NameTxt>
      <P>Fourth, without a shred of justification, the measure focuses on the one and only sector in education where there is any real democratic control. The mover of the Bill, Deputy Bruton, has not justified his decision to stigmatise the VECs or their employees nor has he or any of the speakers in favour of the Bill provided any acceptable justification for the decision to effectively ignore other teaching appointments also funded from the public purse which very frequently are made on the basis of a porcedure no more elaborate than a phone call and which are subject to no form of democratic control.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickRoche" hpid="Mr. Roche Mr. Roche">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Roche:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this just another example of Fine Gael double standards or does it mean that the young tiger is in reality no more than the timid wee beastie willing only to take the odd cock shot at the safe targets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fifth, the &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; is yet another example of the classical tendency of using a sledgehammer to crack a peanut. Deputy Bruton suggested that 99.99 per cent of all appointments are fine, fair and good and there is nothing wrong with them.  Why introduce such a bureaucratic device as this to look after the 0.01 per cent in respect of which he has a doubt? Nobody can say that the many thousands of appointments that have been made by the VECs are perfect, certainly that would not be my view.  However, none of the supporters of this Bill have produced a shred of evidence to support the contention that there is any significant cause for concern with the vast and overwhelming bulk of teacher appointments <Col N="2213" /> in the VECs.  No compelling evidence has been produced to suport the replacement of a locally based, relatively flexible system of appointment which has a democratic input by a centralised, highly inflexible, undemocratic system which would increase the level of bureaucracy and would inevitably delay school appointments.</P>
    <P>Like many other Members of this House I am a member of a VEC.  I do not say I have much experience in that regard but it goes back to 1985.  I am sure also that the VEC of which I am a member is not unique, different, special, above reproach or better than all the other 38 VECs in the country.  The general selection board of the VEC, of which I am a member, is made up of four members of the VEC, a departmental inspector and the chief executive officer acting as a non-voting secretary to the board.  There is nothing unique in that. As it happens, three members of the selection board are currently serving as elected public representatives, two are from Fine Gael, the third is a member of Fianna Fáil, the fourth &mdash; a lay member &mdash; is a distinguished ex-member of this House, now retired, who was a TD in my own party.  Those four people give of their time.  They are supported in giving of their time to the selection process by an excellent chief executive officer, a man of the utmost integrity, and they are supported further by a paid public official from the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>In the case of appointments to principals, vice-principals and A post holders, a representative of the IVEA is brought on the board.  I saw these details into the record because this is the way it is in other VECs also.  If there was any cause for public concern, if there was sculduggery &mdash; political or otherwise &mdash; there are many whistle-blowers in the system without even bringing into consideration the trade unions, who would put the finger on what is wrong.  The reality is that this is a shabby piece of politics which is aimed at a public who are ever interested in believing the worst of politicians.</P>
    <P>To refer to the comments of Deputy Michael D. Higgins, he said that not only <Col N="2214" /> was politics an honourable practice but that the reality was that he would prefer more involvement by politicians because in the end whether you are happy or unhappy with the political system at least you have the capacity to vote the people out.  The reality is that the present system of selection in the VECs is a good one, it has worked well.  Deputy John Bruton said that 99.99 per cent of the appointments are good.  Why, in the name of goodness, focus so much energy on changing what he regards as excellent?  I wish to share the balance of the time with Deputy Quill.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies Roche and Browne for sharing their time with me.  This legislation has an interesting history.  It was introduced to this House by Deputy George Birmingham, the then Fine Gael spokesman for Education, in February 1989.  When the subject matter was debated in great detail by Members of all parties.  I spoke during that debate on behalf of the Progressive Democrats. My contribution is best summed up by the statement of the former Deputy Birmingham in his reply to the debate &mdash; Official Report of 1 March 1989, column 2095:</P>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats, while going along with this Bill, indicated through their spokesman, Deputy Máirín Quill, an impatience to see wider reforms being introduced.  She was anxious to see legislation dealing with rationalisation of the VEC system... around the country.  I share that sense of impatience and I accept entirely that it would be preferable not to proceed on a piece meal basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was my position then.  That is my position now.  The 1989 debate on this issue was one of the most constructive Private Members' debates since I became a Member of Dáil Éireann.  There was a strong measure of cross party support for the principle of bringing about fundamental changes and improvements in the appointment procedures within the VEC system.  No vote was taken.  To <Col N="2215" /> those who stated in the public press recently that the Progressive Democrats voted for the Bill on that occasion I say, not so.  The Progressive Democrat Members, in common with all other party Members from whatever side of the House, neither voted for nor against.</P>

      <P>What happened then was that the Ceann Comhairle declared and I quote from the Official Report of 1 March 1989 at column No. 2097:</P>
      <P>Standing Order 87 in respect of a Private Members' Bill of this kind provides that should a Private Members' Bill pass its Second Reading it shall then be transferred to a select or special committee...</P>
      <P>This never happened.  The ill-fated Bill fell victim to the subsequent general election and a different kind of voting took place.  Some of those who were involved at that time did not return to the House.</P>
      <P>I am aware that in her speech last week, the Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, made it clear that the present coalition Government's policy is to devolve as much responsibility as possible from central government to local government and this extends to the education sector also.  I endorse this commitment. The Minister also stated &mdash; column 1326 of the Official Report of 13 November 1989 that:</P>
      <P>The proposal that the appointment of teachers in vocational schools, and to those schools alone, should be determined centrally runs counter to this policy and argues against local democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2216" /> I accept the point made by the Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, but only to a point.  In my view, while the principle of local selection is a good one, the guiding shape of the selection process should be that the selection body should be an expert group with professional qualifications and one which would not be open to the suspicion, as in most cases, of political interference or pressure. That is the nub of the issue.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats believe that that issue must be tackled and so we are consistent with our stand of 1989 when we state that this matter must be addressed in the wider context of rationalisation of the VEC sector.  We will be working to that end and we will not be supporting the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Bill on behalf of the Labour Party as my colleague, the party spokesman on Education, Deputy Brian O'Shea, did in principle last night.  We are consistent in supporting this Bill in principle.  It is the stand we took when the Bill was last discussed in this House in March 1989. The principle that underlines this Bill, which has been clearly articulated already by Deputy Quill, is simple.  The fundamental principle is that appointments to all vacancies in the public domain should be fair and be seen to be fair, and that the same should apply to promotions.  Regardless of the reality of the situation, the perception among teachers and others is that the current procedure for appointing teachers in the vocational sector does not have the confidence of everybody.  That is a fact <Col N="2217" /> regardless of whether we, as individuals, have confidence in it.  There is a body of opinion, particularly among the teaching profession, that does not share that confidence.</P>
      <P>Mention has already been made during the debate of an important IMS survey carried out among teachers on equality of opportunity in teaching.  Whatever we think about surveys and opinion polls, most of us would accept that that survey was an objective and fair analysis of the opinion of teachers on equality in education and teaching.  On the issue of the appointment procedures to appoint vocational teachers respondants were asked to rate procedures for appointment on a scale from zero to ten &mdash; zero being not at all satisfactory and ten being extremely satisfactory.  The average figure was 5.1.  The reality is that this medium line indicates that a very large number of teachers are less than satisfied that the procedures under which appointments and promotions are made are objective and fair.</P>
      <P>What were the two issues which caused concern?  First, there was a perception of political bias or influence and, second, that the relevant boards lacked the qualifications or competence necessary for interviewing in specific subject or job areas.</P>
      <P>We can all trot out the history of our membership of vocational educational committees, we can all say how wonderful we are as individual members and that we do not know any individual members who are less upright, who have less integrity or who are less honest than ourselves, but we cannot ignore the fundamental reality that there is a perception out there that all is not well as regard the procedures under discussion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>We can do several things. For example, we can ignore that evidence &mdash; I am sure some Members would advocate this &mdash; and decide that since we have confidence in the system nothing needs to be changed.  That is a fatuous argument <Col N="2218" /> in the light of the evidence.  We need to restore confidence.  That is why I believe the principles in this Bill drew such widespread support across parties when it was introduced.</P>
      <P>Although I indicated that the medium view was about 5.1, I should like to draw particular attention to the fact that women had less confidence in this system. That is significant and is something to which we must pay attention.  More and more women are becoming involved in the workplace &mdash; thankfully teaching has always attracted a very large number of women &mdash; but it is clear that women do not think they get equal treatment when it comes to appointments and promotions.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that perception exists only in the vocational sector.  In the primary sector, in which I worked, when it came to the appointment of principals or promotions within national schools a very large number of women believed there was a preconceived notion that the job of principal in a rural school was a man's job and, therefore, they could not have it.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may mix quotations to suit the cause &mdash; it is a ploy regularly used by the Deputy and his party, but it will not get away from the fundamentals which need to be addressed in this Bill.</P>
      <P>We are being asked on Second Stage, which is all that is before us tonight, to endorse a simple principle, that is, the need for change in the current methodology used for promotions and for appointing vocational teachers.  Deputy Quill said she agreed with that principle but then, mind bogglingly, jumped to the conclusion that one need not vote for the Bill.  If one accepts the principle of the need for change, one must support the Bill.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that the Bill is perfect. In fact my colleague, Deputy Brian O'Shea, the Labour Party spokesman on Education, has indicated that on Committee Stage &mdash; should the parties on the other side allow us have a Committee Stage &mdash; we will bring forward amendments to ensure, at least in some measure, that there is local involvement in the appointment of teachers to local schools.  I believe this can be done.  We can debate it and express our views by way of consensus as when the Fianna Fáil Party were in a minority in this House and could not steamroll and bully other Members and parties into their narrow way of thinking.  It is a pity that that consensus, that progressive view, which existed then is not shared now.  Now that the two parties on that side of the House have a majority, their Members, whatever their principles and views, are dragged into having a single view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2220" /> As I have indicated, I have reservations about this Bill.  I have reservations about the suitability of using the Local Appointments Commission as the vehicle for appointments.  However, we can argue that on Committee Stage, if we are allowed to have such a debate. We should have the widest possible consultation in advance of a Committee Stage debate so that the views of teachers, their unions and parents can be taken into account.</P>
    <P>I listened to the debate last night and, in particular, to the contributions of the Fianna Fáil Members who have a difficulty with this Bill.  They have a difficulty with this Bill tonight notwithstanding the fact that their party had no difficulty allowing the previous Bill to pass Second Stage in March 1989. I genuinely accept that some Members on that side may believe that if they support this Bill it might be tantamount to a slight on members of vocational education committees.  That is simply not the case.</P>

      <P>Vocational education committees are the core of democratic education.  The Labour Party have a very honourable and consistent view on this issue.  I was Education spokesman for the Labour Party for some years and I had the privilege and pleasure of reading the earliest policy documents emanating from any party.  As early as 1928 we were advocating a comprehensive democratic education system.  That is still our view and we still argue it as a fundamental principle of reform of education democratic accountability.  It may be argued that when T. J. O'Connell wrote the policy documents of 1928 he was before his time but that document is still inspirational and valid today.  The time has now come when the issue of democracy and democratisation is in vogue.  I hope this will come to pass even under this Minister who does not have the last record when it comes to democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have always defended and praised <Col N="2221" /> the vocational education sector and the service of individual members of vocational education committees, and that remains the case.  It is a perversion for anybody to suggest that to seek to reform a system in any way is a slight on serving members.  Those serving members themselves know that this is not the case.  It is a travesty to ascribe those motives to people who seek in honesty to have reform in the education sector.</P>
    <P>I have said that the Labour Party view on this matter is constant.  That is a feature of our party.  We are consistent and we are constant.  In many ways we have suffered because of our consistency. We do not stand up in the morning, put a finger in the air and decide which way the wind is blowing.</P>

      <P>I will return to the subject matter of the Bill.  Regarding the Progressive Democrats, I have greater cause or hope and greater expectations.  On the last occasion they supported this measure.  I understand the rather shaky logic used by Deputy Quill tonight and the red-faced approach to this House. The veneer is wafer thin.  The principal issue of this Bill is the same as it was last year.  I understand they have taken the decision that the principle is not important enough to shake an already shaky coalition.  They have done their macho thing this month and a repeat performance, regardless of the principle, is not acceptable.  They will bite the bullet and accept that they cannot support a measure which in their heart and soul they would like to support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The essence of this Bill is simple.  It is a call for change.  It was supported by all parties in this House a matter of months ago.  The Minister for Education indicated during her contribution last night that she was considering change in this area.  She stated that when this matter was last before the House it was indicated from the Government side that the question of amending the Vocational Education Act, 1930 was under consideration, in relation in particular to the question of rationalisation of the VEC service and the amalgamation of some of the existing VECs.  She said it was her intention to consider the question of teacher appointments by VECs in the context of this amending legislation.  The Minister acknowledges the need for change.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, who is representing the Government tonight, acknowledged the need for change when he spoke in this House on <Col N="2223" /> 1 March 1989, as reported in the Official Report at column 2091.  All sides have expressed the need for change.  There is a demand from the teacher unions for change.  Why not accept that in principle and in a spirit of consensus look at the actual changes we would like to implement for the good of the education service?  One day we will come up with a proposition from the Opposition benches.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State asked a very pertinent question which I intend <Col N="2224" /> to answer.  There is a very valid answer but I will tease the Minister before I give it.  Our party have consistently advocated a policy in this area of education.  It is the bulwark of democracy in the sphere of education in that it involves locally elected people at local authority level who represent the people who elect them to provide an education system which will be seen to be fair and to cover the educational spectrum required by the electorate.  We have had very competent teachers who provide the most important element of education at local authority level.  As a past member of a vocational education committee I pay tribute to the teaching profession who have been involved over the years since the initiation of VECs.  Having worked with them on committees and having accepted representations from them I can say that their concerns were for the pupils who were their responsibility.  They were always open and frank in discussions with elected members of VECs.</P>
      <P>When teachers apply for posts it is accepted that they will already be suitably qualified.  The trauma of having to canvass political parties of all views at local level before they can be sure of an appointment must be most degrading for qualified teachers.  If all things were equal we would look after our friends, but unfortunately in 1985, the majority party in Government swept the boards at the local elections.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris:</NameTxt>
      <P>They managed to cajole themselves into power by securing a majority.  They dominated the selection process in all the local authorities for the various subsidiary bodies including health boards, county committees of agriculture and vocational education committees. A balance was only achieved when other nominating bodies such as the urban councils were brought in because Fianna Fáil had not been as successful in those elections.  Only with that kind of balance was there an opportunity for any other part of the political spectrum to be <Col N="2225" /> involved at VEC level.  In my constituency we were presented with a <i>fait accompli</i> by the Fianna Fáil whip.  They could decide whom they wanted on each body because they had enough votes to carry their proposals.  From 1985 onwards there was the belief that if you were not a Fianna Fáil supporter you had a very slight chance of being successful in the canvass for the job for which you were qualified.  That is one of the problems being encountered.  When we were in Government there was fairness right across the nominating procedures in local authorities which ensured there was a fair balance between all of us at the various subsidiary committees, including the VECs.  There was always that understanding between all of us.  The Fine Gael and Labour people in my constituency &mdash; who, as it happened, had a majority &mdash; always ensured there were Fianna Fáil representatives not alone on the committee but also involved in the actual process of selection.  Always there was resentment on the part of members of the selection boards if any of us interfered in their decision-making process in the presence of a departmental inspector.  At least there appeared to be some element of fair play about the whole process.</P>
      <P>Nowadays it is different.  That is why we are supporting a change; we are not supporting change for change's sake.  We do not believe people should apologise because they are politically minded or because there is anything wrong with being political; there is not.  The problem arises when there is a dominant group within the selection processes that scrutinize meticulously the political affiliations of teacher applicants.  It is then time for us at least to ascertain how we can render it more democratic at local level.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the provisions of the Bill are not devising the right system of appointing teachers.  In 1989 all Members of this House, of whatever party, agreed to allow it get a Second Reading, that it be referred to a Committee of the House, when we could then ascertain whether some improvements should be built in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister of State likes to <Col N="2226" /> have his facts.  I can itemise conclusive evidence &mdash; I will even name some examples &mdash; of the hypocrisy of endeavouring to maintain that this system is great because it is administered by locally elected politicians.</P>
    <P>There was the case of a vice-principal in a community college who was nominated for appointment by the selection board.  The VEC, at a subsequent meeting, endeavoured to overturn that recommendation and appoint another person. It so happened that that other person himself was a nominee of the Fianna Fáil Party and had sat on the main committee; he was not on the actual selection board but was a member of the committee.  Of course his colleagues decided, when he was not chosen, they would endeavour to overturn the decision of the selection board itself.  The House knows what happens when that takes place.  If that matter is brought before the VEC and the relevant chief executive officer, he is then required to advise the Department, then the unions become involved because they observe the damage done to some of their members.  This means they, in turn must lobby the Department of Education to ensure that their member, who is properly qualified, is appointed as was decided by the selection board.  That is an example of an occasion when the selection board did not nominate the god-child of the main political party on the committee.</P>
    <P>In the academic year 1979-80 there was another example of a person who was interviewed and recommended for appointment as vice-principal of a vocational school &mdash; I am sorry Deputy Roche is not present &mdash; in Deputy Roche's constituency.  At the time of the interview the person himself was a member, as was his mother-in-law, of the same party; not alone was she a member of the committee but she was also a member of the selection board.</P>
    <P>As elected public representatives there is an obligation on all of us &mdash; going forward at local level &mdash; to declare a vested interest in planning and all other areas.  If we are to be honest with ourselves and convince the public that we <Col N="2227" /> are seen to be fair, we must ensure the public are so satisfied.  Were I serving on a selection board and a relative of mine was applying for a post &mdash; if that relative was also a member of the committee &mdash; surely to God there would be an obligation on me to disclose my vested interest and exclude myself from that decision?  But that was not done in this case.  That is one of the problems obtaining. Again, of course, the union would be obliged to intervene.  Otherwise there would not be fair play.</P>

      <P>Just in case the Deputy wants them he can read them from the record.  Those are the dates for referral purposes but because the Acting Chairman rightly would request me to refrain from mentioning people's names who are not in this House to defend themselves, I have no intention of so doing.  Nonetheless they are a matter of public record. Anything I have said is a matter of public record, has been quoted and has not been refuted, even on mature reflection, by Deputy Roche.  I suggest that if he has any problems about the examples I have given he should read the facts.  Deputy Roche was most anxious to quote Deputy Michael D. Higgins whose policy in this area is impeccable.  I suggest Deputy Roche might learn something from the impeccability of Deputy Michael D. Higgins.</P>
      <P>We are supporting this Bill on Second Stage.  We should like to see it referred to an all-party Committee of the House. We would like to go down the road Deputy Quill has suggested; possibly that is the correct way.  Obviously that is also what the Minister herself wants.  If she feels there is need for improvement in this process, then all of us are correct. We want to ensure that the public see change brought about, that the professional people to whom we are so obligated will see that the system is equitable so that they can go about their business without pandering to politicians of any hue.  For that reason, I support the Bill.</P>

It would be undesirable, and unachievable, for Deputy Bruton to attempt to take his party, and the country, up the high road to infallibility, and if this Bill is anything to go by that would appear to be one of his objectives.  The fact that a Bill similar to this lapsed with the dissolution of the House last year should have given us all, including those who supported it at the time, time to reflect more on its merits or otherwise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have noted carefully the contributions by Deputies who support the Bill for evidence which might convince me that VECs should be singled out for special attention.  Nothing I have heard has persuaded me that this should be the case.  Of all the areas of education comprising primary, secondary and third level, the VEC system would appear to operate the fairest and most open method of selecting teachers.  The suggestion being floated in this debate is that a selection board which includes politicians of various hues is much less likely to have integrity than one set up by the Local Appointments Commission.  I reject this emphatically.  Even Deputy Bruton has stressed that 99.99 per cent of VEC appointments are beyond criticism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the human factor involved in any such procedure, a success rate of this magnitude must surely suggest that the system could not be bettered anywhere in the world.  One would presume that any selection board would be comprised of dedicated citizens each of whom would be a voter with a deeply held political view of one kind or another.  No one is suggesting that any such person on a local appointments commission board would allow his or her judgment to be <Col N="2232" /> clouded accordingly.  However, in the case of VEC boards the elected members have declared their political views openly.  I would have thought this makes it even less likely that they would allow themselves to be seen as less than objective.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton, in the second of two examples he cited, referred to a case where a successful applicant for promotion was a member of the relevant VEC, as was his mother-in-law, and neither of them had declared an interest. The implication was that they were both on the selection board.  This seems ludicrous because it would suggest that the applicant had interviewed himself, in much the same way as &mdash; presumably &mdash; Deputy Bruton interviewed himself for the leadership of the Fine Gael Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>I would certainly share the concern that in all such matters people should avoid a conflict of interest, but this applies equally to all methods of selection.  The argument that teachers should be selected only by professionals is not sustainable.  When the Civil Service Commission set up a board to interview applicants for public service posts they include non-professional civil servants as well as a member or members of the appropriate profession.  This is done because of their obvious belief that the whole persona of the applicant should be looked at and not merely his or her academic achievements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking here about the VEC system under which the original vocational schools were set up by people with admirable foresight in 1930 &mdash; admirable foresight is what one would expect from a Kerryman, John Marcus O'Sullivan &mdash; and under which a Fianna Fáil Government with matching wisdom subsequently set up the regional technical colleges which revolutionised third level education in Ireland.  The system has served us well.  It has produced a body of <Col N="2233" /> teachers second to none in the world and their graduates in Ireland and elsewhere are ample testimony to that.</P>
    <P>The Minister in her speech has, with commendable clarity, explained the procedures and outlined the ongoing developments over which she is presiding. The system is well served by dedicated and unpaid elected representatives of local communities.  She has also referred to the repeated endorsements of the selection procedures by none other than the head of the Local Appointments Commission.  This fact alone, together with the fact that the IVEA endorse the selection process, should convince people that we should leave well enough alone.</P>
    <P>Nobody has suggested in this debate that appointments made by various Governments down the years should be changed or that the system should be changed.  Nobody suggested that a Government should not appoint district justices, Circuit Court judges, High Court judges or Supreme Court judges and nobody suggested a Government should not appoint the Chief Justice.  To take it a step further, nobody suggested a Government should not appoint a Commissioner of the Garda Síochána or the Ombudsman.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>His role is to examine complaints about the bureaucratic procedure.  The attitude of some Members, taking the matter to its logical conclusion, would appear to be that it is all very well for politicians at national level to make appointments at national level which are extremely important and affect the everyday lives of every individual, but it is not all right for local politicans, who may well aspire to becoming national politicians, to make appointments in relation to 6 per cent of our schools.  Let us be fair and honest about this, that suggests a &ldquo;holier than thou&rdquo; attitude, a feeling that, while we are <Col N="2234" /> inspired from on high in the national Parliament in relation to some of the most important appointments in the State, those elected to local authorities, and who give of their time voluntarily day in and day out, are not qualified to make these appointments at all for the reason that they are politicans.  Perhaps those who would suggest that a nod or a wink or a stroke is the order of the day in relation to the appointment of teachers in the vocational education sector would do well to remember that there is no other system of education today which appoints its teachers as openly as do the VECs.  It is extremely wrong, and most unfair, to single out these committees above any other committee or system for special treatment and an examination under the microscope.  I accept that reviews and examinations are necessary, but this microscopic examination has begun to border on the ludicrous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the situation in other schools regarding the selection of teachers?  Secondary schools select their own teachers and the State has no input whatsoever. The State has an input, with a member on the selection board, in regard to VEC appointments.  There is a system of selection for primary schools but again it is completely different from what Deputy Bruton proposes in this Bill.  Is there a valid or good reason why the selection procedure in vocational schools should be different from the procedure in community and comprehensive schools?  One could go on forever in this vein, but one thing is abudantly clear to everybody, that we cannot simply single out the VECs for microscopic consideration. This is more especially the case when one considers the contribution of the VECs to Irish education over the years, not just in relation to second level education but to third level education, and their contribution to people who through no fault of their own were unable in the early years of this State to get an education.  I mean their contribution to adult education, sport and the arts.  They have made a massive contribution to our education culture but this debate has taken a twist whereby, by innuendo at <Col N="2235" /> least, it has been suggested, regrettably, that their contribution was given with less than full integrity or full commitment.</P>
    <P>The evidence is different and one has to examine the evidence to decide whether the system worked.  Is it not fair to say that in Irish vocational education today we have some of the finest teachers not just in this country but in western Europe or indeed the world?  Is it not true to say that most of the people who graduate from Irish vocational schools, and from Irish regional colleges, are among the best educated and most able people one could wish to meet?  Are they the products of a corrupt system?  Are they not the products of a system which has served the Irish people admirably over so many years?  The evidence has to be examined and I suggest that, in this instance, it is irrefutable.</P>
    <P>There is a second innuendo that relates to the position of local councillors.  I will not say it is the most regrettable innuendo but it is one of them.  It is that there was a Ballymagash-type outfit in the community ready to nod, stroke and wink at any opportunity that presented itself in order to gain extra votes at election time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is unfair to the locally elected democratic representatives. No local representative ever went into public life for personal gain.  They are unpaid servants of the Irish people. They deal with people's problems on a daily basis, from Monday to Sunday, and they do so with the greatest integrity in 99.9 per cent of cases, 0.1 per cent away from infallibility.  It is wrong to take those people out in a mean and vindictive way, as seems to have been attempted by some Members in the debate.  While there may be errors in the system, and while mistakes may have been made in the past, one cannot emphatically say that politicians are the only people who would be likely to be canvassed.  An alternative selection procedure might also lead to canvassing.  I am not suggesting that it <Col N="2236" /> would but I am suggesting that the possibility also exists and let nobody believe otherwise.  Politicians are not the only people who can be asked for favours.  If, as Deputy Bruton said, only 0.1 per cent of the appointments made were incorrect, one could hardly say that the system was absolutely corrupt.</P>
      <P>The teachers appointed by VECs over the years have made an enormous contribution to the country's lifeblood.  Following logically on the argument that has been presented they too have been subject to the innuendo that they, perhaps, are in some way unfit for their positions. That too is a regrettable feature of this debate.</P>
      <P>The system has worked.  I would not disagree with those who say that there are imperfections in it; but to those who cast innuendoes like confetti around this Chamber, I say that those against whom they are casting aspersions have given of their time over several years with the greatest integrity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed:</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I would like to thank Deputy Deenihan for agreeing to share his time with me.  I would like to compliment Deputy Bruton on introducing this Bill.  It is indicative of his reforming zeal and his quest for efficiency and fair play in the public service.  I only hope it will not be too long before he gets an opportunity to direct those vast talents towards this and other institutions in the State because I, as a backbencher, find extremely frustrating the manner in which this House conducts its business.</P>
      <P>I speak as a qualified teacher who never taught.  I speak also as a politician acutely aware of how the present system works and as one who has close contact with many unemployed teachers who are desperately seeking work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Newly qualified teachers are idealistic and full of enthusiasm, a great untapped resource for this State accumulated at great expense.  Many of them are disgusted and demoralised by the present <Col N="2237" /> appointments process and refuse to play any part in it or the lobbying it involves. However, months and years of vain search, and the word on the grapevine which suggests that many appointments are politically motivated, turn sour this great resource but at the time forces them onto the lobbying circuit.  I know that from personal experience and any politician who denies having been approached about VEC appointments or promotions, or who denies having made representations and all that involves and the degrees of pressure implicit in that, is not telling the truth.</P>
    <P>This is the process as it is, warts and all, and I operate within that process whilst yearning for a change in it.  The present system is not fair to us as politicians who should be more concerned about policy matters in education rather than personnel.  Above all else it is not fair to our teachers employed or unemployed. As long as politicians are engaged in the appointments process people will assume political explanations for their appointment, sometimes accurately, sometimes inaccurately.  This Bill is aimed at removing a widespread public perception that there is gross political interference in the appointments process. It is also about ensuring that the people who sit on interview boards are suitably qualified to evaluate the merits and qualifications of all applicants.</P>
    <P>A number of red herrings have been trotted out by the Government parties in their efforts to justify their U-turn on this Bill.  Their claim that the Bill would undermine local government holds no credibility.  Local government is not about personnel.  Local government, strong local government, and reforms of local government, is about policy matters, and hearing that excuse being trotted out gives me little hope in the review body which has been set up by the Government and in which we, as a party, rightly refused to participate.</P>
    <P>It is also their belief that a local appointments commission would be too cumbersome.  Perhaps it would be but at this stage an agreement in principle to the contents of the Bill would be welcome <Col N="2238" /> and on Committee Stage we could tease out the proper process to be adopted in regard to appointments.  What I wonder about is whether there is an implied criticism of the local government appointments commission and if the greedy eyes on the Government benches are being cast on that body for political patronage. Time has caught up on me and I will hand over to Deputy Deenihan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the debate on this Bill with great interest and attention in the past two weeks.  In the course of the debate I have heard the Minister for Education state that the Government would not be supporting the Bill.  I have heard other Deputies on the Government side of the House reject the Bill on the basis that it was attacking local democracy, that it was a slur on the vocational education system and that it represented an attempt by Fine Gael at centralisation.  I would say one thing clearly tonight.  The Bill is not a slur on the vocational education system or on vocational teachers.  Why did 70 teachers turn up tonight outside this House in support of this Bill?  That should be answer enough to those people who reject the Bill.</P>
      <P>All of this is a surprise to me because what the Government are attempting to do is an about-turn on this Bill.  On 1 March 1989, speaking on this same Bill, the Minister of State, Deputy Frank Fahey, stated on behalf of the then Government:</P>
      <P>In general I welcome the Bill and the provisions contained in it.  The specifics and the details have to be considered further perhaps and I am glad to say the Minister will be giving full consideration and will welcome an opportunity to have further discussions with the various spokespeople on the drafting of the legislation for the development and rationalisation of the vocational education sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a direct quotation from the Official Report.  What has changed since 1 March 1989 to cause the Minister to change his mind?  The truth is that <Col N="2239" /> nothing has changed.  Vocational teachers are now appointed in the same manner as they were in March 1989. Clearly the Government as represented by the Fianna Fáil Party have done a cynical about-turn on this Bill for no other reason than that they have come under political pressure from their local councillors who do not wish to give up the right to appoint teachers.  This is insidious.  It shows no regard for the teachers who are affected by this Bill.  It shows no regard for the inherent justice of the issue before us.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education, Deputy Mary O'Rourke, has stated that she would take on board the principle of our Bill in drafting amending legislation to rationalise VECs.  Because she has changed her mind on the rationalisation of VECs she is not now going to do anything concerning the appointment issue. What has the rationalisation of VECs, desirable as it is, to do with the appointment of teachers?  The opportunity of dealing with the appointments issue in principle presents itself to the Minister in the context of the Bill before the House this evening, and the Minister should grasp that opportunity if she has the slightest shred of integrity.</P>
    <P>In Spring 1989 the Progressive Democrats, through their then spokesperson on Education, Deputy Máirín Quill, when speaking in the House on 21 February &mdash; Deputy Paul McGrath has already referred to this statement &mdash; stated:</P>
    <P>I see no material in this Bill for any kind of controversy.  What it advocates is essentially right and I have no great quarrel about it...</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats have changed their view on this Bill.  I was hoping that they would not do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I was hoping they would in practice by supporting this Bill, live up <Col N="2240" /> to their stated aspiration of breaking the mould in Irish politics.  Whatever the position of Fianna Fáil, and indeed their good heckler in the background who does nothing but heckle other Deputies, and the Progressive Democrats, the overriding consideration is that Dáil Éireann adopted this Bill on Second Stage.  Is the Dáil now to reverse that position?  I hope not because if that happens I believe credibility will be lost with the public, with teachers, parents and even students.</P>
      <P>On the last occasion that this House discussed this proposal, it generated media comment which I believe reflected the view of the public at large on this issue.  The media comment was favourable to the passage of the Bill.  Specifically the <i>Irish Times</i> of 2 March 1989, in a leading article commented as follows:</P>
      <P>There was a welcome air of co-operation and goodwill about last night's Dáil exchanges; it was a good example of constructive opposition, with Fine Gael achieving commitments on much needed reform, but without forcing an embarrassing defeat on the Government. The Teachers' Union of Ireland must take some credit, too, for having lobbied long and hard for this reform.</P>
      <P>The appointment of teachers is a very important and very professional business; it should be handled by professionals. With increasingly high levels of unemployment amongst teachers, the pressures on politicians to use influence are bound to increase. They should be happy to pass the responsibility to a body specialised in recruitment techniques.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately the same spirit does not prevail tonight.  It has been alleged that this Bill is attacking local democracy but that is simply not so.  It has been alleged that this Bill is not supported by the teachers but that is patently untrue, as was evidenced by the number of people who turned up to demonstrate outside this House tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to deal with both of these allegations.  My party believe in democratic control of education.  Deputy John Bruton in moving the Bill again reiterated <Col N="2241" /> this point.  It was a Fine Gael Minister, Gemma Hussey, who suggested a reform of the VECs and the setting up of a more decentralised arrangement for the administration of education.  For any Deputy, either on the Government or on the Opposition side of the House, to suggest that Fine Gael are damaging vocational education or local democracy, I say you are mistaken; examine the record.</P>
    <P>This Bill will strengthen vocational education.  It will remove the taunt and allegation of political interference in appointments.  That can only aid the system.  Having said that, I favour democracy in education.  I suggest that there are some issues which are not suitable for control by the democratic system and appointments is one such area.  There is no point of principle or public policy involved in whether Mrs. X, Miss Y or Mr. Z get the teaching job.  The only point at issue is that the best person gets the job.  Selecting the best person for the job is a matter for experts and I suggest we leave it to the experts.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is undermining democracy at local level, is the Local Appointments Commission itself not undermining democracy in every other comparable appointment throughout the local authority service?  All sides of the House accept the bona fides and the good work done by the commission.  Is it now to be alleged that the commission are undermining democracy?  The argument is the same in both cases.  You cannot extol the virtues of the commission on one hand and decry this Bill on the other.  That is illogical.  It is simply a false argument put up by those who for their own political reasons do not wish this Bill to be passed.</P>
    <P>Various Deputies, among them Deputies Cowen and Dempsey, suggested that teachers' morale was not suffering because of the present appointments system.  Some Deputies implied that teachers themselves do not support the Bill, but that is patent nonsense.  Their union have repeatedly called for this Bill to be passed.  Their union were asked forcefully by the chairman of the Irish Vocational Education Association to <Col N="2242" />&ldquo;put up or shut up&rdquo;.  The union put up and reiterated their view that there are verifiable cases of political interference with appointments.  Everyone involved in vocational education knows that there have been abuses.  That is not to decry the system, or to undermine the many fair and impartial appointments that have been made.  What the Bill seeks to do and what the teachers seek to do through their union is to have a demonstrably fair appointments system which is above suspicion, which clearly the present system is not.</P>
    <P>There is one other area of criticism which has been raised and that is that the appointments system in the national and secondary schools should be revised.  Perhaps it should but we must start somewhere. Deputy John Bruton has made an excellent start in moving this Bill.  He has addressed an issue which is of crucial importance to teachers and to our education service.  This Bill will ensure that we get good teachers, the best teachers appointed through a procedure in which everyone can have confidence. Nothing could be more important for our education service.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, therefore, I remind Deputies on the other side of the House that this Bill has previously been adopted on Second Stage by this House; that it was welcomed by the Junior Minister, Deputy Frank Fahey, on behalf of the Government and by the Progressive Democrats, and, nothing with respect to the appointment of teachers in the vocational service has changed in the intervening period.  I call therefore on those persons and parties who previously supported this Bill to again support it on this occasion.  To do otherwise would be, I believe, to debase democracy.</P>
    <P>I thank the Labour Party, The Workers' Party and Deputy Foxe for their constructive contributions to this debate and their continued support for the Bill.  I know that some of those contributors wished to put forward amendments on Committee Stage.  My <Col N="2243" /> party are open to discussing such amendments in an open-minded and constructive manner with all parties, including the Government Party.</P>
    <P>The objective that politics be taken out of appointments remains and it will be <Col N="2244" /> achieved in principle by the House passing this Bill as it did on 1 March 1989.  I ask the House to approve Second Stage of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Tomás Mac Giolla gave me notice of his intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter as to the findings of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General that the £66.7 million of tax revenue foregone under the business expansion scheme has led to little net gain in terms of job creation and the manner in which the Government intend to respond to this finding.  The Deputy has some five minutes to present his case and the Minister has five minutes to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla:</NameTxt>
      <P>In the short time I have I am tempted to simply read some extracts from the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General for 1989, because he provides as damming an indictment of the operation of the business expansion scheme, and the failure of the Government to monitor and supervise it, properly, than anything I could say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a well named scheme, near enough to BSE to call it the mad cow disease of the tax system.  The Workers' Party have long known that the BES was little more than a hidden subsidy for the private sector and the Comptroller and Auditor General's report provided compelling evidence that this is the case.  Every accountant and lawyer in the country knew of it and the captains of industry were quite aware of it and they queued up to take advantage of the Government's generosity which, of course, the ordinary <Col N="2249" /> taxpayer &mdash; especially the PAYE taxpayer &mdash; had to fund.  The specific case referred to in the report, where the foregoing of tax revenue of £13 million created only seven jobs, is a particular scandal.  This was the case of Shannon International Leasing where two people, Cormac Crawford and Martin Hawkes, took in £23 million investment at a cost to the taxpayer of £13.3 million.  This is a cost of £2 million per job created to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Those who took best advantage of the BES were not small fly-by-night investors or the small person but major players in the financial markets.  The report points out that in 1989-90 alone, £78 million was invested at a cost to the Exchequer of £41.3 million in tax foregone and that 19 companies accounted for £56.5 million of this investment, an average of £3 million per company investment.</P>
    <P>One of the most serious findings of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General that as a direct consequence of the BES as it developed the relative share of this type of State aid going to various sectors of the economy was to a large extent being dictated by investment advisers and fund managers rather than by the Government.  It is a terrible indictment of this House that we have no say in how taxpayers money is distributed. The people who make these decisions are investment advisers and fund managers and we are not even told what is happening.</P>
    <P>The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General raises many serious questions about the failure of successive Governments to monitor and assess such schemes.  Money was handed out in the form of tax reliefs but, as the report points out, there was an absence of procedures necessary to evaluate properly the success or otherwise of the business expansion scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister did, belatedly, acknowledged that the BES needed to be tightened up to deal with what he described as Disneyland schemes and some steps were taken in the 1989 and 1990 Finance Acts to tighten up.  No sooner had the Minister tightened up in one area but <Col N="2250" /> these companies had their accountants, tax experts and lawyers working round the clock to find new loopholes they could exploit and use to continue to avoid paying their fair share of taxation.  This is precisely what happened in all of the tax relief schemes.</P>
    <P>There is big money involved here.  The Comptroller and Auditor General confirms what we already knew from Dáil Questions, that £66.7 million in the form of tax foregone was lost to the Exchequer since the scheme was established.  This money could have been used for so many things.  Everybody in the House can point out areas that could do with the money lost.</P>
    <P>The BES is just one of a range of generous tax reliefs made available to private industry on the basis that they would provide jobs, but instead they put the money in their pockets and no jobs resulted.  The very least that should be done is comply with the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General who reported:</P>
    <P>The same criteria should apply to tax expenditures as would be applied to direct State expenditure and mechanisms should be put in place which systematically measure and record the cost of schemes financed by tax expenditures and which evaluate the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of such expenditures and report on them to Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds):</NameTxt>
      <P>I have noted the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the business expansion scheme, contained in his annual report published yesterday. My Department will be studying the report in consultation with the Revenue Commissioners.  There are however, a number of points I wish to make about it at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first concerns the nature of the report itself.  Deputy Mac Giolla has implied that it found that the tax forgone under the scheme had led to little net gain in terms of job creation.  This is not so.  The report is not a review of the <Col N="2251" /> effectiveness of the business expansion scheme, nor does it purport to be one. The report sets out the results of an examination by the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General of the operation of the BES.  The scope of the examination was:</P>
    <P>...to establish whether procedures were in place which would evaluate the extent to which all the objectives of the scheme were being met and which would evaluate whether the financial cost of the scheme...can be regarded as a cost effective means of achieving the stated objectives to the extent that they may have been achieved.</P>
    <P>The report certainly concluded that the procedures were lacking; but it was a report on the procedures, not an evaluation of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The second point I want to make is that a review of the scheme's effectiveness has been underway for some time.  My Department in fact initiated a review of the scheme during the summer, not recently, as the report says.  The business expansion scheme, which was introduced in 1984, was in 1986 extended until the end of the current tax year, that is, until 5 April 1991.  It was always implicit in the deadline placed on the scheme that it would be reviewed before the deadline, and that is exactly what has been happening.</P>
    <P>The third point I want to make is that the £66 million cost of the scheme mentioned in the report refers to the six tax years from 1984 to April 1990.  I would also point out that this cost arose mainly in the 1988-89 and 1989-90 tax years.  In those tax years it was the availability of BES projects with guaranteed returns that attracted the high level of investment. As the House is aware I took steps in the Finance Acts of both 1989 and 1990 to deal with abuses of the scheme.  In the 1989 Finance Act I introduced provisions to outlaw guarantees and options for purchase of BES shares at the end of the five year BES holding period at other than market price.  When experience showed that the intent of this provision &mdash; to <Col N="2252" /> restore the BES to its original purpose of generating genuine risk capital was being circumvented.  I again took steps in this year's Finance Act to remove from relief BES schemes where arrangements exist to eliminate risk from the BES shares.</P>
    <P>While I am on this issue, I would like to point out that I ensured there would be no recurrence of the case quoted in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report of a single company raising £23 million.  I did this by placing a limit of £2.5 million on the amount of BES funding a company can obtain; I also excluded financial services companies from eligibility under the scheme.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasis, in particular, that in looking at the BES we must consider its overall impact and effectiveness.  As I have said, the BES was intended to provide genuine risk capital for companies in selected sectors of the economy and funds invested under it have gone to some 600 Irish companies.  It would be naive to expect that every one of these companies would survive and flourish; after all, risk is risk.  At the same time it would be ridiculous to suggest that the scheme has had no impact.  Some 600 Irish companies have received BES funds and jobs have been created.</P>
    <P>My Department initiated the review I spoke about some months ago, long before anybody had brought it to anyone's attention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoynihanKerry" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moynihan:</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this important matter on the Adjournment.  I hope that in his reply the Minister of State will not refer to my observations on this serious problem as hysterical comments for political purposes.  I want to state clearly that my objective in raising this matter is to focus attention on the serious problems being experienced by those in need of rehousing by their local authority.  This matter only received attention after two years of continuous pressure, by the council by way of resolutions, on the Department pointing out the need for additional funds to enable the local authority to provide housing for people in this category.</P>
      <P>As far back as July a deputation of officers and members of the council and public representatives from Killarney met the Minister of State to discuss the urgent need for additional funds.  We were exceptionally well received by the Minister of State.  We impressed on him the urgency of the matter and he indicated that he would be having discussions with financial institutions with a view to getting agreement or to raise additional funds to what was available in the budget to provide additional housing.  Unfortunately, the reply to that deputation was in the negative.</P>
      <P>I have with me tonight a copy of a list of the 63 applicants on the housing list at 24 October 1990 which was sent by the housing manager to each member of the council.  All these applications have been investigated and cleared.  Not only are all of these applicants in need of rehousing but they are incapable at providing housing for themselves from their own resources.  The responsibility for providing this housing falls on the council and the manager who must ensure that their applications are processed through the proper channels.  Many of these families have been on the waiting list for up to three years.  It is particularly difficult to get housing in Killarney for these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2254" /> Even when this housing is secured, it is very expensive.  This adds to the mental and physical pressures on the families concerned.  Therefore, it is incumbent on all of us to be realistic in our approach to this very serious social problem.  The longer a solution to this problem is deferred the more serious the problem will get.</P>
    <P>Land to build these houses is available and the contractors and builders are waiting to start work.  The only thing holding up the building of 50 houses, which would alleviate the problems of these families, is goodwill and the necessary finance from the Department.  As I have said, the longer this decision is deferred the more serious the problem will get, and it may take many years to resolve.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to recognise the urgency of this issue.  Those families are in urgent need of housing and they will not accept fiscal rectitude or the need to balance the books as reasons for denying them proper housing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Connolly):</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Moynihan rightly said, I met a deputation from Killarney earlier this year and explained the position to them. The total capital available this year for additional housing throughout the country was £33 million.  Both the Minister for the Environment and I had to allocate that money as best we could, and we did our best.</P>
      <P>The capital available for new schemes in 1990 has been fully allocated.  It is not possible to sanction additional schemes in 1990 for this or any other local housing authority.  Any new scheme will have to be considered in the context of next year's financial allocation.  That is the position at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly:</NameTxt>
      <P>Any further allocation for local authority housing will be decided in the 1991 Estimate.  Throughout the country there is a different emphasis now in regard to housing.  At present the <Col N="2255" /> demand for housing is in the greater urban areas; it is not widespread throughout the country.  This housing demand is concentrated in the larger urban areas where there is a need for more houses.  I fully understand the position in relation to housing in Killarney. I have brought the matter to the attention of the Minister for the Environment who will bring it to the attention of the Government.  We will see what we can do in 1991.</P>

I raised this issue on the Adjournment on Wednesday, 14 February 1990.  On that occasion the Minister assured me that she was &ldquo;working with great attention on this case&rdquo;.  She also said &ldquo;the matter is urgent, the school is needed and the present accommodation is completely unsatisfactory&rdquo;. She concluded with the simple statement, &ldquo;progress reported&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Since that time &mdash; I say this with a degree of anger, frustration and, above all, disappointment &mdash; there has been progress in only one area, and that is, the progress of time.  Now, ten months later, there has been no improvement in the situation, no hope given in any response from the Department of Education and definitely no sign of a community school being opened in Cashel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not rested my case since February. On Tuesday 6 March last I tabled <Col N="2256" /> a parliamentary question asking the Minister when the proposed community school would commence and the reasons for the delay to date.  Another parliamentary question was tabled on the same date by me, and by Deputy John Bruton, asking the Minister to outline the nature of the legal formalities which would have to be completed before work on the community school would start, when the works would be completed and if a model contract for the design, finance and construction scheme had yet been finalised. In reply to those questions the Minister stated that is was hoped that the necessary approval of the contract would be forthcoming soon.</P>
    <P>On 4 April I telephoned the Department of Education and was told that all the legal difficulties had now been resolved.  In May the Minister wrote to me saying that she had sanctioned the procedure for the selection of developers and hoped I would be pleased with the information.  Innocently and somewhat naively I was tremendously happy with her response.  It seemed Cashel Community School was at last imminent. Sadly, more of the same was to follow.</P>
    <P>The summer months brought no joy to those interested in the community school for Cashel.  Delay followed delay, due firstly to difficulties experienced by the developers in obtaining necessary information from the quantity surveyor involved.  The closing date for tenders was July but this had to be extended to August and extended yet again to 26 September.  On this day, 21 November 1990, no progress can be reported.</P>
    <P>The sad saga of Cashel community school has continued since 1979.  So many times we were near to success, only to be pushed back again by a change in Department policy, by inaction, by lack of urgency on the part of the Minister and her Department and by a simple lack of interest and of a meaningful determination to ensure that this project would commence.</P>
    <P>I cannot overstate the anger and frustration of parents, teachers, students and school managers in Cashel.  Continuous delays and postponements have resulted <Col N="2257" /> in a mounting tide of impatience and intolerance.  For too long Cashel has waited and Cashel now wants action.  I appeal to the Minister for immediate action on Cashel community school and I ask that the promises so freely given should now be generously honoured.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke) Mary O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity of discussing this matter in which you, a Cheann Comhairle, have a deep interest, as have other Deputies, particularly Deputy Davern.  There is no doubt that the delay by Deputy John Bruton in the appointment of his front bench has led to great declamatory occasions in this House and we look forward to many more of them in the weeks ahead.  It is well to get the facts straight so that Deputy Ahearn will know where the blame lies, rather than denouncing the Department in such a delcamatory way.</P>
      <P>The project at Cashel was one of three second level building projects included in a pilot scheme which I initiated for the procurement of school buildings on a design, finance and build basis.  The purpose of the pilot scheme was to examine the feasibility of funding from sources other than State funds.  I would like Deputy Ahearn to listen and lay the blame precisely where it should be laid. Tenders for the three projects involved in the pilot scheme were invited from selected developers in June.  Tenders were received within the specified time in respect of the other projects at Newcastlewest and Newbridge College.  In the case of the Cashel project, however, at the request of the developer the closing date for receipt of tenders was extended twice, the final date being 26 September 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then in stepped the Construction Industry Federation who requested a further deferral of the closing date on behalf of the developers.  We informed them that because of the urgency of the Cashel project it was not possible to grant a further extension of time, in addition to the two deferrals already allowed.  The developers were informed at the same time as the CIF that because of the urgent <Col N="2258" /> need for the new school no further extensions of time would be granted for the submission of their tenders.  However, as it transpired, no tenders were received at the due date.  With due respect to Deputy Ahearn, we cannot proceed to build without getting a tender.  That is axiomatic in any contract.</P>
    <P>Since then my Department have had discussions with the CIF regarding the failure of the developers to submit tenders. It emerged during the discussions that a difficulty was encountered by the developers with regard to their use of the bill of quantities prepared by the consultant quantity surveyor.  There is drama within a drama.  It is quite apparent to me where precisely the blame lies and the Deputy must also be aware of this. Discussions are continuing with the CIF and the quantity surveyor concerned with a view to getting agreement which will satisfy both the developers and the surveyor and so enable the project to proceed. Every possible effort is being made by my Department to have those discussions concluded as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I went to Cashel and met the group in early September.  I met the managers and principals and following that I arranged for the Secretary of the Department to meet the CIF.  He discussed with them the proposals from the surveyor.  There was another meeting with the surveyor and the CIF on Monday, 19 November. Pending a satisfactory resolution of this unforeseen problem I am not in a position to indicate how soon the project will proceed. There is as yet no tender.  I am anxious to have the school provided as soon as possible.  Further arrangements will be expedited when the present difficulty, which is of a local nature, is resolved.  I have asked my Department to endeavour to find a solution to the problem as a matter of urgency.  Our hands are tied and it is quite extraordinary that in the other two pilot projects difficulties such as have been encountered in Cashel have not been met. Deputy Ahearn is sitting beside a Deputy who is concerned with one of those projects. We will keep pushing but we need a response.  Most of all we need a tender.</P>

      <P>I would like the Minister to explain all of this.  To put it bluntly: were the Carysfort authorities cooking the books? Where is the £800,000 now?  Will it be given back to the Department of Education?  Why did the Department of Education not pursue the matter with Carysfort over a five-year period?  Did the Carysfort authorities enjoy a special favoured status with the Department of Education in that time?</P>

The VEC's two schools &mdash; the one at Dungarvan and St. Declan's Community School, Kilmacthomas &mdash; I understand have approximately 650 pupils between them.  I understand that a submission in relation to the need there is with the Department outlining the extent of learning difficulties in literacy and numeracy. There is within the scheme, in first and second year, a large number of pupils who, if there is not a remedial post granted, will be unable to cope with the new junior certificate examination.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is well aware of the anxiety and indeed unease felt in the mid-western region with regard to any changes that might be in the offing which would affect the present status of Shannon Airport.  The Government stated recently there was no change in Government policy so far as Shannon Airport is concerned.  Yet we still hear organised rumours from the Dublin lobby that such changes are afoot and are inevitable. Indeed these are fuelled by Aer Lingus manoeuvres to have, first, a Dublin-New <Col N="2261" /> York flight and, second, a Los Angeles flight direct to Dublin.  Now there is the threat with regard to Aeroflot in that the Soviet Union have threatened to cancel flights to Cuba which would seriously affect the stop-over flights at Shannon Airport.  I would be grateful to hear the Minister's comments on this matter.</P>
    <P>The existence of GPA and other welcome projects in the Shannon area are now being advanced by critics of Shannon as the reason for the need for change in the status of Shannon Airport.  These critics are attempting to portray us as an area of wealth without the need for continuation of the airport under its present status.</P>
    <P>I understand the constraints to which the Minister is subjected.  However, I would ask him to remember the part played by Shannon Airport in our industrial history and to ensure a place in the sun for Shannon Airport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins:</NameTxt>
      <P>Without the late Monsignor Horan there would be no Knock Airport.  He overcame the sceptics, the cynics, the economists, the meteoroligists and the politicians, some of our own hue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the journalists to whom it was a source of considerable amusement.  The airport is now a reality and is making money.</P>
      <P>It is almost incredible that one can now fly from the heart of County Mayo to Manchester in 40 minutes, to Coventry in 50 minutes and to Luton in an hour. This has provided a lifeline for many of our emigrants apart altogether from its tourism benefits.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be putting in place an ownership and management structure, one would hope in the not too distant future.  The Minister is a man conscious of merit and recognises a man of merit. Monsignor Horan was a man with a dream, a vision and idealism who went in hot pursuit of what he wanted and achieved his goal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is nice to name the airport after <Col N="2262" /> him.  But the best way in which we can recognise the endeavours and achievements of Monsignor Horan would be to make a member of the Horan family a member of the trust, management or administrative team who will henceforth manage that airport, thereby have a member of the Horan family serve on whatever management structure exists in perpetuity.  I know the Minister's heart is in the right place in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke) Mary O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke):</NameTxt>
      <P>To answer Deputy Seán Ryan, I should say that the payment of money to the contractor has never been an issue in this case.  The contractor has confirmed this emphatically to my Department.  Indeed he is to be commended for the excellent service he has given.  The new accommodation will be ready for the children next week.</P>
      <P>Finaly, I should mention that a progress payment &mdash; recently certified in the normal way by my Department's architect &mdash; will be issued to the school authorities next week.  Therefore, they will be getting the rooms and the money next week.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gilmore raised a query about Carysfort College accounts.  The position of discrepancies between the financial details furnished by the Carysfort College of Education when they were seeking State grants and accounts subsequently furnished by the college authorities &mdash; raised in the recently published report of the Comptroller and Auditor General are being examined by my Department in conjunction with the manager of the college. Pending completion of this examination I am not in a position to comment further.</P>
      <P>I can assure Deputy Gilmore that I will particularly interest myself in the issue he has raised.  It certainly merited being raised and is what one might describe as a bit of a mystery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the remedial teacher for the two County Waterford VEC schools at Kilmacthomas and Dungarvan, Deputy O'Shea will be aware that in the normal way teachers are appointed through the committee <Col N="2263" /> system.  The allocation for County Waterford was increased recently over what they had got previously.  They appealed and were allocated three more posts.</P>
    <P>With regard to the specific allocation of 60 remedial/disadvantaged teachers allocated to second level in September last, County Waterford VEC received one teacher who was placed in Dungarvan. That teacher is for what are deemed to be the needs of home/school liaison for the disadvantaged in Dungarvan. My Department have written to them saying that the psychologist will help in any needy case.  Bearing in mind their appeal, which resulted in giving them teachers in the county and the special appointment of a remedial/ disadvantaged teacher in Dungarvan I feel we have gone some way to meet their needs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Finucane raised the matter of Rathkeale Community School.  The demographic survey has been completed and the revised schedule was issued to the school authorities in July for their agreement.  We have been awaiting receipt of agreement on the part of all the parties concerned to the revised schedule of accommodation before proceeding with the alterations to the plans for the school.  The revised schedule is now acceptable.  But we did not receive formal notification from the management authorities that they had accepted the revised schedule.  When we receive that we will examine it.  While we would be very keen to make every possible effort, of course any capital projects of that nature are dependant on the moneys available.  Indeed I should say that all of those mysteries will be unveiled within the next few weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. S. Brennan) Seamus Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. S. Brennan):</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Deputy de Valera's concern I want to assure the House that there is no change in existing Government policy in relation to the Shannon stop.  It is true to say that, in <Col N="2264" /> recent weeks, I have received a number of submissions from various organisations both for and against the change. I can tell the Deputy that I am at present studying these submissions in the context of plans and trends within the community and the wider aviation trends.</P>
      <P>I should like to avail of this opportunity to reiterate the commitment of the Government to the future development of Shannon Airport and the Shannon region as a major centre of economic growth.  Representations have been made to me by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Daly, and by Deputy de Valera and others over recent months.  I want to assure them of the Government's full commitment to the development of Shannon Airport and region.</P>
      <P>In regard to the second matter raised by Deputy Jim Higgins, I should say that last September the board of Knock Airport indicated to me that it would not be possible to complete the necessary formalities to put a deed of trust in place. I then proposed that the question of a trust be dropped altogether and have suggested an alternative way of doing this. We are still talking to the board about how that alternative might work out and no final decision has been taken.</P>
      <P>I had a lengthy meeting with representatives of the Horan family on 2 November last.  I was fully aware of their views in this matter after that meeting and I believe they understand my views fully.</P>
      <P>I want to emphasise that I am interested and concerned about the future development of the airport, that its assets will be fully utilised and that it will continue to be a viable airport and an instrument for economic development in the region.  These are my aims for the future development of the airport, and I will take into account what Deputy Higgins has said.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.40 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 22 November 1990.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 20, 22 and 25 together.  Oil stocks held by OECD countries at 1 July 1990 represented an average of 98 days forward consumption. Ireland's oil stock level at that date amounted to 95 days.  During the past number of months I put various measures in place to further increase national stock levels.  I arranged that additional strategic supplies of both crude oil and product be sought and put into position by Irish National Petroleum Corporation as quickly as possible to further augment stocks.  To date, over 205,000 tonnes of crude have been put into the Whiddy terminal and almost 30,000 tonnes of gasoil and 21,000 tonnes of gasoline have been placed in storage in various locations in the country.  In addition, stock levels of both crude and product at Whitegate are being maintained at higher levels than normal.  As a result of these measures, by 1 October 1990 Ireland's oil stocks stood at 116 days while the average for the OECD was 97 days.  Irish stock levels at 1 October 1989 were 60 days.</P>
      <P>For reasons of commercial confidentiality, I do not propose to release the average cost per barrel of the additional strategic stocks.</P>

      <P>Although the precise reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy necessitated by the current round of GATT negotiations have not yet emerged, I do not expect any adverse effects on forestry. The Community will remain a significant importer of timber.  World trade in timber is not distorted by price subsidies or restrictions.  Forestry is, therefore, an attractive alternative land use and, I expect, will continue to receive the high priority and generous aid set for it in the Community's forestry action programme adopted in June 1989.</P>

      <P>I and my predecessors have received representations over the years from various organisations suggesting that a standard formula for the financial terms of mining leases should be adopted by Government. Such a formula could possibly include a basis for State equity participation. At present it is the Government's policy to settle mining lease terms having regard to the nature, characteristics and projected economic outturn of each individual deposit.  The financial terms of a lease are determined following delineation of the deposit, evaluation of the reserves, ore grades and other specific characteristics.  A detailed assessment of the likely profitability of a mining operation is also carried out.  No change is envisaged in this policy, which is designed to ensure equity between the State and the developer.  Under the Mineral Acts I have extensive discretionary powers in the settlement of lease terms and I can ensure that terms would not be set which <Col N="2101" /> would jeopardise the viability of any proposed development.</P>

      <P>Ireland was represented at the Second World Climate Conference by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, as this is principally a matter relating to the functions of the Minister for the Environment.  The official delegation which attended the <Col N="2102" /> conference included a representative from my Department.</P>
      <P>The ministerial declaration arising from the Second World Climate Conference recognises <i>inter alia</i> that there is no single quick fix technological option for reducing greenhouse gas emissions including CO 2.  It also recognises the promotion of energy efficiency as the most cost-effective measure for reducing energy related emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, as well as the use of safe energy sources which produce low or no greenhouse gases.</P>
      <P>On 29 October last the EC took the decision at a joint Energy and Environment Council to stabilise its CO 2 levels within the Community at 1990 levels by the year 2000, based on equitable burden sharing.  In this connection the Commission is expected to propose, in the near future, appropriate options and measures to be taken by individual member states.</P>
      <P>As regards energy policy here, we have promoted the maximum use of natural gas and the importance of energy conservation and efficiency for some time now.  In addition, earlier this year the Government agreed to provide an additional £500,000 in 1990 under the environmental action programme for energy conservation measures, given their acknowledged role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</P>

      <P>Under the operational programme for forestry 1989-1993, which I launched in July 1990, particular new emphasis has been placed on the promotion of broad-leaved species.</P>
      <P>My aim is to increase substantially the proportion of broadleaves planted from its current level of about 2 per cent.</P>
      <P>Under the new grant schemes the maximum rate of grant for brodleaf afforestation is £1,200 per hectare which is available to both the private and public sectors and represents a 50 per cent increase on previous schemes.  A further incentive for private sector planting by farmers is the availability of a premium payment of £116 per hectare each year for 20 years for lands planted with broadleaves. In addition pilot demonstration projects on the use of native broadleaf species will be considered for funding under the scheme of back-up measures.</P>
      <P>The level of involvement todate by the private and public sector in this broadleaf area has been disappointing, but I would hope that from now on there will be a significant response to these initiatives.</P>

      <P>In July last year.  I made protests to the UK and German authorities in regard to the plans to reprocess German nuclear waste at the THORP plant under construction at Sellafield.  It was pointed out to the German authorities that they had abandoned the completion of a reprocessing plant in Germany because of environmental concerns, and that it is not acceptable to us for them to transfer the problems associated with reprocessing close to Ireland.  The increased transport of spent and reprocessed fuel and waste through the Irish Sea, with the attendant increased risk of accidents, is of particular concern.</P>
      <P>In April this year, when the first contract with a German firm was signed, I issued a strong statement condemning the move.  It was also raised at the council meeting of EC Energy Ministers which I chaired on 21 May.</P>

      <P>The rules governing the purchase of shares in overseas companies by Irish resident individuals and companies are set out in sections 21 and 22 of the Exchange Control Notice dated 1 April 1990.  In summary these are direct investment and portfolio investment.  A direct investment is an investment which has the effect of establishing lasting and direct links between the investor and an enterprise and which enables the investor to participate effectively in its management or control.  Each direct investment must be referred in advance to the Exchange Control Department of the Central Bank for verification.  Bona fide direct investments in EC countries are permitted freely and may be financed entirely from Irish pounds.  The cost of authorised direct investments outside the EC must normally be financed substantially with foreign currency.</P>
      <P>On portfolio investment, residents may freely purchase medium and long-term foreign securities or any securities issued by the EC or EIB through an approved agent in the State, with Irish pounds, provided each purchase is immediately notified to the Central Bank on Form S.2.  Purchases of short-term foreign securities should normally be financed with borrowed foreign currency or sale proceeds of similar securities. Short-term securities are mainly those with a maturity of less than two years at date of issue and money market securities.</P>

      <P>The flood damage relief scheme 1990 was introduced to assist farmers who suffered hardship as a result of livestock, fodder and grazing losses arising during the adverse weather conditions of the winter and early spring.</P>
      <P>Qualification for aid was confined to farmers whose non-farm income did not exceed £10,000 in the tax year ending 5 April 1990 and where livestock and fodder/grazing losses were in excess of pre-set percentages differentiating between farmers of up to and over 60 livestock units.</P>
      <P>As a general principle, 50 per cent of losses were considered, with upper limits of £1,200 for fodder/grazing losses and £1,500 for livestock loss subject to a maximum of £2,000 in any individual case.  In addition several cases of produce loss were considered as well as some cases where extreme hardship occurred.</P>
      <P>Approximately 1,500 applications were received of which 1,250 qualify for payment.  To date 1,100 payments have been processed, with the remaining ones being currently processed.</P>

      <Quest>the number of inspectors employed by him to administer forestry grants on 1 November 1990; and the reason for the delay in implementing the transfer, promised in Dáil Éireann last year, relative to the overseeing of EC grant aid for private forest developments.</Quest>

      <P>The number of inspecting officers engaged in my Department to administer private forestry grants is two full-time officers and two part-time.  In addition, Coillte Teoranta carries out agency work on my behalf and the number of inspecting officers employed by them on this work is two full-time and close on 70 part-time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2115" /> Negotiations with the Department of Finance and consultations with Coillte Teoranta are being pressed ahead in preparation for the forthcoming change in administration of the private forestry grant schemes.  As I have pointed out to this House on a previous occasion, it is important, and in the best interests of private forestry, that the new arrangements are right both in regard to staffing and implementation procedures.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for unmarried mother's allowance &mdash; now being subsumed into the new comprehensive lone parents scheme &mdash; with effect from 8 March 1990.</P>
      <P>Adjustments had to be made in respect of a maternity benefit claim and supplementary welfare allowance she received during the earlier part of her claim.  In addition, her entitlement to reduced rate unemployment benefit from mid-July 1990 had to be established.</P>
      <P>Her allowance book was issued paying from 16 August 1990 and arrears for the period 8 March to 15 August have now been calculated.  A cheque for £887.75, which is the net amount due after adjustments for the maternity benefit and supplementary welfare allowance payments are made, will issue to her within a few days.</P>
      <P>The delays which arose in this case were due to the need to co-ordinate activities on the various claims which were involved. I have been unable to trace a claim for unemployment assistance in this case and, from the facts available to me, it would appear that she would not be entitled to that assistance as it would be less favourable than the unmarried mother's, lone parent, rate.</P>

      <P>My Department is conscious of the need to provide bilingual signposting at its public offices.  The external signs at all new offices are bilingual.  However, because of the considerable amount of information given on signs, notices and posters inside the offices, the provision of bilingual signposting internally presents a difficulty.  I have asked for a review of internal signposting arrangements to see what improvements can be made.</P>

      <P>Emissions from motor vehicles are at present governed by Articles 30 and 90 of the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations, 1963. In addition, heavy goods vehicles, buses and ambulances are subject, under the European Communities (Vehicles Testing) Regulations, 1981 to 1986, to an annual roadworthiness test which includes pollution-smoke tests on exhaust systems.</P>
      <P>The existing statutory framework must be extended to take account of EC Directives on the control of gaseous emissions from new vehicles.  The EC Directives set emission standards for carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides and particulates, and will require the use of unleaded petrol and, in many cases, catalytic convectors on new cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The type-approval aspects of the Directives have been implemented in Ireland by way of statutory instruments made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The implementation of the other aspects of the Directives, in particular the prohibition of entry into service of new vehicles which do not meet the required standards, will be the subject <Col N="2118" /> of a discussion paper which it is hoped to have published before the end of the year, with a view to having these provisions transposed into Irish legislation as soon as possible.</P>
